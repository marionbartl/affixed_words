A Polish man got the shock of his life when he visited a brothel and spotted his wife among the establishment 's employees .
Polish tabloid Super Express said the woman had been making some extra money on the side while telling her husband she worked at a store in a nearby town .
" I was dumbfounded .
I thought I was dreaming , " the husband told the newspaper .
We first encountered this warning about straight ticket voting a few months before the 2008 presidential election , and it reappeared in July 2012 in anticipation of that year ’s presidential election .
The warning does have some merit to it , but it only applies to residents of a single state ( North Carolina ) .
When casting their ballots in elections , some voters choose to select candidates individually regardless of party affiliation ( i.e. , they may vote for a Republican candidate for one office but a Democratic candidate for another office ) , while some voters choose to go with what is known as a “ straight ticket ” ( i.e. , they cast their ballots for all the candidates of one party ) .
The ballots in some states simplify the process of straight ticket voting ( STV ) : Rather than having to vote for every candidate from a particular party individually , the voter can fill in a bubble , or punch a hole , or mark a box , or pull a lever that is indicated as casting votes for all candidates of a specified party in partisan offices .
Examples :
[ Collected via e-mail , July 2012 ] ATTENTION !
TO EVERYONE THAT’S VOTING IN THE NOVEMBER 2012 ELECTION !!
IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO VOTE A “ STRAIGHT DEMOCRATIC TICKET ” THIS NOVEMBER , BE SURE TO “ PUNCH PRESIDENT OBAMA ’s NAME “ FIRST ” ON THE CARD , THEN PROCEED TO PUNCH “ STRAIGHT DEMOCRATIC TICKET ” !
IF YOU DON’T PUNCH PRESIDENT OBAMA NAME FIRST ON THE TICKET , YOUR VOTE WILL BE VOIDED !!!!
PLEASE PASS THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON TO ALL YOUR E-MAIL FRIENDS AND FAMILIES .
I ’M SURE THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT BE TOLD TO YOU AT THE POLLS THIS COMING NOVEMBER !!!!!!
GOD BLESS !
[ Collected via e-mail , September 2008 ] Just Passing this on …Make sure you do the same !!!!!!!!
For those who normally vote “ Straight Democratic ” , please pay close attention !!!!!
I was informed this weekend by a group of Obama volunteers that when voting for the presidential candidate this November , you have to make sure you punch Barack ’s name first , then proceed to punch “ Straight Democratic ” or else the vote for the president wo n’t count .
I ’m not sure if any of you are aware of this , but we know they wo n’t tell us this at the polls .
Please make sure you inform others .
The item quoted above warns voters that selecting the straight ticket option may not result in their casting a ballot for their party ’s presidential candidate because presidential selections have to be undertaken separately from the straight ticket voting process .
Voting processes vary from region to region , and as far as we know this warning applies only to North Carolina , where straight ticket voting is available for all races except for presidential electors ; voters in that state ( regardless of party ) therefore need to specifically select a presidential candidate in addition to voting a straight ticket .
As the Charlotte Observer cautioned readers back in 2008 :
Imagine you are a first time voter with a desire to vote straight party — to vote for all the candidates of a particular party .
If you look at the official ballot that all [ North Carolina ] counties are set to use on Nov. 4 , you ’ll find the following sentence : “ A Straight Party vote is a vote for all candidates of that party in partisan offices .
Individual partisan office selections are not necessary if you select a Straight Party below .
” If you followed those directions , filled in the Democratic or Republican oval in the Straight Party Voting section and then left , you might think you ’d just voted for president .
But you would be wrong .
On North Carolina ’s ballot , the presidential contest is not included in the list of “ Partisan Offices . ”
In order to cast a vote for president and a straight party vote , you need to make two marks — one in the presidential contest and the other in the straight party section .
( And a straight - ticket vote does not cast a vote in judicial races , because those are nonpartisan . )
A state law passed in 1967 prohibits the combination of the vote for the president with any other office on the ballot .
The best advice to ensure your votes count as you intend is to study a sample ballot in advance , read the ballot and voting instructions provided to you at the polling place carefully before casting your vote(s ) , and ask a poll worker for assistance if you are unsure about any aspect of the voting procedures .
If you think you may have spoiled your ballot , do not hesitate to report the situation to a poll worker .
Another thing to keep in mind is that some political parties may not field candidates for every single partisan office on a ballot , so by selecting a straight ticket you may end up not voting at all in some races .
Therefore , if you plan to vote a straight ticket , you might want to review your ballot first to verify that your party has a candidate running for every partisan office listed ( and also be sure to cast votes for non-partisan offices not included in the straight ticket selection process ) .
As they say , “ If you ’re going to take the time to vote , take a few extra seconds and make every vote count . ”
This is a huge privilege for me to present you today the first guest post written for Elrst .
Her author , Daryl Warner Laux and I have been exchanging mails and views for the past months .
Verda Vivo , Daryl ’s blog , reflects her passion for environmental issues , climate change , conservation , pollution , recycling , organics and “ going green ” .
I recently asked her if she would be interested in writing for this humble blog .
To both my pleasure and honor , she agreed .
Here is Daryl ’s post :
Three decades ago , experts said that the ever - growing human population would lead to global disaster .
Paul Erhlich ’s best - selling work , The Population Bomb predicted disaster for humanity due to overpopulation and the “ population explosion ” .
Even though the world population increased to 6.7 billion in thirty years , advances in technology and agriculture , globalization and successful family planning has forestalled the detonation of this bomb .
With the recent rise in the cost of food and fuel , and our failure to control greenhouse gas emissions , along with predictions of a world population of 9 billion by 2040 , it looks like we might run out of planet even with advances in technology .
One of the ways we can create a more sustainable planet is to limit our population .
I ’m not talking about state mandated controls but self - regulation .
If a woman has control over the number and the spacing of her children , we are all better off .
One of the United Nations 2015 Millennium Goals is the unmet need for family planning – the gap between women ’s stated desires to delay or avoid having children and their actual use of contraception .
In addition to sustainability issues and the pressure on world resources , this undermines related goals , such as reducing child mortality , hunger and malnutrition , and increasing primary education enrollment .
The unmet need is most pronounced in the poorest households in Latin American , the Caribbean and all households in sub-Saharan Africa .
Unmet need for family planning is also especially high among young women , many of whom want to delay their pregnancies .
Close spacing of births raises the risks to their life and health .
Once a woman has had the children she desires , not being able to use contraception results in unwanted pregnancies and births .
This increases the risk of maternal death and makes it harder for families to afford schooling and health care for all their children .
According to the Population Reference Bureau :
Worldwide , women now average 2.6 children during their lifetimes , 3.2 in developing countries excluding China , and 4.7 in the least developed countries .
Lifetime fertility is highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 5.4 children per woman .
In the developed countries , women average 1.6 children .
The United States , with an average of 2.1 children , is an exception to this low - fertility pattern in the world ’s wealthier countries .
So , while there are successes in family planning , not all women have access to contraception so they can plan for and space their babies .
Theoretically , access to contraception is either free or at nominal cost to those who are indigent in developing countries .
So the stumbling blocks are either bureaucracies who are unable to deliver to rural populations or politics such as Bush ’s “ gag rule ” which limits any U.S. funding to any organization that provides abortion counseling or services .
Limited access to contraception forces women into either having children they cannot feed or having an abortion , neither of which is desirable .

For the nine - plus months of pregnancy , I dutifully downed fish oil pills .
I had heard all about the virtues of essential fatty acids ( especially DHA , docosahexaenoic acid ) , known collectively as omega - 3s , which are found in fish such as salmon and sardines .
These fats are involved in the development of new neurons and help form the cell walls — the structural support — of nerve cells .
If the healthy brain is like a sponge , then the brain deprived of omega - 3 is like a puddle .
Several years ago , in 2007 , an enormous study funded by the National Institute of Health looked at the link between children ’s scores on aptitude tests ( at ages 6 months to 8 years ) and their mother ’s prenatal consumption of fish .
It turned out that the kids whose moms ate fish more than twice weekly during pregnancy were significantly less likely to have low scores on cognitive tests .
Low maternal seafood intake ( two or fewer servings weekly ) was also associated with increased risk of suboptimum outcomes for prosocial behavior , fine motor , communication , and social development scores .
This was a huge deal .
The nearly 12,000 expectant women who participated in the study were asked to record how much whole fish they ate , not fish oil supplements .
Naturally , this study — and smaller studies like it involving whole - fish consumption — inspired millions of pregnant women to focus on fish oil .
Problem is , not many of us want to or can afford to eat fish every day .
Fears of mercury and PCB contamination are valid ( many varieties of fish , such as tuna , have high levels that are toxic to fetuses ) .
It ’s not much of a stretch to say that fish oil pills are a better way to get your daily DHA .
But here ’s the interesting part .
Everyone has assumed that when it comes to omega - 3 fatty acids like DHA , the source — whole fish or fish oil pills – should n’t matter .
Seems reasonable , but is it ?
A few very recent fish oil studies cast doubt :
Results of fish oil pill supplementation range from neutral to negative …
• A review of six clinical trials ( 1280 women in total ) involving fish oil pill supplementation during breastfeeding found no significant difference in children ’s neurodevelopment : language development ( intelligence or problem - solving ability , psychomotor development , motor development .
In child attention there was a significant difference .
For child visual acuity there was no significant difference .
For language development at 12 to 24 months and at five years in child attention , weak evidence was found ( one study ) favouring the supplementation .
• At the Women ’s and Children ’s Hospital in Adelaide , Australia , researchers tracked the children of 2400 women who took DHA - rich fish oil pills in the last trimester of pregnancy .
The use of these fish oil capsules compared with vegetable oil cap - sules during pregnancy did not result in improved cognitive and language development in their offspring during early childhood .
Other fish oil pill studies found disturbingly negative results :
• At the Universities of Copenhagen and Chapel Hill , researchers followed 120 Danish women who nursed their babies for four months after birth and took fish oil supplements ( or olive oil pills ) .
The children were tested in intervals up to seven years .
The higher the early intake , the lower the child scored in speed of information processing , inhibitory control , and working memory tests .
Boys whose mothers consumed fish oil had lower prosocial scores relative to the olive oil group .
Meanwhile , these recent studies strengthened the evidence that eating fish is brain - boosting :
• In a study that took place the Arctic , 154 11 - year - old Inuit children took standardized tests for memory and verbal learning .
Their scores were compared with their levels of DHA present in their cord blood at birth .
Children who had higher cord plasma concentrations of DHA at birth achieved significantly higher scores on tests related to recognition memory processing .
The source of DH in their mothers ’ diets was fish and marine mammals .
Intriguingly , the connection with higher test scores remained intact regardless of seafood - contaminant ( PCB and mercury ) amounts .
* A UK study of 217 nine - year - olds whose mothers had eaten oily fish in early pregnancy had a reduced risk of hyperactivity and children whose mothers had eaten fish ( whether oily or non-oily ) in late pregnancy had a verbal IQ that was 7.55 points higher than those whose mothers did not eat fish .
This is what I ’d love to see : large studies that compare pregnant / nursing fish - eaters versus pill - poppers .
Few researchers have tackled this , in part because we assume DHA works the same no matter how we get it , and because DHA from sources other than pills is difficult to measure or isolate .
Interestingly , a study at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health compared height , weight and head circumference results of newborns whose mothers whose main source of DHA was fish versus pills .
They found that fish - eaters generally gave birth to larger babies while fish - oil - pill - poppers had newborns with a smaller head circumference .
Is it possible that fish consumption boosts IQ , but fish oil pills do not ?
It ’s dumbfounding , the difference in results between whole fish and fish oil .
The researchers that found negative results of supplementation on nursing infants speculated on what goes wrong .
It may be that early intervention with fish oil pills results in an “ environmental mismatch ” between prenatal and postnatal life , ” ( e.g. the fetus is “ programmed ” in the womb to live in an environment without abundant DHA and is thrown off when inundated with these fats later on ) .
Another theory is that the timing in these recent fish oil pill studies is off .
The critical period in which fish oil may influence brain growth may be in the first trimester of pregnancy or toward the end of the first year of life — not during the time periods in which women in these studies were taking fish oil pills .
It may be that DHA has a “ sweet spot ” — an optimum level below and above which may be detrimental to the developing brain .
Indeed , when researchers look at fish oil pill supplementation and DHA - deficient premature infants , the results are much rosier .
There ’s another compelling explanation of why fish oil pills do n’t yield the desired results : DHA does n’t do its magic alone .
Nutrients and proteins in fish and seafood , other than DHA , may be brain - boosters — or at least help us ( and our fetuses or babies ) to absorb or metabolize DHA better .
All the fish oil in the sea ca n’t compensate for a bad diet .
In the US , a federal advisory recommends that pregnant women not eat more than two servings of fish weekly .
This advice may be misguided given that fish such as salmon and sardines are high in DHA but low in mercury .
Pop fish oil pills instead ; they ’re just as good– that ’s been the message .
But these recent studies point to a different truth .
Thus the case for fish , the whole fish , and nothing but the fish .
Food for thought .

Why must our political election process be so rabid and based on amoral and unethical strategies ?
Here 's why , in part : Karl Rove
This observation is of the ' What makes Karl Rove Tick ? ' variety .
I 'm interested , albeit somewhat passively , in from whence he comes ... psychologically , not politically , ( the efficacy of the political component is obvious ) .
Daily each of us , you and I , cope with ethical and moral decisions allowing oppositional ideologies to percolate through our lives and decision making process .
But in Rove 's case , other operatives of kindred mindset , including those that bring them ' on board ' , this apparently does not hold true .
From their own actions and words , I suspect they are indifferent to any kind of moral stance , ( except perhaps religious tokenism and financial reward ) .
It seems they are almost totally lacking ethical questioning .
It 's the old ' everything 's fair in love and war ' mantra .
Having said that , nevertheless , I believe in the general ' goodness ' of decision making for most of us -- as a whole and individually .
Human - kind has an inherent questioning of the moral and ethical impact of our choices .
It 's called conscience , at a more primal level , perhaps : an unwillingness to self - destruct .
Is it the excitement of the risk of doing ' wrong ' for these ' Rovian ' types ?
Are they merely degenerates without conscience ?
Are they seeking revenge against society , sociopaths , seeking personal revenge for perceived personal attacks during their formative years ?
Who knows , ( at this point I lean toward the latter ) .
This ' clawing ' mentality is most probably a character flaw beyond their personal control , an overwhelming compulsion for the greedy acquisition of power behind the scenes , ( that alone is a perversion ) .
Practically speaking , this attitude is easier on the self - image than running for public office themselves , this way they never loose ... they simply earn their creds to become a well compensated pundit on the corporate media or to garner an advance on a ghost written book .
The net result , unfortunately , is that society suffers immensely at their hands .
There ought to be a law .

Obama commented wryly that the canine question had “ generated more interest on our Web site than just about anything . ”
He continued :
“ We have two criteria that have to be reconciled .
One is that Malia is allergic , so it has to be hypoallergenic .
There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic .
On the other hand , our preference would be to get a shelter dog , but , obviously , a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me .
So  so whether we ’re going to be able to balance those two things , I think , is a pressing issue on the Obama household . ”
Here , in a few sentences , Obama did the following :
He deepened his bond with every dog lover in America .
He identified with every household that ’s tried to figure out what kind of dog to get .
He touched every parent with a kid allergic to pets .
He showed compassion by preferring a dog from a shelter .
And he demonstrated a dry and slightly politically incorrect wit by commenting that “ a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me . ”
Not bad .
It could be a tough four or eight years for conservatives .
It will be tougher yet if they underestimate Obama .
His selection of Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff suggests that Obama ’s not going to be mindlessly leftist , and that he ’s going to shape a legislative strategy that is attentive to Congressional realities while not deferring to a Congressional leadership whose interests may not be his own .
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were both tripped up in their first two years by their Democratic Congresses .
Obama intends for Emanuel to ensure that that does n’t happen .
And Obama has the further advantage of inheriting a recession that will give him a very tough first year or two ( for which he wo n’t be blamed ) , but that should be followed by a recovery well timed for his re-election bid .
So Obama will be formidable .
But conservatives should welcome the challenge .
It ’s good for conservatism that conservatives will have to develop refreshed ideas and regenerated political skills to succeed in the age of Obama .
And it would n’t hurt for Governors Sarah Palin , Mitch Daniels , Bobby Jindal and the other possible 2012 G.O.P. nominees to begin bringing some puppies home for their kids .
WASHINGTON D.C. ( Fortune ) -- Rahm Emanuel , the Chicago Congressman who will be President - elect Barack Obama 's White House chief of staff , is " dangerous , absolutely relentless when he's got a political kill in sight , " according to an admiring Republican colleague , Oklahoma Congressman Tom Cole .
Emanuel is also , President Clinton once told Fortune , " one of the top political minds in Washington , " a former ballet dancer who " favors the counterattack over the attack . "
From his years at Clinton 's side , Emanuel knows his way around the West Wing - and was a critical figure behind the passage of NAFTA .
From his years in the U.S. House of Representatives , he knows his way around Capitol Hill - and was the chief architect of the Democrats ' 2006 recapture of Congress .
Find out how Emanuel 's life was shaped by a near - death experience in high school and lifelong competition with ( and enduring love for ) two equally successful brothers in this 2006 profile by Fortune 's Nina Easton .
On a wretchedly hot August day outside the Caterpillar tractor plant in Montgomery , Ill. , President Bush and the state 's congressional delegation gather for the signing of the massive transportation bill .
This is 2005 , the calm before the Katrina storm , and a rigorous mountain - biking schedule has the President in top shape .
In off - camera chitchat with the shirt - sleeved lawmakers , Bush takes note of Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel 's deep tan , prompting the 46 - year - old Emanuel to boast about the miles of swimming and biking in his triathlon training schedule .
( This story is an excerpt from the story that ran in the October 2 , 2006 issue of Fortune .
Read the full story . )
Testosterone oozes into the humid air space between the two men .
Bush invites Emanuel down to Texas to do some real biking .
" So I said , ' I 'll make you a deal , Mr. President .
I 'll bike if you swim . '
Now he did n't exactly say swimming was a wussy sport , but you could tell ....
So I said , ' Mr. President , Laura can put your water wings next to the lake .
You can have your water wings . ' "
At that point you might think this graduate of the Evanston School of Ballet would leave well enough alone .
But Emanuel is hard - wired to go for the jugular : Politics Chicago - style are part of his DNA .
So he sharpens his drill bit on the leader of the free world .
" I said to him , ' You 're not one of those tribathletes , are you , Mr. President ?
You know - steam , sauna , shower ? '
" And Bush goes , ' That 's g-o - o - d . ' "
Banter with a U.S. President is nothing new to Emanuel ; he was at Bill Clinton 's side as a political advisor inside the White House for six years and still talks strategy with him at least once a month .
Now chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee - the operations center for House candidates - Emanuel is applying rugged business discipline to the Democratic Party 's historic effort to wrest control of the U.S. House from the Republicans .
Last year he recruited dozens of candidates to challenge GOP incumbents .
This year he is holding feet to the fire to raise record amounts for the Democrats ' effort .
Along the way Emanuel has widened his core of admirers - and made powerful enemies .
Nervous about being swamped by Republican money this fall , he spent the summer locked in a bitter dispute with Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean over the allocation of election resources .
In private Emanuel told off Dean .
In public he 's aimed similar messages at liberal financiers like George Soros for being stingy and at the leftist activists in MoveOn.org for being ineffective .
All this matters , of course , only if the Democrats lose .
" Holy Christ , his butt is on the line , " says Democratic strategist Paul Begala , who describes Emanuel 's aggressive style as a " cross between a hemorrhoid and a toothache . "
Emanuel has rejuvenated the hopes of House Democrats in no small part by applying the money - raising acumen he used when Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign nearly sank under the weight of Gennifer Flowers ' accusations .
With a penchant for networking and making deals - honed during a stint at Wasserstein Perella ( which netted him more than $ 18 million in just over two years ) - Emanuel has put the party 's House campaign coffers on a par with the Republicans ' for the first time in years .
As the fall campaign clicks into high gear , Democratic strategists say they have at least a fifty - fifty chance at taking back the House .
Emanuel 's fears about being slaughtered by RNC money are legitimate .
A deal he brokered with Dean in early September committed the DNC to spend $ 2.4 million on 40 competitive House races , while the RNC will be drawing on a war chest that will probably clock in at 25 times that size .
Emanuel 's in - your - face money demands make him stand out in a party that has sometimes been a little prissy about big - donor fundraising .
He 's expanded the DCCC 's donor base , appealing both to like - minded young financiers and big - business donors with GOP ties who are hedging their bets this fall .
When it comes to slicing and dicing his Republican foes , Emanuel applies a Chicago pol 's sensibility that recalls that famous " Untouchables " line : " He pulls a knife , you pull a gun ; he sends one of yours to the hospital , you send one of his to the morgue . "
Mostly out of power for the past six years , the Democrats could use Emanuel 's comeback instincts .
So the match is a timely one .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The FBI tracked about 108,000 potential terrorism threats or suspicious incidents from mid-2004 to November 2007 , but most were found groundless , a Justice Department review found on Friday .
The department ’s office of inspector general gave the figure in an audit of the FBI ’s terrorism case - tracking system , called Guardian , launched in 2002 after the September 11 attacks .
“ The FBI determined that the overwhelming majority of the threat information documented in Guardian had no nexus to terrorism .
However , as a result of information reported in Guardian the FBI initiated over 600 criminal and terrorism - related investigations from October 2006 to December 2007 , ” the inspector general ’s report said .
The report did not discuss the result of the investigations .
FBI policy requires that each threat or suspicious incident reported by the public or other government agencies and law enforcement officers be reviewed to determine whether there is a link to terrorism .
The report expressed concern over delays in the development of a related system , called E - Guardian , for sharing terrorism - related information with local law enforcement .
It said the automated Guardian system had improved since it was first implemented , and the number of incidents tracked had grown dramatically .
FBI spokesman John Miller said the agency had implemented steps to resolve concerns and it accepted recommendations made by the inspector general .
Hillary Rodham Clinton loyalists tried Saturday to kill off the caucus system that proved so damaging to her presidential bid , but were beaten back by a Democratic Party leadership firmly under the command of her former rival , Barack Obama .
Democrats who supported the New York senator ’s candidacy pushed to amend the new party platform so that caucuses would be banned in future presidential contests .
But the party ’s platform committee refused to allow a vote on the amendment or even a discussion .
Co-chair Patricia Madrid , a former New Mexico attorney general , said the matter would instead be taken up at a later date by the party ’s rules committee .
That left Clinton supporters disappointed .
They say that if the party were serious about enfranchising more voters , it would take a clear position against a system that makes participation difficult for shift workers , the disabled and overseas members of the military .
In traditional primaries , people have all day to vote .
But a caucus may last just a few hours .

During the Democratic race , Obama outmaneuvered Clinton in Iowa and many other states that held caucuses , turning out far more supporters and racking up enough delegates to give him an insurmountable lead .
“ My feeling is the issue should have been aired and people should have had the opportunity to speak and vote it up or down , ” Bob Remer , a delegate for Clinton from Chicago , said in an interview Saturday .
Remer , who is a member of the platform committee , had put forward the amendment that was shelved .
“ The caucus system is the exact opposite of everything I ’ve been fighting for in terms of maximizing democratic input . ”
The 186 - member committee voted to recommend adoption of a new Democratic platform , the party ’s formal statement of policies and principles .
Final approval will come at the party ’s national convention Aug. 25 - 28 in Denver .
Clinton supporters were hoping to influence the draft in ways that reflect her interests .
For its own sake , the Obama campaign would like to accommodate Clinton forces where it can ; with Republican John McCain keeping the general election contest close , according to recent polls , Obama needs to unify voters behind him .

So the platform is a mixed bag .
In a section devoted to expanding opportunities for women , the document says that Democrats are proud “ that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling , ” a respectful reference to Clinton ’s vote total in the primary and a phrase she used in her concession speech .
But Obama , now in control of the Democratic Party machinery , clearly enjoys the greatest influence over the document .
The platform reflects many of his policy goals and borrows language from his stump speech .
“ Our planet is in peril , ” reads the preamble .
One of the defining policy differences the Illinois senator had with Clinton involved healthcare .
She wanted a requirement that people carry health insurance ; he did not .
The platform has no mention of a health insurance mandate .
But it does include language that acknowledges “ there are different approaches within the Democratic Party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage . ”

Platform committee leaders insisted that Clinton was given a role in shaping the document .
At some point , party officials said , the future of the caucus system will be decided , but inserting a paragraph in the platform is not the best way to settle the matter .
Madrid , the committee co-chair who set aside the caucus amendment , said the platform “ was n’t effectively controlled by Obama , although his people certainly had a hand in it .
He ’s the candidate and he will have to run on this platform .
That ’s not unreasonable .
The issue of the caucuses wo n’t be resolved here at the platform .
It will be resolved on the DNC level , and they will have their full day in court , I guarantee you . ”
Tensions between Obama and Clinton forces were evident at the Convention Center here , where the meeting took place .
Clinton ’s supporters sat together in the audience , wearing campaign buttons and T - shirts bearing her name .
One person hissed when Obama ’s name was mentioned .
Among the activists serving on the committee , there were also signs of a split .

Lynn Forester de Rothschild , the head of a private holding company and a member of the committee , took the microphone after the caucus amendment was defeated to register a protest .
After the meeting , she said she still had n’t made up her mind about whether to vote for Obama because she did n’t “ understand how a person comes to the U.S. Senate and -- before they ’ve done one thing there -- decides they can be president . ”
“ I have serious questions about Barack Obama and what the Democratic Party is doing , ” she said .
“ I have serious issues with Barack Obama . ”

Consequences for Bank Managers German Bank Demands Money Back from Ex-Employees
The beleaguered state lender IKB has called for bonus repayments from several of its former managers , in the first public demand for money from specific employees by a German bank in the credit crisis .
Meanwhile more German state banks have hinted that they might take federal aid .
( CNN ) --
Nearly half the respondents in a survey of U.S. primary care physicians said that they would seriously consider getting out of the medical business within the next three years if they had an alternative .
Experts say if many physicians stop practicing , it could be devastating to the health care industry .
The survey , released this week by the Physicians ' Foundation , which promotes better doctor - patient relationships , sought to find the reasons for an identified exodus among family doctors and internists , widely known as the backbone of the health industry .
A U.S. shortage of 35,000 to 40,000 primary care physicians by 2025 was predicted at last week 's American Medical Association annual meeting .
In the survey , the foundation sent questionnaires to more than 270,000 primary care doctors and more than 50,000 specialists nationwide .
Of the 12,000 respondents , 49 percent said they 'd consider leaving medicine .
Many said they are overwhelmed with their practices , not because they have too many patients , but because there 's too much red tape generated from insurance companies and government agencies .
And if that many physicians stopped practicing , that could be devastating to the health care industry .
Dr. Gupta :
Watch more on the looming doctor dearth »
" We could n't survive that , " says Dr. Walker Ray , vice president of the Physicians Foundation .
" We are only producing in this country a thousand to two thousand primary doctors to replace them .
Medical students are not choosing primary care . "
Dr. Alan Pocinki has been practicing medicine for 17 years .
He began his career around the same time insurance companies were turning to the PPO and HMO models .
So he was a little shocked when he began spending more time on paperwork than patients and found he was running a small business , instead of a practice .
He says it 's frustrating .
" I had no business training , as far as how to run a business , or how to evaluate different plans , " Pocinki says .
" It was a whole brave new world and I had to sort of learn on the fly . "
To manage their daily work schedules , many survey respondents reported making changes .
With lower reimbursement from insurance companies and the cost of malpractice insurance skyrocketing , these health professionals say it 's not worth running a practice and are changing careers .
Others say they 're going into so - called boutique medicine , in which they charge patients a yearly fee up front and do n't take insurance .
And some like Pocinki are limiting the type of insurance they 'll take and the number of patients on Medicare and Medicaid .
According to the foundation 's report , over a third of those surveyed have closed their practices to Medicaid patients and 12 percent have closed their practices to Medicare patients
That can leave a lot of patients looking for a doctor .
And as Ray mentioned , med school students are shying away from family medicine .
In a survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in September , only 2 percent of current medical students plan to take up primary care .
That 's because these students are wary of the same complaints that are causing existing doctors to flee primary care : hectic clinics , burdensome paperwork and systems that do a poor job of managing patients with chronic illness .

So what to do ?
Physicians do n't have a lot of answers .
But doctors say it 's time to make some changes , not only in the health care field but also with the insurance industry .
And they 're looking to the new administration for guidance .
One of President - elect Barack Obama 's health care promises is to provide a primary care physician for every American .
But some health experts , including Pocinki , are skeptical .
" People who have insurance can't find a doctor , so suddenly we are going to give insurance to a whole bunch of people who have n't had it , without increasing the number of physicians ? " he says .
" It 's going to be a problem . "

After nearly a year as a community tech preview , Microsoft has released the first true beta of the ASP .
NET MVC framework .
ASP .NET MVC is a radical departure from the WebForms technology has promoted in the past , and in the opinion of many , a return to mainstream web programming .
The MVC pattern provides the cornerstone for web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Java 's Spring Framework .
MVC web frameworks should not be confused with their namesake , the Model - View - Controller pattern first proposed by Trygve Reenskaug .
Under Reenskaug 's pattern , the view and controller were tightly bound to one another with a one - to - one mapping between each view and controller .
With a MVC web framework , the view and controller are loosely coupled and it is not unheard of for multiple views to be tied to a single controller .
Regardless of which definition of MVC you prefer , the model remains an independent representation of data that has no knowledge of what is using it .
This is in contrast to WebForms , where it is common for data to be stored in the UI elements themselves in the form of viewstate .
Microsoft 's MVC framework trades in the quick development time of forms and controls for the flexibility and precision you get from controlling all the HTML output directly .
This change in philosophy will probably be a much easier transition for those familiar to classic ASP programmers or non-Microsoft languages than those already with a background in .NET programming .
Some of the new features in this , the first ASP .
NET Beta release , seek to guide developers towards this new way of thinking .
For example , developers can now create new views simply by right - clicking on the associated controller class or pressing Ctrl - M Ctrl - V , at which time they are prompted for the model the view will bind to .
Another departure from WebForms is the emphasis on JavaScript .
While WebForms tried to hide JavaScript from the developer , either by wrapping it in controls or by processing data on the server , ASP .
NET MVC embraces it .
By default MVC web sites get a " Scripts " folder already pre-populated with ASP .
NET AJAX and jQuery .
Full intellisense is provided for the former , while jQuery only has partial support .
This is temporary however , and the annotations needed for full jQuery support is expected in a few weeks .
Microsoft has always had a fascination with data binding , and ASP .
NET MVC is no exception .
Microsoft's " Model Binders " allow developers to quickly map HTTP POST data to object properties .
These objects are then sent to the controller class 's action method .
With this release , default binders for common .NET classes were added .
Keep in mind , however , that under most circumstances developers will be creating their own .
Automated testing of web sites is another mainstream concept Microsoft is only just now embracing .
Unlike many frameworks where testing is only given lip service , Microsoft has planned for it from the beginning .
Mocks are no longer needed for testing controllers and models , which is important as they tend to contain all of the testable logic .
Testing of views will still have to be done externally as that involves checking the HTML against each supported browser separately .
Another aspect of ASP.NET is a return to a focus on HTTP verbs .
While important in older technologies like classic ASP , a WebForms developer could almost forget they existed .
Other than knowing that a post - back caused a POST and a Response .
Redirect caused a GET , little could be done with them .
In ASP .
NET MVC , HTTP verbs are very important and the API reflects that .
Common tasks like restricting some actions to a particular verb can be done simply by decorating the controller method with an AcceptVerbs attribute .
To facilitate replacing Microsoft 's own methods for those written by the developer , any of the HTML helper methods have become extension methods .
This allows them to be replaced partially or in whole simply by changing the using / imports statement .
On a concluding note for those die - hard WebForms fans , Microsoft is n't abandoning you .
Scott Guthrie writes ,
As I always like to make sure I point out :
If you do n't like the MVC model or do n't find it natural to your style of development , you definitely do n't have to use it .
It is a totally optional offering - and does not replace the existing WebForms model .
Both WebForms and MVC will be fully supported and enhanced going forward ( ASP .
NET WebForms in .NET 4.0 will add richer URL routing features , better HTML css markup support , complete control over the Client Id property , more AJAX features , and more that I 'll be blogging about soon ) .
So if you do n't like the MVC option , do n't worry , and do n't feel like you should or need to use it ( you do n't ) .
It had to happen eventually .
The " hard problem " of consciousness is being invoked in favor of anti-Darwinist ideas such as " Intelligent Design " .
Here 's a key quote from an already infamous New Scientist article :
" According to proponents of ID , the " hard problem " of consciousness - how our subjective experiences arise from the objective world of neurons - is the Achilles heel not just of Darwinism but of scientific materialism .
This fits with the Discovery Institute 's mission as outlined in its " wedge document " , which seeks " nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies " , to replace the scientific world view with a Christian one . "
The reporter contacted me to ask for a comment when she was writing the article .
I told her that like many other scientists and philosophers ( even people like Steven Pinker ! ) , I have serious doubts about the possibility of a materialist explanation of consciousness , but that those doubts do little to support a religious agenda or intelligent design .
I declined to be quoted on the record , though , because of the danger of being taken out of context as supporting the movement .
Perhaps this was a mistake , as the article does n't do a good job of separating the issues .
I 'd hate to see the consciousness / materialism issue and the design / theism issue run together in the popular imagination .
As Peter Hankin says amusingly at Conscious Entities :
" Oh boy : if there was one thing the qualia debate did n't need , it was a large - scale theological intervention .
Dan Dennett must be feeling rather the way Guy Crouchback felt when he heard about the Nazi-Soviet pact : the forces of darkness have drawn together and the enemy stands clear at last ! "
Anyway , let 's get things straight .
The problem of consciousness is indeed a serious challenge for materialism .
In fact , I think it 's a fatal problem for materialism , as I 've argued at length here and there .
But it simply is n't a problem for Darwinism in the same way .
Even if one rejects materialism about consciousness , Darwinism can accommodate the resulting view straightforwardly .
The simplest way to see this is to note that the " hard problem " does nothing to suggest that consciousness does n't lawfully depend on physical processes , at least in the sense that certain physical states are reliably associated with certain states of consciousness in our world .
Even if materialism is rejected , there is still good reason to believe that there is such a dependence , via laws of nature that connect physical processes and consciousness .
But if so , there is no problem at all with the idea that evolution can select certain physical states , which yield certain states of consciousness .
If interactionist dualism ( on which consciousness has a causal role ) is true , evolution might even select for certain states of consciousness because of their beneficial effects .
And if epiphenomenalism ( on which consciousness has no causal role ) is true , consciousness can still arise by evolution as a byproduct .
Perhaps the thought that consciousness is a byproduct is unattractive , but if so the problem lies with epiphenomenalism , not with evolution .
So I think there is very little support for anti-Darwinist ideas to be found here .
I think there 's also not much support for theist ideas : of course traditional theism requires that materialism be false , but the falsity of materialism does little to positively suggest that theism is true .
As for intelligent design , I 'm on the record as saying that I can't rule out the hypothesis that we 're living in a computer simulation , so I suppose that it follows that I can't rule out the hypothesis that our world is designed .
But there 's not much here to support traditional theism or to oppose Darwinism , and whatever support there is does n't come from the problem of consciousness .
In any case , I hope that these issues remain firmly separated , as they should .
How will the global financial meltdown affect the next President ’s national - security policy ?
A typical — and true — reply is that our expeditionary armies in Iraq and Afghanistan will be harder to finance .
But there are also subtler issues of potentially greater importance .
Consider this episode from Britain ’s post - imperial awakening :
In 1956 , Egypt ’s Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal , previously a British asset .
Britain , France , and Israel intervened militarily and occupied the canal zone .
President Dwight Eisenhower objected and sought to pressure Britain to accept a United Nations - supervised plan for withdrawal .
Britain had borrowed heavily from the United States during the Second World War and was vulnerable to the demands of its creditor .
To squeeze London , Eisenhower conditioned direct U.S. financial support and backing for a loan to Britain from the International Monetary Fund on Britain ’s acceptance of withdrawal .
The tactic worked .
As the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden put it , “ We were therefore faced with the alternatives , a run on sterling and the loss of gold and dollar reserves till they fell well below the safety margin…or make the best we could of U.N. takeover and salvage what we could . ”
Brad W. Setser cites this example in an important new paper , ” Sovereign Wealth and Sovereign Power , ” published by the Center for Geoeconomic Studies , at the Council on Foreign Relations .
The paper is exceptionally balanced and accessible , and it explores in depth the potential national - security consequences of American trade and financial imbalances with China , Russia , and oil - exporting states in the Persian Gulf .
Setser challenges the view that economic interdependence inevitably promotes stability .
He argues that such optimism “ neglects the differing interests of creditors and debtors . ”
The United States , of course , is a large - scale debtor in the current global system because we have voraciously consumed more than we have produced and have allowed China , among others , to finance our consumption .
Many economists have argued that this pattern of indebtedness is , at least in some respects , a strategic advantage of the United States because the dollar remains the world ’s dominant reserve currency and thus our creditors — even though they may not be political allies — have bound their economic prospects to our own .
This is a geopolitical extension of the old Wall Street saw :
If you borrow a little from a bank , the bank owns you ; if you borrow a lot , you own the bank .
China ’s government , for example , owns a dollar portfolio worth more than a trillion dollars ; it has no interest in seeing the value of that portfolio collapse by forcing a devaluation of the dollar , this argument goes .
This has proven true so far , but will it always ?
Setser ’s argument is that U.S. reliance on foreign governments for credit is an “ underappreciated strategic vulnerability . ”
He writes :
A debtor ’s ability to project military power hinges on the support of its creditors … .
In some ways , the United States ’ current financial position is more precarious than Britain ’s position in the 1950s … Britain ’s main source of financing was a close political ally .
The United States ’ main sources of funding are not allies .
Without financing from China , Russia , and the Gulf states , the dollar would fall sharply , U.S. interest rates would rise , and the U.S. government would find it far more difficult to sustain its global role at an acceptable domestic cost .
The current financial crisis is dynamic and its outcome is impossible to predict , but it does seem likely that it will extend , rather than reduce , the type of vulnerability that Setser has described .
In the short term , the problem is panic and a lack of liquidity ; in the longer term , those ( like the United States ) who took on debt to speculate on rising asset prices will suffer most .
The relative winners , once the markets stabilize , should be those with large cash positions and sound fundamental economies .
If you were to choose a single winner by that formula , it would be China , our largest creditor .
What interaction of creditor - debtor dynamics and hard military power might test this proposition , in a way comparable to the Suez crisis of the 1950s ?
Last week , the Bush Administration announced plans to sell about $ 6.5 billion in arms to Taiwan , a nation that China regards as its own sovereign territory .
At a minimum , what Setser ’s paper suggests is that the Pentagon ’s traditional Taiwan war games — whose ships can maneuver fastest , whose weapons systems can perform the best , etc. — may be myopic and outdated .
Remote control toys are often pretty cool , examples being R2D2 and the wall climbing car , and some are just plain old wacky , R/C Sumo wrestlers and the farting teddy spring to mind .
I ’m not sure yet which category this one falls in , Pterosaur , the remote control flying dinosaur .
As well as resembling palaeontology ’s favourite winged lizard , this remote controlled reptile flies around by flapping its membranous wings in a highly realistic ( we imagine ) fashion .
No really !
Ready - to - fly straight out of the box , Pterosaur will be flapping through the air faster than you can grunt “ unk umgawa ” in your best caveman voice .
( Yes , we know dinosaurs and humans never actually co-existed , but that did n’t stop Doug McClure or Raquel Welch , so it ’s certainly not going to stop us ) .
Pterosaur can be yours from Firebox for £ 49.95 ( ~$ 100 at todays crazy exchange rate ) .
Sen . Norm Coleman is leading Democratic challenger Al Franken in one of the most bitter U.S. Senate races in Minnesota history .
With 100 percent of the 4,130 precincts reporting , Coleman had an unofficial margin of several hundred votes out of nearly 2.9 million cast .
Recounts are required in races with a winning margin of less than one half of 1 percent .
The Associated Press uncalled the Senate race at about 9 a.m. , saying they had prematurely declared Coleman the winner .
Franken said this morning that he intends to exercise his right to a recount .
He also said his campaign is investigating alleged voting irregularities at some polling places in Minneapolis , and that “ a recount could change the outcome significantly . ”
“ Let me be clear :
Our goal is to ensure that every vote is properly counted , ” he said .
Coleman will speak to reporters this morning at his headquarters in St. Paul .
Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , a Democrat , said today that a recount would n’t begin until mid-November at the earliest and would probably stretch into December , the Associated Press reported .
It would involve local election officials from around the state .
“ No matter how fast people would like it , the emphasis is on accuracy , ”
Ritchie said .
Ritchie ’s office ran a speedy recount in September of a close primary race for a Supreme Court seat .
That took just three days , but Ritchie said the Senate race is entirely different .
“ Having a ton of lawyers and other partisans injected into the process , that will change the dynamics of it , ” Ritchie said .
Both candidates captured 42 percent of the vote .
Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley captured 15 percent of the vote .
Exit polls showed that Franken was helped by a wave of Democrats -- including large numbers of first - time voters -- who had already delivered the state 's electoral votes to Democratic President - elect Barack Obama .
But Franken struggled throughout the evening to hang on to all of the Democratic surge , losing some to ticket - splitters who opted for Coleman , particularly in the suburbs .
Returns showed Barkley trailing a distant third , but also pulling enough Democrats and independents to possibly cost Franken the race .
The economy , which was a major factor in Obama 's win , proved far less decisive for Franken .
Despite making a nearly identical pitch and linking himself often with Obama in the closing days of the race , Franken was barely holding his own on that issue against Coleman , exit interviews showed .
Franken , a comedian and first - time candidate who began his effort to unseat Coleman nearly two years ago , had run behind Coleman for much of the campaign but edged ahead in some polls after the stock market imploded in late September .
Coleman had started the race as one of the GOP 's three most vulnerable senators and carried the burden of being linked to both an unpopular war and an immensely unpopular president .
Barkley , who jumped into the race in mid-July , at first showed surprising strength as voters disenchanted with Coleman and Franken turned to the third - party candidate .
Contrary to earlier indications , the exit polling showed that Barkley made a bigger dent in Franken 's support , pulling slightly more Democrats than Republicans into his camp .
As an indication of the damage done by constant attacks , nearly half of Barkley 's supporters indicated in exit polls that had he not been in the race , they would have skipped voting in the Senate contest .

A team of biologists and chemists is closing in on bringing non-living matter to life .
It ’s not as Frankensteinian as it sounds .
Instead , a lab led by Jack Szostak , a molecular biologist at Harvard Medical School , is building simple cell models that can almost be called life .
Szostak ’s protocells are built from fatty molecules that can trap bits of nucleic acids that contain the source code for replication .
Combined with a process that harnesses external energy from the sun or chemical reactions , they could form a self - replicating , evolving system that satisfies the conditions of life , but is n’t anything like life on earth now , but might represent life as it began or could exist elsewhere in the universe .
While his latest work remains unpublished , Szostak described preliminary new success in getting protocells with genetic information inside them to replicate at the XV International Conference on the Origin of Life in Florence , Italy , last week .
The replication is n’t wholly autonomous , so it ’s not quite artificial life yet , but it is as close as anyone has ever come to turning chemicals into biological organisms .
" We ’ve made more progress on how the membrane of a protocell could grow and divide , " Szostak said in a phone interview .
" What we can do now is copy a limited set of simple [ genetic ] sequences , but we need to be able to copy arbitrary sequences so that sequences could evolve that do something useful . "
By doing " something useful " for the cell , these genes would launch the new form of life down the Darwinian evolutionary path similar to the one that our oldest living ancestors must have traveled .
Though where selective pressure will lead the new form of life is impossible to know .
" Once we can get a replicating environment , we ’re hoping to experimentally determine what can evolve under those conditions , " said Sheref Mansy , a former member of Szostak ’s lab and now a chemist at Denver University .
Protocellular work is even more radical than the other field trying to create artifical life : synthetic biology .
Even J. Craig Venter ’s work to build an artificial bacterium with the smallest number of genes necessary to live takes current life forms as a template .
Protocell researchers are trying to design a completely novel form of life that humans have never seen and that may never have existed .
Over the summer , Szostak ’s team published major papers in the journals Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
that go a long way towards showing that this is n’t just an idea and that his lab will be the first to create artificial life — and that it will happen soon .
" His hope is that he ’ll have a complete self - replicating system in his lab in the near future , " said Jeffrey Bada , a University of California
San Diego chemist who helped organize the Origin of Life conference .
Modern life is far more complex than the simple systems that Szostak and others are working on , so the protocells do n’t look anything like the cells that we have in our bodies or Venter ’s genetically - modified E. coli .
" What we ’re looking at is the origin of life in one aspect , and the other aspect is life as a small nanomachine on a single cell level , " said Hans Ziock , a protocellular researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
Life ’s function , as a simple nanomachine , is just to use energy to marshal chemicals into making more copies of itself .
" You need to organize yourself in a specific way to be useful , " Ziock said .
" You take energy from one place and move it to a place where it usually does n’t want to go , so you can actually organize things . "
Modern cells accomplish this feat with an immense amount of molecular machinery .
In fact , some of the chemical syntheses that simple plants and algae can accomplish far outstrip human technologies .
Even the most primitive forms of life possess protein machines that allow them to import nutrients across their complex cell membranes and build the molecules that then carry out the cell ’s bidding .
Those specialized components would have taken many , many generations to evolve , said Ziock , so the first life would have been much simpler .
What form that simplicity would have taken has been a subject of intense debate among origin of life scientists stretching back to the pioneering work of David Deamer , a professor emeritus at UC - Santa Cruz .
What most researchers agree on is that the very first functioning life would have had three basic components : a container , a way to harvest energy and an information carrier like RNA or another nucleic acid .
Szostak ’s earlier work has shown that the container probably took the form of a layer of fatty acids that could self - assemble based on their reaction to water ( see video ) .
One tip of the acid is hydrophilic , meaning it ’s attracted to water , while the other tip is hydrophobic .
When researchers put a lot of these molecules together , they circle the wagons against the water and create a closed loop .
These membranes , with the right mix of chemicals , can allow nucleic acids in under some conditions and keep them trapped inside in others .
That opens the possibility that one day , in the distant past , an RNA - like molecule wandered into a fatty acid and started replicating .
That random event , through billions of evolutionary iterations , researchers believe , created life as we know it .
In a paper released this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Mansy and Szostak showed that the special membranes , fat bubbles essentially , were stable under a variety of temperatures and could have manipulated molecules like DNA through simple thermal cycling , just like scientists do in PCR machines .
The entire line of research , though , begs the question : where would DNA , or any other material carrying instructions for replication , have come from ?
Many researchers have tried to tackle this problem of how RNA - or DNA - like molecules could have developed from the amino acids present on the early Earth .
John Sutherland , a chemist at the University of Manchester , published a paper last year demonstrating one plausible way that RNA could have spontaneously been created in the prebiotic world .
Once such molecules existed , Szostak ’s lab ’s demonstrated in a Nature paper earlier this summer that nucleic acids could replicate inside a protocell ( pdf ) .
But while many scientists agree the protocell work is impressive , not every scientist is convinced that it contributes to a reasonable explanation for the origin of life .
" Their work is wonderful inasmuch as what they are doing can be , " said
Mike Russell , a geochemist with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena , California .
" It ’s just that I ’m uneasy about the significance of it to the origin of life . "
Russell argues that the very first life - like molecules on Earth would have been based on inorganic compounds .
Instead of a fatty acid membrane , Russell argues that iron sulfide could have provided the necessary container for early cells .
But UCSD ’s Bada pointed out that it as unlikely we will ever know how life actually began .
" [ Szostak ’s ] point , and how we all view it , is that it ’s a nice model , but it does n’t necessarily mean that it happened that way , " he said .
Szostak suggested that even if life could theoretically or did begin some other way , his lab ’s hypothesis was ( at least ) experimentally plausible .
" We ’re now pretty much convinced that growth and division could occur under perfectly reasonable prebiotic conditions in a way that is not some artificial laboratory construction , " he said .
And actually , the most intriguing possibility of all may be that the protocells in Szostak ’s lab do not closely model earthly life ’s origins .
If that ’s true , human beings , ourselves the product of evolution from the most primitive organisms , would have created an alternative path to imbuing matter with the properties of life .
" What we have in biology is just one of many , many possibilities , " Szostack said .
" One of the things that always comes up when people talk about life and universal qualities is water .
But is water really necessary ?
What if we could design a system that works in something else ? "

Q : Can Men Breastfeed ?
A : Odd as it seems , men can lactate .
In their 1896 book , Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine , Dr. George Gould and Dr. Walter Pyle recount several occurrences of men breastfeeding their young .
The stories include a sailor who put his son to his breast to quiet him and started producing milk ; a South American peasant who sustained his child with his own breast milk during his wife 's illness ; and a Chippewa man who put his infant to his breast following the death of his wife and produced enough milk to rear the child .
The phenomenon has n't stopped .
In 2002 , a Sri Lankan man named B. Wijeratne lost his wife and was left to care for their 18 - month - old daughter .
When the child refused powdered milk , Wijeratne tried something different .
" Unable to see her cry , I offered my breast , "  Wijeratne told a Sri Lankan newspaper .
" That 's when I discovered I could breastfeed . " 
Wijeratne is n't alone .
All men can breastfeed , because they possess the two most vital components for lactating — mammary glands and pituitary glands .
Mammary glands , which produce milk , are present in all mammals .
In fact , they 're one of our defining characteristics .
In some cases , such as with mice , the mammary glands of the males are too underdeveloped to function .
In humans , however , they 're fully formed in both sexes , complete with breastfeeding ducts and nipples .
Of course , for a human to actually breastfeed , those mammary glands have to be activated somehow .
In women , this usually happens during pregnancy , when the brain 's pituitary gland starts releasing large amounts of a hormone called prolactin , which prepares the breasts to produce milk .
All men produce small amounts of prolactin during their lifetimes .
It 's released after orgasms , for example , and may be responsible for the associated feelings of satisfaction and relaxation .
But typically , it 's never present in large enough quantities for men to breastfeed .
Under the appropriate psychological circumstances , however , the mind can demand that the body produce more of the hormone .
This often happens to mothers who adopt children and suddenly find they can nurse .
And as Dr. Gould and Dr. Pyle have documented , there 's a long history of it happening in men , too .
This article was written by Shea Serrano and originally appeared in the September - October issue of mental_floss magazine .
( CNN ) -- The Director of Hanwei Eggs was contrite .
" We solemnly apologize to consumers , " said Han Wei .
" We apologize to the distributors .
We solemnly declare that our company has never purchased melamine .
We have never adopted melamine to the feeds or products . "
But somehow melamine got into eggs produced at the company 's plant in Dailin in northeast China .
Chinese consumers were taking the news in stride .
" Stop eating eggs ? " asked one customer .
" That 's not doable . "
Melamine is a chemical used in making plastics and fertilizer .
But in recent times , it has become the badge of shame for the Chinese food industry after being illegally added to food products to suggest they contain a higher level of protein .
U.N. officials are concerned that melamine has been introduced to animal feed and may turn up in chicken , pork , farmed fish and other products .
Tainted eggs from Hanwei were discovered in Hong Kong late last week ; melamine was present at nearly double the maximum permissible level .
Health officials in Hong Kong say that there 's little risk to human health -- and that a child would have to eat perhaps 20 eggs a day for the melamine to have an effect .

But Wal - Mart is taking no chances .
It has pulled Hanwei eggs from the shelves of its supermarkets across China .
The U.S. superstore 's step has not been followed by many other retailers in China , and CNN found eggs plentiful at Beijing markets on Tuesday .

Chinese consumers -- by now familiar with food safety alarms -- were taking the news in stride .
" Stop eating eggs ? " asked one woman .
" That 's not doable .
If there 's a problem with eggs it should be solved fundamentally .
People can't live without eggs in their daily lives . "
A younger woman had the same view : " We can't be too serious , if we think too much about the vegetable and meat we eat , we can't eat anything . "
Do n't Miss Wal - Mart pulls eggs from stores in China
Wal - Mart pulls eggs from stores in China ' High level of melamine ' in two Cadbury products
' High level of melamine ' in two Cadbury products Melamine found in 18 more food products
The egg scare is unlikely to take on the dimensions of the tainted milk powder scandal , which has sickened more than 50,000 Chinese children and led to the deaths of four babies .
Again , melamine was the culprit -- and the consequences could be long - lasting .
The World Health Organization says that crystals have been found in the kidneys of some children .
WHO 's regional food safety expert Anthony Hazzard told Reuters Tuesday : " We believe at this stage that it 's really the complex of melamine and cyanuric acid forming what you call crystals ... they can form in the small tubules [ in the kidneys ] and they get bigger and can block the tubules . "
Experts say melamine 's health risks are not well known .
According to Dr. Dan Blumenthal of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia , " Something we do n't know is whether there is a safe amount of melamine in food .
I 'd rather not eat any melamine at all .
There is a limit that is not based on animal studies , but we can't be certain that even the small amount is safe in humans , especially if consumption of the chemical goes on for years . "
In the meantime , Blumenthal recommends " the prudent thing to do is to stay away from foods that might be contaminated , and this especially means infant formula and other dairy products that are coming from China . "
The Chinese leadership , long criticized by other governments for poor food safety standards , has promised action .
A committee of the National People 's Congress is reviewing a new draft law .
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said last weekend , " Food is a continuous process that begins in the fields and ends on your dinner table .
From production to transportation to refining to packaging to manufacture , every process needs to go through thorough and strict testing . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health library
That will be music to the ears of WHO .
Earlier this year , the U.N. office in China produced a report on food regulations in China , criticizing the patchwork of regulatory agencies and lack of responsibility among food manufacturers .
It pointed out that China had 350,000 food producers or processors with fewer than 10 employees , and oversight of them was the greatest challenge .
Among the U.N. 's recommendations :
• A legal framework that is consistent nationwide ;
• Food safety standards that are in harmony with international standards ;
• And a unified and efficient food safety testing and inspection system .
The stakes are high for China 's food industry and its consumers .
Food exports from China were worth $ 27 billion in 2006 and Chinese food exports to the United States have risen fivefold since 1990 .
Recent scandals involving melamine have led governments around the world to ban the import of certain Chinese foods ; and Beijing wants to restore credibility to the " Made in China " label .

The Coleman and Franken campaigns traded shots Monday as counties completed the process of certifying their vote tallies and officials prepared to start recounting nearly 3 million ballots in the U.S. Senate race .
Six days after the election , unofficial results showed Republican Sen.
Norm Coleman leading Democratic challenger Al Franken by 206 votes , a difference of about 1/100th of 1 percent that sets the stage for the automatic hand recount that will begin next week .
Monday was the deadline for counties to certify their results .
Depending on the unknown number that may not have yet reported them to the state , that 206 figure could still change before the state Canvassing Board meets next week to certify the official total .
Only then will the recount begin .
Officials with Hennepin County forwarded their tally Monday to the secretary of state 's office , showing that , since initial results Wednesday , Franken 's total had increased by 55 votes and Coleman 's by 27 in the state 's largest county .
Adjustments in the vote tallies because of misplaced figures and other errors have been limited to 22 of the state 's 87 counties , according to an analysis of the fluctuations from Wednesday to Monday .
Since the preliminary Election Day numbers , Franken 's biggest gains were in Lake County , where he added 246 votes , and in Pine and St. Louis counties , where he picked up 100 in each .
Coleman 's biggest gain was in Ramsey County , 29 votes , but that was more than canceled out by an additional 41 votes there for Franken .
Coleman 's biggest drop was 124 votes in Anoka County , where Franken also lost 90 votes .
Meanwhile , both campaigns spent much of the day fencing over exactly how to secure the ballots that will be recounted and possibly laying the groundwork for further legal challenges .
A Jersey City councilman was allegedly drunk when he was seized at a Washington nightclub after urinating on attendees of a Grateful Dead tribute concert .
City Councilman Steven Lipski , who represents the Journal Square area and directs a charter school , was charged Friday with simple assault at Nightclub 9:30 on V Street , a spokesman from the Metropolitan Police District of Columbia said today .
Staff at the club spotted Lipski , 44 , at the Dark Star Orchestra concert , urinating from a second - level balcony onto the crowd below , The Daily News reported today .
Club employees hauled Lipski from the club and held him until police arrived and arrested him around 9:50 p.m. , the report said .
A " source " told The Daily News that Lipski was " very drunk , " and said it was n't the first time he acted up at the nightspot .
" We 've dealt with this man before , " the source is quoted saying .
" He 's never peed on anybody , but he gets really belligerent and drunk . "
Lipski , founder and director of CREATE Charter School in Jersey City , did n't return several phone calls left for him at his home and on his cell phone .
But one of his city council colleagues , Willie Flood , said Lipski called her this morning and said the incident was a big misunderstanding .
Lipski claimed he spilled a drink and a someone thought it was urine , Flood said .
" It is an allegation , " Flood added .
" We need the facts first and then make a determination what happened .
It seems out of character . "
Flood , who also is the Hudson County Registrar , made headlines earlier this year when it came to light she hired her son for two government jobs even though he had previous run-ins with the law .
Richard Heinecke , owner of Nightclub 9:30 , declined to comment today .
Downtown Councilman Steven Fulop called Lipski's arrest " embarrassing " for Jersey City .
Coupled with Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy 's conviction for resisting arrest and obstruction of administrative law during a tussle with cops in Bradley Beach in 2006 , Fulop said these incidents would lead investors to " question the leadership " of Jersey City .
" It is very humiliating , " he said .
Healy was unavailable to comment and his spokeswoman , Jennifer Morrill , called the Lipski incident a " private and personal matter . "
The mayor has characterized his thrice - appealed disorderly persons arrest in Bradley Beach in 2006 in much the same manner .
The state Supreme Court refused to consider a final appeal of the charges earlier this year .
Healy has maintained he was just trying to help the police sort out a domestic dispute .
As we noted last week , university endowments have been clobbered in the past three months , especially the ones that were trying to " be like Yale . "
( Overweight private - equity , hedge funds , commodities , and real - estate ; underweight cash and bonds ) .
The situation is so bad that some funds are resorting to fire sales : Harvard , for example , is desperately shopping $ 1.5 billion of private equity commitments , which it will likely be forced to sell for $ 750 million or less .
At this point , however , it appears that UVA may win the prize for the most wholesale destruction of alumni gifts .
JP Morgan wealth - management strategist Michael Cembalest summarizes the situation :
The endowment 's value as of October 2008 is $ 4 billion , and they have $ 1.6 billion in uncalled private equity , real estate and natural resource commitments on top of $ 1.4 billion already invested .
[ That 's 75 % of the endowment pledged to highly illiquid investments ] .
The endowment has now announced plans to sell not only public equity , but also several hundred million from hedge funds at a time of illiquid markets , and to explore selling their private equity in the secondary market ( a " market " which only exists in the narrowest sense of the word ; there 's around $ 15 billion in buy side funds looking for very steep discounts ) .
Endowments like UVA 's make annual contributions to a university 's operating budget , so a portfolio with a 75 % allocation to private funds ( holdings plus future commitments ) is a very aggressive one .
Sorry , UVA alumni .
You 're going to have to make those gifts all over again .

Pakistani troops arrest alleged Mumbai plotter
One of the alleged plotters of last month ’s attack by gunmen on Mumbai was arrested by Pakistani security forces , officials said Monday .
Pakistani troops seized a camp used by the suspected terrorist group and arrested more than five people .
The raid was the first known action by Islamabad in response to the attacks , which have sharply raised tensions between nuclear - armed rivals Pakistan and India and raised concerns in Washington over its campaign against al - Qaeda in the region .
Witnesses heard several loud explosions and saw a helicopter and dozens of army personnel at the scene .
It has been reported that one of those held was Lashkar - e - Taiba operational chief Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi .
“ Yes , Lakhvi is among four or five people arrested in a raid yesterday , ” said the official , whose JuD charity is regarded as front for the feared militant group .
India has blamed “ Lashkar - e - Taiba ” for attacks in its commercial center , which killed nearly 180 people and injured over 300 .
Islamabad denies any participation in the Mumbai violence but some of the gunmen are said to have had links to Pakistani militants .
The United States has exerted diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to match words with deeds swiftly to stop the crisis worsening , while asking India to exercise restraint .
“ I think there ’s no doubt that Pakistani territory was used , by probably non-state actors , ” U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN ’s “ Late Edition ” on Sunday .

British environmental group Futureproof has been giving out £ 5 bills to drivers who agree to sign a petition to the British Secretary of Transport , Geoff Hoon , to encourage him to seek tougher emission standards for cars sold in the European Union.[ social_buttons ]
“ Today we ’re giving drivers £ 5 each and in return asking them to make sure the Government plays its part in keeping the car manufacturers on track towards real progress and not opting for weaker targets , ” said Blake Ludwig , the Managing Director for Futureproof .
The activists say the money represents a fraction of what drivers would save if the UK weaned itself from fossil fuels .
They hope to push emission standards to 120g CO2 / kg by 2012 .
Current standards are merely voluntary agreements with automakers , but environmental groups argue the voluntary agreement system is not working .
The group says the money they are giving away represents only a fraction of what drivers would save if the UK weaned itself from fossil fuels .
“ This makes sense not just from an environmental point of view , but also from an economic standpoint .
Low emission cars are an important first step toward removing us from oil dependency as they require less fuel , so will cost less to run . ”
So far it is unclear who is funding the “ Fivers for Drivers ” campaign .
Futureproof also has higher ambitions : they hope to found a new car company called Mundo Cars , which would produce “ aspirational , ” pollution - free vehicles .
For more information about the group and their high aspirations , check out this video they have produced .

The report , Intellectual Property Crime And Enforcement
In Australia , noted the industry now loses about $ 45 million annually due to illegally copied content .
But this rises to nearly $ 200 million when tax losses and secondary revenues such as advertising are factored in .
Faster , cheaper broadband connections and new software making downloading easier are behind the boom , the researchers found .
But it has also been driven by an impatient demand for must - see US and British shows , which has prompted Seven , Nine and Ten to fast - track episodes of popular programs .
As a result of illegal downloading , numerous hit programs - including The Mentalist , Californication , Supernatural , NCIS , House , The Amazing Race and Heroes - are now aired within days of their release overseas .
Australian networks are also giving internet - savvy viewers the opportunity to legally download programs from their own websites .
Fans of the cancelled series McLeod 's Daughters can download the show from Nine 's site .
Ten provides downloads including Neighbours and Good News Week .
A Channel Seven spokesman said : " Television is successful because it reflects consumer demands and fast - tracking of some programs from the United States to counter any impact from downloading is one strategy .
" Our key strategy is one of creating and producing programs you can only see on Seven , such as Sunrise , Dancing With The Stars and Packed To The Rafters . "
Overseas programs that are not fast - tracked are being left in the dust .
The finale of Dr Who series four ran locally last month on the ABC as one of its best - rating shows but for downloaders the episode was old hat six months ago .
The Cartoon Network last week announced its November 22 launch of the long - awaited Star Wars franchise animation , Clone Wars , but it is already available on the internet .
Even hit TV shows scheduled for US prime - time broadcast can be copied in New York and ready to download in Sydney before they legitimately go to air in LA three hours later , because of the cross-country time difference .
Leading internet monitor Envisional said users with the right software can leave their home PCs to scan and download the latest available releases .
The study concluded more than one in five Australians have watched or purchased a pirated film or TV show .
The TV Superhighway * House : 1 day ( after the US ) * Kath & Kim : 3 days
* Californication : 7 days * NCIS : 7 days
* Supernatural : 11 days * The Mentalist : 12 days * Heroes : 17 days
* Amazing Race : 18 days

As much as we'd like to think up some mildly positive spin to this , such as the new possibility that we might get to see Cat Stevens killed on live television , we can't .
Frankly , it 's the first explosive act in what will probably be the end of the world .

As the traditional Thanksgiving Day shopping weekend is upon us , we hear the usual canards of hope — hope that consumers will " stimulate " the economy , or we read from people like Karl Rove that President - elect Barack Obama ’s " economic team " is " first - rate , " and will have the " answers " for the economy .
Paul Krugman , who already had advocated trillion - dollar deficits as a way to bring the economy into recovery , says that this new government can " fix the financial system " by even more regulation , thus avoiding the next recession ( if we ever recover from this one ) .
The spate of bad advice and outright ignorance of what actually is happening will continue into the Obama presidency , which has promised " green jobs " as a means of bringing the economy back into balance .
( What Obama means is that his administration plans to destroy the relatively - healthy energy industries and replace them with unreliable substitutes like wind power and corn - based ethanol , thus destroying millions of jobs in order to create a few thousand " new " ones . )
Moreover , the vaunted " economic team " so lavishly praised by the former Bush political officer
Rove so far has offered nothing but more Keynesian " solutions " of massive debt and inflation .
Instead of simply attacking the newest Keynesian nonsense , however , I will note that the eternal default position on economic crises — the Keynesian one — arises because academic economists foolishly have rejected Austrian Economics and the wise counsel it provides .
This hardly is an accident or a problem that can be " solved " by being more aggressive in promoting the Austrian position .
Instead , the failure of economists to embrace Austrianism comes both from ignorance about the economy in general and the fact that Austrian " solutions " do not provide a central role for economists to be seen as heroes or " fixers " of the economy .
Robert Murphy , in a recent " open letter " to the famed Nobel - winning economist Gary Becker , writes the following :
Mainstream economists often have a hard time grasping the Austrian theory of the business cycle because it relies on a theory of the complex capital structure in a modern economy .
Most mainstream economists , in contrast , usually think of the “ capital stock ” encapsulated by a single value , K. Relying on the framework of the Solow growth model , mainstream economists usually interpret the Austrian theory as one of “ overinvestment ” during the boom .
As Murphy continues , it is clear that modern neoclassical economists are clueless in general about capital :
In order to even comprehend the Austrian claim , the mainstream economist needs to discard the simplistic homogeneous notion of the capital stock , and seek a richer framework that reflects the time structure of production .
In a modern economy , if we picked a random consumer good off the store shelf , it would probably have a “ life history ” going back many years , and involving thousands of workers handling resources originating in dozens of countries .
( Leonard Read ’s wonderful essay “ I , Pencil ” is apposite . )
Indeed , if one were to ask a typical economist how an economy grows , he or she might reply : " Aggregate demand has been increased . "
( The so - called Supply - Siders might say that " aggregate supply has increased , " but neither statement really makes any sense .
There really is no such thing as " aggregate demand " or " aggregate supply " ; they are figments of economists ’ imaginations . )
For now , it seems that economists , no matter if they are of the " free market " variety or if they are disciples of Keynes and Krugman , all are calling for the government to become involved in schemes to " jump start " the economy .
The blind are leading the blind .
Furthermore , as Murphy points out in his " open letter , " even accomplished economic thinkers like Becker seem incapable of understanding the basic Austrian notion of " malinvestment , " instead mistakenly calling it " overinvestment . "
( Krugman refers to it as the " Hangover Theory , " but presents a caricature not only of the theory itself , but also in his portrayal of Austrian economists as people who revel in the economic misery of others . )
Murphy and others of the Austrian School are correct in pointing out that typical academic economists really do n’t understand capital very well , and their few attempts at formulating a theory of capital have been failures .
Yet , I believe that the mainstream failure of capital theory is due to the greater failure of economists to understand that simple good : money .
About 30 years ago , I read The Biggest Con by Irwin Schiff , and I have not forgotten his opening statement that money in the United States had " disappeared . "
I was taken aback when first reading those words , but as I read his book and then read the Austrian economists , I realized that Schiff was right : money has disappeared in this country , and has been gone for a long time .
In fact , almost all modern economists have grown up in a time when fiat " money " has been the norm .
Few economists ( and I include myself ) ever have seen real money in circulation .
The closest thing that most of us have seen was the silver ( or part - silver ) coinage that existed in the United States until 1965 , but was replaced by government tokens .
Thus , few , if any , of us have experience in dealing with what historically has been termed " money , " and that situation only adds to the overall ignorance that economists have of this subject .
Furthermore , because of the artificial division of economics into " microeconomics " and " macroeconomics , " economists who choose the more - popular " micro " fields have almost no contact at all with monetary theory , save a class or two from graduate school in which a near - pure quantity theory prevails .
Economists can speak of " money supply " or " price levels , " but very few understand the very nature of the money economy and what happens when governments predictably abuse their monopolies of " money creation . "
Even the " free market " economists often stumble over the issue of money , even when they " specialize " in it , as did Milton Friedman .
This state of affairs was made clear to me in an exchange of articles by Joseph Salerno and Richard Timberlake in The Freeman nearly a decade ago .
Salerno argued the Austrian position while Timberlake followed the Monetarist view .
Timberlake , for example , could not understand Salerno ’s contention that the 1920s was an era of Federal Reserve - induced inflation in this country because the consumer price index fell slightly during that decade .
Timberlake ’s reasoning was that if the government index was falling , then the 1920s had to be a time of deflation , not inflation .
Yet , Salerno and Timberlake were arguing past each other because each man was defining money in very different terms .
Salerno was defining money as a good used for exchange that had all the properties of any individual good , and if the amount of money in circulation increases , the marginal utility of money falls , with inflation being the decrease of the value of money relative to the goods it is used to purchase .
Timberlake , on the other hand , defined money in the more typical neoclassical fashion of being a quantity variable monopolized by government and manipulated by the central bank as a means of influencing economic activity .
The difference between the two points is crucial not only in understanding the current economic crisis , but also in understanding Austrian Capital Theory and the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle .
If one cannot understand money and capital , then one cannot understand the whole issue of malinvestments and what causes the boom and bust cycle .
The consequences of this ignorance are not esoteric .
This is not a parlor discussion among economists on how many spirits of George Stigler can dance on the head of a pin .
Instead , it is about understanding how this current crisis came to being , what to do about it , and , just as important , what not to do .
The upshot is that economists are creating crude models of imaginary " aggregate demand and aggregate supply , " throwing in government spending and expansion of fiat currency , and calling it a " solution . "
However , one applies these " solutions " the same way that one pours gasoline on a house fire to extinguish the flames .
The Keynesian " solution " is a disaster which is made worse because most academically - trained economists are ignorant of the causes of the problem and , thus , are not intellectually equipped to recommend the needed steps to put the economy back into balance .
Austrian economists and the intellectual tools they bring to the table are needed more than ever , yet the response of the economics profession has been to be even more aggressive in denouncing Austrians as " quacks " and " charlatans " and making sure that they are excluded from any academic and political discussions about this crisis .
However , if one wishes to see just how superior the Austrian position has been , the best proof is to watch clips of Peter Schiff ( Irwin ’s son ) , who is a well - known investor and fund manager , debate mainstream economists and other “ financial experts ” by using the Austrian analysis against their viewpoints .
Schiff clearly understands the nature of the crisis and how to stop the bleeding and cure the " patient " ; the others blindly stumble about , citing the " expertise " of economic theories that lead to nowhere .
For years , economists from the University of Chicago and others influenced by them have claimed that Austrian Economics is rejected by the mainstream because it " fails the market test . "
Their logic goes like this : ( a ) Mainstream economists accept good theory and reject bad theory ; ( b ) Austrian Economics is rejected by the mainstream ; ( c ) Therefore , Austrian Economics is bad economics .

He was raised by his mother alone , as she was by her father .
She wondered if his mother , who had set up their date , had told him about that .
Siyu was thirty - eight , and the man , Hanfeng , was forty - four .
Siyu ’s father , after supporting her through college , had remarried , choosing a woman thirty years his junior .
The woman had a young son from her previous marriage , whom Siyu ’s father had taken on as his responsibility .
The boy was now in his last year of high school , and Siyu , having told her father many times that he deserved peace and simplicity , maintained a respectful distance from his new family .
Each year she spent New Year ’s Eve , and sometimes other holidays , with Hanfeng ’s mother , who had been her zoology professor in college .
There was no way to predict when the older woman would be in the mood to invite Siyu , so she tried to keep herself uncommitted , which meant that most of the holidays she spent alone .
“ Professor Dai must miss her students these days , ” Siyu said after she and Hanfeng had exchanged greetings , although she knew that it was not the students that his mother missed but the white skulls of mammals and birds on her office shelves , the drawers filled with scalpels and clamps and tweezers that she had cleaned and maintained with care , and the fact that she could mask her indifference to the human species with her devotion to animals .
The first time Siyu had seen Professor Dai , on a campus tour during the opening week of college , the older woman had been following a strutting owl down a dimly lit hallway ; she paid little attention to the group of new students , and stooped slightly the whole time , as if she were the mother of a toddler and had to watch out for minor accidents .
When a boy stepped over to take a closer look at the owl , she scooped up the bird in her arms and glared at him before striding away .
“ Retirement is a strange thing for her , ” Hanfeng said .
His mother had always despised women who grabbed every opportunity to matchmake , but within days of his return to China she had mentioned a former student she thought he should meet .
His mother did not say much else , but he could sense that it was marriage that she was thinking about .
Twenty years of living away from her had not changed that in him : he always knew what was on her mind before she said it , and he wondered if she was ever aware of that .
The teahouse where Hanfeng and Siyu were meeting , at a hillside pavilion in the Summer Palace , had been chosen by his mother , and she had suggested that they also take a long stroll along the lakefront .
It was early March .
The day turned out overcast and windy , and secretly Hanfeng hoped that the wind would not die down , so they could forgo the romantic walk .
He wondered if Siyu was wishing for a different scenario .
He could not yet read much from her face .
She smiled courteously as she gave him a few facts about the tea she had ordered for them both , White Peony , but the smile and the words seemed to come with effort , as if her interest in interacting with him could easily fade .
Her body was slender , and her hair , black with noticeable strands of gray , was kept straight and at shoulder length .
He wondered why the woman , who was beautiful in an unassuming way , had never married .
“ Do you find Beijing a different city now ? ” Siyu said .
It must be a question that he was asked all the time , but it would not do anyone any harm , she thought .
It was not the first time that Siyu had been set up with a stranger — since she had turned twenty , neighbors and acquaintances , pitying her for not having a mother to fuss over her future , had taken it as their responsibility to find a husband for her — but with those men she had known from the beginning that she would not bother trying to impress them .
Over the years , she had developed a reputation as unmatchable , and nowadays only the most persistent of the matchmakers would mention a widower or a divorcé , in his fifties or sometimes sixties , as a possible solution .
The first time such a prospect was presented in an enthusiastic speech , Siyu had the odd feeling that she was now expected to marry her father ; only later did she realize that she was no longer a young woman .
Siyu worked as a librarian in a zoology institute , and her life had not changed much from that of a college student .
In her mind , she might still be the eighteen - year - old who had set her alarm clock early so that by six o’clock she would be sitting on the bench under an ancient gingko tree in front of the biology building .
At half past six , Professor Dai would arrive on her bicycle — a tall , rusty , heavy - built one that would have better suited a peasant or a street peddler — and she would nod at Siyu almost imperceptibly as she locked it up .
It had taken two years for Professor Dai to cross the courtyard and ask Siyu about the thick volume that she had been reading every day .
Charles Dickens , Siyu had replied , and then added that she was trying to memorize “ Great Expectations . ”
Professor Dai nodded , expressing neither surprise nor curiosity at the task that had already made Siyu an eccentric in the eyes of her classmates .
Siyu did not explain to them that her grandfather — her mother ’s father , whom she had never met — had once memorized volumes of Dickens on the small balcony of a Shanghai flat , a feat that had eventually led him , before the liberation , to a high position in a bank run by Englishmen .
It was Dickens who had in the end killed Siyu ’s mother : as a daughter of the British capitalists ’ loyal lapdog , she had hanged herself when her own daughter was four months of age , barely old enough to be weaned .
Hanfeng looked at Siyu ’s face , detecting a familiar absent - mindedness .
His mother , too , asked him questions to which she seemed scarcely interested in knowing the answers .
He wondered if this happened to women who lived by themselves .
“ Too many cars , ” he replied , nonetheless — the standard response he gave when asked about his impression of Beijing these days .
“ I miss the bicycles . ”
Hanfeng had returned from the States a month before .
He had told his former colleagues in San Francisco about his intention to settle down in China , and they had joked about moving with him and becoming the forty - niners of the new gold rush .
He had gone along with the joke , making up ambitious business plans that he knew he would not carry out .
His mother was getting old , he ’d explained to his friends ; the thought that he , too , was no longer a young man in need of adventures he had kept to himself .
Semi-retired was how he liked to think of his situation , but within days he had realized that what he had made in the States at the tail end of the dot - com bubble would not be sufficient to support a life of idleness , as he had hoped .
Still , he was not eager to go out and seek employment .
He deposited half his money into his mother ’s account and told her that he would take a break ; she did not ask about his plans for the future , in the same way that she had not questioned his decision to leave or to come home .
At seventy - one , his mother was as independent as ever , and she loathed most activities that a woman her age enjoyed : taking morning walks with a companion , gossiping and bargaining at the marketplace , watching soap operas in the afternoon .
Hanfeng had never wondered how his mother spent her days in retirement until his return , when , all of a sudden , the three - bedroom flat that must have seemed empty to her became crowded .
He had been the one to cook for the two of them when he was a boy , dividing the meals in half and eating his portion alone ; his mother , her preoccupation with her research a ready excuse , had eaten at odd hours then .
Since his return , he had taken over the cooking again , and , now that neither of them was eager to go out into the world to fulfill any duty , they ate together .
Rachel makes a very strong case for why Joe Lieberman should not remain the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and why the damage he could do and already has done in that position far outweighs the slim hope he might vote with the Democrats when really needed .
Responding to Evan Bayh 's promise that they 'll take the chairmanship away from him if he tries to pull any investigative shenanigans on Obama , Maddow notes adroitly :
Are you really going to wait until he starts his first off - base witch - hunting investigation of Obama into whether he 's a Marxist or a traitor or whatever , and then you 're going to take away his gavel .
[ Laughs ]
I 'm sure that 's going to go over great .
... Listen , Democrats , you have lost Lieberman anyway .
If you boot Lieberman out of his chairmanship , I know you probably wo n't get your 60 votes .
But you do get a guy who politicized national security and homeland security in a disgusting fashion during this election , you do get him out of one of the most important security jobs in the government .
You go , Rachel .
Why did n't the Democrats already do something about his failure to hold any hearings on hurricane Katrina and the no-bid contracts given to Cheney 's buddies ?
Why have they allowed someone who 's acted as a protection arm for the Bush administration to chair one of the most important Senate committees in the Congress already and not investigate the fraud and corruption that has occurred in this illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq ?
How can Democrats think it would not be a complete political disaster if they tried to shut Lieberman down after he decided to use the position to possibly go after Obama in the same way Republicans went after Clinton for overblown controversies ?
Especially given the statements he 's already made about Obama regarding foreign policy , particularly his oft - stated fear of what actions Obama might take as President ?
Joe Lieberman needs to go before he can do any more damage than the Democrats have allowed him to do already .
Archaeologists in southeastern Turkey have discovered an Iron Age chiseled stone slab that provides the first written evidence in the region that people believed the soul was separate from the body .
University of Chicago researchers will describe the discovery , a testimony created by an Iron Age official that includes an incised image of the man , on Nov. 22-23 at conferences of biblical and Middle Eastern archaeological scholars in Boston .
The Neubauer Expedition of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago found the 800 - pound basalt stele , 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide , at Zincirli ( pronounced " Zin- jeer - lee " ) , the site of the ancient city of Sam'al .
Once the capital of a prosperous kingdom , it is now one of the most important Iron Age sites under excavation .
The stele is the first of its kind to be found intact in its original location , enabling scholars to learn about funerary customs and life in the eighth century B.C.
At the time , vast empires emerged in the ancient Middle East , and cultures such as the Israelites and Phoenicians became part of a vibrant mix .
A funerary monument recovered in southeastern Turkey reveals that people who lived in an important Iron Age city there believed the soul was separate from the body .
They also believed the soul lived in the funerary slab .
Photo : Eudora Struble , University of ChicagoThe man featured on the stele was probably cremated , a practice that Jewish and other cultures shun because of a belief in the unity of body and soul .
According to the inscription , the soul of the deceased resided in the stele .
" The stele is in almost pristine condition .
It is unique in its combination of pictorial and textual features and thus provides an important addition to our knowledge of ancient language and culture , " said David Schloen , Associate Professor at the Oriental Institute and Director of the University 's Neubauer Expedition to Zincirli .
Schloen will present the Kuttamuwa stele to a scholarly audience at the meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research on Nov. 22 in Boston , the major annual conference for Middle Eastern archaeology .
Dennis Pardee , Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization at the University of Chicago , will present his translation of the stele 's 13 - line inscription the following day at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature , also in Boston , in a session on " Paleographical Studies in the Near East .
" German archaeologists first excavated the 100 - acre site in the 1890s and unearthed massive city walls , gates and palaces .
A number of royal inscriptions and other finds are now on display in museums in Istanbul and Berlin .
Schloen and his team from the University of Chicago have excavated Zincirli for two months annually since 2006 .
" Zincirli is a remarkable site , " said Gil Stein , Director of the Oriental Institute .
" Because no other cities were built on top of it , we have excellent Iron Age materials right under the surface .
It is rare also in having written evidence together with artistic and archaeological evidence from the Iron Age .
Having all of that information helps an archaeologist study the ethnicity of the inhabitants , trade and migration , as well as the relationships of the groups who lived there .

The stele was discovered last summer in a small room that had been converted into a mortuary shrine for the royal official Kuttamuwa , self - described in the inscription as a " servant " of King Panamuwa of the eighth century B.C.
It was found in the outer part of the walled city in a domestic area — most likely the house of Kuttamuwa himself — far from the royal palaces , where inscriptions had previously been found .
The inscription reads in part : " I , Kuttamuwa , servant of Panamuwa , am the one who oversaw the production of this stele for myself while still living .
I placed it in an eternal chamber ( ? ) and established a feast at this chamber ( ? ) : a bull for [ the storm - god ] Hadad , ... a ram for [ the sun-god ]
Shamash , ... and a ram for my soul that is in this stele . … "
It was written in a script derived from the Phoenician alphabet and in a local West Semitic dialect similar to Aramaic and Hebrew .
It is of keen interest to linguists as well as biblical scholars and religious historians because it comes from a kingdom contemporary with ancient Israel that shared a similar language and cultural features .

Photo : Jason Herrmann , University of ArkansasThe finding sheds a striking new light on Iron Age beliefs about the afterlife .
In this case , it was the belief that the enduring identity or " soul " of the deceased inhabited the monument on which his image was carved and on which his final words were recorded .
The stele was set against a stone wall in the corner of the small room , with its protruding tenon or " tab " still inserted into a slot in a flagstone platform .
A handsome , bearded figure , Kuttamuwa wore a tasseled cap and fringed cloak and raised a cup of wine in his right hand .
He was seated on a chair in front of a table laden with food , symbolizing the pleasant afterlife he expected to enjoy .
Beside him is his inscription , elegantly carved in raised relief , enjoining upon his descendants the regular duty of bringing food for his soul .
Indeed , in front of the stele were remains of food offerings and fragments of polished stone bowls of the type depicted on Kuttamuwa 's table .
According to Schloen , the stele vividly demonstrates that Iron Age Sam'al , located in the border zone between Anatolia and Syria , inherited both Semitic and Indo -European cultural traditions .
Kuttamuwa and his king , Panamuwa , had non-Semitic names , reflecting the migration of Indo - European speakers into the region centuries earlier under the Hittite Empire based in central Anatolia ( modern Turkey ) , which had conquered the region .

Kuttumuwa 's inscription shows a fascinating mixture of non-Semitic and Semitic cultural elements , including a belief in the enduring human soul — which did not inhabit the bones of the deceased , as in traditional Semitic thought , but inhabited his stone monument , possibly because the remains of the deceased were cremated .
Cremation was considered to be abhorrent in the Old Testament and in traditional West Semitic culture , but there is archaeological evidence for Indo - European - style cremation in neighboring Iron Age sites , although not yet at Zincirli itself .
In future excavation campaigns , the Neubauer Expedition , under Schloen 's direction , plans to excavate large areas of the site in order to understand the social and economic organization of the city and its cultural development over the centuries .
Schloen hopes to illuminate Iron
Age culture more widely , of which Zincirli provides a richly documented example .

The GreenDot Project aims to train software to recognize a person by the unique fingerprint of body language .
New York University computer science professor Chris Bregler tells me that the GreenDot Project " is DOD funded for some biometrics application , but we also applied it to lots of public figures , including the current Presidential candidates . "
From the project page :
The goal of the project is to train a computer to recognize a person based on his or her motions , and to identify the person 's emotional state , cultural background , and other attributes .
The research is federally funded ( by the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation ) , and conducted by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists , movement experts , linguists , and other specialists .
The current focus is the analysis of national and international public figures while they are giving speeches , with future plans to investigate many other domains .
The research team is building a large database of people 's motions , using cable television recordings and web video downloads .
Through techniques similar to those used in speech recognition , this project applies machine learning ( an Artificial Intelligence technique ) to train a computer system to compare the detected body language of an individual in a video , to that of a database of other subjects .

Solix Claims it Can Cut the Cost of Algae Production by 90 Percent
November 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Algae fuel has become a hot topic as of late , and now Solix Biofuels has spiced up the conversation with a claim that it can cut the cost of growing algae by 90 to 95 percent .
Algae needs carbon dioxide for food and growth .
Normally , CO2 is drawn from nearby power plants and injected into the algae tank in a costly and energy - intensive process .
But Solix claims it has created a way for CO2 to swirl inside the tank in a passive manner , thus reducing costs drastically .
Instead of using bioreactors made up of plastic bags hung from racks like many other algae fuel companies , Solix makes its bioreactors out of flat plates .
The flat shape increases the amount of light that can be absorbed by algae .
During optimal conditions , Solix estimates that it can produce 1,500 gallons per acre .
In comparison , biofuel company Amyris says it can make 600 to 800 gallons per acre .
The truthfulness of Solix ’s claims will come to light soon enough — the company is building a five - acre growth and testing facility in the coming year .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has picked Chicago superintendent of schools Arne Duncan as his nominee for secretary of education , the New York Times reported on Monday .
Duncan has seven years experience as chief executive of Chicago ’s public school system , the third largest in the country , and has earned a reputation for addressing issues including how to raise teacher quality and transform weak schools , the newspaper said on its website .
Obama has scheduled a news conference for 11:45 a.m. EST / 1645 GMT on Tuesday at an elementary school he and Duncan visited together in October 2005 .
Biometric cards are being issued to some foreign nationals from this month Women who change their name after marriage could face fines of up to £ 1,000 if they fail to tell the government , under new proposals .
Anyone with a biometric passport or ID card will be required to notify the National Identity Register of changes to the personal data it holds .
The £ 30 fixed fee for an ID card is likely to rise after 2010 , draft laws published earlier also reveal .
And people undergoing a sex change will be entitled to two ID cards .
Identity cards for foreign nationals will be issued from next week , with the first cards being issued to British citizens at the end of next year in a pilot project for airside workers at Manchester and London City airports .
The government is holding a 12 week consultation on the draft legislation , which is likely to come before Parliament in the new year in time for its implementation .
' Not punitive '
The document reveals that most people will have to pay more for ID cards than the £ 30 fixed fee previously discussed when large scale issuing of cards begins in 2011 or 2012 .
Fines will also apply if cardholders fail to report their cards lost or stolen , and will be enforceable by the civil courts .
The National Identity Scheme will bring real and recognisable benefits for British citizens
Home office
The consultation document states fines are " not intended to be punitive or revenue raising " .
Cardholders will usually have the fines waived if they agree to have their data updated when the errors emerge , officials stressed .
And they said the penalties are necessary to ensure the information on the database remains current .
Fines starting at £ 125 for the first infringement will normally only be imposed on people actively refusing to have their data updated , the Home Office said .
Homeless people
But providing false information , tampering with the register , giving out people 's data without authorisation and holding false ID documents will be a criminal offence .
Anyone found guilty of unauthorised disclosure of information on the national identity register or an ID card application , would face up to two years in prison , while anyone found guilty of hacking into the ID database could be jailed for up to 10 years .
There will be no penalties , civil or criminal , for not applying for an ID card .
Special provisions have been made for people undergoing sex changes .
Transgender people will have two cards at the same time , one for their old identity and a new one for when they have completed their sex change .
Fines will also apply if cardholders fail to report their cards lost or stolen , and will be enforceable by the civil courts .
Officials have also tried to tackle the issue of how to record the addresses of homeless people and gypsies without a fixed address .
Homeless people wanting ID cards may be able to give their home address as a bench , bus stop or park where they are often found .
Addresses will be recorded on the register but will not appear on the face of the card .
' Nasty stuff ' A spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service said : " The National Identity Scheme will bring real and recognisable benefits for British citizens by offering a more convenient way of proving identity and helping protect people from identity fraud .
" Civil penalties are not intended to be punitive or revenue raising as it will be in an individual 's best interests for their information to be accurate .
The government should do us all a favour and scrap this laminated poll tax , instead of making us all pay through the nose for it
Chris Huhne
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman
" We would always encourage people to update their information voluntarily but in some cases would apply a basic penalty of £ 125 .
" This would only increase if someone deliberately or repeatedly failed to update their details over a prolonged period of time .
The penalty would normally be cancelled as soon as the person has updated their information . "
But Phil Booth , national coordinator of NO2ID , said the proposals outlined in the document were worse than campaigners had feared .
He said : " This is a wake - up call for people who thought it was just about the card .
" There is some very nasty stuff buried in the fine print of this consultation document .
Basically , you have to tell them everything they want to know about you under threat - and pay for the privilege . "
' Draconian punishments '
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve , for the Conservatives , said the consultation document showed the ID scheme is " truly the worst of all worlds - expensive , intrusive and unworkable " .
" At a time of economic hardship , the public will be dismayed that the government plans to fine innocent people for inaccuracies on the government 's own database , using summary powers vested in the home secretary .
" The home secretary has confirmed the worst element of the scheme - a single , mammoth and highly vulnerable database exposing masses of our personal details to criminal hackers .
" Worse still , she has magnified the scope for fraud by allowing spot fines to be issued by email . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " It is becoming clear how draconian the punishments will be for those that want no part in the government 's illiberal and unnecessary identity database .
" Ministers are already admitting that people will be forced to pay more for the dubious privilege of an ID card than they originally promised .
" The government should do us all a favour and scrap this laminated poll tax , instead of making us all pay through the nose for it . "

Polls suggest Rudd is more popular now than he was this time last year
When he won the election , he was known as Kevin 07 .
But in the 12 months since , his unrelenting work ethic has earned him the nickname Kevin 24/7 , while his penchant for foreign travel has prompted others to call him Kevin 747 .
According to the Sydney Daily Telegraph , he has travelled 160,000 km ( 100,000 miles ) and has spent over 50 days out of the country .
So what has he got to show for his frequent flyer miles and infrequent breaks from work ?
A high approval rating for one - an enviable 68 % according to the latest survey of public opinion .
The polls suggest that Kevin Rudd is more popular now than he was this time last year , when he ended 11 years of conservative rule by promising risk - free change .
Judging by the polls , Australians appear to value his calm , deliberative approach to government and his unflashy style .
Plaudits Traditionally , the country has favoured trusty technocrats over bold visionaries .
Certainly , it has been a year of great symbolic accomplishment .
His deftly worded apology to Aboriginal Australians , the first act of the new parliament , carried incalculable cathartic power .
Kevin Rudd popularly apologised to Aboriginal Australians Similarly , the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol , his first act as prime minister , improved Australia 's standing in the world - it drew a standing ovation from delegates at the UN Climate Change Convention in Bali .
The decision to terminate the Pacific Solution , the practice introduced by the Howard government which held asylum seekers at detention centres on remote Pacific islands , was both symbolic and substantive .
Again , it drew plaudits at home and abroad , and marked another definitive break from the past .
Still , Kevin Rudd has faced criticisms that he lacks political courage and that he has failed to map out a bold , reforming agenda .
Many critics would like to see him leverage his personal popularity and depart from his innate cautiousness .
Efficient managerialism hardly stirs the soul .
" He 's tremendously brave at big symbolic gestures when really the opposition has crumbled away , " according to the author and journalist David Marr , a strident critic of the Howard government .
" The apology was a magnificent thing , but by the time he delivered it there was really no opposition to it any more .
" But whether he's got the courage to face big difficult decision when there 's massive opposition that 's what is left to be seen . "
Oft - heard criticism Perhaps his trickiest policy challenge is delivering an emissions trading system by 2010 .
You can't get around in Asia saying 'by the way , we borrowed the monarch of another country , the Queen of Great Britain as our head of state '
Former PM
Paul Keating Environmentalists already fear he is backtracking , and will ultimately settle on unambitious emissions targets because of his fear of hitting the vital coal and energy sector .
Other than selecting a new Governor General , Quentin Bryce , who is thought to have Republican sympathies , he has done little to " accelerate the Republican agenda " , which was an early promise .
That has disappointed his Labor predecessor , Paul Keating , who has complained that the Rudd government lacks an overarching narrative .
Mr Keating thinks Australia should ditch QE2 - as he calls the Queen - and that the failure to do so inhibits the development of a more overtly Asia - centric foreign policy .
" You can't get around in Asia saying 'by the way , we borrowed the monarch of another country , the Queen of Great Britain , as our head of state ' , " Mr Keating recently complained .
Another oft - heard criticism is that although Mr Rudd speaks fluent Mandarin he has not yet mastered plain English .
His speeches can be stultifyingly dull , peppered as they are with bullet points and acronyms .
Annabel Crabb of the Sydney Morning Herald has memorably called him " the jargon hunter " .
Second term ?
He also has an unhappy tendency to lapse into militaristic rhetoric .
On Armistice Day , as Australia remembered its war dead , Mr Rudd launched a " war on unemployment " , a rather jarring juxtaposition .
Kevin Rudd 's immediate aim is to avoid Australia slipping into recession
In parliament earlier this month , the opposition frontbencher Joe Hockey delivered one of the most effective sound - bites of the year when he reminded the prime minister that he had already launched " wars " on Japanese whalers , downloads , disadvantage , " pokie " machines , doping in sport and banking salaries .
" Prime minister , how goes the war on everything , " Mr Hockey bellowed , to uproarious laughter from the benches behind .
Sure enough , Mr Rudd has likened the global economic downturn to a " rolling national security crisis " , and knows that his political future will be determined by his economic stewardship rather than his political vision .
The immediate aim is to avoid Australia slipping into recession , something which he hopes to accomplish through massive public spending on major infrastructure projects , even if it means wiping out the government 's budget surplus .
Curiously , his public standing has improved since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , even though in the new opposition leader , Malcolm Turnbull , he now faces a formidable opponent .
Every Australian prime minister since the war has won a second term in office , which is part of the country 's conservative tradition .
The present occupant of the Lodge in Canberra is determined to extend that run .

Britain no longer has any stake in the production of its nuclear warheads after the Government secretly sold off its shares in the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Aldermaston .
Ministers agreed to sell the remaining one - third ownership to a Californian engineering company .
The announcement , which means that Americans will now produce and maintain Britain 's independent nuclear deterrent , was slipped out on the eve of the parliamentary Christmas holiday .
Officials refused to say how much the deal raised .
Opposition MPs last night expressed concern that the stake may have been sold off below market value to raise much - needed money for the Treasury .
They accused the Government of trying to conceal the sale of the stake in AWE Management Limited by failing to make an announcement in Parliament .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There was also anger that Britain would no longer directly control the site where Britain 's nuclear warheads are produced and maintained .
A terse one - paragraph statement posted on the website of the state - owned nuclear firm BNFL confirmed that its one - third stake in the Atomic Weapons Establishment ( AWE ) had been sold to the California - based Jacobs Engineering Group , a global engineering firm which already carries out work for the nuclear weapons and research establishment in Berkshire .
Yesterday , the MoD insisted that it had retained a " special share " in the establishment which allows it to intervene in the site or sack the operators if necessary .
A spokesman said the deal would protect the independence of the nuclear deterrent and ensure Britain 's strategic interests were maintained .
The Ministry of Defence owns the site and equipment at the establishment , but contractors have carried out the work of the base since 1993 .
The AWE , based at Aldermaston and Burghfield in Berkshire , employs 4,500 people and more than 2,000 contractors .
It designs , assembles , maintains and decommissions nuclear warheads , but the organisation is also a major centre for nuclear weapons research with expertise in advanced physics , materials science and super - computing .
The current contractors , a joint venture between BNFL , the business services group Serco and the American defence giant Lockheed Martin , were appointed in 2000 and will run the base until 2025 .
The successful bidder , Jacobs , is an $ 11 bn - a - year engineering concern with interests ranging from aerospace to the oil and gas industries .
Last year , it lost out in bidding to operate 10 Magnox nuclear power stations in Britain .

MPs expressed anger that Parliament had not been informed of the sale of the AWE .
The shadow Defence minister , Gerald Howarth , said : " The AWE is critical to Britain 's nuclear deterrent capability and we find it astonishing that the decision regarding the increase in US involvement in the company was not announced to Parliament .
It is now imperative that the Government spells out its understanding of the implications of this move for the United Kingdom and our nuclear deterrent . "
Richard Bacon , a Conservative member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee , said the sale needed to be urgently scrutinised : " This is the type of thing we would raise with the National Audit Office .
There are a number of economic questions , but there are national security questions . "
Nick Harvey , the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman , added : " It is staggering that the Government could do something of such strategic importance without informing Parliament .
" The whole argument used for Britain having a separate weapons establishment is that this is required by the [ nuclear ] non-proliferation treaty , as technology - sharing is not allowed .
We must therefore query the rationale of a US company having a majority shareholding in AWE ...
There has always seemed to be a lot of cloak and dagger around Aldermaston , and now it appears the Government has concealed something of huge significance from Parliament .
If the company has declared the deal is going ahead to the New York Stock Exchange , they must be fairly sure this is the case . "
Anti-nuclear campaigners claimed the sale would compromise the independence of Britain 's nuclear deterrent .
Jeremy Corbyn , the Labour MP for Islington North , called it " astonishing " , adding : " It 's almost unbelievable that something as serious as the development of nuclear weapons should be privatised to an American company . "
Kate Hudson , chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said : " It is outrageous that control of Britain 's so - called ' independent ' nuclear weapons is being handed over to American corporations . "
But a spokesman for the MoD said : " The safe operation of AWE will remain unaffected by the sale .
MoD worked closely with colleagues in the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform , and BNFL , during the sale process to ensure British strategic interests were taken into account .

This tutorial is an extension of the paperclip tutorial I put up last week .
This time we are going to take advantage of polymorphic paperclip .
Polymorphic paperclip utilizes separate tables ( an assets table and an attachings table ) to track your attachments .
This allows for an unlimited number of attachments per item per model .
In the first tutorial I showed you how to attach just one item , although you could add more columns to your table to handle additional attachments this way is a lot more flexible .
While this plugin is not perfect , there is a lot of room for improvement , its a great starting point .
Perhaps a fork is on its way from me …
Project Page : http://github.com/heavysixer/paperclippolymorph/tree/master
First things first , lets install the plugin :
script / plugin git : // github .
com / heavysixer / paperclippolymorph .
git
Lets setup our new migration that is needed .
After reading the rdoc , I noticed there was a new generator installed .
Great , this makes things even easier .
Lets verify that the generator is available for use , first run :
script / generate
This should produce a list of all generators available for use , my list below might vary from yours depending upon what plugins you have installed …
Installed Generators Plugins ( vendor / plugins ) : authenticated , forgot_password , open_id_authentication_tables , paperclip , polymorphic_paperclip , roles , rspec , rspec_controller , rspec_model , rspec_scaffold , upgrade_open_id_authentication_tables Builtin : controller , integration_test , mailer , migration , model , observer , plugin , resource , scaffold , session_migration
As you will notice there is a polymorphic_paperclip generator , go ahead an run it as follows :
script / generate polymorphic_paperclip
Before you go and run rake db : migrate , open up the migration and modify the assets_count to attachings_count – it seems there is a minor bug .
I notified the author of the plugin and will submit a patch via git .
Now its OK to run rake db: migrate
Now we have the migration generated and the tables have been added to your database .
Next we have to add ( or change if you already have paperclip setup ) the model where you want to have attachments by adding acts_as_polymorphic_paperclip .
As an example , I posted my documents model below .
class Document < ActiveRecord :: Base # Document Belongs To A User belongs_to : user # for paperclip ( polymorphic ) acts_as_polymorphic_paperclip # Validations ...
Note : Ideally I would like to be able to override the styles settings that are set in the plugins assets.rb , however I went ahead and hard coded them there to fit my needs .
Example :
class Asset < ActiveRecord :: Base has_many :attachings , : dependent => : destroy has_attached_file : data , : styles => { : thumb => " 100x100 # " , : small => " 150x150 > " , : medium => " 300x300 > " , : large => " 500x500 > " , : xlarge => " 600x600 > " , : xxlarge => " 800x800 > " }
For now , lets move onto the views where you are going to allow attachments .
We are just going to have one upload , perhaps in another tutorial we will look at handling multiple uploads .
You need to make sure you put the html => { : multipart => true } in both your edit and new views for the model you are working with .
Example in my case :
<% form_for ( @document , : html => { : multipart => true } ) do | f | %> <% = f. error_messages %> <% = render : partial => ' form ' , : locals => { :f => f } %> <% end %>
Next you need to add the file upload field to your _form or edit / new views .
< p > Attach a file or image < br /> <% = f. file_field : data %> </ p>
Now lets go ahead and make these attachments viewable in the document .
For the edit view I added the following :
< p > <% = image_tag asset .
url ( : medium ) %> </ p> < p> Tiny : <% = asset . url ( : tiny ) %> < br /> Small : <% = asset . url ( : small ) %> < br /> Medium : <% = asset . url ( : medium ) %> < br /> Large : <% = asset . url ( : large ) %> < br /> XL : <% = asset .
url ( : xlarge ) %> < br /> XXL : <% = asset . url ( : xxlarge ) %> < br /> Original : <% = asset . url %> </ p>
Other Notes :
You can use this to attach an attachment if you were going to use a different view , for example an upload view with @document.assets.attach( @asset )
You can nuke an attachment by either calling @document.assets.detach or @document.assets.detach( @asset ) depending upon how you are going about dealing with removing attachments .
@document.assets .detach will nuke ALL attachments associated with that document , @document.essay.assets.detach( @asset ) will nuke just that asset you are referencing .

Game description
Do n't Shoot The Puppy is a free puzzle game .
Lock and load a barret 50 cal automatic rifle that can take helicopters out of the sky or strafe a platoon from a distance .
Do whatever you want with the gun , just do n't shoot the puppy .
That 's right .
It 's all fun and games until a puppy gets shot , then you lose the game .
So , as I said : you have your machine gun and there is a puppy , both of these things should co-exist without ever crossing over .
For example , you can shoot your gun , but do n't shoot it AT the puppy .
This is basically all you need to know to play Do n't Shoot the Puppy .
A lot of people get confused .
They see the title and they see the game and they wonder " can I shoot the puppy ? "
I 'm here to tell you " no , do n't shoot the puppy . "
I do n't want to have to repeat myself but I understand there might be a language barrier , maybe you have a hearing problem or perhaps it 's just so ludicrous to not shoot a puppy .
But to be clear :
We will not be shooting puppies in this game .
Maybe you 've played other games where puppies are shot , and that is horrifying , but it 's not how we do things around here .
Instructions
You are the player of a game who has access to a high powered rifle .
There is also a puppy in this game .
It 's really important you do not use the high powered weapon to shoot the puppy .

BOSTON , Nov. 10 ( UPI ) -- A Boston businessman is the undercover FBI informant at the center of corruption charges against a state senator , The Boston Globe reported Monday .
The newspaper , citing multiple sources , says Ron Wilburn , 69 , a well - known business figure in Boston 's black community , is the shadowy figure seen handing cash to Dianne Wilkerson , Massachusetts ' only black state senator , on government surveillance tapes .

FBI agents say in affidavits they video - and audio - taped an unnamed confidential witness handing money to Wilkerson ostensibly for her help in obtaining a liquor license .
The witness , the Globe confirmed , is Wilburn , a longtime consultant to minority business ventures in Boston , probably best known as a 1980s associate of the late entrepreneur Bertram Lee .
The Globe said interviews with three of Wilburn 's associates confirmed its information .
Wilburn did not respond to the Globe for repeated requests for interviews .
Wilkerson has said she will resign her state senate seat in the wake of the 18 - month investigation , for which no trial date has been set , the newspaper said .

Watch it !
Retrocomputing is cool as never before .
People play C64 games in emulators and listen to SID music , but few people know much about the C64 architecture and its limitations , and what programming was like back then .
This paper attempts to give a comprehensive overview of the Commodore 64 , including its internals and quirks , making the point that classic computer systems are n’t all that hard to understand – and that programmers today should be more aware of the art that programming once used to be .
Commodore History
The company that became Commodore Business Machines was founded in 1954 by Jack Tramiel .
The company specialized on electronic calculators , and in 1976 , Commodore bought the chip manufacturer MOS Technology and decided to have Chuck Peddle from MOS evolve their KIM - 1 computer kit ( a design that demos their new MOS 6502 8 bit CPU ) into the Commodore PET series : computers with built - in monitors for the home , school and small business market that ended up competing with devices from Atari and Apple .
In 1981 , Commodore introduced the VIC - 20 , a 5 KB stripped down monitorless computer - in - the - keyboard design based on the PET for the home computer market .
This was followed by the ( incompatible ) higher - end Commodore 64 in 1982 that included more PET features , came with 64 KB of RAM ( an immense amount compared to the rest of the market ) and was very aggressively priced at US $ 595 beating the competition by a factor of two .
This was made possible by designing and building most of the system in - house .
Although some features of the C64 were taken from the PET models of the time , it had to be connected to a TV set , which only made 40 columns of text possible ( as opposed to then - current 80 columns on the PET ) .
Also , the BASIC 4.0 codebase was stripped down to the old 2.0 feature set to make it fit into 8 KB .
In the beginning , the C64 did well in the competition .
The superior but compatible C128 from 1985 did well , too , but was never more popular than the C64 , which continued to be sold .
The direct successor to the low - end VIC - 20 , the 1984 Plus / 4 and its siblings , the C16 and the C116 , failed , mostly because they were incompatible with the C64 , which at that time already had a remarkable software library .
A few years after the introduction , the C64 was still offered as a low - end alternative to the Commodore Amiga , and while it became less popular in the USA , it gained more and more popularity in Europe .
In the early 90s , when manufacturing costs of a C64 were as low as $ 25 , it gained a second life in Eastern Europe .
Production did not end until the liquidation of Commodore in 1994 .
According to the 1993 Annual Report , 17 million C64 had been produced in by then , as well as 4.5 million C128 .
Look and Feel
A C64 only needs to be connected to power and a TV set ( or monitor ) to be fully functional .
When turned on , it shows a blue - on - blue theme with a startup message and drops into a BASIC interpreter derived from Microsoft BASIC .
In order to load and save BASIC programs or use third party software , the C64 requires mass storage – either a âdatasetteâ  cassette tape drive or a disk drive like the 5.25 ″ Commodore 1541 .
Unless the user really wanted to interact with the BASIC interpreter , he would typically only use the BASIC instructions LOAD , LIST and RUN in order to access mass storage .
LOAD ” $ ” , 8 followed by LIST shows the directory of the disk in the drive , and LOAD ” filename ” , 8 followed by RUN would load and start a program .
If a tape drive is connected , LOAD and RUN will launch the first program on tape – pressing SHIFT and the RUN / STOP key has the same effect .
By default , typing characters without SHIFT will result in upper case characters being shown on the screen .
This can be changed by pressing the Commodore key and SHIFT at the same time , which switches to the upper / lower character set .
This behavior is due to the fact that the first PET only had uppercase characters , and that BASIC required keywords unshifted – but all tutorials taught them as uppercase .
This is also the reason why in Commodore ’s version of ASCII , called PETSCII , the codes for uppercase and lowercase characters are reversed .
The text based user interface is not a line editor , but a screen editor , i.e. the cursor can be moved freely on the screen , and pressing RETURN on a line with existing text will present the text to the application as if it were just typed in .
While a physical screen line is only 40 characters , the screen editor logic can extend it to a logical 80 characters – whenever a character is entered on the 40th column , the rest of the screen is moved down by one line , âopeningâ a line that extends the previous line to 80 characters .
The C64 screen editor supports selecting one out of 16 color for the foreground text by pressing the key combinations Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+8 and Commodore + 1 to Commodore +
8 .
Reverse text mode can be turned on and off with Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0 .
Ports and Connections
The C64 has a whole range of connection possibilities .
On the side , it has two 9 pin Atari - style joystick connectors that can also be used for a mouse , light pens or paddles .
On the back , there is the expansion port , which exports the complete processor bus , allowing not only game cartridges but also cartridges with I/O chips that map themselves into the CPU ’s address space – or even cartridges that completely replace the CPU .
For a conventional TV connection , there is an RCA connector that outputs an RF signal .
For monitors , there is an extra DIN connector that carries separate chroma , luma and audio signals ( although not 100 % S - Video , it is compatible with a lot of S - Video equipment ) .
For connecting Commodore compatible printers and disk drives , there is a DIN connector for the IEC bus .
There is also a dedicated connector for datasette drives .
The â User Portâ consists of several GPIO pins that can be used for custom hardware projects , or as a RS - 232 port ( with TTL levels ) , for which support exists in the ROM .
Board
On the C64 motherboard , there is a dedicated IC each for the main tasks .
There is the MOS 6510 CPU , eight 64 KBit RAM chips ( later consolidated into 2 ) , three ROM chips with KERNAL ( I/O library ) , BASIC and the character set ( KERNAL and BASIC were later consolidated ) , two 6526 CIA I/O controllers ( one for keyboard and joystick , one for the IEC bus and the user port ) , the 6581 SID sound chip , and the 6567 / 6569 VIC video chip , as well as the RAM chip that holds the 512 bytes of Color RAM .
All non-RAM chips are custom chips designed manufactured by MOS , Commodore ’s inhouse chip company .
Address Space
The 8 bit C64 design has a 16 bit address bus , allowing the CPU to address 64 KB of memory .
Since the C64 has 64 KB of RAM , filling the complete address space , ROM and I/O chips are mapped into regions of the address space that are shared with RAM :
The CPU can switch these regions between RAM and a second or third mapping .
These regions are as follows :
$ 0000 - $9FFF : RAM
$ A000 - $BFFF : RAM or BASIC ROM
$ C000 - $CFFF : RAM
$ D000 - $DFFF : RAM or memory mapped I/O chips or character ROM
$ E000 - $ FFFF : RAM or KERNAL ROM
In contrast to CPUs like the Z80 and the 8086 , and like most modern CPUs , I/O devices are memory mapped on the C64’s 6510 CPU .
The mapping is as follows :
$ D000 - $ D3 FF : VIC video controller
$ D400 - $ D7 FF : SID sound controller
$ D800 - $DBFF : Color RAM
$ DC00 - $DCFF : CIA 1 I/O controller
$ DD00 - $ DDFF : CIA 2 I/O controller
$ DE00 - $DFFF : for extensions on the expansion port
6502 CPU
The CPU inside the C64 is a 0.985 MHz ( on PAL ) MOS 6510 , which is a close derivative of the well - known 8 bit little - endian MOS 6502 .
The 6502 was introduced in 1975 by MOS Technology , a company formed earlier the same year by former Motorola engineers , with engineering headed by Chuck Peddle .
The philosophy of the 6502 was to have a reduced instruction set and a small register file , making it simpler and faster than CPUs like the Z80 at the same clock speed , as well as cheaper to manufacture .
Unlike most modern CPUs , the 6502 does not have a set of general purpose registers .
Instead , it has a single accumulator A ( for arithmetic and logic ) , two index registers X and Y ( for incrementing , decrementing and indexing memory ) and a stack pointer .
All these registers are 8 bits .
The processor status , consisting of the negative ( N ) , overflow ( V ) , break ( B ) , decimal ( D ) , interrupt ( I ) , zero ( Z ) and carry ( C ) flags is exposed as register P .
The program counter ( PC ) is 16 bits wide .
The fact that the stack pointer is 8 bit means that the stack is confined to the area between $ 0100 and $ 01 FF in the address space , i.e. the upper half of the effective stack pointer is hard - coded to $ 01 .
There is another special area in the address space :
The first 256 bytes , at $ 0000 to $ 00 FF are referred to as the zero page ( ZP ) .
Many instructions support special encodings for zero page addresses , which saves one byte in the instruction encoding as well as at least one cycle of execution time .
This can be seen as an extension of the register file to another 256 ( though external ) registers .
All opcodes are one byte , and have 0 , 1 or 2 byte operands .
The 8×8 opcode matrix is somewhat logical ( e.g. branch instructions are encoded as $ 10 , $ 30 , $ 50 , … ) , but there is no easy rule to construct the opcode table .
Nevertheless , the opcode table is a minimal encoding for optimal decoding in the 6502 ’s internal PLA ROM .
Instruction Set
The instruction set is very streamlined , and avoids redundancies .
There are load instructions ( LDA / LDX / LDY to load A , X and Y respecively ) , store instructions ( STA / STX / STY ) , read - modify - write instructions ( logic : ASL / LSR / ROL / ROR , count : INC / DEC ) , arithmetic ( ADC / SBC ; note that these always include the carry : CLC / ADC is a regular addition , and SEC / SBC is a regular subtraction , because of the one ’s complement logic ) , compare ( CMP / CPX / CPY ; these are subtractions without storing the result ) , logic ( AND / ORA / EOR , and BIT , which is AND without storing the result ) , as well as branch instructions , flag manipulation , register transfer and stack manipulation .
Addressing Modes
Each instruction supports one or more addressing modes .
Common instructions like LDA ( load accumulator ) support more addressing modes than less common ones ( BIT ) .
The immediate addressing mode is indicated with a # sign : LDA # $ 17 loads the immediate value of $ 17 into the accumulator .
Absolute addressing specifies a 16 bit address as an operand : LDA $ 0314 loads from the memory address $ 0314 .
Zero page addressing is an optimized version of absolute addressing : LDA $ 02 will read from address $ 0002 in memory , but the instruction can be encoded more tightly , and execution is faster .
Absolute - X- indexed addressing reads from a specified address , to which the contents of the X register is added .
LDA $ 0200 , X reads from the address $ 020A , in case X is $ 0A .
This allows reading from tables .
Absolute - Y - indexed is the same thing , but with the Y register .
Zero -Page - X- indexed is an optimized version of Absolute - X - indexed .
LDA $ F0,X reads from the Xth location in a table stored starting at $ 00F0 in memory .
Note that all zero page addresses will wrap around , so $ F0 + $ 10 = $ 00 .
Zero -Page - Y - indexed is the same thing , but with the Y register .
Zero - Page - X- indexed - indirect adds X to a specified zero page address , reads a 16 bit pointer from the resulting address and finally accesses memory at that address .
So LDA ( $ 80,X ) will read from an address specified by the array of pointers at $ 0080 and the index X into the array .
This addressing mode is rarely used .
Zero -Page - indirect - Y- indexed treats two consecutive bytes in zero page as an address and adds Y to the address .
LDA ( $ 14 ) , Y will read from $ E020 , if the address stored at $ 14/$ 15 is $ E000 and Y is $ 20 .
This addressing mode is the most convenient way to work with pointers , as no register can hold 16 bits .
Register Transfer and Stack
There are several 1 byte instructions without operands that move data between registers .
TAX , TXA , TAY and TYA move between A , X and Y. TSX and TXS copies between X and the stack pointer .
The stack pointer always points to the next address that is written to .
This means that an empty stack has a stack pointer of $ FF , and pushing a value first writes the value and then decrements the stack pointer .
The 6502 can move the accumulator from and to the stack ( PHA / PLA ) , as well as the processor status P ( PHP / PLP ) .
Control Transfer
Next to the absolute JMP instruction , there is an indirect version that jumps over a vector ( e.g. JMP ( $ FFFC ) ) .
JSR ( jump to subroutine ) only has an absolute version , and stores the address of the next instruction minus one on the stack .
RTS ( return from subroutine ) takes the address from the stack , adds one , and moves it into the program counter .
The âminus oneâ logic was chosen because it could save one cycle in the implementation of JSR .
A hardware interrupt , unless disabled by a set interrupt ( I ) flag , pushes the address of the next instruction minus one ( just like JSR ) , pushes the processor status afterwards , disables interrupts , and jumps over the vector at $ FFFE / $ FFFF . RTI return from interrupt ) is the same as the combination of PLP and RTS .
BRK causes a software interrupt and behaves the same as a hardware interrupt , except that it sets the B flag in the processor status on the stack to 1 ( a hardware interrupt sets it to 0 ) .
Note that the B flag does not exist in the actual processor status register , the corresponding bit is only used in a status byte on the stack .
From a software perspective , NMIs behave the same as IRQs , but they cannot be masked , and they use the $ FFFA / $ FFFB vector .
The reset vector is at $ FFFC / $ FFFD .
Flags and Branches
All load and logic instructions set N and Z accordingly , shift instructions also modify C , and arithmetic instructions touch N V , Z and C. The D ( decimal ) , I ( interrupt disable ) and C flags can be set and cleared programmatically ( CLD / SED , CLI / SEI , CLC / SEC ) , while the V flag can only be cleared ( CLV ) .
Conditional branches are possible based on the value of the negative ( BPL / BMI ) , overflow ( BVC / BVS ) , zero ( BNE / BEQ ) and carry ( BCC / BCS ) flags .
Branches encode an 8 bit relative offset and can therefore reach code in the area of +127 and - 128 , counting from the byte after the branch instruction .
Since a compare is the same as a subtraction , BCC is a branch on ( unsigned ) below , and BCS is a branch on above - or - equal .
NOP
NOP ( no operation ) does nothing .
Its encoding is $ EA .
Decimal Mode
If the D flag is set , all ADC and SBC operations will be BCD - adjusted afterwards , i.e. $ 09+$ 02 wo n’t be $ 0B , but $ 11 , since 9+2=11 .
The BCD correction circuit has been patented in US patent 3,991,307 .
Cycle Counting
It is quite straightforward to find out how many cycles an instruction takes .
As a rule of thumb , an instruction takes as many cycles as the number of memory fetches it has to perform , but at least two .
Therefore , single - byte opcodes ( one byte fetches ; NOP / TAX / INX etc. ) as well as instructions with immediate operands take two cycles .
Zero page instructions take three memory accesses ( opcode , address , data ) , so they are three cycles .
Absolute instructions take four accesses ( opcode , address low , address high , data ) , so they are four cycles .
Read - modify - write instructions ( INC / DEC / shift / rotate ) are an exception :
They require 4 memory accesses for the zero page case and 5 otherwise , but they take 5 and 6 cycles , respectively .
Branches take 3 cycles if they are taken and two if they are not taken .
And extra cycle has to be added if the branch crosses a page boundary .
JMP is 3 , push is 3 , pull is 4 , JSR and RTS are 6 each .
All other timings can be looked up in the 6502 ’s reference , but they are very easy to memorize .
Common Tricks
The BIT instruction exists in a two - byte ( immediate operand ) and three - byte ( absolute operand ) variant .
Since BIT only changes the flags , it effectively skips one or two bytes in the instruction stream .
This can be used to replace a two - byte branch or a three - byte JMP with a one - byte BIT if only one or two bytes have to be skipped .
The architecture allows safe self - modifying code , so a common optimization for copy loops is to use LDA $ nn00 , X and STA $ mm00 ,X , looping X from $ 00 to $ FF and then incrementing the bytes that encode nn and mm for the next page .
Compared to a LDA ( zp1 ) , Y : STA ( zp2 ) , Y sequence , this gets the inner loop down from 16 cycles ( 5 LDA , 6 STA , 2 INY , 3 BNE ) to 14 ( 4 LDA , 5 STA , 2 INY , 3 BNE ) .
A PHA / PLA combination is 7 cycles , while an STA / LDA combination in the zero page is 6 cycles , so unless there is no free zero page space , PHA / PLA should be avoided to quickly store a value .
Using an absolute store to write the value into the operand of a future immediate load ( i.e. self modification ) is the same speed at the zero page solution , but does not waste zero page space .
An elegant way to store a flag is to have it in bit # 7 of a zero page address .
While a load / store combination has to be used to set the flag ( or the slower , but register - preserving SEC / ROR combination ) , it can be cleared with a simple LSR ( 5 cycles ) and tested with BIT ( 3 cycles ) , without affecting register contents .
Since the 6502 is so register starved , only 3 bytes can be passed to a subroutine in registers .
Also , the stack is small , and accessing it is slow , so stack frames as seen on modern architectures are very uncommon .
Many applications and libraries ( e.g. GEOS ) use a dedicated area in the zero page as virtual registers .
The 6502 has no instructions for multiplication , division or floating point arithmetic .
Most 6502 - based computers have a BASIC interpreter in ROM though , and they typically include a math and floating point library .
Bugs and Quirks
The original 6502 implementation has a series of bugs and other anomalies that have never been fixed in MOS chips ( not counting the 65CE02 , which was only used in Amiga peripherals ) .
The indirect version of JMP loads the program counter from the wrong address , if the vector ’s address lies on a page boundary : JMP ( $ 23 FF ) will read the address from $ 23 FF and $ 2300 instead of $ 23 FF and $ 2400 .
When in decimal mode , the negative flag reflects the original binary result , not the effective decimal result .
If a software interrupt ( BRK ) and a hardware interrupt occur at the same time , the BRK is dropped .
STA with the absolute - indexed addressing mode takes first reads from the absolute address without the index register added , and then reads again from the correct address .
LDX # $ 07 STA $ DC0D ,X will first read from $ DC0D , discard the result , and then write to $ DC14 .
On the C64 , this read form $ DC0D would ACK all pending CIA 1 interrupts , while it is only supposed to write to $ DC14 .
Read - modify - write instructions with absolute addresses first read the value , but one cycle before they store the result , they store the original value again .
On a C64 , this can be seen when incrementing the screen border color at a defined area of the screen , as every write to the register will cause a tiny gray dot on the screen ( on later HMOS versions of the VIC ) .
When this is used with certain I / O ports , this can have other side effects .
The latter two quirks have been used heavily for obfuscating copy protection software .
Instruction decoding in the 6502 is done by a PLA that compares the current cycle number within the instruction and the current opcode against a ROM of 130 mask lines , of which any number can fire independently .
The outputs of these lines are then fed into components like the ALU , bus control , register control and program counter logic .
The instruction set only consists of 151 defined opcodes , and since handling the remaining 105 opcodes as NOPs or traps would have required extra lines in the PLA , they will match against some lines that were meant for instructions with similar opcodes .
Some of these âillegal opcodesâ lead to useful results and are used in some software ( SAX = store A & X ) , but most of the instructions make little sense ( LAS = loads from memory , ANDs it with S and stores it into A , X and S ) , and some even lock up the CPU , disabling IRQs and NMIs ( CRA / KIL ) .
The MOS 6510
Except for the pin layout , the MOS 6510 that is used in the C64 differs from the generic MOS 6502 in two ways :
It can make the bus tri-state when not used , so the VIC can use it , and it has a 6 bit I / O port built in , which can be controlled using zero page locations 0 and 1 .
In register 0 , each bit from 0 - 5 set it to output if 1 , and to input if 0 .
Bits 0 - 5 in register 1 are the actual I /O pins .
On the C64 , bits 0 - 2 are outputs and control bank switching , they turn the ROMs and the I/O area on and off .
Bits 3 - 5 go to the tape connector and control the motor and the data sent to the head , and detect whether a key on the tape deck is pressed .
BASIC
Microsoft had a strong position in the market for ( mostly ROM ) BASIC interpreters in 8080 - based home computers when the MOS 6502 was released in 1975 , so they rewrote their interpreter in 6502 assembly .
Microsoft BASIC was pure 6502 code with a minimal character I/O interface to the machine ’s âmonitorâ , i.e. I /O library .
Commodore decided to license the interpreter for the 1977 PET and extended it slightly to interface with their disk and tape libraries .
Commodore BASIC was very buggy , so they went back to Microsoft for an update , which , with the Commodore changes re-applied , shipped in newer PETs as BASIC V2 .
For version 4 , Commodore added several instructions for more conveniently dealing with disk .
Being a low - end machine , Commodore took the bugfixed BASIC V4 codebase and removed all features after V2 , making it independent of the machine ’s graphics and sound features again , and fitting it back into 8 KB , and shipped this version on the VIC - 20 .
The Commodore 64 got the almost exact same version , but it runs at a different memory address ( $ A000 - $ BFFF ) .
Microsoft BASIC is a line - based editor , that is , lines can be shown with the LIST command , and they can be modified by re-typing them .
This integrates nicely with the KERNAL screen editor :
The cursor can be moved up to LISTed lines , the lines can be modified , and when RETURN is pressed , the whole line is fed into BASIC again .
A nice feature of this and later versions of Commodore BASIC is the fact that all important parts , like the tokenizer , the detokenizer and the interpreter loop jump over a jump table in RAM before they do their work , allowing the user to extend BASIC arbitrarily .
The most well - known BASIC extension is Simons ’ BASIC , a cartridge that maps 8 KB of extra ROM at $ 8000 - $9 FFF .
KERNAL
The C64 has an 8 KB I/O library at $ E000 - $ FFFF which is utilized by BASIC , but is intended to be used by other applications as well .
All Commodore 8 bit systems have a standardized library call interface in the form of jump tables at the very top of memory that call into machine - specific functions for I/O .
KERNAL is started form the RESET vector , initializes the machine , sets up an interrupt service routine that handles the keyboard , animates the cursor and does the real time clock .
The C64 has a hardware clock in each of the CIA chips , but KERNAL has not been updated to use this feature since the VIC - 20 .
KERNAL provides an abstract character I /O interface to a number of devices .
All devices support open , read , write and close .
The open call takes three parameters :
The logical file number ( there is a maximum of 16 channels ) , the device number and the secondary address .
There are 32 device numbers statically assigned to the devices .
The 8 bit secondary address can signal something to the device , like speed or an operation mode .
Some devices ( tape and IEC ) support an optional filename .
Device 0 is the keyboard .
While KERNAL exports raw key presses , the keyboard can also be accessed through character I/O , which will go through the screen editor and replay all characters on the screen that are in the line of the cursor , regardless of whether the user typed them or they had been there before .
Device 1 is the tape drive .
KERNAL reads and writes blocks of data at a time and buffers them for character I/O .
Device 2 is RS - 232 .
KERNAL contains a very sophisticated ( but rarely used ) software RS - 232 implementation that supports up to 2400 baud .
Device 3 is the screen .
KERNAL interprets special codes , manages the cursor position and handles scrolling .
Devices 4 and greater will be directed to the IEC bus .
By convention , devices 4 to 7 are printers and plotters , and devices 8 to 30 are floppy drives or hard disks .
KERNAL allows interacting with the IEC bus manually by sending TALK and LISTEN requests to the bus .
GEOS
While KERNAL is a minimal character - based operating system in ROM , there is also a disk - based operating system with a graphical user interface for the C64 .
GEOS was released by Berkeley Softworks in 1986 and Commodore bundled it with the C64 for some time .
The GUI , which can be controlled by a joystick or a mouse , runs in 320×200 graphics mode and resembles early versions of MacOS .
GEOS is a 16 KB library that includes an optimized disk interface ( faster , support for timstamps , icons and multi- fork â VLIRâ files ) , library code for drawing to the screen , high level UI primitives for menus , buttons and dialog boxes ( with callbacks ) and a simple memory swapping facility .
Furthermore GEOS allows input and printer driver plugins , as well as proportional fonts in different sizes .
Internally , GEOS has a jump table to its library routines that consists of about 150 entries .
GEOS came with applications like GeoPaint and GeoWrite ; Berkeley Softworks themselves offered solutions like GeoPublish and GeoCalc , and more software was available from third parties .
GEOS ’ only requirement is a 1541 disk drive , but a 3.5 ″ 1581 drive , a RAM extension or one of the later hard drives helped speed it up a lot .
6526 CIA
The C64 has two identical 6526 CIAs ( Complex Interface Adapter ) that are mostly used for I/O .
One CIA features 16 general purpose I /O pins ( 8 bit port A and 8 bit port B ) that can be used either as an input or an output , two programmable timers and a real - time - clock .
The timers have 16 bit counters and count down by one either on each clock cycle , or on an external event , or on a timer A underflow ( in the case of timer B ) .
This allows concatenating the timers to one 32 bit timer .
On an underflow , the CIA can be programmed to cause an IRQ or to send data through a serial shift register .
The CIA also supports receiving data through a shift register .
The real - time - clock has a resolution of 1/10 of seconds and supports generating interrupts at a certain time .
CIA 1 is hooked up to the keyboard and the joystick ports .
Since the keyboard consists of 64 keys ( plus SHIFT LOCK , which is parallel to the left SHIFT key , and RESTORE , which is directly connected to the CPU ’s NMI line ) , these can be laid out in a 8×8 matrix of lines , key presses connecting the intersections .
One side of the matrix is connected to port A ( output ) , and the perpendicular side is connected to port B ( input ) .
The keyboard driver can now write the values of $ 01 , $ 02 , $ 04 etc. in port A and test the input of port B to see which keys are pressed .
The two joysticks are connected in parallel to port A and port B , so they can cause spurious keyboard events .
CIA 2 is hooked up to the IEC bus , and I/O lines control the VIC bank .
The rest is exposed on the user port , and can be used for RS - 232 .
KERNAL uses CIA 1 for the 60 Hz system timer , but , apart from the ports , does n’t use any of the extra features of either CIA .
6581 SID
The SID ( Sound Interface Device ) is a whole topic of its own .
6567/6569 VIC
The video chip inside the C64 is called the MOS 6567 / 6569 VIC - II ( Video Interface Controller ) – the video chip in the VIC - 20 had been the original VIC , and was the reason for the marketing name of the VIC - 20 .
The VIC supports a 40 × 25 text mode , a 320×200 bitmap mode , 16 colors and 8 sprites – all of these features have lots of sub-modes and options .
The amount of memory the VIC can address is 16 KB , and while by default , it accesses the first 16 KB of the C64 RAM , it can be configured to use any of the four banks .
The 16 colors of the VIC are divided into two sets of eight .
The first eight are the more important colors , as some modes only support the first eight .
The colors are , in the original order : black , white , red , cyan , purple , green , blue , yellow , orange , brown , pink , dark gray , gray , light green , light blue and light gray .
Character Mode
The C64 has two built - in character sets that the VIC can access .
They can be shown on the screen by writing the numbers 0 to 255 into screen RAM ( at $ 0400 by default ) .
The default font has uppercase characters and lots of line - drawing symbols in the lower 128 characters , and the second half consists of the same characters , but inverse .
The alternative font has upper - and lowercase characters and omits some of the symbols .
The foreground color of the characters can be changed by writing the color numbers into the Color RAM , which is located at $ D800 - $ DBFF .
There is one byte per character , but only the lower 4 bits are actually preserved by Color RAM .
Each character is 8×8 pixels , and stored as eight bytes in the character ROM ( or RAM , if a user - defined character set is enabled ) , one line being one byte .
A 1 - bit will take the color from the Color RAM ( $ D800 - $ DBFF ) , and a 0 bit will take it from the global background color register ( $ D021 ) .
The pixel matrix is determined by looking up the character index in the screen RAM ( at $ 0400 - $ 07 FF by default ) and consequently looking up the pattern the current character set ( the VIC sees the default font at $ 1000 , although for the 6502 it is invisible there ) .
In Extended Color Mode ( ECM ) , it is possible to chose between one of four background colors ( registers $ D021 to $ D024 ) with the upper two bits of the character index , but then only 6 bits will be used to look up the character pattern , decreasing the number of possible characters to 64 .
The built - in ( uppercase ) character set is well - suited for this :
While it is similar to the ASCII encoding , it has the uppercase characters mapped to codes $ 01 to $ 1A , so the most important characters are within the first $ 40 .
Multi-Color Character
Mode allows up to four colors per character and is intended for tile - based games , like platformers .
If bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is 0 , then the character gets displayed just like in non-multicolor mode , but colors are restricted to the first eight .
If bit 3 is 1 , then pairs of horizontally adjacent bits are combined in their meaning : 00 represents the screen background ( $ D021 ) , 01 is the second background register ( $ D022 ) , 10 is the third background register ( $ D023 ) , and 11 is the color specified in bits 0 - 2 of the Color RAM .
Pixels in these characters are twice as wide , so the resolution of a character is 4×8 .
Bitmap Mode
In hi-res graphics mode , the VIC supports a resolution of 320×200 , which uses the same pixel frequency as 40 × 25 character mode ( 40*8=320 , 25*8=200 ) .
The bitmap can reside at $ 0000 or $ 2000 , and the VIC reads one byte for 8 pixels .
But hi-res mode does not only support monochrome graphics :
The foreground and background colors of each 8× 8 tile are taken from the high and low nibble of screen RAM , which would otherwise be unused .
Color RAM is not used in this mode .
The encoding of the bitmap is identical to the encoding of a character set , making it a non-linear framebuffer :
The first eight bytes of the bitmap represent the pixels in the tile at character position ( 0,0 ) , the second eight bytes represent the tile at character position ( 1,0 ) , which is pixel position ( 8,0 ) , and so on .
This layout makes pixel addressing in software slower .
In Multi-Color Bitmap Mode , the horizontal resolution is halved to 160×200 , and pixels are twice the width .
Every set of two bits in the encodes one of four colors per tile : 00 takes it from the global background register ( $ D021 ) , 01 and 10 take it from the upper and lower nibble of screen RAM , respectively , and 11 takes it from Color RAM .
Scrolling
The VIC supports hardware X and Y scrolling by 0 to 7 pixels .
Since the 40th column is half visible and another column left of the first column is half - visible when the horizontal shift register is set to e.g. 4 , a 41th column would be needed .
Instead , it is possible to switch the screen to 38 column mode , i.e. the whole screen is a little narrower , and more border is shown on the left and on the right .
The screen can also be switched from 25 to 24 lines the same way .
Sprites
The VIC has eight hardware sprites ( also called MOBs , movable objects ) .
Each sprite is 24 × 21 pixels , which is encoded in 63 bytes .
Set bits will be drawn in the sprite ’s individual foreground color , and cleared bits will be transparent .
The index to the sprite ’s bitmap data in memory is an 8 bit value that is read from the last 8 bytes of screen RAM – since the screen is only 1000 characters , the last 24 characters of the $ 0400=1024 bytes area would otherwise be unused .
There is also a multicolor mode for sprites , which makes pixels twice as wide and decreases the horizontal resolution to 12 pixels .
In this mode , 00 is still transparent , and 10 encodes the sprite ’s individual color .
The codes 01 and 11 take the color out of the sprite multicolor registers ( $ D025 and $ D026 ) , which are shared among all sprites .
Sprites can be positioned at arbitrary pixel positions on the screen , and overlap .
In this case , sprites with lower numbers have priority over sprites with higher numbers .
Each sprite can either be shown in front or behind background pixels .
Sprites can be X - and Y - expanded by a factor of two , and collision of two sprites or of a sprite and background pixels is detected by hardware :
Whenever two non-transparent sprite pixels are drawn at the same position on the screen , they have collided .
Whenever a non-background pixel is drawn by the character generator at the same position where a non-background pixel of a sprite is draw , the sprite has collided with the background .
An exception from this rule is the 01 code in the character data , which also counts as background .
This way , a background picture can be constructed that does not cause collisions in certain areas .
In practice , most newer games do not use the hardware functionality , but instead test for overlapping sprite bounding boxes in software .
Memory Layout
The VIC can address 16 KB at a time .
All VIC data structures can be stored anywhere in these 16 KB , but they have to be aligned to their size .
The screen RAM is $ 0400 bytes in size and can be at $ 0000 , $ 0400 , …
The character set is $ 0800 bytes , and can be at $ 0000 , $ 0800 , …
The bitmap is $ 2000 bytes and can be at $ 0000 or $ 2000 .
Sprites are $ 40 bytes , and can be at $ 0000 , $ 0040 , …
Two GPIO pins of the second 6526 CIA are connected to bits 6 and 7 of RAM when the VIC accesses it .
By changing the lower 2 bits of $ DD02 , the VIC can be switched between banks $ 0000 - $ 3FFF ( 11 ) , $ 4000 - $ 7FFF ( 10 ) , $ 8000 - $ BFFF ( 01 ) and $ C000 - $ FFFF ( 00 ) .
If the VIC is set to banks $ 0000 or $ 8000 , then the two built - in character sets shadow RAM in the area of $ 1000 - $ 1 FFF .
This means that the built - in character set can be used on those banks without occupying RAM , but it also means that the area from $ 1000 - $ 1FFF cannot be used for bitmap , screen RAM or sprite data either .
For timing reasons , color information is not taken from main RAM , but from a dedicated Color RAM .
These $ 0400 half - bytes are accessible to the C64 at $ D800 - $ DBFF and can not be bank switched .
Timing
For advanced VIC programming , it is necessary to not just set up a certain mode and have the VIC display it , but to reprogram the VIC while it is drawing the picture .
For this , it is necessary , to understand its timing .
While the pixels within the screen area are 320 by 200 , the VIC actively draws pixels in the border color outside of this area , which ( on PAL ) is 403×284 pixels .
Analog TV standards specify an H blank area at the end of every line , and V blank area at the end of every screen .
So counting this timing as pixels , this gives an absolute resolution of 504×312 pixels .
The interesting and very useful connection about the pixel clock and the system clocks is that an 8 pixel character is drawn every system clock cycle , i.e. about 1 million times a second .
The 504 horizontal pixels therefore mean that a line is drawn on the screen every 63 cycles .
With this information , it is possible to do cycle - exact timing of assembly code to switch a VIC register at an 8 pixel granularity .
Further timing details ( badlines , sprite timing ) , as well as the application of this information to do tricks like FLD , FLI and AGSP would go beyond the scope of this article , but are talked about in the presentation at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress .
Memory Configuration
In a running system with BASIC and KERNAL , the BASIC and KERNAL ROMs are turned on and visible at $ A000 - $ BFFF and $ E000 - $ FFFF respectively , and at $ D000 - $ DFFF , the I/ O area is visible .
Using the 3 lowest bits in the processor port at address 1 , this configuration can be altered .
The ROMs can be turned off , revealing RAM instead , and the I/ O area can be configured to show either RAM or the character set ROM .
Note that writing to ROM will always direct the data to the underlying RAM .
In practice , many programs run in the default configuration and use both KERNAL library routines , as well as functions in BASIC , to keep their own code as small as possible .
More recent programs and almost all games turn off all of ROM , to get direct control of the interrupt vector without having to go though the KERNAL handler first .
The I/ O area is typically configured to show the I/O registers and Color RAM , and only rarely switched to a different configuration to temporarily access the RAM underneath .
A few applications read the character ROM at program start and modify the copy .
The C64 supports another ROM bank at $ 8000 - $9FFF , which can only be serviced by an external cartridge connected to the expansion port .
Also , the $ A000 - $ BFFF bank can be overridden by an external ROM .
If KERNAL detects the magic string â CBM80 â at $ 8004 on startup , it will jump to the code of the cartridge right away .
Expansion port cartidges can also put the C64 into “ ULTIMAX ” mode , in which the it can play game cartridges for the failed C64 - based stripped down “ ULTIMAX ” system ( “ Commodore MAX ” , “ VC - 10 ” ) :
All internal ROM is disabled , $ 8000 - $9FFF and $ E000 - $ FFFF show external ROM , RAM is only visible at $ 0000 - $0FFF , and the VIC has a different view on the address space .
This mode is used by freezer cartridges which can use it to replace the $ E000 - $ FFFF bank and thus override the hardware vectors .
Tape Interface
The tape interface consists of a single line each for data input and output , motor control and key sense .
The raw data is read from and written to the data lines , and all encoding and decoding of the data stream is done in software .
3 of the required lines are connected to the processor port at zero page location 1 , and one ( data input ) is connected to CIA 2 .
IEC Bus
The IEC bus is a serial version of the IEEE - 488 bus used on the PET .
Devices on the IEC bus are daisy - chained , and are all connected to the same three lines : ATN ( attention ) , clock and data .
IEC has a single bus master , which is the computer .
It is the only device to ever raise ATN , while every device can output to clock and data , depending on the state of the bus .
If the computer raises ATN , every device on the bus listens for the command which includes the 5 bit device number ( 0 - 30 ) and compares it with its own .
The protocol on who sends and who receives is determined by the computer sending TALK / UNTALK and LISTEN / UNLISTEN commands .
While KERNAL exports the interface at this level , it also allows high - level open , close , read and write operations on the IEC bus , as well as load and save operations .
The BASIC LOAD and SAVE commands are directly hooked up to this interface .
The IEC bus was designed for the serial shift register in the VIA ( Versatile Interface Adapter ) of the VIC - 20 and its disk drive , but it turned out that the VIA had a bug that made the shift register unusable , so the IEC protocol had to be implemented in software .
While the C64 has CIAs , in which the bug has been fixed , the 1541 still used VIAs .
It was n’t until the C128 ( in its native mode only ) that the computer could talk to the floppy drive ( Commodore 1570 / 1571/1581 ) in its intended speed .
1541 Disk Drive
The Commodore 1541 Disk Drive is the most common disk drive used with the C64 .
It uses 5.25 ″ SS / DD ( single side , double density ) disks , but disks can be flipped , and the other side can be used as well , if the disks are double sided .
The 1541 does not use the index hole , and uses software markers ( SYNC ) instead to be able to tell the start of a sector .
Due to reliability problems of early drives , the 1541 only uses 35 out of the 40 possible tracks on a 5.25 ″ disk .
The tracks have a variable number of 256 byte sectors , ranging from 21 on the outside to 17 on the inside .
The data is written in 4 different speeds .
This makes an overall 683 sectors , or 174,848 bytes .
The file system is stored on track 18 .
Track 18 , sector 0 contains the disk name and the BAM ( block availability map ) , which stores one bit per sector ( 1 = free ) .
Track 18 , sector 1 is the first sector containing directory entries :
There are eight 32 byte entries per sector , with a maximum filename length of 16 characters .
The first two bytes of a directory sector point to the next directory entry sector .
The files on disk are also stored as a linked list .
The first two bytes of every sector are either the track and sector number of the next block , or the first byte is 0 and the second byte is the number of valid bytes in this sector .
The 1541 is a stripped down version of the PET drive series , which had a parallel connection , and contained two 6502 CPUs :
One for doing the filesystem and communicating with the computer , and one for reading data from disk and writing data to it , as well as encoding and decoding the data .
The 1541 only has a single 6502 CPU running at 1 MHz , which ( using timer IRQs ) regularly switches itself between the two modes .
The two virtual CPUs still communicate with each other using a messaging interface in the zero page .
The 1541 has 2 KB of RAM at $ 0000 - $ 07FF .
The 1541 has two VIA I/O controllers at $ 1800 ( for the IEC bus ) and at $ 1C00 ( for the drive ) .
The firmware is located at $ C000 - $ FFFF .
Since loading an application or a game takes minutes on an unmodified C64 , several â floppy speedersâ appeared ( either as software on disk or built into applications , as ROM extension cartridges , or as internal replacement ROMs ) , that consisted of implementations of more optimized protocols for the IEC bus for both the C64 and the 1541 .
The 1541 code was uploaded using the old bus protocol .
Such a new protocol would for example not do a handshake on every bit using the clock line , but shift a complete byte through in 4 steps , two bits at a time , using the clock and data line at the same time .
This would of course only work if both CPUs were not interrupted .
VIC timing on the C64 side could already affect this , so many floppy speeders turned off the screen while loading .
Other Peripherals
The 1541 is the necessary companion to a C64 .
It can be replaced by a 1570 ( 1541 with fast bus routines for the C128 ) or a 1571 ( double - sided 1570 ) , since they include a 1541 compatibility mode .
The 3.5 ″ Commodore 1581 , which supports 880 KB per disk , can hardly be a replacement for a 1541 , because most applications contain their own floppy speeders that make lots of assumptions on the exact on - disk format .
For GEOS , it can be very useful though .
Creative Micro Devices sold and continues to sell a line of hard drives that have an IEC connection but contain a 3.5 ″ SCSI drive inside .
Although they have a 6502 CPU built in and allow code execution on their CPU , they are not compatible enough to replace a 1541 either .
Several memory extension cartridges exist for the expansion port of the C64 : The Commodore REU ( contains a DMA chip that transfers data between itself and main RAM ) , as well as the third party GeoRAM ( maps a block to the $ DE00 - $ DFFF area ) and RAMLink ( battery backed , designed as RAM disk ) .
Freezer cartridges like the Action Replay and the Final Cartridge were not only popular because they could dump all of memory to disk and thus copy certain copy - protected games , but also because they featured floppy speeders that disabled the original routines directly at startup time , without any effort from the user .
In the mid 90s , CPU speeders for the expansion port became popular .
The 8 MHz Flash 8 is rare today , but many enthusiasts have a SuperCPU , which replaces the onboard CPU with a 20 MHz 65C816 , which has a native 16 bit mode that can address up to 16 MB or RAM .
There are a few applications and games that require a SuperCPU .
The speedup of GEOS with a SuperCPU is significant .
In the 2000s , the enthusiast scene created all kinds of peripherals , like ethernet interfaces , IDE interfaces and SD card readers .
And there are not only peripherals :
In 2004 , the Commodore 64 DTV , a reimplemented C64 appeared in the form of a Joystick .
The device is fairly compatible and can be extended to connect to a keyboard and a 1541 .
Whoa .
This is big .
Attorney General and former Governor of California Jerry Brown says prop 8 is invalid .
Yesterday Brown filed a legal brief claiming the same - sex marriage ban , which would amend the California Constitution to include discrimination and gays and lesbian couples , " is itself unconstitutional because it deprives a minority group of a fundamental right . "
Why is this so dramatic ?
Basically , Jerry Brown 's job is to defend the state 's laws .
But he was in a tricky position because prop 8 might violate the constitution .
So , which one should he defend ?
The equal protection clause or prop 8 ?
It seems like an easy decision to us -- you have to defend equal protection ; it would be nuts if the state suddenly turned against its decades of support for nondiscrimination laws .
Then again , it 's a messy , complex issue that is beyond radioactive , politically speaking .
The people who want to limit equal protection will argue that this is n't fair ; that Brown is ignoring the will of the voters in the last election , and that they deserve to have prop 8 defended .
However , there are loads of other lawyers ready to defend prop 8 .
And Jerry is defending the will of the voters -- fifty years ' worth of will that is plainly evident in California 's pioneering protection of civil equality .
Brown , we should point out , is also thinking about making a run for the governor chair .
Again .
That said , we have n't been this proud of the state of California since the election .
Way to go , Golden State .

Elisabeth Hasselbeck Critiques Sarah Palin's Wardrobe on Stump ( Video )
, staunch Republican and co-host of The View , stumped within Florida on Sunday .
Hasselbeck and Palin hooked up for a day of campaign stops where the subject of the candidates wardrobe was one of Hasselbeck 's talking points .
Speaking of wardrobe , Elisabeth designed the t- shirt that she is wearing in the above photo .
She took some flack for wearing it on the show recently .
Apparently her co-hosts did n't think she should be advertising for her candidate of choice .
Today Hasselbeck gave a ' sassy ' and impassioned spiel that is sure to be fodder for Joy Behar on tomorrow morning 's ABC network show .
It promises to be ' Must See TV ' .
She called recent Palin wardrobe criticism " deliberately sexist " .
Check out the videos below .
The first is a brief Hasselbeck critique of Sarah Palin 's wardrobe .
The second has Elisabeth taking a few comedic jabs at The View and then is followed up with Palin commenting on the whole wardrobe snafu .
The full nature of the Palin governorship emerges :
The Branchflower report ... makes for good reading , if only because it convincingly answers a question nobody had even thought to ask :
Is the Palin administration shockingly amateurish ?
Yes , it is .
Disturbingly so .
The 263 pages of the report show a co-ordinated application of pressure on Monegan so transparent and ham - handed that it was almost certain to end in public embarrassment for the governor ...
Monegan consistently emerges as the adult in these conversations , while the Palin camp displays a childish impetuousness and sense of entitlement .
The Palin pick - as reckless as it was unvetted - disqualifies McCain from the presidency .
More remarkable details from Time 's Nathan Thornburgh after the jump :
A harsh verdict ?
Consider the report 's findings .
Not only did people at almost every level of the Palin administration engage in repeated inappropriate contact with Walt Monegan and other high - ranking officials at the Department of Public Safety , but Monegan and his peers constantly warned these Palin disciples that the contact was inappropriate and probably unlawful .
Still , the emails and calls continued in at least one instance on recorded state trooper phone lines .
The state 's head of personnel , Annette Kreitzer , called Monegan and had to be warned that personnel issues were confidential .
The state 's attorney general , Talis Colberg , called Monegan and had to be reminded that the call was putting both men in legal jeopardy , should Wooten decide to sue .
The governor 's chief of staff met with Monegan and had to be reminded by Monegan that , " This conversation is discoverable ...
You do n't want Wooten to own your house , do you ? "

World hunger seems like one of those grand unsolvable problems – the perennial favorite wish of beauty pageant queens .
The truth is , it ’s not unsolvable at all .
The United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) stated that it would only take $ 30 billion a year to launch the necessary agricultural programs to completely solve global food insecurity .
( Severe hunger afflicts 862 million people annually . )
$ 30 billion sounds like a lot of money , but considering we ’ve just bailed out Wall Street to the tune of nearly a trillion , it ’s trifling .
After I did a little digging , all I could think was …really ?
$ 30 billion is all we need to end world hunger ?
That ’s it ?
I thought such a major goal would require some unreachable , vast sum .
Here are six things I learned we ’re doing with that money instead .
Global military and arms trade expenditures hit high at about $ 1 trillion annually .
Approximately $ 540 billion is spent by the United States alone .
( I do n’t mean to single out defense here , but …wow ! )
The United States Department of Energy spends $ 23.4 billion yearly just to develop and maintain nuclear warheads .
How could we forget the recent $ 700 ( and growing ) billion housing bailout bill ?
In other words , 4 % of the Wall Street bailout would end world hunger .
The U.S. Congress has approved $ 44 billion of U.S. funds for Iraqi construction projects ( meanwhile , 39 % of bridges in the United States have been deemed structurally deficient – but that ’s another story .
Am I being partisan ? )
$ 30 billion was spent on Homeland Security in 2008 , and they ’re requesting $ 35 billion for 2009 .
Lest we pick on ourselves only , residents of the United Kingdom waste about Ã¢ ” š ¤ 20 billion worth of food every year .
That translates to about $ 31.7 billion U.S. dollars .
You ’ll notice that the big spenders are on corporations , defense and military organizations , but in my research I did n’t intend to focus on this .
It ’s just what we spend on !
I ca n’t help but think that if we could channel even a few of those war dollars into peace spending ( like helping alleviate world hunger ) , there might not be much left to fight about in the future .
This idealist believes it ’s worth a try .
What do you think ?

Sherry Wolf , author of the forthcoming Sexuality and Socialism : History , Politics and Theory of Gay Liberation , looks at the debate about why Proposition 8 passed in California .
IN THE wake of Barack Obama 's historic victory , a false and reactionary narrative has emerged that blames Black voters for the gay marriage ban that passed by a 52 to 48 percent margin in California .
While Florida and Arizona also passed same - sex marriage bans , the vote for Prop 8 in the politically progressive state of California is widely attributed to the enormous surge of Black voters , 70 percent of whom approved the ban reversing the state 's May 2008 Supreme Court decision allowing lesbians and gays to marry .
The exit polls showed that 53 percent of Latinos voted for the ban , as well as around 49 percent of white voters .
The state 's Black population is 6.2 percent , and it accounted for 10 percent of the overall vote .
In other words , blaming African Americans for the referendum 's passage ignores 90 percent of the vote .
It also ignores recent history .
To judge from social research , had there been an unapologetically pro-civil rights campaign , there was the prospect of a different outcome .
Thousands of people protested the passage of Prop 8 on the steps of the capitol building in Sacramento ( Kelly Huston )
The most comprehensive study of Black attitudes toward homosexuality , which combines 31 national surveys from 1973 to 2000 , came to a fascinating conclusion .
Georgia State University researchers found that " Blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay - rights laws . "
African Americans ' religiosity leads many to believe that homosexuality is a sin , while their own experience of oppression leads them to oppose discrimination .
This was borne out in the 2004 elections , where , in the six states with substantial Black populations that had same - sex marriage bans on their ballots , Blacks were slightly less likely than whites to vote for them .
Nationally , 58 percent now oppose gay marriage bans , a dramatic shift from just a few years ago .
If an explicit case in favor of gay marriage were made by activists , a multiracial majority could be won over in coming years .
THE EXIT poll statistics from California do n't explain the more important story of why so many of California 's Black , Brown and white citizens -- who voted overwhelmingly for the first African American president by a 56 to 37 percent margin -- also supported striking down civil rights for lesbians and gays .
The most critical reason was the ineffective strategy used by pro-gay marriage forces that adhered closely to the Democratic Party -- and Barack Obama 's -- equivocal position on the issue .
While formally opposing Prop 8 , both Obama and his running mate Joe Biden were vocal throughout the campaign about their personal discomfort with and opposition to same - sex marriage .
Despite the unprecedented and astonishing sums of money raised to fight the referendum -- the pro-equality side took in $ 43.6 million , compared with $ 29.8 million for the anti-gay marriage forces -- the No on 8 side lost .
The statewide No on 8 Coalition did n't use the money for a grassroots organizing campaign .
It did n't put out a call for activists to hit the phones , knock on doors and hold rallies and actions to publicly denounce the bigotry of the measure -- though in a few cases , activists took the initiative to do so on their own .
Adhering to the false notion that the Democrats lost the 2004 presidential election due to the assertiveness of gay marriage activists , the heads of the No on 8 campaign avoided even using words like " gay " or " bigoted . "
Instead , one TV ad opposing the measure featured a straight white couple , and only obliquely referenced gays at all when the camera panned over a bookshelf with a photo of two women and their children .
In the final days before the election , No on 8 ran an ad with a voiceover by Black actor Samuel L. Jackson denouncing past civil rights abuses like Japanese internment and anti-miscegenation laws , with a slideshow of gay and lesbian couples on the screen .
Some members of the California Teachers Association , to their credit , turned over the final week of pre-election phone banking to No on Prop 8 calls .
Kathryn Lybarger , who married her partner a few weeks before the election , describes this and other efforts as " tragically last - minute stuff . "
Blogger Rick Jacobs rightly challenged the campaign 's tepid approach : " [ C ] an there be outrage when a movement becomes a corporation ?
When the largest LGBT organizations look like , are staffed by former executives of , and are funded by huge corporations and huge donors , where is the movement ? "
BY COMPARISON , the anti-gay Yes on 8 campaign was aggressive , vocal and visible .
They cynically used Obama 's own words and image in TV ads to persuade Democratic voters to oppose gay marriage by voting for the ban .
Largely financed by right - wing institutions like the Mormon Church and the Blackwater mercenary security company , Yes on 8 sent anti-gay marriage activists to Black and white churches to drum up support .
Their so - called robocalls , automatic telephone calls with mechanized messages , played Joe Biden 's words from the vice presidential debate agreeing on opposition to gay marriage with vacuous bigot Sarah Palin .
Another element was exposed in a Los Angeles Times op - ed article titled " No - on - 8's white bias , " by Black lesbian Jasmyne A. Cannick .
Cannick said she knocked on doors in working - class and poor Black neighborhoods of LA to register voters without ever raising the gay marriage issue .
" [ T ]he right to marry does nothing to address the problems faced by both Black gays and Black straights , " Cannick wrote .
" Does someone who is homeless or suffering from HIV but has no health care , or newly out of prison and unemployed , really benefit from the right to marry someone of the same sex ? "
The answer is :
Yes , indirectly , they do .
Thus , for example , the fight for HIV drugs and funding that erupted in the late 1980s and early 1990s , when white gay men were the dominant group dying of AIDS , could have averted the catastrophe of AIDS in the Black community today if a multiracial , gay and straight alliance had formed from both sides of the racial divide .
As African American civil rights leader Julian Bond put it , " Our inability to talk about sex , and more specifically homosexuality , is the single greatest barrier to the prevention of HIV transmission in our community . "
An injury to one truly is an injury to all .
As a group that has endured the injustices of separate but equal amounting to second - class status , Blacks can certainly comprehend the stakes in this fight for equality -- especially Black gays and lesbians who would directly benefit .
Besides , pitting one group of oppressed against another can only aid those in positions of wealth and power who benefit from divide - and - conquer tactics .
For this reason , many prominent African American leaders , from Coretta Scott King to Al Sharpton , have taken an unequivocal stand in defense of gay marriage .
It is true that some Black churches and leaders are homophobic , and they should be challenged .
But the enormous wealth of the white - dominated Catholic and Mormon churches , in stark contrast to the poverty of most Black churches , renders their culpability that much worse .
In challenging white LGBT people who justify not working alongside African Americans due to their supposed higher rates of homophobia , Black lesbian Barbara Smith argues :
Institutionalized homophobia in this society is definitely a white monopoly .
And when we do see examples of homophobia in people - of - color contexts , what that should motivate people to do is to increase the level of solidarity with gay men and lesbians of color so that we can challenge homophobia wherever it appears .
The massive outpouring of protesters on the streets of California 's cities since the ban shows the potential to organize a repeal of Prop 8 in coming months .
But they will need to devise a strategy independent of the Democrats ' equivocation and corporate - funded organizations wary of rocking the boat .
LGBT activists in this budding movement should go directly to Black and Latino allies and develop a multiracial and collaborative challenge to the bigotry of anti-gay marriage forces of every race .
Included in the strategy should be a demand on the new Obama administration and Democratic - controlled Congress to carry forward with their party platform that opposes the Clinton - era Defense of Marriage Act .
It 's time to repeal that law and end federally sanctioned bigotry against gay marriage .
Thanks to Kathryn Lybarger in Berkeley for providing local insight on the Prop 8 campaign .
Marc Forster has signed up to direct an adaptation of World War Z , a bestselling novel about flesh - eating zombies who destroy the word
After his gruelling sojourn into big - budget action with Quantum of Solace , Marc Forster said he wanted to return to the " smaller films " that made his name .
One suspects a movie about flesh - eating zombies taking over the planet was n't quite what he had in mind , but that 's the film he will work on next , according to Variety .
World War Z is an adaptation of the eponymous bestselling novel by Max Brooks , son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft .
It describes a devastating infestation of flesh - eating zombies that destroys all the nations of the world .
The story is told through the first - person accounts of survivors , as relayed to a UN postwar commission 10 years after armageddon .
" The genre always fascinated me , and when they pitched it to me , it reminded me of the paranoid conspiracy films of the 70s like All the President 's Men , " Forster told Daily Variety .
World War Z is being developed by Brad Pitt 's Plan B ; Michael Straczynski , who wrote Changeling , is on board to write the screenplay .
Pitt bought the rights in 2006 but will not necessarily take a starring role .
Plan B has several other high - profile films in the works , including an adaptation of the novel Eat , Pray , Love starring Julia Roberts , and two David Fincher movies .
Pitt recently finished work on Fincher 's forthcoming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button .
A South Londoner has become an internet star after a video of him beating an NBA star , not once but twice , in a game of one - on - one in a playground was posted on the internet .

Toni Morrison ’s books are epics of the failure of the country ’s conscience .
“ When I began , there was just one thing that I wanted to write about , which was the true devastation of racism on the most vulnerable , the most helpless unit in the society – a black female and a child , ” she told The New York Times in an interview .
Almost 40 years into her career , a black female child is still at the heart of her writing .
In the Nobel Prize - winner ’s first novel in five years , A Mercy , she goes back further in history than her most searing and poetic novel , “ Beloved , ” to look at the foundations of slavery in an America “ before it was America . ”
The chances for mercy to thrive in a new land are weighed on a small farm in New York .
Four women who were acquired by farmer - turned - trader Jacob Vaark in various ways – marriage , purchase , repayment of debts – have forged an unlikely family , partly out of proximity but also out of a deep , thwarted hunger for motherhood – either to have one or to be one .
There are also two indentured male servants ( whose contracts never seem to end ) , so the farm is a small collective of every type of servitude possible years before the country turned exclusively and implacably to the enslavement of black Africans .
This might seem like a contrived set up for a morality play , but once Morrison ’s writing takes over readers will not notice .
“ White men , by and large , are not powerful figures in black women ’s literature , ” Morrison remarked in the same New York Times interview .
While the women are definitely the center of “ A Mercy , ” Morrison offers a more complicated portrayal of a white male in Jacob Vaark .
An orphan himself , Jacob has a tendency to collect strays .
His wife , Rebekka , came over from England when she was 16 – essentially sold by a family that did n’t want to feed her anymore .
Her “ prospects were servant , prostitute , or wife , and although horrible stories were told about each of those careers , the last one seemed safest . ”
Given her low expectations , Rebekka is thrilled with Jacob ( and he with her ) .
They seem destined to have a happy marriage – until their children all die , one after another , leaving Rebekka “ unleavened , ” in Jacob ’s words .
Her companion , Lina , is a native American whose tribe was destroyed by disease when she was a child .
She was raised by Presbyterians until “ Christianized and capable , ” they sold her to Jacob .
The final member of the household is Sorrow , a seemingly vacant girl who escaped from a shipwreck and who Jacob agreed to take in exchange for some lumber .
While in Maryland in 1682 , seeking repayment on a debt , Jacob visits the tobacco farm of a Senhor D’Ortega .
D’Ortega has no money , so he offers him another form of portable wealth : a slave .
Jacob initially recoils but ultimately accepts a little girl named Florens when asked to by her mother .
“ From his own childhood he knew there was no good place in the world for waifs and whelps other than the generosity of strangers , ” Jacob reflects .
“ Even if bartered , given away , apprenticed , sold , swapped , seduced , tricked for food , labored for shelter or stolen , they were less doomed under adult control . ”
So he brings Florens back home to his wife – the act of “ mercy ” of the title .
But Florens never recovers from being “ abandoned ’ by her mother , whom she believes chose her baby brother over her .
And the act of acquiring her opens Jacob to the possibility of doing more than just dabbling in slavery .
While repulsed by what he sees as the overindulgence and excess of the D’Ortegas , Jacob becomes determined to acquire the same kind of house and trappings , and another trader explains how : the sugar plantations of Barbados – where the labor is free and infinitely replaceable .
At the Vaarks ’ farm , Lina mothers Florens and Rebekka is mildly amused by the little girl who “ however slight , any kindness shown her she munched like a rabbit . ”
If the quality of mercy on display here is dubious , the blessings are even more so .
By 1690 , Jacob has just died of smallpox , never having had a chance to live in the mansion he spent years constructing , and Rebekka , still childless , is ill with the same disease .
The now teenage Florens has been sent to find a free African blacksmith who is believed to have healing powers .
If Rebekka is dependent on Florens ’s speed and Lina ’s nursing , the other three women are in terrible trouble if Rebekka dies .
With no mistress , Lina realizes , they will be easy prey .
“ They once thought they were a kind of family because together they had carved companionship out of isolation , ” someone says of the residents of the Vaark farm .
Like a dream deferred , if a mercy is hidden too long , it tends to explode – as Morrison shows in her knockout final monologue .
It ’s a spare , dark fable – and at under 200 pages , a swift , kaleidoscopic trip into tragedy .

The long decline in newspaper circulation over the years continues to accelerate , with sales in the spring and summer falling almost 5 percent from the previous year , figures released on Monday show , deepening the financial strain on the industry .
The drop occurred nearly across the board during the six months that ended Sept. 30 ; weekday circulation for the largest metropolitan dailies fell anywhere from 1.9 percent for The Washington Post , to 13.6 percent for The Atlanta Journal - Constitution , compared with the period a year earlier .
The figures , released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations based on reports filed by the individual papers , show that circulation at The Houston Chronicle , The Boston Globe , The Star - Ledger of Newark , The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Orange County Register and The Detroit News fell 10 percent or more .

Neither paper publishes on Sundays .
Among more than 100 papers with weekday circulation above 100,000 , none had more than a fractional increase .
Dear Cecil :
Have you ever considered the puzzle of doubling ancestors ?
Everybody has two parents , four grandparents , eight great grandparents , and so on back through time , with the number of ancestors doubling in each generation .
Go back 30 generations and the number of ancestors tops one billion .
Eventually we arrive at a time when we have more ancestors than there could have been people in the world .
How can this be ?
Common sense , not to mention the book of Genesis , suggests the human race started off with a handful of individuals whose numbers steadily increased .
What are the implications of these two surging numerical tides , ancestors and descendants , butting head to head ?
Enclosed is a $ 10 check for the trouble of a personal reply .
George M. , Monrovia , California
Cecil replies :
You ask a question as cosmic as this one and you think a lousy sawbuck is going to cover it ?
Keep your money until you can fork over some real cash .
The ancestor puzzle has its explanation in what one genealogist has called “ pedigree collapse . ”
This occurs when relatives , usually cousins , marry , in effect narrowing the family tree .
( Fortunately for the gene pool , most of the cousins are only distantly related . )
When this happens you find that many of the “ slots ” in a given generation of your family tree are filled by duplicates .
Consider an extreme case .
Mr. and Mrs. Nosepicker have two children , a girl and a boy .
These two develop an unnatural yen for one another and marry .
Six months later the girl gives birth to an eight - pound horseradish with a lisp .
In theory , the horseradish has four grandparents .
In reality , its maternal and paternal grandparents are identical .
Two of the four grandparent slots are thus filled by duplicates — pedigree collapse with a vengeance .
Only slightly less extreme is the case of Alfonso XIII of Spain ( 1886 -1941 ) .
Because of inbreeding in the royal family , he had only ten great - great - grandparents instead of the expected 16 .
If you go back far enough , however , pedigree collapse happens to everybody .
Think of your personal family tree as a diamond - shaped array imposed on the ever - spreading fan of human generations .
( I told you this was cosmic . )
As you trace your pedigree back , the number of ancestors in each generation increases steadily up to a point , then slows , stops , and finally collapses .
Go back far enough and no doubt you would find that you and all your ancestors were descended from the first human tribe in some remote Mesopotamian village .
Or , if you like , from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden .
These simple facts have given rise to some remarkable displays of statistical pyrotechnics .
Demographer Kenneth Wachtel estimates that the typical English child born in 1947 would have had around 60,000 theoretical ancestors at the time of the discovery of America .
Of this number , 95 percent would have been different individuals and 5 percent duplicates .
( Sounds like Invasion of the Body Snatchers , but you know what I mean . )
Twenty generations back the kid would have 600,000 ancestors , one - third of which would be duplicates .
At the time of the Black Death , he ’d have had 3.5 million — 30 percent real , 70 percent duplicates .
The maximum number of “ real ” ancestors occurs around 1200 AD — 2 million , some 80 percent of the population of England .
Pedigree collapse explains why it ’s so easy for professional genealogists to trace your lineage back to royalty — go far enough back and you ’re related to everybody .
For that matter , you ’re probably related to everybody alive today .
Some geneticists believe that everybody on earth is at least 50th cousin to everybody else .

Applications Wilkins Ice Shelf under threat
28/11/2008 1656 views 0 likes
New rifts have developed on the Wilkins Ice Shelf that could lead to the opening of the ice bridge that has been preventing the ice shelf from disintegrating and breaking away from the Antarctic Peninsula .
The ice bridge connects the Wilkins Ice Shelf to two islands , Charcot and Latady .
As seen in the Envisat image above acquired on 26 November 2008 , new rifts ( denoted by colourful lines and dates of the events ) have formed to the east of Latady Island and appear to be moving in a northerly direction .
Dr Angelika Humbert from the Institute of Geophysics , Münster University , and Dr Matthias Braun from the Center for Remote Sensing , University of Bonn , spotted the newly formed rifts during their daily monitoring activities of the ice sheet via Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) acquisitions .
" These new rifts , which have joined previously existing rifts on the ice shelf ( blue dotted line ) , threaten to break up the chunk of ice located beneath the 21 July date , which would cause the bridge to lose its stabilisation and collapse , " Humbert explained .
" These recent changes are happening slower and more continuously than the events we saw earlier this year . "
Wilkins Ice Shelf - 20 - 26 November
In February 2008 an area of about 400 km² broke off from the ice shelf , narrowing the ice bridge down to a 6 km strip .
At the end of May 2008 an area of about 160 km² broke off , reducing the ice bridge to just 2.7 km .
Between 30 May and 9 July 2008 , the ice shelf experienced further disintegration and lost about 1 350 km² .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf , a broad plate of floating ice south of South America on the Antarctic Peninsula , had been stable for most of the last century before it began retreating in the 1990s .
The peninsula has been experiencing extraordinary warming in the past 50 years of 2.5°C .
If the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula , it will not cause a rise in sea level since it is already floating .
However , ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula are sandwiched by extraordinarily raising surface air temperatures and a warming ocean , making them important indicators for on - going climate change .
Long - term satellite monitoring over Antarctica is important because it provides authoritative evidence of trends and allows scientists to make predictions .
Over the last 17 years , ESA ’s ERS and Envisat satellite missions have been the main vehicles for testing and demonstrating the use of Earth Observation data in Polar Regions .
Break -ups of Larsen - B and Wilkins ice shelves
In the past 20 years , seven ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated or disintegrated , including the most spectacular break - up of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 , which Envisat captured within days of its launch .
Envisat ’s ASAR instrument is particularly suited to acquire images over Antarctica during the local winter period because it is able to produce high - quality images through bad weather and darkness , conditions often found in the area .
Daily ASAR images of Antarctica are easily accessible to scientists .
ESA will publish an update about the status of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in the event of a break - up .

Soil study muddies climate change debate
Climate change may not be as severe as predicted , suggests an international study that shows current modelling of carbon dioxide emissions from soils are overestimated by as much as 20 % .
The view , reported in the latest Nature Geoscience journal , is based on a study of Australian soils that finds the amount of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) released by Australian soils is much lower than previously believed .
The finding has major implications for climate change predictions as annual carbon emissions from soils are estimated to be more than all human - made CO2 emissions combined .
The Australian and US researchers say emissions from soils are lower because they contain a much higher proportion of charcoal , or black carbon , than estimated by previous models .
" Current models of global climate change .. are inaccurate if a larger fraction of soil organic carbon than postulated has a very slow decomposition rate , " they write .
Co-author Dr Evelyn Krull , of CSIRO Land and Water , says charcoal , which is formed in the aftermath of bushfires , is a very stable form of carbon that can last for millennia .
" In effect it 's a carbon sink , " Krull says .
Inflated predictions
Under the commonly used RothC model , the proportion of black carbon is calculated to be about 6.6 % , she says .
Krull says in their study of 452 soil samples from the Australian National Soil Archive and two landscape transects of about 3000 km in Queensland and the Northern Territory , charcoal content ranged from zero to 82 % .
She says the average proportion of charcoal present for all 452 soil samples was 20.4 % .
The team found by including realistic estimates of charcoal in their climate prediction models , the amount of CO2 predicted to be released from two Australian savannah regions under a 3 º C warming scenario was 18.3 % and 24.4 % lower than previously calculated .
For Australia , a proportion of 20 % charcoal in soils would lead to a 135 teragram ( 135 billion kilograms ) overestimation on a continental scale .
" On an annual basis , an inflated prediction from topsoils alone equates to ... 84 % of CO2 emissions associated with aviation for Australia using values obtained for 2006 , " the paper says .
Krull , who has analysed soil samples from across the globe since the paper was prepared , says she has found soils from countries around the same latitude as Australia have similar charcoal content .
She says this means that current scenarios predicted by climate change modeling " are making it look worse than it actually would be " .
This highlights the need for a global initiative to analyse soils worldwide for charcoal content so that modeling can be more accurate , she says .
And so we have now discovered yet a third category of documented and scientifically accepted harmful effects of radiation and that is mental retardation in children who were irradiated while still in the womb .
. . .
When we extract uranium from the ground , we dig up the rock , we crush it and we leave behind this finely pulverized material -- it 's like flour .
In Canada we have 200 million tons of this radioactive waste , called uranium tailings .
As Marie Curie observed , 85 percent of the radioactivity in the ore remains behind in that crushed rock .
How long will it be there ?
. . . .
Well , it turns out that the effective half - life of this radioactivity is 80,000 years .
That means in 80,000 years there will be half as much radioactivity in these tailings as there is today .
You know , that dwarfs the entire prehistory of the Salzburg region which goes way back to ancient , ancient times .
Even archaeological remains date back no further than 80,000 years .
We do n't have any records of human existence going back that far .
That 's the half - life of this material .
And as these tailings are left on the surface of the earth , they are blown by the wind , they are washed by the rain into the water systems , and they inevitably spread .
Once the mining companies close down , who is going to look after this material forever ?
How does anyone , in fact , guard 200 million tons of radioactive sand safely forever , and keep it out of the environment ?
In addition , as the tailings are sitting there on the surface , they are continually generating radon gas .
Radon is about eight times heavier than air , so it stays close to the ground .
It 'll travel 1,000 miles in just a few days in a light breeze .
And as it drifts along , it deposits on the vegetation below the radon daughters , which are the radioactive byproducts that I told you about , including polonium .
So that you actually get radon daughters in animals , fish and plants thousands of miles away from where the uranium mining is done .
It 's a mechanism for pumping radioactivity into the environment for millennia to come , and this is one of the hidden dangers .
All uranium ends up as either nuclear weapons or highly radioactive waste from nuclear reactors .
That 's the destiny of all the uranium that 's mined .
And in the process of mining the uranium we liberate these naturally occurring radioactive substances , which are among the most harmful materials known to science .
URANIUM :
Known Facts and Hidden Dangers
invited address by Dr. Gordon Edwards
September 14 , 1992
Dr. Gordon Edwards , Quebec , Canada .
Mathematician .
Uranium
W hat do we know about uranium ?
Well , uranium is the heaviest naturally occurring element on earth .
It is a metal , like all other metals , except that it had no commercial value before the mid-twentieth century .
Until the last fifty years it was produced only as a byproduct .
Thus the entire history of the mining of uranium has taken place during my lifetime .
Moreover , a great deal of it has occurred in my homeland , Canada , which was the first country to produce and process uranium as such .
The first uranium processed by Canada was used to produce nuclear explosives for the atomic bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
Indeed , the beginning of the nuclear weapons program marked the beginning of the uranium industry .
By 1956 , uranium had become the fourth most important export from Canada , after pulp , lumber and wheat ; and every ounce of it was used to produce A - bombs and H - bombs for the American -- and , to a lesser extent , the British -- nuclear weapons programs .
It was the only use uranium had at that time .
Today , Canada remains the world 's largest producer and exporter of uranium , ostensibly for peaceful purposes ; that is , as fuel for civilian nuclear reactors .
Canada is also one of the very few countries in the world in which uranium mining is currently expanding .
In the province of Saskatchewan , there are environmental assessment hearings going on now , this year , having to do with the potential opening of five new uranium mines .
This , despite the fact that the price of uranium is lower today than it has ever been .
The price has been falling steadily for more than fifteen years , and is now at an all - time low .
I hope that those attending this conference will write to the Prime Minister of Canada ( c/ o House of Commons , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada , K1A 0A6 ) and to the Premier of Saskatchewan ( c/ o Saskatchewan Legislature , Regina , Saskatchewan , Canada ) asking them not to continue the expansion of this industry .
Why ?
Because uranium is the deadliest metal on earth .
As you will see , the scientific evidence fully bears out this conclusion .
I would now like to explain why .
Both the commercial value and the dangers of uranium are based on two extra-ordinary characteristics which it possesses .
First of all , uranium is radioactive .
Secondly , uranium is fissionable .
These are two quite different properties , however , and they should not be confused .
Radioactivity
T he phenomenon of radioactivity was accidentally discovered in 1896 when Henri Becquerel put a rock in a drawer .
The rock contained uranium , and the drawer contained a photographic plate , which was well - wrapped and shielded from the light .
Some weeks later , when Becquerel unwrapped and developed the plate , he found rays of light on the photograph emanating exactly from the point of contact where the rock had been resting on it .
Being a scientist , he was astounded .
He could think of no possible way in which an inert rock could spontaneously be releasing energy -- especially such a penetrating form of energy .
Moreover , the energy release had taken place in total darkness , in the absence of any external stimulation -- there was no chemical reaction , no exposure to sunlight , nor anything else .
Becquerel had discovered radioactivity .
Marie Curie decided to pursue the mystery further .
She got some uranium ore from the Erz mountains , not very far from here .
She chemically separated the uranium from the rest of the crushed rock ( she had to crush the rock and dissolve it in acid to get the uranium out , which is what we still do today in mining uranium ) and she found that even after the uranium had been removed , the crushed rock remained very radioactive -- much more so than the uranium itself .
Here was a mystery indeed .
Why is it that eighty - five percent of the radioactivity stays behind in the crushed rock ?
Starting with many tons of rock , Madame Curie proceeded to separate out all the chemical elements she knew .
It was painstaking work .
Finally she was left with a small beaker of concentrated , highly radioactive liquid .
By evaporating the water , she felt sure she would discover whatever was causing this intense radioactivity .
But when the liquid was evaporated , the beaker was , apparently , completely empty .
She was deeply disappointed .
She could n't fathom what had gone wrong .
But when she returned to the laboratory late at night , she found the beaker glowing brightly in the dark , and she realized that it was n't empty after all .
In this way , Marie Curie discovered two new elements : radium and polonium .
We now know these are inevitable byproducts of uranium .
By 1906 , all the basic facts of radioactivity were known , except for the central mystery as to " why " ; this we do not understand .
Indeed , science does n't really understand why anything is the way it is .
All science can do is describe how things behave .
Science tells us , for example , that all material things are made up of tiny atoms .
The atoms found in most substances are remarkably stable , but in the case of radioactive materials , the atoms are unstable .
Consider the water in this glass .
It is made up of stable atoms .
Pure water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms , and these atoms are , as far as science can determine , eternal and unchangeable .
The very same atoms of hydrogen and oxygen that are in this glass of water were around , in some other combinations , in the days of the dinosaurs .
But radioactive substances have unstable atoms which can and will explode microscopically , and when they do , they give off a burst of energy .
This process is called " radioactive disintegration " or " radioactive decay " .
When radioactive atoms explode , they give off highly energetic charged particles of two types : alpha and beta .
These are particles , they 're not invisible rays .
They are like pieces of shrapnel from an explosion .
And this microscopic shrapnel does great damage because of the high energy of the particles which are given off .
Decay Products
W hen a radioactive atom explodes , that atom is changed permanently into a new substance .
And radium turns out to be one of the results of exploding uranium atoms .
So wherever you find uranium on the earth , you will always find radium with it because it is one of about a dozen so - called " decay products " of uranium .
To be more precise , when uranium disintegrates it turns into a substance called protactinium , which is also radioactive .
And when that disintegrates it turns into a substance named thorium , which is likewise radioactive .
When thorium disintegrates it turns into radium ; when radium disintegrates it turns into radon gas .
And when radon gas atoms disintegrate , they turn into what are called the " radon daughters " , or " radon progeny " , of which there are about half a dozen radioactive materials , including polonium .
Finally , in this progression , you end up with a stable substance , which in itself is highly toxic : lead .
But because the radioactivity of the other materials is so much more dangerous than this toxic heavy metal , people do n't even talk about the lead at the end of the chain .
They think that once all the radioactivity is gone , what 's left is perfectly safe .
It is n't -- but the lead that remains is just a whole lot less dangerous than the radioactive materials that produced it .
So all the radioactive decay products of uranium remain in the crushed rock when uranium is separated from the ore .
That 's why Marie Curie found most of the radioactivity left behind in the residues , including all the radium and all the polonium .
Radium
W ell , how did the story of uranium progress ?
Because uranium was less radioactive than its daughter products , it was not valued commercially .
But radium was .
And radium began to be used principally for two purposes .
One was to burn cancerous growths .
I should tell you that both Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie suffered grievous burns which were very difficult to heal and which left permanent scars just as a result of handling radium .
Other scientists got the idea that if they embedded a needle containing radium inside a cancerous tumor , it would burn the cancer -- and indeed it did .
That was the beginning of cancer therapy using radiation , wherein the harmful effects of atomic radiation are directed against cancerous cells instead of healthy cells .
Of course , atomic radiation does similar damage to healthy cells .
Now , the other main use for radium was as a luminous paint , because of the glow - in - the - dark phenomenon that Marie Curie had observed .
Believe it or not , the price of uranium in the 1920s was $ 100,000 a gram -- and this is using dollars of the twenties !
It was a very expensive commodity , but only very little was needed for any given purpose .
Some of it was used to make luminous paint , with which they would paint dials so they could be read even in the dark .
Now the young women who painted these things began to get sick .
This was first reported by an American dentist called Blum , who said that he had some very young women -- 19 years old , 18 years old , 20 years old -- coming into his dentistry office .
Their teeth were falling out , their gums were badly infected and bleeding profusely , they were anemic , their bones were soft , and in some cases their jawbones had spontaneously fractured .
Some of them died of severe anemia .
The only thing these women had in common was that they worked in a radium dial painting factory in New Jersey .
Blum called this phenomenon " radium jaw " .
A few years later , the women who had recovered from these symptoms started developing problems in the rest of their skeleton .
They suffered weakening of the bone , spontaneous fractures of the hip and of other bones , and growths -- tumors , some of which were cancerous -- in the bones themselves .
Now , bone cancer is such an exceedingly rare disease , that there was little doubt that this cancer was caused by exposure to radium .
It was discovered that simply by wetting the tip of the brush in order to get a nice clean figure on the dials , these women were ingesting minute quantities of radium .
And that was sufficient to cause all these symptoms .
When autopsies were performed on the corpses of these women , doctors discovered that in their entire skeleton there were only a few micrograms of radium .
This quantity was so small , that no conventional chemical analysis could detect it .
Nevertheless , this tiny amount of radium had distributed itself so thoroughly through their skeleton , that you could take a picture of any one of their bones just by laying it on a photographic plate in a dark room ,
It is called an auto - radiograph -- that is , an x-ray picture with no x-ray machine .
So this was our first introduction to the harmful effects of even minute quantities of such substances .
By the way , many of the women who survived this phase of the assault later on developed cancers of the head -- cancer of the sinuses , cancer of the soft palate , and other types of head cancers .
We now know how these were caused .
Remember , radium is radioactive -- even inside the body .
As I told you earlier , when radium atoms disintegrate , they turn into radon gas .
So radon gas was being produced inside the bodies of these women .
In fact , one test for radium contamination is to check a person 's exhaled breath and see if it has radon gas in it ; if it does , that person must have radium in his or her body .
In the case of the radium dial painters , the radon gas was being produced in the bones , dissolved in the blood , and pumped by the heart up to the head where it collected in the sinus and other cavities .
And there it was irradiating the delicate living tissues and causing head cancers .
Radon
N ow , it so happens that for hundreds of years , going back to the 15th century , there had been reports that miners working in the Erz mountains had been dying at a tremendous rate from some unknown lung diseases .
We 're talking here about 75 percent mortality in some cases .
It was n't until the late 19th century that the principal disease was diagnosed and found to be lung cancer .
At that time , lung cancer was virtually unknown among the surrounding population ; yet these miners were experiencing in some cases up to 50 percent lung cancer mortality .
The other lung ailments were not lung cancer , but other types of debilitating lung damage .
By the 1930s it had been established that this epidemic of lung cancer and other lung diseases was caused by breathing radioactive materials in the atmosphere of the mine .
In animal experiments , radon gas was identified as the main killer .
Uranium finally acquired commercial value in 1942 , when we discovered that we could make atomic bombs with it .
Only then did we start mining uranium for itself and not as a byproduct of something else .
A few years earlier , in 1938 , it was discovered that uranium is not only radioactive , it is also fissionable , which makes it unique among all naturally occurring radioactive materials .
When uranium atoms undergo the fission process , large amounts of energy are released .
Unlike the process of radioactive decay , which cannot be turned on and off , nuclear fission can be controlled .
The energy release caused by fission can be speeded up , slowed down , started or stopped .
It can be used to destroy cities in the form of nuclear weapons , or to boil water inside a nuclear reactor .
Suddenly , uranium was in demand .
We sent miners into the mines in North America at a permissible level of radiation exposure which was comparable to the levels that those miners in the Erz mountains had been getting back in the 19th century .
And of course , the results were entirely predictable : an epidemic of lung cancer and other lung diseases .
One has to ask therefore :
Why were these consequences not predicted and prevented ?
Radon Daughters
T he answer is , in part , that the scientists refused to believe that such a small amount of radon gas could cause such a huge increase in cancer .
As it turns out , the scientists were wrong .
One of the basic things they overlooked , is that if you take a sample of radon gas -- right now , if I filled a tube with radon gas in front of your eyes , and measured the radiation in that tube -- within three hours , the level of radioactivity would increase by a factor of about five .
Why ?
As the radon atoms disintegrate , they produce other radioactive substances .
And so , in fact , you have a multiplication of new radioactive materials which were n't there to begin with .
This is one of the things the scientists overlooked .
So that when the miners go into a mine where the radon has been collecting for several hours , it 's five times as radioactive as radon in the laboratory .
And those other substances -- the radon daughters -- are extremely dangerous .
The worst of the radon daughters , by the way , is a substance called polonium -- the same polonium that Marie Curie discovered so many years ago .
Recent scientific evidence shows that polonium is , in many circumstances , at least as toxic as plutonium , and in some cases more toxic .
Nuclear Fission
N ow , what is that property that made uranium commercially valuable ?
It 's called fissionability .
More precisely , uranium is called a " fissile " material .
Let me explain what that means .
Yes , uranium atoms are radioactive , and so they will disintegrate if you just leave them alone ; but what happens if you poke them ?
What happens if you bombard uranium atoms with tiny particles called neutrons ?
It turns out that in that case , you can force a much more violent disintegration of the atom , which is called fission .
When fission occurs , the uranium atom does n't just disintegrate , it actually breaks apart into two or three large chunks .
In the process it gives off some extra neutrons , and it also gives off about 400 times as much energy as is produced by a radioactive disintegration event .
Now , the fact that fission is triggered by a neutron makes it quite different from normal radioactivity .
Radioactivity is not triggered , and therefore science does not know how to control it .
We have no mechanism for speeding up , slowing down , starting or stopping radioactivity .
That 's why radioactive wastes are such a problem .
But with fission , we can start it , stop it , and control it , just by maintaining control over the extra neutrons that are produced at each stage .
Starting with just one neutron , we can split one uranium atom , and the extra neutrons can go on to split two more uranium atoms , giving even more neutrons which can then split four atoms , which can then split eight atoms , and so on .
In this way , forty quintillion uranium atoms can be split with only sixty generations of splittings , all triggered by a single neutron .
[ A quintillion is a billion billion , or a million million million . ]
This whole " chain reaction " , as it is called , takes place in less than a thousandth of a second .
That is really what constitutes the atomic bomb .
Fission Products
Y ou may now realize that all of the radioactive materials which escape from an atomic bomb when it explodes , are basically the broken bits of uranium atoms .
These are new radioactive materials , called " fission products " , which are created by the splitting of uranium atoms .
There are hundreds of them .
They all have different names , and different chemical and biologically properties .
Most of them did not exist in nature before the advent of nuclear technology .
You see , uranium travels in many disguises .
In every sample of uranium ore , one finds radium -- but radium is , in a certain sense , just a transformation of uranium .
Speaking loosely , one could say that it is a disguised form of uranium .
It is just one of the many elements in the chain of decay .
Similarly with polonium .
Similarly with radon gas .
These are all just different manifestations of uranium , so to speak , resulting from radioactive decay .
And similarly with the fallout from atomic bombs ; all those radioactive materials which are released by nuclear explosions -- such as iodine - 131 , strontium - 90 , cesium - 137 , krypton - 85 , and all the rest -- they are all broken bits of uranium atoms .
They are additional disguises for uranium , resulting from nuclear fission .
The radioactive poisons that were released from the Chernobyl reactor are also broken bits of uranium atoms .
Incidentally , 80 percent of the total radiation dose delivered by the Chernobyl accident worldwide was caused by the escape of just a couple of kilograms of radioactive materials from the damaged nuclear plant .
It does n't take much ....
To this day , the sheep in Wales are unsuitable for human consumption because of contamination by one particular by - product of the Chernobyl accident called cesium - 137 .
But every atom of cesium - 137 from Chernobyl started out as an atom of uranium .
These radioactive materials , which are called fission products -- the ones in the bomb fallout and which in nuclear reactors -- should not be confused with the other radioactive materials I told you about earlier , which are the decay products of uranium .
The decay products of uranium are due to radioactive disintegration .
They are about two dozen in number , and they occur in nature because uranium does .
When you talk about fission products , however , you are dealing with completely different substances .
They are created only inside nuclear weapons or nuclear reactors .
They are the leftover pieces of uranium atoms which have been violently broken apart by the fission process .
There are over 300 of them altogether , when you consider that -- being radioactive -- each of the fission products also has its own decay products !
Health Effects of Radioactive Materials
A nd so this one material , uranium , is responsible for introducing into the human environment a tremendously large range of radioactive materials which are all very inimical to biological organisms .
These are not invisible rays , they are materials .
They get into our water , our food , and the air we breathe .
They 're exactly like other materials except for the fact that they 're radioactive .
Take , for instance , radioactive iodine .
It behaves just like ordinary iodine , which is not radioactive .
Why is there iodine in our table salt ?
Well , it 's one of the few examples of preventative medicine we have .
The iodine , when it 's eaten in the table salt , goes to the thyroid gland , and there it helps to prevent a disease of the thyroid gland called " goiter " .
Radioactive iodine does exactly the same thing .
If a child or an adult gets radioactive iodine in the diet , the radioactive iodine goes to the thyroid too , and it also helps to prevent goiter .
But while it 's there , the atoms explode , and the shrapnel rips through the cells of the body , and in the process breaks thousands of chemical bonds randomly .
It 's like throwing a grenade into a computer .
The probability of getting an improvement in a computer by throwing a grenade into it is very small , and similarly with radiation events and human cells .
Now , the cells that die are really no problem , as long as not too many of them die .
They can be replaced .
The ones that are particularly dangerous are the ones that survive .
Those damaged cells can develop into cancers .
You can also have damage to germ cells -- eggs and sperm -- leading to genetically damaged children , grandchildren , or great - grandchildren .
As Alice Stewart mentioned in her talk , there are two categories of human illness that everyone agrees can be caused by exposure to atomic radiation even at very low levels .
They are ( 1 ) cancers of all kinds , and also ( 2 ) genetic mutations -- which can be caused right down to the lowest levels of radiation exposure .
Most scientists believe that these harmful effects are linearly related to the dose , so that if the dose is doubled , the number of cancers and genetic defects will also be doubled , and if the dose is cut in half , only half as many cancers and genetic defects will be seen .
It is important to realize that if a damaging dose is spread out among a very large population , so that each individual receives only a very small portion of the total dose , the number of cancers and genetic defects is in no way diminished .
Thus , in the case of radioactive pollution , dilution is no solution at all .
However , there is one other effect of radiation at low levels which was n't mentioned in the previous talk , and I would like to just mention it here .
It has now been confirmed by the scientific community -- only in recent years , by the way -- that mental retardation is caused by radiation exposure in the womb .
This type of biological damage also seems to be linear , that is , proportional to dose , right down to the lowest levels of exposure .
There does n't seem to be any cut - off point .
And so we have now discovered yet a third category of documented and scientifically accepted harmful effects of radiation and that is mental retardation in children who were irradiated while still in the womb .
Uranium Tailings
N ow , if I could just wrap up , I have to tell you something extremely important .
The title of my talk was " Known facts and hidden dangers " .
I 've told you a bit about the known facts .
Now for at least one of the hidden dangers .
When we extract uranium from the ground , we dig up the rock , we crush it and we leave behind this finely pulverized material -- it 's like flour .
In Canada we have 200 million tons of this radioactive waste , called uranium tailings .
As Marie Curie observed , 85 percent of the radioactivity in the ore remains behind in that crushed rock .
How long will it be there ?
Well , it turns out that the effective half - life of this radioactivity is 80,000 years .
That means in 80,000 years there will be half as much radioactivity in these tailings as there is today .
You know , that dwarfs the entire prehistory of the Salzburg region which goes way back to ancient , ancient times .
Even archaeological remains date back no further than 80,000 years .
We do n't have any records of human existence going back that far .
That 's the half - life of this material .
And as these tailings are left on the surface of the earth , they are blown by the wind , they are washed by the rain into the water systems , and they inevitably spread .
Once the mining companies close down , who is going to look after this material forever ?
How does anyone , in fact , guard 200 million tons of radioactive sand safely forever , and keep it out of the environment ?
In addition , as the tailings are sitting there on the surface , they are continually generating radon gas .
Radon is about eight times heavier than air , so it stays close to the ground .
It 'll travel 1,000 miles in just a few days in a light breeze .
And as it drifts along , it deposits on the vegetation below the radon daughters , which are the radioactive byproducts that I told you about , including polonium .
So that you actually get radon daughters in animals , fish and plants thousands of miles away from where the uranium mining is done .
It 's a mechanism for pumping radioactivity into the environment for millennia to come , and this is one of the hidden dangers .
Conclusion
A ll uranium ends up as either nuclear weapons or highly radioactive waste from nuclear reactors .
That 's the destiny of all the uranium that 's mined .
And in the process of mining the uranium we liberate these naturally occurring radioactive substances , which are among the most harmful materials known to science .
Couple this with the thought that nuclear technology never was a solution to any human problem .
Nuclear weapons do not bring about a sane world , and nuclear power is not a viable answer to our energy problems .
We do n't even need it for electricity .
All you need for conventional electricity generation is to spin a wheel , and there 's many ways of doing it : water power , wind power , geothermal power , etc .
In addition , there are other methods for producing electricity directly : solar photovoltaics , fuel cells , and so on .
What we have here , in the case of nuclear power , from the very beginning , is a technology in search of an application .
So , I think that we as a human community have to come to grips with this problem and say to ourselves and to others that enough is enough .
We do not want to permanently increase our radiation levels on this planet .
We have enough problems already .
Thank you .

Freda Meissner - Blau ( Moderator )
Thank you very , very much , Gordon Edwards .
I think those two lectures gave a perfect background to the next step of our endeavors .
Our objective of the meeting is really to give the voice to the victims of what we just have heard .
And I should ask now to come up here , please , Mr. Vladimir Chernousenko , if he 's here .
And then , Mr. Guy White Thunder , Mr. James Garrett and the family Yazzie of Arizona -- that 's Esther , Robert and their daughter Darnell .
Now we are going to hear for the next hour the testimonies .
Now , you may know , may have heard about Vladimir Chernousenko .
He was the coordinator of the clean - up in Chernobyl .
He is himself a physicist , and he definitely is a victim .
He is n't feeling very well , and he has a lot to say to us .
He has lived through the whole nightmare , so we want to give him as much time as he needs .
If you 're running the Turner Prize , look away now .
The big rock star you hired to bring glamour and edge to this year 's ceremony is refusing , magnificently , to play the game .
" Nothing to say about that , " Nick Cave drawls , despite his presentation of the art award in eight days ' time being the main reason we are together .
" You know , they just asked me to do it .
I guess they wanted to give it a bit of class . "
He laughs , darkly .
Cave is the prince of darkness , by reputation the darkest creature in the dark recesses of rock ( and boy are they dark , and crowded ) .
This gothic Australian will not pretend to be infatuated with British art , like his predecessor Madonna .
" I said I was fine , as long as all I had to say was , ' The winner is ... ' "
Has he even been to see the exhibition ?
" No , " he says .
" No , there 's too much else to do than wandering around looking at other people 's work . "
He will try , he says .
But there is music to make and novels to write and movies to complete , all in his office in the basement of a Victorian mansion block in Hove , West Sussex .

Meeting him there is intimidating .
The sea is just across the road , but blinds and bars obscure the windows .
" I have no interest in a view , " he says , offering a creaky wooden school chair , then sitting himself on the other side of a massive desk .
His face is lit , in the gloom , by the glow of a computer screen .
Cave could be the Devil in thin disguise , offering mean terms for my soul – the sort of scenario you find in his songs , which at first hearing are full of fury , violence and heartbreak , the Old Testament as performed by an unusually groovy garage band .
Cave looks as he does in all the pictures : a twisted preacher man with swept back , crow - black hair , a thick bandito moustache and a dark suit .
He sits at an odd angle , head inclined , as if trying to decide whether to click his fingers and have demons carry me away .
I am nervous .
But more than one listen to his music reveals the lyrical subtlety , humour and self - deprecation that raise him above his rivals .
The latest recording by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , the widely acclaimed Dig , Lazarus , Dig !!! , has the Biblical resurrectee adrift in the Seventies New York disco scene .
The album closes with a song called " More News From Nowhere " in which Cave tries ( and fails , miserably ) to get into bed with former lovers .
Rare is the modern lyric that combines " psychotropic " and " chromosome " with references to Homer and the attempted seduction of someone called Janet : " You are the one , you are the sun , and I 'm your dutiful planet ... but she ain't down with any of that , she 's heard that shit before . "
But look , he must have an opinion about modern art : he dropped out of art college in Australia , did n't he ?
" No , " he says , " I failed . "
Ah. Now , this is new .
None of the biographies says that .
It suits the myth more to say that Cave walked out of the Caulfield Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1977 ( he is 51 , but looks like he bought an elixir of youth from Lucifer ) to concentrate on the music he was making with his band the Birthday Party , who in turn gave way to the Bad Seeds .
" They did me a favour because I did n't turn out to be a painter , " he says , " but at the time I was mortified .
I thought I was the genuine hope for that school , and what I was doing would get that school on the map .
Which of course it did in the end . "
Now a university campus , it gave him an honorary doctorate earlier this year .
But the past still gets to him .
" I did two years , then failed the assessment .
They thought I was interested in music and therefore not in painting , but that time was incredible for me . "
He had been raised in rural Australia , by church - going parents .
" I went from a pretty conservative boys ' school into this environment where there were all these budding artists .
I had the best time of my life .
Everyone talking about their ideas , it was exciting .
You get licence to do that , which I do n't really get these days . "
He has worked with Johnny Cash and Russell Crowe , his songs have been used by Wim Wenders and in the blockbuster Shrek 2 , but he still sounds lonely , artistically .
There is none of the sparring of art school , or a later time in Berlin when there was , he says wrily , " artistic cross fertilisation ... of every kind " .
Does he miss it , down here in Hove ?
" Yeah , I do . "
But this is a place he comes back to for peace and anonymity , after show - off things such as the week - long national tour that starts in Brighton tonight , or the televised Turner ceremony on 1 December .
The £ 25,000 prize could go to a woman who pushes teacups off the edge of a table .
Or the artist who made a steel sculpture that looks like a bike rack .
Or the one who put a mannequin on the toilet .
Or the one whose work is based around Felix the Cat .
The BBC has already sent a reporter to sneer and ask – again – if this is art .
" That 's what should be happening , surely ? " says Cave , who may care more than he is letting on .
Between us on the desk is a booked called WACK !
Art and the Feminist Revolution .
" If someone is pushing teacups off a table at least that seems to be still an art form in which artists are leading the way the public thinks , rather than the other way round .
Not like the movies . "
Cave made a sensational debut as a screenwriter with The Proposition , an Outback western with all the grit and originality missing from Baz Luhrmann 's new Australia .
He has now written the score – with his band member Warren Ellis – for a new film of Cormac McCarthy 's novel The Road .
" I do n't know if I 'm allowed to say this , but ... it was pretty much locked off , everyone was pleased they 'd done something radical and exciting , then they showed it to one of these test screenings – 100 random punters – and it scored a low mark .
Some people thought it was a little depressing or something . "
Is n't it set after the apocalypse ?
" Exactly .
So there was a complete panic , an attempt to recut it and all sorts of stuff . "
Including the music ?
" No .
Our music was lauded and applauded all the way through . "

He 's so dry .
In print that looks cocky ; in person , he emphasises the words so carefully it 's funny .
He 's serious , though , about the effect the book had on him .
" For me , it turned into a real weepy .
The last 15 pages of that book , you 're bawling your eyes out . "
Stories about fathers and sons touch a nerve for Cave .
He was 19 years old and being held in a Melbourne police station for burglary when he was told that his father , an English teacher called Colin , had died in a car crash .
He has four sons .
Two of them were born in 1991 , to women on different continents ( other singers have to make this stuff up ) .
Now he lives with his wife Susie Bick , a former model , and their seven - year - old twins Arthur and Earl .
" I 've just written a novel , " he says .
" That 's a father and son thing . "
The book is called The Death of Bunny Munro , the name of the protagonist , his son and his father .
" He 's a door - to - door hand cream salesman and general predator .
Sex maniac . "
The book is set along the south coast of England .
" Terrible things happen in Rottingdean .
Den of iniquity . "
Cave lives in the top floor of this block in Hove , overlooking the sea .
" I officially leave the house .
I put on a suit and come to work . "
He means this literally : today , he 's in blue pinstripe .
Does n't he ever stroll down in his trackie bottoms ?
Cave stares .
The temperature drops .
Bats fly , cobwebs quiver , an old door creaks .
" I do n't , " he says slowly , " have any trackie bottoms . "
Really ?
Why not ?
" Well , they do something weird to your crotch , do n't they ?
You can't walk around in them . "
I can .
If I was going to roll out of bed and slide down here to browse among the many books , sit at the beautiful black piano and play with the chords to " Changes " by David Bowie and " A Hard Day 's Night " by the Beatles ( both on his music stand ) I might do it in my trackies .
On the shelf are what look suspiciously like running shorts and shoes .
( Trot out in those and he 'll look like a 118 ad . )
So is he really saying that if he 's going to be on his own in here all day , he still wears a suit ?
" Yeah .
I do actually . "
Why ?
" I just always have .
I do n't know how to answer that . "
Pause .
" There is a period of preparation that happens upstairs .
You know , I wo n't go into the details but I ready myself for the day .
I am a high - maintenance type of guy . "
The hair is dyed , we know that .
Always has been .
The ' tache and sideburns too , with a little brush .
" It seems to work in some way , formally preparing for whatever happens down here . "
This is not about the way he is seen by others , apparently .
" I find myself mildly embarrassing .
I think , ' Oh , I must look ridiculous . '
I am often in scenarios where I should n't be dressed as I am . "
A trip to Asda , maybe ?
More chills .
More bats .
" I do n't , " he says slowly , " really do Asda . "
No .
Fair enough , rock star .
But is n't turning up to the office every day in a suit contrary to everything we imagine about artistic creativity ?
" Is it ?
Most people wait for the muse to turn up .
That 's terribly unreliable .
I have to sit down and pursue the muse by attempting to work .
If I do n't , I 'm not much use . "
How so ?
" If I 'm hanging around too much , my wife and kids say , ' Hey , why do n't you go downstairs and start a new novel ? ' "
It keeps the black dog at bay .
" If I 'm not working , all the attendant doubts come roaring in . "
This discipline has emerged in the last 10 years or so , out of the chaos of his past , " I can do this because I 'm not a junkie . "
He was a heroin addict .
" You can have a music career and be a junkie , because you 're only required to write 13 or 14 songs every two years or so .
That ai n't hard .
But if you want to do other things , like novels or films , you can 't .
Sadly . "
The smile again .
He does that a lot , I realise .
The gothic look , the heavy imagery , frame a sense of humour as dry as the Outback .
He deadpans everything .
" People are always surprised to see clues to my being a normal kind of guy .
As if I 'm somehow letting the team down . "
It does feel odd when he brings in a drink in a floral cup .
But he does it with swagger .
" There .
You can say Nick Cave made you a cup of tea . "
Other people have done the same , I say .
" Who ?
Who 's the most famous person who has ever made you cup of tea ? "
I rack my brain for one who will impress him .
And fail .
" Any good cup of tea anecdotes ? " No . " Oh . "
His eyes move from the cup to me .
" Well , " he says , as I take a sip .
" Anyway ... I spat in yours . "

Let ’s keep our homes warm , happy , clean and green this winter !
The green revolution is n’t just about doing right by the planet .
It ’s also about doing right by our pocketbooks .
Clean energy – A clean furnace is an efficient furnace .
Check your filters , check your ducts , dust off radiators ( dust insulates them and keeps heat in ) .
Replacing a furnace filter is cheap , and dirty filters cut your efficiency and can cut your furnace ’s lifespan .
Get your furnace inspected and maintained – a badly tuned furnace wastes $ 30 a month on average , so this pays for itself very quickly .
And make sure your vents are n’t blocked by furniture – that cuts efficiency , too .
Heat Smart – First , drop the temp ; each degree you cut clips 3 to 8 percent from your bill .
Next , get wet – moist air holds heat better and FEELs warmer .
You can add a humidifier to your furnace , buy a freestanding one , or just keep a kettle on the stove pumping out steam .
You ’ll feel the difference within minutes .
Thermostat Timer –
This is actually the only piece of high - tech on our list .
Putting it in is an easy do - it - yourselfer ; programming can be trickier , but once you get the hang of it you can save 10 percent or more .
Many even now come pre-programmed to drop the temperature during down - times , like work hours during the day or when you ’re all in bed at night , and then bring up the temp just before you come home or wake up , so you ’re always comfy .
Circulation – Heat rises .
Use your ceiling fans to circulate air ( or install them if you do n’t them , and get the cooling benefit in summer as well ) .
Cut back on using kitchen and bathroom ventilation fans for the season – they suck your valuable warm air right out of the house .
Also , close off rooms that are n’t being used , and shut the heat vents in there .
Insulate – Got insulation ?
Better check – bats can sag , leaving gaps , and animals can slip in , making holes .
Now ’s the time to make sure by taking a quick look .
Also , make sure you ’re covered all over – attics and crawl spaces might have been overlooked .
Need insulation ?
This can be a big ticket item , but compared to the average $ 1900 cost of heating a home , it ’s a no -brainer .
And adding insulation does n’t just save you money now – it adds to your home ’s value .
Along with replacing old drafty windows , and replacing an old , inefficient furnace , this is one investment that pays off both in the short term and the long term .
Talk to your bank about an equity credit line …
Mind the gaps !
– I ’m sure by now you know to caulk and weather - strip around doors and windows , and make sure to cover gaps between doors and thresholds .
But there are a few places you might not have thought of , like electrical outlets .
On outside walls , these can make a gap in your insulation blanket – you can buy small foam inserts that go under the switchplates .
You should also check around pipes under sinks , and fill any gaps with foam .
Of course , you should make a point of keeping all doors and windows closed – and close garage doors as quickly as possible .
And close the chimney damper !
That alone can hit you 10 percent .
Putting a blanket over your fireplace screen when the fireplace is n’t in use can also help cut drafts .
Use the sun ! –
You do n’t have to have an expensive passive solar setup installed ( although that would be great ) – you ’ve got windows , so let the sun in during the day .
It ’ll warm the interior , providing free watts of energy .
Windows of opportunity –
When the sun goes away at night ( or on cloudy days ) keep the blinds , shades and curtains closed to prevent heat from radiating out through the glass ( you could lose 10 to 20 percent of your heat that way ) .
Installing heavy drapes is good , but you can also install 2 - mil plastic sheeting that ups the insulation factor hugely ( put it up with blue painter ’s tape , which leaves less residue ) .
Replace those ancient windows if you can .
Snug in your bed – A thick down comforter might cost a bit , but if you ’re bundled up and cozy you can save a bundle by cutting the heat to 60 degrees while you snooze .
Wood stove – Depending on where you live , installing a wood burning stove can save you quite a bit .
Just make sure you run it efficiently ( pointers here ) .
And splitting wood warms you up like you would n’t believe .
One other important tip – get everyone in the family involved !
Emphasize the planet - saving aspects , and the kids will be happy to join in .
And that ’s a lot easier than yelling at them 10 times a week to keep the darn door closed ….

SEVEN of the Mumbai terrorists were British Pakistanis , Indian government sources claimed last night .
Insiders said two Brits had been arrested and another five suspects were from the UK .
Two of the seven are from Leeds , one is from Bradford and one is from Hartlepool , it was alleged .
Sources claim the Hartlepool suspect was found in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel , where gunmen massacred dozens of guests .
The man from Bradford and one of the men from Leeds were allegedly discovered on the 17th floor of the Trident - Oberoi Hotel .
The second Leeds man was said to have been captured near a jetty after the 25 - strong terror gang landed by speedboat .
Documents found on the suspects confirmed they were British , the sources said .
Other reports said Indian officials checked Blackberry phones used by the gang to follow news reports and found " a lot of content " linked to the UK .
The Foreign Office and MI6 were last night trying to establish the facts .
Government sources stressed that there had been no confirmation from India that British terrorists were involved .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said his Indian counterpart had not told him about UK suspects .
But he said it would be " premature " to draw any conclusions .
AS he sought the presidency for the last two years , Barack Obama liked to say that “ change does n’t come from Washington  change comes to Washington . ”
Nearly three weeks after his election , he is testing voters ’ understanding of that assertion as he assembles a government whose early selections lean heavily on veterans of the political era he ran to supplant .
He showed that in breathtaking fashion by turning to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , his bitter primary rival and the wife of the last Democratic president , for the post of secretary of state .
Mr. Obama will bring pieces of Chicago to the White House in the form of longtime advisers like Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod .
But even after vowing to turn the page on the polarized politics of the baby boom generation , he ’s made clear that service in the Beltway wars of the last 20 years is not only acceptable , but in some cases necessary for his purposes .
At the same time , it raises a question : Could the 47 - year - old president - elect ultimately find himself pulled toward the Washington folkways he has vowed to surmount ?
( CNN ) -- Flooding in Brazil 's Santa Catarina state has left at least 50 dead and more than 20,000 homeless , the state news agency reported Monday .
The rain - fueled flooding in southern Brazil affected 1.5 million residents and cut off five cities -- Rio dos Cedros , Pomerode , Itapoa , Garuva , and Benedito Novo -- from the rest of the nation , Agencia Brasil reported .
Civil defense officials said patients at the Santa Ines Hospital in the beach resort city of Balneario Camboriu were moved to another part of the hospital , the news agency said .
Joao Paulo Kleinubing , the mayor of Blumenau , declared a state of public calamity Sunday night , Agencia Brasil said .
He had declared a state of emergency on Saturday .

Officials were sending two helicopters to Blumenau on Monday to help victims .
Aid also was being sent to the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Parana , which also have been hit hard by flooding , Agencia Brasil said .
Elsewhere , video footage from CNN affiliate TV station Record Internacional showed that heavy rain in Sao Paulo caused part of a roadway to collapse .

The judge said he had " an inability to show remorse " A man with 200,000 computer images and thousands of videos showing child sex abuse has been jailed indefinitely .
Christopher Stubbings , 55 , from Crawley Lane , Kings Bromley , Staffordshire , was one of the ringleaders of a worldwide abuse ring , Stafford Crown Court heard .
He was ordered to serve a minimum of 12 - and - a - half years in jail .
Stubbings had admitted eight offences including indecent assaults on a child under 16 and the commissioning of child abuse videos .
The offences also included distribution of child abuse images and possession of child abuse images .
' Deplorable and depraved '
He was arrested by Staffordshire Police following a two - year investigation involving the FBI and police in Australia .
The court heard when he was interviewed by Staffordshire Police , Stubbings said : " You know what men are like .
Some choose to collect stamps .
I choose to collect images of children . "
Stubbings was at the very heart of this child abuse group
Crown Prosecution Service
The judge , Mrs Justice Macur , said he had " an inability to show remorse , contrition or empathy . "
She added the images were " deplorable and depraved - these children were abused , all of them debased , all of them humiliated " .
In a statement , the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) said he was a co-founder of a worldwide paedophile group consisting of about 60 members and within that group he was second in command and acted as its treasurer .
It added one of his primary roles was to secure funding by direct pleas from him to the group 's members .
The CPS said : " Stubbings was at the very heart of this child abuse group , which used very sophisticated internet encryption techniques to try and avoid detection . "
Det Insp Ronnie Walker , from Staffordshire Police , said afterwards that Stubbings had not shown " any remorse whatsoever " .
Asked about the sentence , Det Insp Walker added : " It truly reflects his level of offending and the seriousness of the nature and the quantity and the levels of depravity shown within those images that we 've recovered . "

The Mandatory Three ( from Jim )
After the dot com bust , I spent a lot of time interviewing .
It was mostly dead ends or companies that were only willing to hire one person to do the job of four ( specifically , the four that they had just laid off ) .
A friend of mine who worked at a school , told me about an IT position there .
Being out of work for so long , I was very eager to get in for an interview , and figured I might have an " in " since he was working there already .
When I arrived at the interview , there were two other candidates waiting .
I was to go in first , and I was informed that all three of the interviews would be done in " rapid fire " succession , and each would take just 30 minutes .
I went into their conference room , and was a bit startled by the fifteen people sitting around the table .
This was known as " The Gauntlet . "
This group of people only asked a few , fairly non-technical questions .
Most seemed bored , and some occasionally looked at their watches and yawned !
Now , I am not the most exciting person in the world , but I am certainly not that boring .
I finished the interview and left feeling quite confused .
What the hell just happened ?
I got a call from my mom later in the day , and I told her about the interview .
Being a teacher , she was familiar with what I had gone through and she explained it to me .
It turns out that in education , every job offered requires at least three interviews to be done , even if the job has already been filled ( most are filled internally ) .
Basically , I was just " filler . "
It now made sense why everybody was bored and just waiting for the interview to be over .
It also made sense why there were two other candidates , and why the interviews were done so quickly and carelessly .
My friend checked it all out for me and confirmed that I was indeed filler .
When I asked why so many people for a " filler " interview , I was told that it was the law .
What a complete waste of everybody 's time !
The lesson here is :
If you go on an interview for an educational institution , and your interview is way too quick and simple , chances are you are just " filler " .
Do yourself a favor and run from the interview if you see yawning !
Ironically , I now work for a university , where I see many " fillers " come in for interviews .
The poor bastards !
The Easy Road to Success ( from Paul H. )
I was working for a large Swiss bank in a risk analysis department .
We were dealing with pretty complex deals which required lots of processing time and had very little time to work , so we had built a grid to handle it .
Our systems kept very close watch on the grid , opting for our own job queue instead of what the grid offered .
As such , we needed people who knew a few things about programming .
I have no idea where the candidates came from , but we had put the word out that we were looking for senior developers .
The candidates would come to us , be interviewed by our dev manager ( who had been promoted because his code was n't worth the disk space it was stored on ) , then get passed to us .
We 'd start the talk with background , basic one - liner questions , then jump to one of our open - ended questions .
Our favorite was " how would you build a priority queue ? "
We 'd explain what a priority queue is , what someone would use it for , tell them it did n't need to be persistable , and let them know it was a real - world exercise , since we had to build one for our project .
Nine times out of ten the answer involved XML .
And people would try to convince us that XML was the best , fastest , and easiest way to go .
My favorite candidate stammered for a few seconds then pulled out a SecurID key fob , acted like it was a Blackberry , and claimed there was a production issue at his job and he had to go .
So after a month of horrible candidates we had a day with three interviews in a row .
Each candidate gave a perfect , clear , correct answer .
So we followed up with a similar , but easier question and all three bombed miserably .
We sat around discussing it at the end of the day and it did n't take long for the dev manager to admit he had given all of them the answer because he was tired of us rejecting candidates .
Relevant Inexperience ( from Adam )
The company I am contracting at are having a recruitment drive ahead of a big government contract .
Since I know a bit about coding I have been asked to scan through the résumés and select the ones that have the relevant experience .
Why the agencies do n't do this is beyond me .
Anyway , I received a résumé recently , and I started to skim through it .
The header of " relevant experience " looked fine until the last entry :
Technology Experience Competency The Italian language 10 years Awful
OK , quite amusing , and on I went to work experience , which had some fairly standard bullet points about AJAX , C# , SQL and so forth .
So far so good .
Then I got to the last bullet point :
I do not understand .NET interfaces as I have never used them .
I 've survived just fine without them so far thank you very much , so if this is a big problem , let 's not waste eachothers ' time , please .
Oh , and you may as well stop reading .
At that point , I stopped reading ( since we use interfaces all over our n- tier apps ) and fired a quick email off to the agent to suggest he reads through the résumés before he passes them along .
Out of curiosity , however , I skimmed through the rest of the résumé .
Here are a few more gems :
Overhauled a dynamic intranet site , using " classic " ASP , for use by a distributed team , to teach myself " web stuff "
( beneath a previous job )
It was here that I taught myself how to program , whilst recuperating from a nasty accident involving a taxi .
It was here that I taught myself how to program , whilst recuperating from a nasty accident involving a taxi .
The system ran like a dog , but it was good for a first attempt .
Needless to say , we all had a good laugh , but he did n't get as far as a technical interview over the phone .
We 've all heard that the Bees in North America and Europe are all disappearing ... but why ?
Well , I might have news for you - they were hiding in my BBQ !
I was planning on using my BBQ this weekend , and figured I might as well clean it out before hand since it had been a while since I last used it .
I have known there were bee 's coming from under the cover so I thought I 'd kill them , obviously ...
Here is the BBQ in question :
And my Bee Bomb !
Preferred weapon of Bee destruction .
Ultimate bee bomb delivery method :
The bomb was super loud .
I could hear it even after I set it off and ran around the corner of my house .
This is what I saw as I walked back : Uh oh ... what do we have here ?
20 mm mass grave of bees
" There was no way they could properly value the assets without wiping out the capital in the banking system , " Hovde told " Squawk Box . "
" There was no way to properly manage the assets ( and ) there was no way to dispose of the assets , without cratering the real - estate markets any further . "
( Watch the accompanying video for the full interview ... )
( The Treasury is a ) " bunch of Goldman Sachs guys , " he said .
" We have a 35 - year - old technology investment banker running the TARP that has no background in financials or in real estate or was around during the last banking crisis . "
" Then they switch and change to what should have been done and that 's injecting capital into the banks , " Hovde said .
" However , they 've even messed that up . "
It was the right decision to start to recapitalize banks , but the fact that the money was given away without more punitive terms — for example allowing some banks to sill pay common stock dividends — has just created more problems , he said .
" Now they 've created this aura where if you do n't take the capital you 're being deemed as an institution that could n't get it so you 're in trouble .
It 's insanity , " he added .
Banks are asking " why not " take the money at terms that are more favorable than getting capital from an investors like Warren Buffett , he said .
Maybe you sent out your traditional , static resume to a few companies to try to land some interviews .
The problem is , 100 other developers did too , and they all have 6 page resumes just like you , packed with the latest eye - catching acronyms and buzz words .
SOA , Ajax , GWT , and on and on …
That ’s the problem : everyone ’s resume looks the same .
The employer can’t really tell who ’s good and who ’s better .
Here ’s where CodersCV comes in .
Send along a link to your CodersCV to the company as well .
When the employer checks it out , she ’ll see your porfolio from different views – a timeline , a summary , an interactive resume , and a technology histogram .
She can quickly get a picture of who you are and what you know , and then drill in for more detail when she sees something interesting .
Your CodersCV is also a great talking point in an interview , or just a good way to publish your portfolio .
Link to it from LinkedIn , Facebook , or your other online profiles .
By the way , CodersCV is not Monster.com , LinkedIn , or Dice .
It ’s just a free service for software developers to publish and manage their portfolio online .
No more , no less !
TOKYO , Nov. 3 ( UPI ) --
The Japanese air force chief of staff was fired for writing an essay in which he said Japan 's wartime aggression was positive , officials said .
Gen . Toshio Tamogami was fired last week after a hotel company announced he won its $ 30,000 " true modern history " essay contest , The Washington Post reported Monday .

Government officials apologized for Tamogami's essay , saying Japan deeply regrets its wartime aggression .
China and South Korea , the main victims of Japan 's wartime Asian attacks , expressed shock and anger .
In his essay , Tamogami argued Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because of a " trap " set by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and that " that many Asian countries take a positive view " of Japan 's role in the war .
Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said Tamogami was fired because a senior military leader " should not make public an opinion opposed to the government 's position . "
In 1995 , then - Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama officially apologized for Japan 's wartime aggression .
However , a minority in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party periodically retreats from the apology , the Post said .
Before becoming prime minister in September , Taro Aso upset the governments of North and South Korea when he praised Japan 's 35 - year colonial occupation of their peninsula .

With fear about the economy driving voters his way , Barack Obama has broadened his lead over John McCain and strengthened his hold on key groups both presidential candidates are courting , a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
Three weeks before election day , Obama leads McCain 50 % to 41 % among voters likely to cast ballots Nov. 4 .
In September , the Illinois Democrat had a 49 % to 45 % lead .
In the weeks between the two surveys , the nation ’s financial system teetered toward collapse , and the poll shows the effect of that upheaval on voters .
Only 10 % now feel the country is heading in the right direction -- the lowest figure since the poll began asking the question in 1991 .
Eighty - four percent said the country was on the wrong track .
Nearly 7 in 10 cited the economy as the most important issue for the presidential candidates to solve -- from 4 in 10 in September -- and Obama was the clear beneficiary .
Voters saw him as more trustworthy than McCain on the economy and better able to handle a financial crisis .

Obama improved sharply over the last month among independent voters , a much - desired bloc .
McCain carried them by a 15 - point margin in September ; in this poll , Obama led by 5 points .
Men , too , moved toward Obama , with the traditionally Republican - leaning group now in his camp .
He also maintained his lead among women .
“ He ’s got more in mind of what the country needs right now , and I just think he would be a better leader than McCain , ” said Betty May , a resident of Ironton , Ohio .
May , a Democrat , spoke in a follow - up interview after being polled .
For McCain , there were slight gains over the last month among older voters and white working - class voters , and he has maintained an edge over Obama when it comes to perceptions of how the candidates would deal with Iraq and foreign affairs .
But the Arizona senator ’s overall level of support declined , in part because his dramatic decision to vault the little - known governor of Alaska onto the ticket appears to have backfired .

More than one - quarter of voters said they were less likely to vote for McCain because Sarah Palin was his running mate , more than the 22 % who said she made them more likely to vote for him .
In September , Palin drew in more voters than she put off .
Forty - three percent of voters felt she was qualified to be president , a far lower percentage than the 76 % who judged Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden as qualified .
Palin was the least popular of the four principal candidates .
But she has accomplished one of the ticket ’s goals : engaging a Republican base that is decidedly less enthusiastic than the Democratic one .
One - third of conservatives , and nearly half of Republicans , said they were more likely to vote for McCain with Palin as his running mate .
Even though the election has been remarkably volatile -- and polls are not predictions -- the survey underscored the predicament in which McCain finds himself :
Much of his recent effort has been aimed at shifting focus from the economy to questions he has raised about Obama ’s character .
But the nation ’s financial difficulties are swamping all other issues .
And tactics that McCain employed to fuel Republican enthusiasm , such as the Palin selection , have alienated other key groups .

McCain also remains tethered to an unpopular president .
Obama has repeatedly pressed the argument that the Republican ’s first term would be akin to George W. Bush ’s third .
Americans generally agreed : 52 % said McCain would continue Bush ’s policies , compared with 42 % who said he would not .
Still , Obama has not broken the race open , largely because of voters like independent Walter Eggers of Perry , Mich .
The retired autoworker said he would vote for McCain because he distrusted Obama ’s economic policies and his background .
“ It ’s either being shot in the head or shot in the foot , ” he said of the choice .
More than anything , Eggers is enraged about the Wall Street and mortgage company titans who , to his mind , have left everyday Americans to pay off excesses as they worry over their own futures .
“ Evidently , I ’ve been a fool for playing by the rules all my life , ” he said .

From Oct. 10 - 13 , the Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg Poll interviewed 1,543 adults , including 1,446 registered voters , 1,030 of them deemed likely to vote .
The margin of sampling error for the poll , conducted by Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
At this juncture , the candidates ’ imperatives are to consolidate their bases and , since neither political party has a clear majority , appeal to enough independents or cross -party voters to carry the day .
Obama was faring better on most fronts .
Both candidates were carrying about 9 in 10 of their party regulars .
Though McCain has targeted supporters of defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama has increased his support among her backers .
Seven in 10 Clinton voters were siding with Obama , up from 6 in 10 in September .
The movement of independents from McCain to Obama over the last month was responsible for much of the Democrat ’s increased lead .
They are also largely responsible for Palin ’s faltering fortunes .

In September , for example , 38 % of independents said her presence on the ticket made them more likely to vote for McCain , while 18 % said it made them less likely .
Now those figures are almost fully reversed , with only 19 % of independents saying they were more likely to vote for McCain because of Palin , to 31 % who said she made them less likely to cast a ballot for the Republicans .
At the same time he was making up ground among independents , Obama was cutting into Republican - allied groups McCain must dominate to win .
More than 1 of every 5 self - described conservatives , for example , was siding with Obama , while only 1 in 14 liberals was siding with McCain .
One in 5 white evangelicals -- the group that forms much of the base of the modern Republican Party -- was choosing the Democrat .
Sixteen percent of those who said they were members of the “ religious right ” were siding with Obama .
And married women , who typically connect strongly with Republicans , were split , with almost half going to each candidate .
In addition , Obama was benefiting from the huge increase in new voters , for which his campaign is partly responsible .
Of those planning to cast their first presidential ballot this year , 58 % were in Obama ’s camp , compared with 34 % for McCain .

Undergirding Obama ’s lead was voters ’ trust in him on their most pressing concern , the economy .
Asked whether they had confidence that Obama had an economic plan that could deal with the crisis , 56 % said yes , compared with 37 % who disagreed .
Asked the same question about McCain , 41 % said he had an acceptable plan , compared with 50 % who disagreed .
In a constellation of related questions , voters chose Obama when asked whom they trusted on the economy , who would do a better job handling the financial crisis , who cares most about people like them and who would change the way business is done in Washington .
The last finding , by a 2 - 1 margin , suggests voters are repudiating McCain ’s reform pitch .
A tantalizing question as the election nears is the impact of Obama ’s biracial background .
Though pollsters disagree over whether voters answer questions about race honestly , in the survey only 8 % of registered voters said that Obama ’s race caused them reservations about voting for him .
That group sided with McCain , 50 % to 36 % ; those who professed to be untroubled by race went for Obama , 50 % to 40 % .

Among the latter was Eddie Harrison of Brenham , Texas , a 77 - year - old African American and Democrat , who believes that election day will show that “ things have changed ” in America .
“ This is what we ’ve been fighting for all my life , ” he said .
“ I would n’t dare miss this vote . ”

How the poll was conducted : The Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg Poll contacted 1,543 adults nationwide by telephone Friday through Monday .
Included are 1,446 registered voters and 1,030 likely voters .
Likely voters were determined by a screening process that includes intention , certainty , political activism and enthusiasm about voting as well as vote history .
First - time voters were not excluded .
Telephone numbers were chosen randomly in separate samples of landline and cellphone exchanges in the nation , allowing listed and unlisted numbers to be contacted , and multiple attempts were made to contact each number .
Cellphone exchanges were hand - dialed .
The cell and landline samples were combined and adjusted for sample size and non-response .
Adults in the combined sample were adjusted to the most recent estimates from the National Health Interview Survey for household phone types and to census proportions of sex , ethnicity , age , education and national region .
The margin of sampling error for adults , registered voters and likely voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points in each case .
For smaller subgroups , the error margin may be higher .
Survey results may also be affected by combining samples and by factors such as question wording and the order in which they are asked .
Interviews were conducted by Interviewing Service of America Inc. in Van Nuys .

The US has carried out attacks in Pakistan in recent months
The US has carried out nearly a dozen anti-terror attacks in Pakistan , Syria and elsewhere in the past four years , the New York Times has reported .
The previously unreported attacks were authorised in 2004 by Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the Times quoted senior officials as saying .
The order gave US forces permission to attack terror targets anywhere in the world without prior specific approval .
The Times said the defence department declined to comment on its claims .
The White House also made no comment .
' Called off '
The paper said it had spoken to more than six officials , " including current and former military and intelligence officials " as well as senior policy makers in the Bush administration .
They said that the order , signed by Mr Rumsfeld with the approval of President George W Bush , was intended to make it easier for the US military to act outside officially declared war zones at short notice .
In total , 15 to 20 countries were covered by the mandate and attacks had been carried out in Pakistan , Syria and " several other countries , " the paper reported .
Some were conducted in coordination with the CIA and one was broadcast live to CIA headquarters in Virginia , via cameras mounted on aircraft .
The paper 's sources also claimed that " as many as a dozen " attacks had been called off - " often to the dismay of military commanders " - due to lack of evidence or because they were considered too dangerous or " diplomatically explosive " .
The US has carried out many attacks along Pakistan 's border areas recently and was blamed for an attack in eastern Syria last month .

Rachel Maddow goes through some of the dirty tricks we 've already seen happening in various locations across the country and empowers us all to not let anyone steal your vote .
After eight years of perhaps the most incompetent government in American history , we‘ve got one way to fix it now , one way to exchange a president who is more despised by his own people than any other president in the time that polls existed .
Choose who you will , but do not give up the power to choose by letting anyone or anything stop you from voting .
Transcripts below the fold
There is bad news and good news this election eve .
The bad news , there ‘s a crime wave going on .
People are trying to steal from you as we speak - steal , rob , burgle , pilfer , abscond .
That is the bad news .
The good news ?
Unlike most arch - criminals , these thieves can be stopped if you just ignore them .
Can you imagine if Batman could have ignored the Joker ?
Holy simple solution .
Well , what treasure do these thugs want from you ?
They want your vote .
They want your power .
Anyone who tells you , you can vote by phone in this election is lying and trying to steal your vote .
You can not cast your vote by phone .
Anyone tells you , you are risking arrest or traffic tickets or outstanding warrants by turning up and voting tomorrow , they are lying to you and trying to steal your vote .
You will not be arrested at your polling place .
Anyone who tells that you are expected to show up to vote on Wednesday instead of on Tuesday because of high expected turnout or something , they are lying to you and they are trying to steal your vote .
The last day to vote is tomorrow , Tuesday .
If anyone threatens your college financial aid or tells you your parents will not be able to claim you as a dependent on their taxes anymore , if you vote where your college is instead of where your parents live , say it with me now , they are lying to you and are trying to steal your vote .
The Supreme Court has affirmed that college students have the right to vote where they go to school .
Now , in an ideal world , candidates would each try to persuade the largest possible number of Americans that they ‘d be the better elected official .
And that ‘s how elections would go .
Who ever persuaded more Americans to their side would win .
In the real world , there ‘s a whole lot of hullabaloo and holy - baloney that gets in between us deciding who we want to vote for and our votes actually getting cast and counted .
First , it ‘s the voter registration purges .
With election officials looking to produce the smallest possible roster of eligible voters , kicking people off the voter rolls for squinting in their ID photo or whatever .
Then , it ‘s the allocation of voting machines and poll workers and the restricted polling place hours to ensure that you have to be able to afford to wait in line a really , really , really long time if you want the privilege - I mean , the right of casting that precious ballot .
Then it ‘s these last - minute dirty tricks that fall somewhere between mob tactics and the kind of prank calls that Bart Simpson makes to Moe ‘s bar , “ Is Mr. Kaholic there ?
Al Kaholic ? ”
Voters in Virginia have been getting these flyers with the seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia on them , the letterhead of the Virginia State Board of Elections .
And they tell them that if they ‘re planning on voting for a Democratic candidate , they should show up the day after Election Day .
Robo calls in the Pittsburgh area are telling voters the same thing .
Voters in Broward County , Florida have been getting calls that sound like they ‘re from the county election supervisor inviting them to vote by phone instead of at the polling place .
Same thing in Nevada , where Latino voters are being targeted with the same vote by phone scam .
At Drexel University in Philly , flyers warning students that voting would cause them to risk arrest at the polling place .
Here ‘s what I think about this anti-democratic , “ steal your vote , screw the heroes who died for this right , ” underhanded , cowardly , sniveling , illegally intimidating and misleading , unpatriotic , anti-American , bull pucky .
I ‘m not crazy about it .
And since it ‘s illegal , and since it happens to a greater or lesser degree in every election now , it would be nice to see this stuff get prosecuted every once in a while .
In the meantime , we can all fight back by not being intimidated , not getting tired , not letting the obstacle course they are making you run through keep you from exercising your right as an American to participate in this big group decision we call democracy .
After eight years of perhaps the most incompetent government in American history , we‘ve got one way to fix it now , one way to exchange a president who is more despised by his own people than any other president in the time that polls existed .
Choose who you will , but do not give up the power to choose by letting anyone or anything stop you from voting .
Bob Chapman | November 12 , 2008
Recently the fane - stream media was asking how our free enterprise system of capitalism could have failed us so utterly .
How , they asked , could we have gotten into this disaster if bad investments were properly weeded out in a timely manner by the markets , and were not allowed to accumulate to such devastating levels of toxicity , as they should have been in such a system ?
These people are either morons , or liars , or both .
This is not the failure of a free enterprise system of capitalism because our economy is no longer based on a free enterprise system of capitalism , and has not been for at least two decades .
Any pretense of a free enterprise system of capitalism ended when , in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 , which crash was orchestrated by the Illuminati during Paul Volcker 's term at the helm of the Fed to provide the excuse needed , President Reagan signed an Executive Order forming the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , also known as the Plunge Protection Team , or PPT , which has , ever since , totally and completely dominated and manipulated virtually all markets worldwide on a 24/7 basis .
The PPT 's authority and mandate are illegally abused on a daily basis .
This group of Illuminist players , which include Caligula , as President , Hanky Panky as Treasury Secretary , Buck - Busting Ben as Fed Chairman , and firms like Goldman Sachs as financial henchmen , are supposed to step in during a crisis .
They are not supposed to be sticking their nose into everyone 's business on a daily basis worldwide .
We have become the envy of Russia and China , because Illuminist control over our markets exceeds their control over their command economies by an order of magnitude .
We have perfected the corporatist , fascist business model via the Illuminati , who form our shadow government of puppet - masters .
Russia and China are still amateurs .
Everything that Russia and China have learned they have learned from us .
That is because we helped to create them and make them what they are today .
They are the best enemies that money can buy .
After all , the Illuminati need various and numerous scapegoats on whom they can pin the blame for all the fallout caused by their malevolent , despicable and nefarious operations .
They need victims to sacrifice on the alter of world government .
By using the Fed 's repo pool to provide tens of billions of dollars to fund their operations whenever needed , the PPT once destroyed the ruble and the Russian economy , and has parked over two trillion dollars worth of latent US inflation , in the Chinese and Japanese economies alone , via treasury and agency debt purchased by these nations with their surplus trade dollars that they have gained through illegal currency manipulations that have been allowed , and even encouraged , until recently , by the PPT .
The PPT has allowed them to artificially devalue their currencies to achieve unfair trade advantages so the Fed can hide the inflation it has caused through profligate growth of the money supply from the US sheople .
The Chinese , Japanese and EU trade surpluses have also been created and fostered by the free trade , globalism , off - shoring , outsourcing , and both legal and illegal immigration agendas which have brought our auto industries to their knees and have sent our manufacturing industry and our good - paying jobs overseas .
And soon that PPT - fostered dam of US debt is going to break along with all the other treasuries and agencies dammed up worldwide , thus totally Weimarizing us and destroying the dollar and its reserve status .
Such an event is what will pave the way for a regional , and later a world , currency .
That , in turn , is how the evil and despicable Illuminati will bring us into world government .
They will control the world 's supply of money , and thus they will be able to do as they please when it comes to political control , ala Rothschild : " Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation , and I care not who makes its laws . "
That line of reasoning can be extended from control of a nation 's money supply , to control of the world 's money supply , and thus leaders worldwide can be made into Illuminist puppets as has been done to most of the leaders of Western Civilization already .
A free enterprise system of capitalism also requires an underlying system of laws by which the game may be played fairly by all parties , and a legal system by which differences may be fairly adjudicated .
Without a system of rules and proper enforcement devices , the fallen natures of men will take over and any sense of freedom and fairness in markets is thus lost .
Our laws and judicial system have been completely and totally perverted because our politicians and judges , with few exceptions , are all bought - and - paid for or are compromised by the skeletons in their closets , which are usually large and numerous .
The US Constitution is thus ignored , and is treated as if it were nothing but worthless piece of paper , like our fiat Federal Reserve notes .
A cadre of malevolent elitists make all the rules , and then break them at will , holding only non-elitists accountable because they control the system of laws , and the system for enforcing those laws .
That is not a basis upon which any free enterprise system of capitalism can be based .
That is type of system that underlies crony capitalism and a corporatist , fascist police state , which is what we now have .
So do n't blame our current debacles on what started out as our free enterprise system of capitalism .
That dream is long since gone , discarded on the scrap heap of history .
Benchmark borrowing costs have been coming down worldwide and as in Japan the world will be flooded with interest free money .
Zero interest rates are on the horizon , which means we could be in for a protracted recession / depression , as Japan has experienced since 1992 .
What all these countries know is that Japan never was able to recover and stayed in depression for years .
Had it not been for an undervalued currency and export markets left wide open to them in the US and then China , they would have collapsed long ago .
Now that everyone is in the same recessionary boat those opportunities are only open to them in a limited way .
Now every country in the world faces the same problem and the same results .
The world public is cutting back on spending and are now paying off debt and saving irrespective of the return on capital .
The mindset has changed and could remain that way for years .
It is called a race to zero rates .
Toward that end England just cut rates 1.5 % to 3 % , the biggest cut in 16 years and the ECB cut rates ½ % to 3.25 % .
Reductions also took place in Denmark , the Czech republic and Switzerland .
The Bank of Japan cut to 0.3 % .
It is its first cut in seven years to 0.2 % .
South Korea cut for the third time in a month .
We see contraction in the world economy , probably to an overall growth rate of 2 % in 2009 .
In the US , Western Europe and Japan we are looking for negative growth of 3 % to 5 % .
Experts are predicting 3 % inflation in Europe and the US .
They obviously overlooked the massive amount of money and credit being created by central banks along with zero interest rates .
The world economy has n’t had negative growth since 1945 , so you can see the world is in for a real wakeup call .
It will be interesting to see if banks lend when rates approach zero .
If they do n’t you can expect mass nationalization .
The current problem is that market rates are above where central banks have their rates and that is n’t going to change anytime soon .
Eventually governments will have to guarantee all loans .
Credit standards for loans to companies and individuals have been tightening for 16 months and it is getting even tighter .
Millions of workers are losing their jobs worldwide as economies retrench .
Joblessness is the highest in 14 years in the US .
As rates fall lenders are not passing on the savings to borrowers when they do lend .
Central banks are betting that negative real interest rates will induce people to spend rather than save money that is declining in value .
What they are now facing is a full - blown recession .
The mindset has changed .
People are frightened and rightly so .
Thus , banks will loosen up and lend and some companies and people will borrow .
That will delay the inevitable for 2 or 3 years .
Then when all the cards are played we ’ll enter depression .
Officially the economy lost 651,000 jobs in three months , unofficially the figure was more than double that .
That is because our government lies about its statistics and counts part - time workers .
These figures were accompanied by equally dreadful auto and retail sales .
These kinds of figures should have shown up eight years ago , but they were delayed by the real estate bubble and the massive creation of money and credit .
Now , in spite of a massive infusion of money and credit by central banks to banks , financial firms and some elitist transnational corporations , household , corporate and municipal borrowers have been frozen out , as have the leveraged speculation community .
The Wild West atmosphere of Wall Street is over , but the massive damage it created will linger on for years .
The criminally rated mortgage securitizations are finally dead forever .
First the Fed tried selective bailouts .
Then they tried throwing money at banking , Wall Street and even general corporations .
Thus far neither have worked , but they have kept deflation at bay .
You have seen the hundreds of billions of dollars poured into our economy and foreign economies , but speculators and risk takers are still having to liquidate holdings and de-leverage , because lenders are cutting back loans , or just wo n’t lend .
These actions by lenders has caused a $ 10 trillion collapse .
The bottom line is yes banks are doing very little lending , but the entire lending apparatus is not moving funds from one place to the other .
This is called disintermediation .
The market segments are close to frozen and there is no end in sight .
In addition , there has been a loss of confidence in the derivatives market .
We believe the banks will lend within the next three to six months .
We ’ll then have a recovery in the economy , which will be short lived .
That will bring temporary relief , monetize funds , increase inflation substantially and that will send gold and silver substantially higher .
Lawrence H. Summers was forced out of the Harvard presidency for formulating a personality cult , displaying supreme arrogance , being dismissive of most everyone and being biased against women .
As Clinton ’s Treasury Secretary he rejected warnings from Brooksley Born at that time head of the CFTC regarding the regulation of derivatives .
Summers called her up and scrammed at Ms. Born , who resigned as a result and who has since proved to be correct , and Summers wrong .
Summers is one nasty piece of work .
Others being considered for Treasury Secretary are former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker , who would be an excellent choice .
The question is can he handle the job as he did 25 years ago .
He is in his 80s .
Another possibility is Timothy Geithner former head of the NY Fed , a protégé of Henry Kissinger .
Summers is calling for more economic stimulus packages - essentially give a - ways – that wo n’t work .
They are stalling measures .
We see that sales of weapons have boomed over the last three months and particularly since the election .
One large wholesaler sold 20,000 AR - 15s in just several days .
Another factor generally overlooked is the growing inequality in US cities that could lead to widespread social unrest and a major increase in deaths .
The cities most vulnerable are Washington , DC , Atlanta , New Orleans and Miami .
This inequality has economic and political consequences that could well destabilize society .
The problem simply is that no matter what all central banks do they cannot stop or stave off financial collapse .
No matter how much money and credit they create and how low they take interest rates , the world is facing a depression of epic proportions .
The forced injection of liquidity into banking systems is severe and it can only become greater until the bubble breaks .
There is now savings to build on and why would anyone save with almost zero interest rates ?
The only place your funds are safe is in gold and silver assets , there is nothing else .
Every second that more money and credit is created your currency is worth less .
A lower interest rate penalizes savers and producers .
Low interest rates and major creation of money and credit eventually kill an economy .
There is no incentive to save and produce .
Our new president will provide what is needed with the help of Congress during this process to create a welfare state , where the state will provide .
That is not difficult when control of banking , Wall Street , money and a great part of major corporations are nationalized .
Government will distribute and redistribute money and credit as the new one world government is created .
A reflection of dollar creation was that foreign official purchases of US Treasuries fell from $ 10.1 billion in July to $ 4.8 billion in August .
Even Japan sold $ 7.5 billion worth .
It was 4 years ago we forecast $ 750 billion in homeowner losses .
Now Bloomberg is talking about $ 855 billion .
Where were they four years ago ?
Subscribers who wanted to sell should have done so 3 to 3 - 1/ 2 years ago .
The Bloombergs of this world and the rest of the mainline media missed it all .
And , that was n’t coincidence , it was deliberate , the people who run things knew what was coming .
Yes , inflation has temporarily eased from 13 - 5/8 % to 12 - 1/2 % , but wait a few months .
It will move back up again .
Inflation is n’t going to slow down – how can it with the tremendous flow of liquidity .
In the third quarter federal spending grew at 13.8 % to help inflation along .
Considering all this Mr. Obama has promised us the process of redistributing income .
He has said he will propose a tax on worldwide income of American multi-nationals who are hiding their wealth offshore at 35 % the world ’s second highest .
He would institute a windfall profits tax on oil companies and would increase capital gains taxes to 20 % next year .
There is plenty of reason for the stock and bond markets to react in fear with the VIX at an all - time high of 89.5 .
The VIX is a contrarian indicator .
When it is where it is today it is telling you the markets are headed down .
Do n’t get fooled by historic averages and declines .
This bear market stands alone by itself as some thing very special .
The Dow could easily fall over 70 % this time from its high of 14,100 into the 3,800 to 4,200 zone .
The 8 cartel banks cannot keep on engineering recovery rallies .
It is impossible to keep this balancing act going indefinitely .
Home prices still have a long way to go on the downside and the correction will probably overshoot to the downside .
This , of course , will add more and more foreclosures .
In addition , the industrial sector is collapsing simultaneously .
Factory activity has fallen 20 % over the past two months , the lowest since 1982 , and factory orders are the lowest since 1980 .
Vehicle sales have collapsed and that sector makes up 13 % of America ’s payroll .
We are looking at prolonged stagnation and the demise of GM , Ford and Chrysler .
What else could you expect of the American economy ?
Free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing have stolen five million American jobs and it still continues to do so .
The Fed and our banks along with Wall Street have destroyed our financial system , what else would you expect to happen ?
Just to show you the affect of all the US slowdown , Japan a big exporter to the US showed a 37.5 down from 45.4 in September , the lowest on record , after contracting for nine straight months .
Toyota ’s US sales fell 23 % and Honda ’s 26 % .
Not to be left out China ’s manufacturing index is off to 45.2 , the lowest level since its inception in June 2004 .
Manufacturing accounts for 42 % of GDP .
It is no wonder China is going to inject $ 586 billion into its economy .
67,000 Chinese factories have already been shut down in just the first half of the year .
It looks like 100,000 will bite the dust by the end of the year .
London ’s interest rates already at 3 % are headed to 2 % by February .
That would be the lowest interest rate since 1694 .
Bank of England governor Mervyn King sees the economy entering waters that have n’t been seen since Charles Dickens .
October house prices fell 2.2 % mom , the 9th successive decline and off 15.75 % yoy .
In the last four months Brits saw homeowners with negative equity rise to 335,000 from 250,000 .
By 2010 , one million could be in that boat .
The UK has the same problem as the US , Spain and Ireland , plunging home prices and a credit crisis .
Even though the pound has fallen 24 % versus the dollar , their export orders fell to 43.5 , the lowest since September 2001 .
When you see numbers like that you know imports and exports are freezing up .
Now you can see why we again see war on the horizon .
The third quarter showed us that disposable income dropped at an 8.7 % rate , the steepest on record dating from 1947 .
Consumer spending fell 3.1 % , the first drop since the last quarter of 1991 .
Durable goods spending fell at the sharpest rate since 1991 .
Spending on non-durables fell at the sharpest rate since 1950 .
Wait until the 4th quarter figures are released in late January .
Sarah Palin says she and John McCain lost because the GOP ticket ' represented too much of the status quo . '
Palin : GOP ticket was too ‘ status quo ’
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Sunday that she and running mate John McCain lost because the Republican ticket “ represented too much of the status quo . ”
In an interview with the Anchorage Daily News posted on the paper ’s site Monday morning , Palin pointed a finger at the Bush administration for souring the GOP brand , adding that it was “ amazing ” that the McCain campaign did as well as it did .

“ I think the Republican ticket represented too much of the status quo , too much of what had gone on in these last eight years , that Americans were kind of shaking their heads like going , wait a minute , how did we run up a $ 10 trillion debt in a Republican administration ?
How have there been blunders with war strategy under a Republican administration ? ”
Palin said .
“ If we ’re talking change , we want to get far away from what it was that the present administration represented , and that is to a great degree what the Republican Party at the time had been representing .
So people desiring change , I think , went as far from the administration that is presently seated as they could .
It 's amazing that we did as well as we did . ”
Looking back on the race , the Alaska governor said that she was “ frustrated ” by misinformation spread about her , especially related to her family .
“ Some of the goofy things , like who was Trig 's mom .
Well , I 'm Trig 's mom , and do you want to see my medical records to prove that ?
And banning books .
That was a ridiculous thing also that could have so easily been corrected just by a reporter taking an extra step and not basing a report on gossip or speculation , ” Palin said .
“ Just looking into the record .
It was reported that I tried to ban Harry Potter when it had n't even been written when I was the mayor .
So , gosh , we have so many examples , I mean every day , especially the first few weeks , every day something that was thrown out there . ”
After railing against earmarks and congressional spending on the campaign trail , Palin promised “ fewer earmark requests ” for projects “ that can help on a national front , not just on a state front . ”
Asked about running for the Republican nomination in 2012 , the Alaska governor seemed cool to the prospect , pointing out that current polling showing favorable prospects in a potential GOP primary field are likely to shift .
“ Look how fickle poll numbers are , ” Palin said .
“ Look where I 've gone , up and down , up and down , even in the state of Alaska the last couple of months .
We can't pay attention to those numbers . ”
PayPal founder Peter Thiel 's Clarium was doing great though the summer , up 58 % for the year .
But since then ?
Whoops .
Bloomberg : Clarium Capital Management LLC , the hedge - fund firm run by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel , slumped 18 percent in October , its biggest monthly decline , because of losses on bonds .
The firm 's Clarium LP fund reported a year - to - date loss of about 3 percent , wiping out the 58 percent gain it made in the first half , according to estimates given to investors .
``Clarium is known for taking large risks , and their performance reflects that , '' said Patrik Safvenblad , head of hedge - fund research in Stockholm for DnB NOR ASA , Norway 's biggest bank .
``Investors can get overly optimistic that periods of strong performance will continue ' '...
Clarium had 81 percent of its money in positions used by investors when they expect a widening spread , or gap , between bond yields , such as for 10 - year Treasury notes and 30 - year bonds .
Instead , yield spreads narrowed in October .
Armel Leslie , a spokesman for the San Francisco - based firm , declined to comment .
Thiel , who manages $ 5.2 billion , trades everything from stocks to commodities , seeking to profit from broad economic trends , a strategy known as macro investing .
How could Peter lose so much so fast ?
L-E-V-E-R-A-G- E .
( What does that mean ?
Gambling .
Wait , sorry .
It means " borrowing a ton of money from your friends before you walk into the casino . " )
Clarium borrowed $ 4.40 for every $ 1 in equity capital invested as of Oct. 31 , compared with $ 3.90 for every $ 1 a week earlier , according to the investor letter .
Thiel , 41 , started Clarium in 2002 after selling online - payments service PayPal to EBay Inc. for $ 1.5 billion .
The hedge fund has gained more than fourfold since starting in 2002 .
In the context of the rest of the hedge - fund industry and global capital markets , of course , the year - to - date results are just dandy .
Still , a 40 % loss in three months hurts .

The Bush administration is pushing its bailout plan by claiming the only way to save the economy is by having the federal government buy $ 700 billion worth of bad paper from big financial firms that screwed up .
Conservatives should hate this because it is a massive federal intervention in the market .
Liberals should hate this because it ’s a handout to the richest people and companies in America .
But the Bush administration and Wall Street are insisting it ’s the end of the world and this is the only choice .
Well , is it this or nothing ?
Many on Capitol Hill — especially Democrats — are buying the general premise of the White House plan but insisting on lipstick - on - a - pig modifications involving CEO compensation , taxpayer protection , and oversight and transparency .
But are there other approaches to the problem besides putting the Treasury in charge of a $ 700 billion fire sale ?
Yup .
Here ’s a quick roundup .
(1) The Planners : The Republican Study Committee , a group of some of the most conservative Republicans in Congress .
The Plan : Two - year suspension of the capital gains and dividend taxes to “ encourag[e ] corporations to sell unwanted assets . ”
The Problem : It wo n’t work .
Over at Time , Justin
Fox says the RSC plan “ seems to be a joke , ” and explains that it would just make matters worse by actually discouraging banks from unloading bad mortgage - backed securities .
(2) The Planners : Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) and some House Republicans .
The Plan : Instead of having the Treasury buy mortgage - backed securities outright , insure them and charge premiums , paid to the government .
The Problem :
It almost certainly wo n’t work .
Marc Ambinder has a great explanation of why , but a commenter at Time sums most of it up in a sentence : “ Writing insurance requires either a long history of past events or , at a minimum , knowledge of present market prices . ”
There is neither a long history of past events nor a knowledge of present market prices in this case .
In fact , as Ambinder points out , there ’s not even a market for the products that would be insured .
That ’s the fundamental problem , and insuring them would n’t fix it .
(3) The Planner : Our own James K. Galbraith , an economist .
The Plan : Prop up the FDIC .
Eliminate the “ pointless ” $ 100,000 cap on deposit insurance , put a half - trillion dollars in the FDIC fund , give it extra funding for more employees , and keep another $ 200 billion in reserve .
( There ’s more in Jamie ’s article , but the FDIC part is the heart of the plan . )
The Problem :
It may good policy , but so far , there are few takers in Washington .
And there ’s no major political constituency advocating for it in the way that Wall Street is calling for a buy - me - out bailout .
(4) The Planner : Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - Ver. ) .
The Plan : Make the rich pay for the bailout .
Impose a temporary surtax on incomes over $ 1 million .
Pass an economic recovery package that puts people back to work .
Then re-regulate and break up any companies that are “ too big to fail . ”
The Problem : See # 3 .
(5) The Planner : Hedge Fund Gazillionaire John Paulson .
The Plan : Buy Wall Street .
No , seriously : Paulson thinks taxpayers ( or , more specifically , the Treasury ) should buy huge amounts of senior preferred stock in banks .
Kevin has more on this , which he points out essentially means nationalizing troubled banks .
The Problem :
This plan essentially means nationalizing troubled banks .
Conservatives will be queasy about it ; even Kevin Drum , a liberal , is queasy about it .
Have you come across any other alternative plans ?
Do you have any suggestions of your own ?

( CNN ) -- Until recently , Navy veteran Joe O'Boyle had no home .
Joe O'Boyle found a home with the help of Pathways to Housing , a New York - based nonprofit .
For 15 years , he was a nomad wandering the streets of his native New York before he got help from Pathways to Housing , a nonprofit organization .
O'Boyle spent two of his homeless years underground , riding the trains of the city 's subway system .
" I had nothing to do , so I rode the trains .
I got to know the whole subway system like the back of my hand , " O'Boyle said .
" The E train used to end at the World Trade Center .
That was the best train to ride in the winter , you know ; it did n't go out into the open . "
Watch O'Boyle talk about his life on the street »
O'Boyle was just one of about 154,000 veterans who call the streets home .
Some find help through the Department of Veterans Affairs , which has approved funding for about 15,000 beds this year in transitional housing programs and provides approximately 5,000 veterans each year with residential services in VA hospital - based programs .
This leaves up to 134,000 veterans to fend for themselves .
Private and nonprofit organizations , including New York - based Pathways to Housing , step in where the VA leaves off .
Psychologist Sam Tsemberis , Pathways ' founder and executive director , acknowledges the work the VA does but says nongovernmental organizations are essential to " take up the slack . "
He estimates that veterans make up 20 percent of his clients , or about 125 of the 650 people the organization is currently housing , which reflects the national average of homeless veterans to nonveteran homeless .
" People who were mentally ill , living on the streets of the city in an intolerable unbearable condition " prompted Tsemberis to start Pathways .
The Pathways to Housing model is called " housing first . "
The approach makes housing a top priority , even in treating homeless who have psychiatric disabilities and addiction .
More traditional organizations require a person to be sober and stable before giving them their own place to live .
This usually requires an uphill battle of up to two years of living in a shelter and meeting a number of requirements .
Tsemberis believes that putting his clients in a place of their own is paramount in achieving success with their counseling and stabilization , as is the case with O'Boyle .
" You have to separate the treatment needs from the housing needs , which is what we were able to do for him .
Give him a place to live so that he can feel safe and secure first , and then he 's interested in helping himself with his psychiatric or addiction issues , employment issues .
All of the issues follow the security of housing . "
Pathways has a branch in Washington as well as a newly opened branch in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Tsemberis says he 's been contacted by a number of other organizations , such as Horizon House in Philadelphia and Coalition for the Homeless in Denver , to discuss the successful Pathways model that is helping O'Boyle .
" Joe represents in a way the challenge of , how do we house people ?
How do we house homeless vets when they have multiple problems ?
We have to get the sequence right .
When the sequence requires treatment sobriety prior to housing , most vets will not , cannot manage that , " Tsemberis said .
Tsemberis says veterans ' perspectives played a key role in the ideological creation of Pathways to Housing .
" They had already served their country , so jumping through hoops was not really something they were willing to put themselves through and would really accept housing on their own terms , " he said .
" They felt that they had done their part and that someone should help them in the way that they deserved to be helped .
And we agreed with that . "
Pathways clients typically receive about $ 20,000 in rent and services which include mental health , addiction , health , employment and peer support .
Tsemberis says that figure is half the amount a homeless person usually costs the system .
The money comes from federal , state and some city funds , and clients have to meet standard lease obligations , such as paying 30 percent of income toward rent .
Rental rates on apartments are fair market , with a studio usually going for about $ 750 a month .
After he was referred to Pathways , O'Boyle was placed in an apartment in Brooklyn within walking distance of the organization 's office .
He now believes that after a very dismal past , he has a future to look forward to and is considering writing a book about his experiences on the street .
Although currently unemployed and looking for work , O'Boyle says he 's never been happier .
" Lately ever since I got my apartment , I feel like I could do anything .
Every day is a good day for me .
I never felt like this in my life .
For the first time in my life , I 'm happy , " O'Boyle said .
As for the future of the homeless and homeless vets , Tsemberis feels that it's a matter of political will and financial commitment .
" It 's not like we do n't know how to do this .
We know how to fix this problem .
It 's just a matter of putting the resources in place to do it . "

Also to the dismay of Republican lawmakers , the House adjourned Monday night without even taking up the question of a special election , ending that prospect at least for now .
State Representative Tom Cross , the Republican leader , had urged his colleagues to pass legislation setting a primary election in February and a general election in April to fill the Senate seat .
Republicans said they suspected Democrats were stalling on the proposal , perhaps all the way until impeachment proceedings are concluded , to allow Mr. Quinn to become governor and make the appointment .
Surprising many , Mr. Blagojevich has left open the possibility that he would sign a bill allowing a special election , which would take away his power to choose Mr. Obama ’s successor .
“ That ’s something that he ’s been a supporter of , letting people decide who their elected officials are , ” Mr. Guerrero said .
“ He just has to see the legislation . ”
Even as members for the impeachment committee were being named , it was clear that few here understood precisely how the impeachment process would go forward .
There is little recent precedent for it , aside from a 1997 effort to impeach James Heiple , an Illinois Supreme Court chief justice .
That case ended without a final decision by lawmakers because Mr. Heiple decided not to run for re-election .
And the standards and procedures for impeachment , described in the state Constitution , are extremely broad , offering scarce guidance other than calling for a majority vote in the House , a trial in the Senate presided over by the State Supreme Court ’s chief justice and , for a conviction , a two - thirds majority vote in the Senate .
“ They ’ll have to decide what their standard is , ” said Dawn Clark Netsch , a political scientist at Northwestern University who was once a Democratic lawmaker and comptroller of Illinois .
“ They ’re going to look to language or grounds or standards used in other states .
They may be somewhat influenced by language in the U.S. Constitution , but they certainly are n’t bound by any of that . ”
Some experts said the impeachment inquiry might also create problems for federal prosecutors ’ criminal proceedings against Mr. Blagojevich , if witnesses are compelled to testify and are granted immunity .
This is a side - by - side view of large cyclones at the north ( left ) and south ( right ) poles of Saturn taken in June 2008 by the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft .
Scientists have discovered a giant cyclone swirling onSaturn ?s north pole , and observed a similar storm on the planet ?s south pole indetail 10 times greater than before , thanks to new images from NASA 's Cassinispacecraft .
The new images , taken in infrared light , reveal for thefirst time a massive cyclone churning at the north pole , similar to a gigantic storm onSaturn 's south pole .
" These are truly massive cyclones , hundreds of timesstronger than the most giant hurricanes on Earth , " said Kevin Baines , Cassini scientist on the visual andinfrared mapping spectrometer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Dozens of puffy , convectively formed cumulus clouds swirl aroundboth poles , betraying the presence of giant thunderstorms lurking beneath .
Thunderstorms are the likely engine for these giant weather systems . "
Researchers think the storms are powered by heat releasedfrom condensing water in thunderstorms deep down in the atmosphere , similar to the way condensing water in clouds on Earthpowers hurricane vortices .
But unlike Earth 's hurricanes , which stem from the ocean ?
sheat and water , Saturn ' scyclones have no body of water at their bases .
The storms on that planetare locked to Saturn 's poles , whereas terrestrial hurricanes drift across theocean .
Cassini mapped the entire north pole of Saturn in detail ininfrared , with features as small as 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) visible in theimages .
Time - lapse movies of the clouds circling the north pole show thewhirlpool - like cyclone there is rotating at 325 mph ( 530 kph ) ?
more than twiceas fast as the highest winds measured in cyclones on Earth .
Surrounding the cyclone is an odd , honeycomb - shaped hexagon , which itself does not seem to move while the clouds within it whip around athigh speeds .
Strangely , neither the fast - moving clouds inside the hexagon nor thecyclone seem to disrupt the six - sided feature .
Southern storm
The cyclone on Saturn 's south pole has been observedbefore , but never in as much detail .
Earlier images revealed an outer ringof high clouds surrounding a region previously thought to be mostly clear airinterspersed with a few puffy clouds circulating around the center .
The newimages show that the clouds are actually vigorous convective storms that formyet another distinct , inner ring .
? What looked like puffy clouds in lower resolution images are turning out to bedeep convective structures seen through the atmospheric haze , ? said Cassiniimaging team member Tony DelGenio of NASA ?s Goddard Institute for Space Studiesin New York .
?
One of them has punched through to a higher altitude and createdits own little vortex .?
The outer ring of high clouds around the vortex is 2,500 miles ( 4,000 kilometers ) wide , and its clouds cast shadows , indicating they are 25 to 45 miles ( 40 to 70 km ) above the clouds inside the ring .
The new imageshint at an inner ring about half the diameter of the main ring , and so the actualclear " eye " region is smaller than it appeared in earlierlow - resolution images .
? It ?s like seeing into the eye of a hurricane , ? said Andrew Ingersoll , a memberof Cassini 's imaging team at the Caltech in Pasadena .
The Cassini-Huygens mission , which has been in orbit aroundSaturn since July 2004 , is a collaboration between NASA , the European SpaceAgency and the Italian Space Agency .

* Illustration : Apirat Infahsaeng * Eight years ago , Jason Kapalka and a couple of friends devised a puzzle game they called Bejeweled .
It was simple : A grid covered with lo-res gems , which players swapped around to match up the colors .
Yeah , it sounds stupid , but once you start playing , it 's like crack .
Since its debut , Bejeweled addicts have frittered away around $ 300 million — and more than 6 billion hours — on the game and its sequel , the provocatively titled Bejeweled 2 .
And PopCap , the company behind the blockbusters , has become a big player — it now has more than 200 employees in offices around the world .
But Kapalka and his team still preach the gospel of simplicity .
They spent four years and $ 1 million to try to make sure that PopCap 's latest release , Bejeweled Twist , would be at least as intuitive and habit - forming as the original .
We asked Kapalka for his take on some of the most addictive puzzlers ever made and why we can't quit playing them .
Solitaire
How it 's played : Shuffle the deck , deal the cards into stacks , arrange them in order and by suit .
Napoleon was supposedly a big fan — great for passing the time on Elba .
Kapalka 's take : People compare Bejeweled to Tetris , but this is the real analog .
Solitaire is a game in which skill is n't a factor .
You 're lucky or you are n't , and it just goes on and on until you 're out of moves .
Yet it does n't feel completely random .
Rubik's Cube
How it 's played :
Twist the cube until the colors match on all sides .
The toy , created by a Hungarian architect , set off a craze in the 1980s .
Kapalka 's take : A clear example of a game in which the pleasure is in creating order .
You randomize it , it becomes a big mess , and then you have to bring it to an organized state .
Where 's Waldo ?
How it 's played :
Spot the hidden object in a densely illustrated book .
Turn page .
Repeat .
Kapalka 's take :
There are paper variants going back to the 1800s that hide illustrations in the little curlicues of the margins .
And there are new videogame versions like Mystery Case Files .
For thousands of years , we 've derived satisfaction from searching and uncovering — and we still do each time we turn up lost car keys .
Tetris
How it 's played :
As differently shaped tetraminoes fall from the sky , you pivot and position them to fill in gaps and form unbroken lines .
Kapalka 's take : A timeless classic .
Fitting pieces together feeds the same pleasure center of the brain that gets off on packing a suitcase really well or squeezing all your groceries into a single bag .
Collapse !
How it 's played :
In this PC title , colored blocks bubble up from the bottom of the screen .
Mouse over groups of three or more and click to eliminate them .
Kapalka 's take :
You click wherever you want and something happens .
It has that bubblewrap factor — pop , pop , pop .
A completely mindless experience , but not in a negative sense — it 's a letting go of conscious thought .
Playing slot machines can be the same way .

We rarely dabble in Atlantic Sun basketball action – unless women are involved .
And thanks to a forward thinking cheerleader / dance team coach who knows how to dress her troops , the ladies of the University of North Florida are now welcomed into the sports blogosphere .
Just this weekend the UNF dancers took the floor of a barren college basketball court to shake it – in their go - go dancing outfits .
If the University of Idaho cheerleaders made you blush , wait until you see Osprey dancers pole dancing unis .
In case you are really confused or actually care about such things , the UNF coach explains why there are about 35 students shaking it for middle - aged men .
As separate dance and cheer teams in the past , both spirit squads are now coalesced into one exclusive and â€œcollectiveâ€  team : UNF VELOCITY !!
Sounds like downsizing to us .
And what ’s up with this ‘ exclusive ’ label ?
Is there like a $ 49.99 membership we can pay for a DVD , calendar , etc . ?
What we really want to know is if the team has had to get a restraining order against the video recording , sunglass wearing Santa ?
An appropriations bill signed by President Bush last week allows the controversial National Applications Office to begin operating a stringently limited version of a program that would turn military spy satellites on the US , sharing imagery with other federal , state , and local government agencies .
The government 's own watchdog agency , the Government Accountability Office , has warned in an unpublished report that the more expansive program in the offing lacks adequate safeguards to protect privacy and civil liberties .
For now , the law restricts the NAO to " activities substantially similar " to those carried out by the Civil Applications Committee , an interagency coordinating body formed in 1976 to give civilian agencies access to military satellites for scientific and disaster preparedness purposes , such as " monitoring volcanic activity , environmental and geological changes , hurricanes , and floods . "
But as a draft charter for the Office makes clear , officials at the Department of Homeland Security hope to branch out from these traditional applications , providing assistance and information to domestic law enforcement agencies .
That does n't sit well with some members of Congess , who in a sharply worded letter earlier this year expressed concerns that the NAO " raises major issues under the Posse Comitatus Act " barring the military from performing law enforcement duties , and worried the program could be used to " gather domestic intelligence outside the rigorous protections of the law — and , ultimately , to share this intelligence with local law enforcement outside of constitutional parameters . "
And as the Wall Street Journal reported last week , the Government Accountability Office appears to share those concerns .
In an unpublished analysis — a public version of which may be released in coming weeks — the GAO found that there did not seem to be adequate " assurance that NAO operations will comply with applicable laws and privacy and civil liberties standards , " nor sufficient checks and oversight procedures to prevent the misuse of satellite imagery .
The existence of the NAO was first publicly disclosed in press reports last summer , several months after its creation at the behest of the Director of National Intelligence .
Following hearings held by the House Committee on Homeland Security , Congress blocked funding for the NAO , pressing DHS for more information about the legal basis for the progam — as well as the privacy safeguard to be put in place .
The current appropriations bill permits the NAO to be funded only for the purpose of carrying out the old Civil Applications Committee 's functions , pending a certification by the Secretary of Homeland Security that the Office 's compliance with the law has been vetted , and provision to the Appropriations Committee of details of how funds will be spent .
The bill also directs the Inspector General to provide regular reports — somewhat oddly , to the Appropriations Committee — on the data collected by NAO .
Among the questions raised about the proposed program is whether it runs afoul of the Reconstruction Era statute that makes it a crime to use the armed forces to " execute the laws " within US borders .
Tim Sparapani , senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union , believes the new initiative to be " a prima facie violation of the Posse Comitatus Act — this is about using a military asset to do domestic law enforcement . "
If law enforcement or immigration agencies need spy satellites , he argues , they should ask Congress to buy them some , rather than using the powerful eyes in the sky operated by the National Reconaissance Office for foreign - intelligence agencies not bound by domestic privacy constraints .
" The military should never be used against the citizenry , " he argues .
" Even if we 're talking about shooting pictures of people instead of shooting people , the principle remains the same . "
But Gene Healy , an attorney and scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute , is not so sure .
At least since the 70s , says Healy , courts have tended to read the prohibition on using the military to " execute the laws " only as a barrier to " hands - on policing , " such as conducting arrests or doing crowd control .
That means sending soldiers to physically search a criminal suspects home is out , but loaning expertise or equipment and sharing information may be allowed .
During the 2002 hunt for the " DC sniper , " he notes , Army aircraft were used in the effort to hunt down the serial killer .
" That does n't mean it 's a good policy , " says Healy , " I can think of a lot of reasons it 's a really bad idea to let soldiers train narcotics officers too , but that does n't mean either is illegal under the current statute . "
And what of Fourth Amendment concerns ?
Here , Sparapani says , the program enters " uncharted waters . "
In a pair of 1986 decisions , the Supreme Court ruled that aerial observation by surveillance planes did not count as a Fourth Amendment " search . "
If you grew your marijuana out in the open , the justices essentially concluded , you could not claim a " reasonable expectation of privacy " even if the crop was n't visible from the ground .
But the court left open the question of whether the same logic would apply in the case of technology more esoteric than an airplane .
And in 2001 , the court concluded that a search warrant was needed to use infrared scanners to detect the heat signature from an indoor dope - growing operation .
Presumably intelligence satellites have a range of sophisticated scanning equipment that would fall under the latter rule .
But even in the case of ordinary image capturing , the high degree of precision of the satellite cameras — by some accounts good enough to read a page of text in a subject 's hand — may make spying from space qualitatively different from a plane flyover .
Whatever the courts decide , Sparapani argues that Congress should press DHS to be more forthcoming about how it plans to use the orbiting eyes .
" Given this administration , " he says , " ' trust us ' just does n't work anymore . "
In order to ultimately get past this crisis , it may be necessary for governments to establish new currencies in which debt is severely limited , and at the same time unwind the debt in the existing currency .
I expect that a huge amount of derivatives of all types will need to disappear as well , so that financial assets start bearing a close relationship to physical resources .
We often hear that " soon " oil prices will hit a bottom , and start shooting back up again .
I am less and less certain that this will be the case .
Instead , I am concerned that we may on a relentless path to a point far below the point where energy companies can expect to have any chance of making money .
We may be on a path toward more and more bankruptcies and defaults of all types -- energy companies , owners of commercial real estate , homeowners , financial institutions , auto makers , airlines , and many more .
If this is the case , there will be a huge strain on governments , and some may find it necessary to default on their debt .
I am becoming more and more convinced that the drop in gasoline prices has a huge amount to do with all of our credit problems ( which in turn are related to limits on the oil supply ) .
These credit problems are causing more and more defaults on debt and more and more bankruptcies .
These defaults and bankruptcies have a double impact on oil prices -- partly from reduced demand , and partly from distressed sellers disposing of futures contracts at low prices , because they are easy assets to sell .
Why are gasoline prices so low ?
And why do they continue to drop ?
The recent drop in oil prices has truly been extra-ordinary .
Gasoline prices are down almost as spectacularly , and the price of diesel is down is well .
If we look at the graph , it does n't look at all like anything we have seen before .
What is happening , and where is this headed ?
Supply and Demand
Most of us who have taken any economics courses have some idea of the expected workings of supply and demand .
Figure 2 - Graph from Wikipedia .
Caption says
The price P of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price ( supply S ) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price ( demand D ) , along with a consequent increase in price and quantity Q sold of the product .
The theory is that in a competitive market , price will act to even our supply and demand imbalances .
If supply is too great , price will drop , and more users will find themselves able to purchase the products and use them at the lower price , bringing supply and demand back into balance again .
Is oil priced too high , or is credit too unavailable ?
I think what we have happening now is a mixture of ( 1 ) supply and demand of the physical product , and ( 2 ) credit issues , both of which are focusing on commodity prices of all types -- oil , natural gas , coal , copper , corn , and many others .
With respect to supply and demand of the physical product , when the US was busy building huge numbers of houses to keep the economy going , and workers around the world were buying many new cars , there was a great deal of demand for these commodities .
Once we started building fewer houses and cars , less oil was needed for manufacture and transportation .
This type of physical supply and demand is what we expect to underlay a curve of the type shown in Figure 2 .
The second problem is debt , and it does n't work as nearly as rationally .
Debt , and the repayment of debt , works as long as there is a growing economy , because with the growth , there are funds for a reasonable percentage of debtors to pay back their debts with interest .
When a government senses that the economy is not growing as fast as it would like , it can encourage more and more debt , to try to keep the economy going .
It seems to me that since 2001 , we have had a considerable amount of government encouraged debt , to try to get the economy to expand faster than its natural rate .
It is not entirely clear what the impact of the growth of credit on real GDP is .
One estimate might be that an additional dollar of debt adds an additional dollar of real GDP .
One could debate whether this relationship is correct , but clearly there is some impact .
Using total debt amount estimates from economagic.com , this is a rough calculation of real GDP , without the inclusion of debt :
Figure 3 . Calculation of US Real GDP , adjusted for growth in credit .
Click for larger image .
Figure 4 . US Real GDP , adjusted for growth in credit .
Click for larger image .
Based on the calculation shown in Figure 3 , and graphed in Figure 4 , there has been no real growth since 2000 .
Instead , we have been seeing more and more debt - based pseudo - growth .
Without real expansion , debt will eventually start to unwind -- there start to be too many defaults .
The debt probably would have started to unwind on its own , because of the slowed growth rate , even apart from the oil price increases .
The increases in oil and food prices between 2005 and mid 2008 helped prick this debt bubble , but the underlying debt set the stage .
The underlying issue that slowed the growth rate was limitations on resources .
These resources are not becoming more abundant , so it seems to me that it will be virtually impossible to get the real growth to increase again to the point where it again makes sense to have very much debt .
I would argue that it probably never made sense to have the level of debt that we have had in the past few years .
So what does this have to do with the supply and demand curve ?
Oil prices can be expected to keep dropping , as long as there is more and more credit imploding , resulting in fewer people being able to buy products made with oil .
Given the huge amount of debt outstanding , and the lack of growth to make this debt " repayable " , more and more defaults seem likely .
We can ask ourselves , " At what price of oil ( or of gasoline ) will credit stop imploding ? " since the answer to that question will tell us when the price of oil can be expected to start rising again .
I believe the answer is , " Whenever governments can figure out a way to get the economy to start growing fast enough so that debt ( and its repayment with interest ) ' works ' again . "
I would argue that governments will never be able to make this happen .
We have reached a point where resources ( oil and other finite resources ) are in such limited supply that the best we might be able to hope for is a level economy for a while .
More likely , we are going to see decline .
Because of the lack of growth , we are at a point that we need to unwind the debt we have , and learn to live without the vast majority of it .
What does this mean going forward ?
To me , Figure 1 is truly scary .
If the price of oil and other commodities continues to drop , we are likely to see more and more energy companies going bankrupt .
Some of these may be large -- we have heard rumors about the financial problems of Glencore , a large privately owned international trading company .
The economies of Texas and Louisiana are likely to take major hits , as will Russia and some Middle Eastern countries .
Even with the low energy prices , many of the problems the US has are likely to continue ( too few houses and cars being built to " pump up " the economy , declining prices on homes and commercial property , and many workers laid off ) .
The amount of debt we have outstanding is extremely high .
The debt shown in Figure 3 is not really all of the obligations of the US public and US government , since it excludes things like Social Security and Medicare liabilities .
According to one web site , the amount of debt Americans have outstanding is $ 53 trillion , plus unfunded governmental promises ( including Social Security and Medicare ) of $ 64 trillion , and plus trillions of dollars of related to derivatives .
Not counting the derivatives , this amounts to $ 386,091 per person .
I do n't know whether these numbers are precisely correct , but it is clear that with limited resources and a declining economy , there is no way that amounts similar to these amounts are going to be paid in full .
I am sure that the Bush and Obama administrations and other administrations around the world will try to fix the problems , but I fear many may not be successful .
If they somehow are successful , the current oil price collapse may lead to a rebound , but it is likely that we will still have to face the need to unwind our debt later , even if we somehow make it past our current crisis .
I do n't know whether it is necessary to go through a full economic collapse and restarting process , to get past all of this debt .
I find it hard to imagine that governmental leaders will sit down , look at the situation rationally , and start thinking about how to unwind the debt .
But eventually , and I fear , sooner rather than later , we will need to get rid of most of this debt , and start over again with a monetary system that is more closely tied to resources and discourages debt .
It is possible that forward - looking leaders could even start the new monetary system before the old one is phase out .
The new monetary system might , for example , start out as more of a rationing system for food and energy products , and eventually be expanded to cover other products as well .
I am afraid I do n't have all of the answers .
My problem is that when I see a trend line based on oil prices pointing almost straight down , and I can't see a good reason for prices to suddenly start rising , I start worrying that the consequences of the current price collapse could be far worse than any of us on The OIl Drum have been talking about .

Mehdi Karroubi has a reputation as a reformist and populist
A senior opposition figure in Iran has announced that he will challenge President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in next summer 's presidential election .
Mehdi Karroubi - a former speaker of parliament - is the first person to announce his candidacy for president .
He has criticised Mr Ahmadinejad over both foreign policy and the economy .
The announcement confirms that Mr Ahmadinejad will face a serious challenge for the presidency in next summer 's election .
He could well become the first president in the history of the Islamic republic not to be re-elected after his first four - year term .
$ 50 handouts
Mehdi Karroubi is a reformist and something of a populist who offered anyone in Iran a $ 50 ( £ 29 ) hand - out last time he stood for election .
There is certainly plenty of opposition to President Ahmadinejad .
The economy is in a mess and the president 's foreign policy is becoming increasingly controversial .
The big question is whether the opposition can rally around a single credible candidate .
As Mr Karroubi announced his candidacy , the first thing everyone wanted to know was whether he would stand down if the former president , Mohammad Khatami , decided to run for election himself .

HOW much do sexual habits vary between countries ?
A great deal , according to a study of 14,000 people in 48 countries .
The survey asked respondents to consider seven questions related to sex .
Some questions were factual : how many sexual partners have you had in the past year and how many one - night stands have you had ?
Other questions were about attitudes to sex : is sex without love acceptable , or sex with casual partners ?
From the answers , the researchers compiled an index of promiscuity for respondents from each country .
The result appears to show that Finns and other Europeans are the most promiscuous , whereas respondents from more conservative countries , such as Bangladesh and Zimbabwe , are less promiscuous .
Around the world men and women vary in their attitudes to casual sex .
Men are more likely to seek it out in their late twenties .
Women wait until their thirties when the chances of a casual encounter resulting in pregnancy are less .

Natalie Portman : Have ‘ The Talk ’ for Obama
Created : October 22 , 2008 10:40 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Obama campaign just rolled out a new YouTube video with Natalie Portman rallying young Americans .
But she ’s not asking them to vote for Obama .
Instead , the campaign tapped Portman to push young people who already support Obama to press their parents to do the same .
It ’s part of a larger effort by the Obama campaign , “ The Talk , ” that aims to turn its sizable edge among young voters into a persuasion machine .
“ Are you sure if your parents are voting for Obama ? ” asks the campaign pitch .
“ If not , you may be the only person who can convince them . ”
There ’s a website with videos , policy information and tips especially for parental outreach :
Think about their perspective .
If they are Republican , or are concerned about Barack ’s policies , think about where they are coming from and what makes them think the way that they do .
Do n’t wait until the last minute — it might take a few conversations for you to convince them , so start as early as possible .
Portman recorded her video in Cincinnati , Ohio , where she stumped for Obama and had “ the talk ” with her grandmother .
Eat your heart out , Sarah Silverman :
PRODUCTION NOTES :
This short , simple video turns on Portman ’s personal appeal — with the kind of tight close - ups you do n’t see in the campaign ’s Biden YouTube collection .
Drawing in young people with star power , the video swiftly redirects them to “ The Talk ” website .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Bleach has been killing germs for more than 200 years but U.S. scientists have just figured out how the cleaner does its dirty work .

REUTERS / Handout
It seems that hypochlorous acid , the active ingredient in bleach , attacks proteins in bacteria , causing them to clump up much like an egg that has been boiled , a team at the University of Michigan reported in the journal Cell on Thursday .
The discovery , which may better explain how humans fight off infections , came quite by accident .
“ As so often happens in science , we did not set out to address this question , ” Ursula Jakob , who led the team , said in a statement .
The researchers had been studying a bacterial protein called heat shock protein 33 , which is a kind of molecular chaperon that becomes active when cells are in distress , for example from the high temperature of a fever .
In this case , the source of the distress was hypochlorous acid or hypochlorite .
Jakob ’s team figured out that bleach and high temperatures have very similar effects on proteins .
When they exposed the bacteria to bleach , the heat shock protein became active in an attempt to protect other proteins in the bacteria from losing their chemical structure , forming clumps that would eventually die off .
“ Many of the proteins that hypochlorite attacks are essential for bacterial growth , so inactivating those proteins likely kills the bacteria , ” Marianne Ilbert , a postdoctoral fellow in Jakob ’s lab , said in a statement .
The researchers said the human immune system produces hypochlorous acid in response to infection but the substance does not kill only the bacterial invaders .
It kills human cells too , which may explain how tissue is destroyed in chronic inflammation .
“ Hypochlorous acid is an important part of host defense , ” Jakob said .
“ It ’s not just something we use on our countertops . ”

Figuring out housing prices is n’t rocket science .
There is no need for a master ’s degree in financial engineering to figure this out folks .
Even as the housing market continues its downward slump , we are still at overpriced levels .
Why ?
Well historically , housing as an investment only tracks with the nation ’s inflation rate .
That is until a bubble appears and people start getting the notion that this time is different .
I ’m going to give you a very straightforward math equation on determining how much home you can afford .
This is the maximum price you can pay without putting yourself into financial jeopardy and maintaining a cushion :
Wait a minute .
You mean to tell me that the ridiculously simple equation above is the solution to restoring sane housing prices ?
Pretty much .
I ’ll explain why this is in a second but you need to remember that for nearly a decade , we had no semblance of checks and balances .
No documentation loans clearly went on no established ratios since you had the ability to make up your family financial balance sheet .
Even with some documented toxic loans , lenders and Wall Street did not care and took the loans anyways .
Now why is the 3 times yearly gross income rule a good one ?
First , you need to remember that as a rule of thumb , you should try avoiding spending more than one - third of your monthly income on housing .
If you want to find out how much a month you will be spending on your home , a quick way of figuring that out is this :
This is a quick rule of thumb .
For example , if your mortgage amount is $ 100,000 you can expect to have monthly housing costs of $ 1,000 .
Many investors usually have these formulas in the back of their mind when determining a good value for a property .
These costs include the following :
Principal
Interest
PMI
Insurance
Taxes
Maintenance
Upgrades
A big mistake made by buyers , realtors , and lenders during the bubble was the fixation on principal and interest only .
In fact , some of the main selling points of interest only loans were the cheap monthly payment .
Well that was only one cost of the above many items .
Some of the most toxic pay option ARMs did n’t even include the full interest amount .
You may be thinking that this is too simple .
Too straightforward and maybe , it belongs on some morning kid TV show .
It is this simple however .
And that is why people do n’t like it .
Sort of like losing weight .
The formula for that is , eat less calories than you burn in a day and you will lose weight .
Yet getting this discipline is the hard part , not the equation .
What this tells us is housing prices have still a long way to go to adjust .
I ’ve put together on this chart below the U.S. median home price and also the U.S. median household income since 2000 to track the housing bubble .
Just for kicks , I threw in the L.A. County median price to put one crazy bubble next to an amazingly insane out of this world bubble :
* Click to enlarge
As you can see from the chart above , U.S. median income for the past decade has remained stagnant .
Yet home prices appreciated at an unprecedented pace .
On the top of the chart , I quickly put the price - to - income ratio just to give you an idea of how high prices rose .
Already in 2000 , prices were at a 3.6 ratio , a little higher than we would like .
Then all of a sudden , you have a non -stop growth to a ratio of 5.5 !
This was simply unsupportable .
In addition , if you think that is bad , the peak price - to - income ratio in Los Angeles County hit above 11 at the height of the bubble .
Meaning , the median home price in L.A. required the median household to spend 11 times their yearly income .
Now this would not be such an issue if incomes had kept pace , which clearly they did not .
So it leads you to the question that if household incomes were n’t keeping pace , how did people manage to pay more for homes ?
In one word , credit .
The above chart goes to show a clear sign of what has occurred in this past bubble .
More and more of a family ’s income went to servicing current debt payments .
When we consider the $ 700 billion bailout plan and one component of injecting capital into banks the primary reason again is to get credit going .
This of course should lead you to question why we are trying to spur credit ( debt ) when debt is what got us into this mess in the first place ?
Nowhere do we see legislation trying to clamp down on stricter lending .
In fact , the marketplace has suddenly tightened up and the government wants to loosen it up again .
The government has led the way in acquiring debt so you would expect similar behavior from the populace :
Total public debt has blasted through the $ 10 trillion mark and with the price tag of these bailouts , we can expect to see $ 11 and $ 12 trillion very soon .
At a certain point you need to return to prudent lending standards yet at the moment , the government seems to want to return to the heyday of the housing bubble .
We ca n’t go back since we have reached a critical inflexion point .
That is , we cannot throw more debt at the problem and expect it to go away .
That is why certain states like California will not see a housing bottom until 2011 or even deeper into the future .
Take a look at real median income produced by the Census Bureau :
What you ’ll see is slowly growing household income , that is until this decade where income even dipped a bit .
Of course , some of that growth also comes from the fact that we now have 2 workers per household which has increased since the 1950s .
Is the formula for housing prices really that simple ?
That is , 3 times gross household income is the maximum value of a home one can afford ?
It is .
So if your household income is $ 100,000 you can buy as much as $ 300,000 worth of home .
If you make $ 1,000,000 , you can buy up to $ 3,000,000 .
Makes you wonder if we ’ll ever see these ratios again .

There ’s nothing manlier than facial hair .
No matter how much we advance in the equality of the sexes , growing a thick beard or mustache is something that only men will be able to do ( Okay , so some women can grow impressive facial hair , but they end up in sideshows ) .
Some men have felt that facial hair was n’t getting the respect it deserved , so they decided to dedicate a month to the manly glory of beards and mustaches .
First , in the United States , November is officially National Beard Month .
Men across the United States are encouraged to grow a beard in preparation of the cold winter ahead .
Second , a non-profit charity group from Australia has declared November Movember .
In Australia , mustaches are called “ Mo’s . ”
The idea of Movember is to get men all over the world to grow mustaches in order to raise money and awareness to fight prostate cancer .
In honor of National Beard Month and Movember , we ’ve decided to pull together a list of the 20 Manliest Mustaches and Beards From Facial Hair History .
General Ambrose Burnside
You know your facial hair is manly when they name a certain type of it after you .
General Ambrose Burnside was a politician , inventor , railroad exec , Union general , and the Father of Sideburns .
Tom Selleck
Whether acting in Magnum PI or Three Men and a Baby , Tom Selleck brought a healthy dose of manly testosterone with that awesome stache of his .
Sadly , in 1997 he shaved off his manly nose mane .
He kept it off for several years after that .
Thankfully , he came to his senses and has since brought it back .
Charles Darwin
Besides developing biological theories that changed the way humans view themselves and the world , Charles Darwin ’s other talent was growing awesome facial hair .
Perhaps intent on discovering himself as the the missing link , Darwin grew a beard any ape would envy .
Teddy Roosevelt
What Art of Manliness list would be complete without an appearance by Teddy Roosevelt ?
TR was so freaking manly that his mustache could judo chop assailants , and shout “ Bully ! ” at would - be attackers .
Friedrich Nietzsche
For Nietzsche , God may have been dead , but his mustache lives on .
In letters unearthed by historians , it was discovered that Nietzsche believed that his mustache made him a superman .
While critics laughed at him , looking at this mustache , I think he was on to something .
Listen to our podcast on the meaning of beards :
Sam Elliot
Anytime the movie industry needs a mustached cowboy , Sam Elliot is their go - to guy .
With movies like Tombstone and Gettysburg under his belt , Sam Elliot has proven that his mustache has the talent to make it in Hollywood .
Of course Sam Elliot is a talented actor , too .
Brigham Young
When leading a religion or overseeing a household with 55 wives ( holy crap ! 55 ! ) you need to muster all your resources to establish your authority .
Mormon prophet Brigham
Young busted out this mustacheless beard to let people know that he was in charge .
Sadly , the university that bears his name ( Brigham Young University ) prohibits beards among its male students .
You can only get an exception to this rule if you have a “ Beard Card , ” given sparingly to those with medical or religious exceptions .
Brigham Young , and his beard , would be rolling over in the grave .
Chuck Norris
Fact : Chuck Norris was born with a beard .
When doctors tried to shave it , he roundhouse kicked them in the face with his precociously strong baby legs , knocking them all unconscious .
Kimbo Slice
Wow .
All I have to say is that this is quiet possibly the scariest beard I ’ve ever seen .
UFC fighter Kimbo Slice puts the fear of God into his opponents with powerful punches and his thick black beard .
While Kimbo Slice may be 3 - 1 in UFC fights , his beard is still , and will always be , undefeated .
Kenny Rogers
What happened to you Kenny Rogers ?
In this picture , you look so damn manly .
Now you just look like a plastic - faced freak .
Out of respect to your beard , I ’ll always remember you the way you looked in 1985 .
ZZ Top
There are no harder working beards in the music industry than the beards on ZZ Top ’s Billy Gibbons ’ and Dusty Hills ’ faces .
Ironically , the band ’s beardless drummer is named Frank Beard .
Tom McKay
Alright .
I ’m exercising a bit of editorial privilege here and adding my dad , Tom McKay to the list of manliest mustaches and beards .
Just look at that thing .
Pretty dang manly if you ask me .
And of course the three piece 1979 suit only accents the mustache .
My dad ’s a retired federal game warden , and I ’m sure he had poachers shaking in their boots when they took one look at his stache .
I ’ve only seen my dad without a mustache twice in my 26 years of existence .
And both times he shaved it off , it freaked me out .
For about a month it would feel like some stranger that sounded like and dressed in the same clothes as my dad moved into our house .
Thankfully , he always grew it back .
Santa Claus
Santa Claus ’ beard is iconic .
Not only is it a part of his personal brand ( so much so that children give it a yank to test a Santa ’s authenticity ) , his beard also has a practical purpose .
When you live in the North Pole and fly a sleigh at high altitudes , you need a thick , full beard to keep your face warm and free from wind chapping .
Oh yeah , and it ’s also magical .
Mark Twain
Mark Twain is one of America ’s greatest humorists , satirists , and writers .
He ’s also one of America ’s finest mustacheers .
Face it .
Mark
Twain ’s mustache will always be wittier than you .
Karl Marx
Thanks to Karl Marx we have Communism , an awesome example of a beard , and annoying college dudes who think if they grow a beard like Marx and quote a few lines of Das Kapital , they ’re automatically experts on the plight of the working class .
But back to this beard .
It ’s awesome .
No , it ’s freaking awesome .
I can see why this man was able to kick start revolutions and inspire the proletariat to shake off the shackles of capitalism .
It was n’t his ideas of communism .
It ’s the beard , stupid .
Walter Frazier
From 1967 - 1977 , Walter Frazier led the New York Knicks to two NBA Championships .
( What the ?
There was a time when the Knicks were actually good ? )
Frazier ’s success on the court can be attributed to two things .
First , his defensive talent .
Second , his awesome mutton chops .
Look at this image above .
In a match up between a man with broad , sweeping mutton chops , and a man with wisps of hair that are a pathetic excuse for a sideburn , who do you think will win ?
I ’m putting my money on number ten .
Perhaps the Knicks should consider requiring their players to grow awesome mutton chops like Walter Frazier .
Maybe then they ’ll stop sucking .
Wyatt Earp
Wyatt Earp is famous for his infamous gunfight at the OK Coral .
He ’s also famous for having a bad ass mustache .
With it , he struck fear into the hearts of cowboys from Dodge City to the the Dakota Territory .
Rollie Fingers
In addition to having one of the best names in sports history , Rollie Fingers also has the best mustache .
With his turn of the century curly mustache , Rollie Fingers pitched his way into the Baseball Hall of Fame .
After his career in baseball , he made a second career out of tying damsels in distress to railroad tracks .
Salvador Dali
Salvador Dali needed a crazy mustache to match the craziness of his surreal paintings and his love of walking his pet lobster .
So he decided to go with this pointy get - up .
I think it works for him .
He looks crazy as all hell .
Grizzly Adams
Can you imagine a man named Grizzly Adams , a man who befriends a bear , having a clean shaven , soft - as - a - baby ’s - behind face ?
Neither can I .
This man ’s beard is so thick that the bear actually thought he was one of them .
That ’s probably why it did n’t maul his face off .
Anybody you think should be on the list ?
Drop a line in the comment box and let your voice be heard .

Gingrich Impressed With Powell Nod
Former House Speaker Says General 's Endorsement ' Eliminated Experience Argument '
Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich reacted this morning to Colin Powell 's endorsement of Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , arguing , " What that just did in one sound bite ... is it eliminated the experience argument . "
Powell , the former secretary of state , announced his long - awaited endorsement Sunday morning , explaining that he is backing Obama " because of his ability to inspire , because of the inclusive nature of this campaign , because he is reaching out all across America , because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities – we have to take that into account – as well as his substance – he has both style and substance – he has met the standard of being a successful president , being an exceptional president . "
In all - star roundtable edition of " This Week with George Stephanopoulos , " former presidential adviser David Gergen categorized Powell 's announcement as " the most important endorsement of the campaign so far . "
Tom Friedman of The New York Times agreed , explaining , " Gen . Powell helps a lot , I think , especially at this moment , you know .
That 's a real affirmation that the country can trust Barack Obama as commander in chief , and Colin Powell still has a lot of cred[ ibility ] with Republicans and Democrats . "
Gingrich , Gergen and Friedman were joined in the powerhouse roundtable by Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and Republican columnist George Will .
Brazile added , " this is an endorsement that has enormous dividend for Sen .
Obama , not only in helping to erase any remaining doubts about his national security agenda , his experience , but also it says that he wants to govern in a different way , different than , say , past administrations where you relied on just his base or his party .
" It says that he 's going to reach across the aisle , and perhaps this is a good way for Sen .
Obama to put that message out in the closing weeks of the campaign . "
The panelists also discussed the possibility of Obama falling prey to the " Bradley Effect , " named for Tom Bradley , the African - American politician running for governor who ended up losing after having a huge lead in the polls .
" Twenty - six years has passed since the Bradley effect , " Brazile explained .
" I think we 're looking at an Obama effect .
He has increased , enlarged the electorate .
He 's bringing new people into the process .
There is an enthusiasm gap that we 've never seen before on the Democratic side , 20 percent more likely Democratic voters than Republican voters at this moment , so I think we -- I think the issue of race may be a factor , but it will not be as large a factor as it would have been , say , 12 years ago . "
Gingrich agreed that " there is a racial effect on both sides , that African - Americans will disproportionately turn out and they will disproportionately vote for Obama , and they have disproportionately registered for a good reason .
The Obama effect is real and legitimate .
It 's authentic . "
And Will argued that Obama will gain more votes than he will lose on account of race .
" It seems to me if we had these tools to measure , we 'd find that Barack Obama gets two votes because he 's black for every one he loses because he 's black , " he said .
Friedman added that the number of white voters who may ultimately support Obama may be underestimated .
" I think there are a lot of white voters telling pollsters , you know , we 're going to vote for Obama , and they wo n't when the moment comes , but I think there is also a whole group of white Republicans who are telling their friends at the country club that I 'm voting for McCain , and they 're going to go ... vote for Obama , because their kids are , " he said .
No single rule has probably contributed so much to the reputation of the EU as an over - regulatory bureaucracy as that on sales of curved cucumbers .
But the much - mocked regulation could soon be gone , with funny shaped vegetables and fruits return to super market shelves throughout the union .
A proposal from agriculture commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel to repeal the rules on curved cucumbers together with regulations of 25 other fruits and vegetables may pass , when experts from the EU member states meet in Brussels next Wednesday ( 12 November ) .
Only 10 standards are to remain , according to the commission 's suggestion - including those for apples , citrus fruit , peaches , pears and tomatoes - accounting for three - quarters of EU cross - border fruit and vegetable trade .
" I can't stand it any longer to be confronted with the curved cucumbers .
I want to end this debate , that the EU is regulating everything into the details , " Ms Fischer Boel explained to Danish daily Politiken .
" My immediate reaction was to get rid of it all .
But I have met stiff opposition in the member states .
Mainly due to massive lobby from the retail and whole sales business , aiming to keep the standards , " she explained .
Countries like Italy , Spain , France and Hungary still want to keep regulations on the trade .
It 's easier to buy and sell standard products , but supermarket giant Sainsbury and Friends of the Earth among others have campaigned for relaxed rules on sale of ' imperfect ' fruit and veg .
In a recent letter to the commissioner the retailer suggested such a move could reduce prices by up to 40 percent and cut down on the one - fifth of produce wasted .
" We have been struggling to fit a square peg in a round hole for too long now , " Sue Henderson , of Sainsbury 's told the BBC .
" We 're not allowed to use up to 20 % of what 's produced in this country and in the current credit crunch climate , we cannot continue to waste this much food before it even leaves the farms . "
EU member states voted on the new rules already in July , but there was not a qualified majority in favour of keeping the rules nor of scrapping them .
When ministers are blocked over approval of a particular proposal , the decision passes over to the commission , which makes it possible for Mariann Fischer Boel to pass her proposal with effect from July 2009 .
It 's ( almost ) all over , but for 1,600 ( uncounted ) ballots and one ( likely ) court case in MN's U.S. Senate seat ...

One last update before the two Jews running for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota stop to celebrate Christmas .
It 's almost all over but the court case , and even that , if it happens , does n't seem to have much left to stand on .
In summary then , here 's where we now are in the extraordinarily close U.S. Senate hand - count in MN ...
All of the 6,000 or so ballots challenged by both sides have now been determined , one way or another , by the bi-partisan state canvassing board .
With those added to the totals as of Christmas Eve , challenger Al Franken ( D ) now leads Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) by an astounding 47 votes out of 2.9 million cast .
Coleman had gone to the MN Supreme Court in hopes they would force the state canvassing board to consider his request to toss out the results from 150 or so ballots which he had claimed , without any actual evidence , had been counted twice .
Those were ballots , largely from Franken - leaning counties , were " remade " by county officials after they could n't be read by the op - scanners originally ( e.g. , they had been creased when mailed in , etc . ) .
The originals are supposed to stay with the remade versions , but in some cases , the originals got lost , and Coleman claimed --- again without any actual evidence --- that therefore they may have been double - counted .
Today , the Supremes rejected Coleman 's request , finding that the matter should be decided in a separate court case , where evidence could be presented , rather than by the state canvassing board .
The finding is a huge blow to the Coleman camp , as those 150 ballots will now remain as part of the final count , though Coleman could still file a case later to try and have them rejected .
Coleman 's attorney , Fritz Knaak , has just issued a statement saying the decision " virtually guarantees that this will be decided in an election contest . "
The findings from such a future case , however , filed after the recount results are certified --- and after the media reportage , which is often all that matters ( see FL 2000 's Bush v. Gore ) --- announcing Franken as the winner , would be a tough road for Coleman to overcome .
That leaves , then , just the 1,600 or so absentee ballots which were improperly rejected previously , which have remained sealed and uncounted up until now .
The Supreme Court has extended the deadline for counties to get those ballots to St. Paul for unsealing and counting , until Jan. 2nd .
They must be counted by Jan 4th , and can be challenged ( as the 6,000 other ballots were previously ) , on Jan 5th , when the state canvassing board convenes again .
Congress is to be sworn in on Jan 6th , so it 's become increasingly likely that MN may not know who their Senator will be for certain by then , unless all is miraculously agreed upon , and certfication occurs on Jan 5th. , and Coleman decides not to file an election contest .
With Franken 's lead at just 47 votes , all would seem to hinge on those final 1,600 uncounted absentee ballots .
As absentees had previously favored Franken , odds are that he 'll increase his final total .
But those are just " odds . "
Anything can happen , as nobody knows what votes remain in those still - sealed , improperly rejected absentee ballots , and this race has seen its fair share of twists and turns up until now !
The Finish Line is in Sight ...
Josh Marshall observes that " Norm Coleman is starting to acclimate himself to the water ... "
" I feel fairly confident .
In the end , the good Lord 's going to decide , " Coleman told the local Fox affiliate .
" The numbers look good to us .
Certainly there 's uncertainty .
I 'm not worried about it .
I 've done everything I can do .
I 'm not really agonizing about the outcome . "
Coleman went on : " Life goes on , regardless of what your job is .
I certainly love what I do .
If I can keep doing it , I 'll be thrilled , and if not , I 'm sure we 'll do something else . "
That 's good , because the Republican National Lawyers Liars Association ( where lying GOP vote - fraudster Thor Hearne is the reigning fraudster - in - chief ) is freaking out , and retreading their panicked , last - minute lies about a stolen election in MN , as Sam Stein reports at HuffPo :
In an " urgent message " to supporters , the Republican National Lawyer Association accuses Franken and his " liberal allies " of " working feverishingly [ sic ] to steal the Minnesota Senate election . "
The rest of their latest missive is actually quite hilarious , and we highly recommend checking it out for some late Xmas cheer !
Finally , kudos are due , no matter the outcome of this election , to MN Sec. of State Mark Ritchie who has run an orderly , fully transparent , and meticulous hand - count process which put accuracy and transparency above all .
After the Franken and Coleman campaigns were able to strike a deal on how to go about counting those last 1,600 ballots today , and with the possibility of MN not having one of their Senators seated in time for the convening of the new session of Congress , Ritchie is quoted as saying :
" We 've been really clear in saying our top priority is accuracy and transparency and the timing thing is just not our issue , " [ Secretary of State Mark ] Ritchie said .
" I want to put an underline , we do n't care as long as it's accurate and we 've done it in an accurate and transparent way .
We do n't care when it 's done . "
Neither do we , Mr. Ritchie .
Thanks for taking the time to ensure that every vote possible is counted accurately , as per the voters ' intent , and in a way that the entire state and country can finally have confidence in , once it's all said and done ... whenever that may be ...
The VelociRaptors
The Western Digital VelociRaptor is an amazingly fast hard disk drive .
Targeted at the blade server and enthusiast markets , this Serial ATA hard disk drive not only delivers incredibly fast seek times and throughput , it also does it in a compact 2.5 " form factor .
For more information on the Western Digital VelociRaptor , read this comprehensive review .
Western Digital offers three versions of the VelociRaptor - BLFS , HLFS and GLFS .
The BLFS is the compact form of the VelociRaptor , designed to fit 2.5 " mounts .
However , it will not fit into notebook drive bays because it's much thicker than 2.5 " hard disk drives .
BLFS
HLFS
GLFS
The HLFS and GLFS models , on the other hand , are designed to fit into 3.5 " drive bays .
The 2.5 " VelociRaptor hard drive is enclosed within a 3.5 " IcePack™ mounting frame that doubles as a heatsink to keep the drive cool .
The HLFS 's mounting frame is backplane - ready while the GLFS 's mounting frame is not .
Both the BLFS and the HLFS are available in storage capacities of 150 GB or 300 GB , but the GLFS model is only available with a storage capacity of 300 GB at this point in time .
Irrespective of the model , the 150 GB drives use a single platter with two read / write heads while the 300 GB drives have two platters and four read / write heads .
Performance Difference ?
The choice of models available made us wonder if there is any performance difference between the different models , so we decided to test it out .
We had earlier reviewed the BLFS model but Chai bought a HLFS model so we thought it was a great opportunity to compare the performance of the two models .
According to Mike Goh of Western Digital , both these models should be identical , with the same firmware revision .
However , nothing beats actually testing them out to see if there are any performance differences between the two models .
Let 's take a look .

The arguments heard by the Supreme Court today in FCC vs. Fox Television Stations may have been , to quote U2 front man Bono , " f*** ing brilliant " — but it 's the court 's decision that will determine whether you can describe them that way on television .
The case stems from the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards , at which Cher and Nicole Richie shocked audiences by uttering expletives normally employed only by sailors , street ruffians , and Dick Cheney .
The Federal Communications Commission determined that the mal mots were " indecent " during primetime broadcast hours , but the broadcaster fought the ruling .
Last year , the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the Commission had been " arbitrary and capricious " in changing its policy to bar even " fleeting " expletives used as intensifiers , in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act .
In principle , the Court could ask the Commission to explain its reasoning more fully and kick the case back to the Second Circuit for review under that statute .
But as Ruth Bader Ginsberg acknowledged Tuesday morning , there was an " elephant in the room " : The First Amendment .
Cher about to drop an f-bomb
The Court held 20 years ago , in FCC v. Pacifica , that " indecent " ( even though not necessarily " obscene " ) language — in the instance , George Carlin 's now infamous Seven Dirty Words routine — could be barred from the " uniquely pervasive " public airwaves , which were a scarce resource that could be regulated in the public interest by the Commission .
But as Ginsburg observed , " That was before the Internet .
Pacifica was in 1978 . "
Have changing technology and changing social mores rendered the Court 's broadcast censorship jurisprudence obsolete ?
Solicitor General Gregory Garre argued , on the government 's behalf , that they had not , and offered up the grim specter of " Big Bird dropping the F - bomb on Sesame Street " if the FCC were defanged .
Even Chief Justice John Roberts , who along with Justice Antonin Scalia appeared openly sympathetic to the government 's position , wondered whether the arguments the Pacifica Court had relied upon " still have the same force today when the broadcast medium is only one of several that are available , " noting that it seemed doubtful that much was achieved by applying stringent rules to a few broadcast channels while many more cable channels and online videos operated without such restrictions .
Just the opposite , Garre argued : because there are now so many venues for Tarrantino - esque streams of vulgarity , the restriction on speech imposed by censorship of the airwaves was much less significant .
And the argument for providing an unambiguously safe space for those who opted out of cable 's vast cesspool that much stronger .
Fox attorney Carter Phillips disagreed , citing the case of a Vermont public television station that had decided not to air a debate between several Senate candidates because one had " used expletives in a previous public forum , " and the station could not afford the kind of time - delay equipment that Garre recommended networks use .
( Especially , Garre added , when they know they 'll be airing a notorious potty - mouth like Nicole Richie . )
Several justices seemed inclined to steer clear of the big constitutional questions and decide the case on procedural and statutory grounds .
But Phillips insisted that the two were inextricably intertwined .
" It seems to me a completely artificial inquiry , " Carter argued , " to look at this as though you 're regulating the price of oil going through a pipeline .
At the end of the day you are regulating the content of speech . "
At an event in September , former FCC Chairman Michael Powell voiced his own regrets about having supported the " fleeting expletives " ban , arguing that the Commission had " gone way too far — we are dancing with the limits of the Constitution . "
Powell said that the rule change had been " a terrible mistake — and I voted for it . "
The entertainment industry has also urged the Court to save the F - bomb , while a slew of decency groups have equally fervently insisted the justices hold the line .
But where exactly is the line ?
Some of the exchanges between the justices and the lawyers made clear just how muddled that question can get .
Justice John Paul Stevens , for example , wondered whether it might be appropriate for FCC " to take into consideration at all the question whether the particular remark was really hilarious — very , very funny ? "
Garre allowed that as part of a contextual analysis , it might be , to the relief of Justice Scalia , who opined that " bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good . "
And then there was the question of the grammatical role of an expletive .
" Is n't it true that [ the F - bomb ] is a word that often is used with no reference whatsoever to the sexual connotation ? " asked Stevens .
Garre again conceded that it " can be used in a metaphorical way , as Cher used it here , to say ' F them ' to her critics . "
Even the person uttering the word — impressionable children might be especially prone to emulate celebrities — played a role .
Whichever way the Court comes down , civil libertarians will have occasion to utter some expletives of their own — the only question is whether the cry will be " Oh F *** ! " or " F*** yeah ! "

In the past , we 've pointed out how silly it was for various politicians to go about banning very specific actions for drivers .
There are aof distractions for drivers , and you 're never going to successfully outlaw all of them .
But it does n't stop politicians from trying .
Earlier this year , we asked for suggestions on what else politicians might try to ban while driving ( beyond earlier bills that were put forth in various legislatures trying to ban using a laptop faxing and ( everyone 's favorite ) having sex while driving .
The latest is up in Canada , where a bill on driver distractions includes a ban on playing portable video game systems .
While my first thought was whether or not this means it would still be legal to hook up a console gaming system and play it , that thought was quickly erased by the most basic question of all : who does n't already recognize that you should not be playing a handheld video game while driving ?
I mean , if we 're going to start banning totally theoretical dangerous driving activities , I 'd like to throw juggling while driving onto the list .
That 's gotta be distracting .
We must ban it .
To save our children , of course .
Of course , to highlight how ridiculous this law is , it says it 's okay for you to change stations on the radio while driving -- but you would be fined for skipping a song on your iPod .
Why the distinction ?
Who knows .
Reporters , sensing the ridiculousness of the situation , questioned a supporter of the new bill , asking him if it would be illegal to change songs on your iPod if the iPod were taped to the dash , like a radio .
His response ?
" I would have to look at that one , " while then noting " the proposed law is fairly general with details to come . "
Ah , so let 's rush into passing a law , and then we 'll work out the details of what the law actually means later ?

WASHINGTON - His name etched in history as America 's first black president , Barack Obama turned from the jubilation of victory to the sober challenge of leading a nation worried about economic crisis , two unfinished wars and global uncertainty .
" The road ahead will be long .
Our climb will be steep , " Obama cautioned .
Young and charismatic but with little experience on the national level , Obama smashed through racial barriers and easily defeated Republican John McCain to become the first African - American destined to sit in the Oval Office , America 's 44th president .
He was the first Democrat to receive more than 50 percent of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
" It 's been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment , change has come to America , " Obama told a victory rally of 125,000 people jammed into Chicago 's Grant Park .
Obama scored an Electoral College landslide that redrew America 's political map .
He won states that reliably voted Republican in presidential elections , like Indiana and Virginia , which had n't supported the Democratic candidate in 44 years .
Ohio and Florida , key to Bush 's twin victories , also went for Obama , as did Pennsylvania , which McCain had deemed crucial for his election hopes .
With just 76 days until the inauguration , Obama is expected to move quickly to begin assembling a White House staff and selecting Cabinet nominees .
Campaign officials said Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel was the front - runner to be Obama 's chief of staff .
The advisers spoke on a condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made .
Obama 's victory was sweetened by Democratic gains in both houses of Congress .
In the Senate , Democrats ousted Republicans Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire and captured seats held by retiring GOP senators in Virginia , New Mexico and Colorado .
Democrats scored big gains in the House , as well .
When Obama and running mate Joe Biden take their oath of office on Jan. 20 , Democrats will control both the White House and Congress for the first time since 1994 .
" It is not a mandate for a party or ideology but a mandate for change , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said : " Tonight the American people have called for a new direction .
They have called for change in America . "
After the longest and costliest campaign in U.S. history , Obama was propelled to victory by voters dismayed by eight years of George W. Bush 's presidency and deeply anxious about rising unemployment and home foreclosures and a battered stock market that has erased trillions of dollars of savings for Americans .
Six in 10 voters picked the economy as the most important issue facing the nation in an Associated Press exit poll .
None of the other top issues - energy , Iraq , terrorism and health care - was selected by more than one in 10 .
Obama has promised to cut taxes for most Americans , get the United States out of Iraq and expand health care , including mandatory coverage for children .
Obama acknowledged that repairing the economy and dealing with problems at home and overseas will not happen quickly .
" We may not get there in one year or even in one term , " he said .
" But , America , I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there .
I promise you , we as a people will get there . "
McCain conceded defeat shortly after 11 p.m. EST , telling supporters outside the Arizona Biltmore Hotel , " The American people have spoken , and they have spoken clearly . "
" This is an historic election , and I recognize the special significance it has for African - Americans and the special pride that must be theirs tonight , " McCain said .
" These are difficult times for our country .
And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face . "
Obama faces a staggering list of problems , and he mentioned some of them in his victory speech .
" Even as we celebrate tonight , we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime - two wars , a planet in peril , the worst financial crisis in a century . "
He spoke of parents who worry about paying their mortgages and medical bills .
" There will be setbacks and false starts , " Obama said .
" There are many who wo n't agree with every decision or policy I make as president .
And we know the government can't solve every problem . "
The son of a Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas , the 47 - year - old Obama has had a startlingly rapid rise , from lawyer and community organizer to state legislator and U.S. senator , now just four years into his first term .
He is the first senator elected to the White House since John F. Kennedy in 1960 .
Bush called Obama with congratulations at 11:12 p.m. EST .
" I promise to make this a smooth transition , " the president said .
" You are about to go on one of the great journeys of life .
Congratulations and go enjoy yourself . "
He invited Obama and his family to visit the White House soon .
Bush planned to make a statement about the election at mid-morning Wednesday in the Rose Garden .
With most U.S. precincts tallied , the popular vote was 51.9 percent for Obama and 46.8 percent for McCain .
But the count in the Electoral College was lopsided in Obama 's favor over McCain - 349 to 147 as of early Wednesday , with four states still to be decided .
Those were North Carolina , Georgia and Missouri .
Obama won California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , the District of Columbia , Florida , Hawaii , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Virginia , Vermont , Washington and Wisconsin .
McCain had Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , Idaho , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Mississippi , Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , West Virginia and Wyoming .
He also won at least 3 of Nebraska 's five electoral votes , with the other two in doubt .
Almost six in 10 women supported Obama nationwide , while men leaned his way by a narrow margin , according to interviews with voters .
Just over half of whites supported McCain , giving him a slim advantage in a group that Bush carried overwhelmingly in 2004 .
The results of the AP survey were based on a preliminary partial sample of nearly 10,000 voters in Election Day polls and in telephone interviews over the past week for early voters .
In terms of turnout , America voted in record numbers .
Preliminary projections , based on 83 percent of the country 's precincts tallied , indicate that more than 131 million Americans will have voted this year , easily outdistancing 2004 's 122.3 million , which had been the highest grand total of voters before .
That puts the 2008 turnout rate of eligible voters around 64 percent , experts said .

The song ' I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus ' offers a pretty sinister implication when you believe in Santa .
When I was a little kid , thinking about this man carrying on with some kid's mum was pretty distressing .
Sure , he 's a notorious ' reverse burglar ' , but what 's his deal with messing about with other kid 's mums ?
It 's understandable then that when other kids got better presents than me , it did kind of change my attitude towards their mothers .
In unrelated news , for some reason I was n't invited to Christmas parties as a child either .
Newswise — Westfield State College senior mathematics majors Jeffrey P. Vanasse and Michael E. Guenette , working under the direction of Mathematics Department faculty members Marcus Jaiclin and Julian F. Fleron , have made a significant new discovery in the mathematical field of number theory .
They have discovered the first known example of a 3 by 3 by 3 generalized arithmetic progression ( GAP ) .
Most easily thought of as a 3 by 3 by 3 cube ( similar to a Rubik 's cube puzzle ) made up of 27 primes , their discovery begins with 929 as its smallest prime ends with 27917 as its largest prime .
The intervening 25 primes are constructed by adding combinations of the numbers 2904 , 3150 , and 7440 in an appropriately structured method .
" Such an object was known to exist and its approximate size had been loosely estimated , " Fleron said .
" However , a blind search would require checking more cases than can be feasibly checked by all existing modern computers each running for the next million years .
Instead , the group used knowledge of the structural relationships between the potential candidates to greatly reduce the potential candidates to be checked . "
An algorithm to check the necessary cases " still easily hundreds of trillions of cases " was programmed using a Linux version of the computer language C++.
" This breakthrough is another indication that our Mathematics Department is working on a world - class level , " said Evan S. Dobelle , president of Westfield State College .
" The college is very proud of these students and their professors for taking the initiative to practice cutting - edge mathematics . "
" We were worried that it might take months to run based on our estimates , " Guenette said .
" Yet initial tests showed the algorithm running at a hopeful speed . "
" We were always optimistic , but the first tests got us really excited that our method would be successful , " Vanasse said .
The team broke the search up into groups of cases for each of the researchers to run on separate computers .
Within days the first known example of a 3 by 3 by 3 GAP was found " one with largest prime of 197,957 .
Having succeeded in finding the first known example , and now having a strict bound on the size of the largest prime , the group set to work finding other 3 by 3 by 3 GAPs " in particular , the smallest such .
They were successful , showing there are exactly three 3 by 3 by 3 GAPs of primes with largest prime less than 50,000 , the smallest example being that described above .
The students and faculty members are hopeful that their work will aid number theorists who continue to work on elusive patterns that lurk within the mystery of the prime numbers .
With estimates for the largest prime in a 4 by 4 by 4 or 3 by 3 by 3 by 3 GAP being near 5 quadrillion ( that 's a 5 followed by 15 zeroes ) the group is fairly certain that their record for finding the highest dimensional GAP will stand for quite some time , Fleron said .
Guenette of Easthampton , Mass. , and Vanasse of Chicopee , Mass. , both plan on attending graduate school in mathematics following graduation .
Their work on this problem has provided them with a valuable introduction to the efforts of a working research mathematician .
For Jaiclin and Fleron , and the rest of the Westfield State Mathematics Department , it is another opportunity to share with and involve undergraduates what they love best : doing significant mathematics and advancing the frontier of human knowledge .
Fleron said the team 's work was inspired by the recent discoveries of the young Australian mathematician Terence Chi-Shen Tao , now a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" Many prominent number theorists are working simply to understand the implications of these discoveries , " he said .
" Now Westfield State College students are playing a role , as well . "
British mathematician Andrew Granville , now on the faculty of the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al , also inspired the group .
Granville 's paper , " Prime Number Patterns , " was published in the April edition of American Mathematical Monthly .
Ironically , Granville just gave a lecture on " Patterns in the Primes " as part of the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Mathematical Association of America ( MAA ) .
This series , sponsored by the National Security Agency , took place at the MAA Carriage House Conference Center in Washington D.C. on Thursday , Nov. 13 .
This was the day before the Westfield State group 's discovery .

Positioning
In our reports from the 5800 Tube 's launch event we touched upon its positioning , but now we are willing to go more in - depth and give you the big picture .
We 've all been waiting for this - a touch - sensitive phone from Nokia .
And the more they hyped the fabulous Apple iPhone , the more anxious everyone had been growing .
Having launched a PR campaign of immense power Apple did not hesitate to take on Nokia on its very own turf .
But Nokia have got some trumps up their sleeves as well , and among them are several solutions that will leave the whole Cupertino sleepless .
That is , Nokia Music
Store may not seem like much and does n't look any better than Sony Ericsson 's PlayNow service , but Nokia has in fact added a whole new dimension to it by bringing about Nokia Comes with Music campaign that allows the users of select phones to enjoy free subscription to a vast music database .
Furthermore , you can store all tracks you 've downloaded on PC and listen to them as long as you want .
So , this is " strike one " that puts the business model of iTunes in question and makes it less of a monopoly on today 's market .
But such a powerful service calls for some capable hardware - specifically , music - minded mobile phones .
As you probably have guessed , Nokia has tackled this issue with its latest and greatest 5800 Xpress Music .
We already posted an in - depth story about Nokia Comes with Music a while ago , so in case you missed it for some reason , I strongly recommend that you read it .
Moreover , we will put up a review of Nokia Comes with Music the day after it kicks off on October 16th , so we invite you to visit Mobile - Review.com for more info and hands - on impressions with this service .
Although it may seem Nokia have designed the 5800 exclusively for their online music service , it 's not quite true .
This phone targets all other touchscreen offerings around , including Windows Mobile , Apple iPhone and some dedicated audio players delivered by smaller companies .
Basically , Nokia have dropped the price of the 5800 Tube to the point where no one will even want to compete on price or wo n't have the means to offer a similarly geared solution for this money .
But Nokia 's real intention behind this sensationally low price tag ( by the way , they are still going to make good money off it ) is to clean up the whole industry a little bit .
Apparently , half - dead manufacturers focusing on touch - sensitive solutions and marketing them at higher price points due to lack of competition wo n't be able to survive the arrival of the 5800 XpressMusic .
However , those who will find a way to adjust without altering their pricing policies will be knocked out early in 2009 by another announcement - without going into much detail , I can say that those 279 Euros for the Nokia 5800 are n't exactly the bottom line for this type of phones ; effectively they can go much lower than that .
These days Nokia hardly faces any competition on the mobile phone market - Samsung are capitalizing on the weakness of the rest of the field , and although they 've been trying to back it up with pretty decent offerings too , they do n't interact with local carriers just as much .
So , Nokia 's real challenges lie in services and music ; obviously , it 's impossible not to mention iTues in this regard .
Basically , every Apple - branded phone or players comes bundled with iTunes and there is no other way around .
Nokia , however , has learned a lesson from Apple 's experience and is now looking to take on Apple 's offerings on their own turf .
How ?
By now probably everyone knows that the stellar sales generated by the original iPhone in the US were more due to the demand they had to meet in other regions .
Apple closed their eyes to all leaks and in an effort to encourage these activities , they supplied " right " people with their firmware encryption codes that essentially made the whole jailbreak hysteria possible ( although these days it 's nearly impossible to break the iPhone 3 G's software ) .
Previously Apple needed to put up great numbers and turn the market in their favor , but that was stage one .
The second part of the plan , which is unfolding these days , is supposed to bring the iPhone brand back to the top price bracket .
And that 's exactly the moment when Nokia chimes in with its underpriced finger - friendly devices , leaving Apple very few ways to retaliate - one of them would be to send the iPhone 's pricing through the floor ( thankfully , it 's not all that popular in Europe ) .
Without a price cut their whole campaign in Europe will come to a halt in a year or two .
On the other hand , with unlimited music subscription and a more able device ( in terms of core functionality ) , Nokia wo n't allow an alternative to come along any time soon .
Now , several words about the phone itself .
They call it " feminine " , " teenager - ish " and a whole bunch of other ways .
But nobody is trying to conceal the fact that it 's aimed primarily at the younger audience , although even people past their thirties should be pretty content with the 5800 XpressMusic as well ( we 'll see some more imposing offerings of this breed down the road , though ) .
Those who are into innovations and cutting - edge gadgets wo n't be put off by the Nokia 5800 's simplistic design .
And on the other hand , people who shun touch - sensitive screens wo n't even think of the 5800 as a possible way to go .
This way , Nokia will never face the risk of letting the sales of their conventional smartphones plummet in favor of the 5800 XpressMusic .
It 's quite another matter , though , that with the arrival of this phone they will have to give up on several music - minded offerings given the price tag of the 5800 Tube .
That said , the Nokia 5800 's positioning should n't take a rocket scientist to figure out - it 's simply the most feature - rich and affordable touchscreen device with a focus on music .
Furthermore , you wo n't find any other phone that can come close to it in terms of price / quality ratio .
Windows Mobile devices are by no means " multimedia - ready " , so the only other way to go is the Apple iPhone - however , retailing for twice as much , it 's not much of a mobile phone per se .
And the Nokia 5800 makes it clear that the real price of the Apple iPhone 3G should revolve around 300 - 350 USD before subsidies .
All in all , I suggest we wait until December and see how Apple will alter their pricing policy in view of Nokia 's latest efforts on the touchscreen playground .
Again , I never tire to emphasize the following - the 5800 Xpress Music is nothing but Nokia 's first step in this segment , and we 'll see more of them down the road .
What Nokia is really up to is defeat the myth that touch - friendly phones are always on the expensive side - they know it 's all nonsense and they are building up a mass market for this type of solutions .
And they seem to be doing pretty well , considering how much arguments and feedback their latest release has sparked up .

Design , Size , Controls
The 5800 XpressMusic is a pretty much standard plasticky candy - bar without any metallic or chromed accents in it .
The build quality , however , was pretty good - we did n't find any parts on it that would creak when pressed or feel wobbly ( just as you 'd expect from this design , though ) .
Also , there is nothing wrong with the 5800 Tube utilizing only plastic parts - some more expensive offerings do n't have any metallic accents either and somehow this fact does n't turn many off .
Apparently , since the Nokia 5800 does n't have any other newsworthy drawbacks , its haters will be looking for any opportunity to blame it for not having metallic parts in its design .
I especially like some " qualified " opinions of people who have n't even touched the 5800 yet , but for some reason feel competent enough to share their point of view .
Here are some gems :
It 's a plasticky made - in - China toy ;
All other touchscreen phones are made of metal , the 5800 is not - why ? ;
It looks and feels so cheap !;
Thankfully , though , these mumblings have absolutely nothing to do with how things really stand .
As far as materials are concerned , the Nokia 5800 has nothing to shout about , but at the same time it does n't expose any crucial letdowns .
The phone measures in at 111x51.7x15.5 mm and tips our scales at 109 grams .
Let 's put it up against some other today 's offerings to see how it is " too small " or " way too bulky " , " feminine " or whatever :
Nokia 5800 Motorola ZN5 Sony Ericsson W902 Apple iPhone 3G Samsung PIXON M8800 111x51.7x15.5 mm , 109 g 118x50.5x16 mm , 114 g 110x49x11.7 mm , 100g 115.5x62.1x12.3 mm , 133 g 107.9x54.6x13.8 mm , 124 g

Nokia 5800 vs Nokia 5310 :
I suppose the numbers above are more informative than any words - the 5800 is reasonably wide and not overly fat ( which some tend to groundlessly blame it for ) .
All in all , in terms of size it 's a typical candybar of 2008 .
It also features a lanyard eyelet that can be used to attach what Nokia calls " stylus plectrum " ( comes with a strap on it ) .
I 'm pretty positive that some girls will use it as a wrist strap .
Nokia 5800 vs Sony Ericsson W902 :
Nokia 5800 vs Apple iPhone :
As far as color schemes are concerned , the Nokia 5800 does n't offer anything out of this world ( three options are available : red , blue and black ) .
Even though Nokia 's official product page does n't show it , the rear cover of the 5800 comes with a distinctive pattern .
Running along the sides is a flashy strip color - keyed to the phone 's trim .
Housed on the right - hand spine is the volume rocker , display / keypad lock switch and dedicated camera button .
More towards the base of the phone there is the stylus silo .
On the left you will find two slots sealed by flaps - one for microSD memory cards , the other one is for SIM cards .
The latter is pretty tricky to open , but with the bundled stylus in your hands you wo n't face and problems with it .
Perched on top is the standard 3.5 mm audio jack along with 2 mm charger socket and mircoUSB connector .
Both stereo - speakers are mounted on the left - hand side .
The Nokia 5800 comes boxed with a carrying case made of soft plasticky material - while it's not much at all , it 's there and it's free , which is better than nothing .
And I believe the 5800 XpressMusic will save you enough money to buy even the most sophisticated carrying case .
The phone comes bundled with a proximity sensor that disables the display when you put it close to your face .
One more thing of note - this sensor had been around long before the " One and Only " arrived last July .

Display
One of this phone 's fortes is its display , hands down - it 's covered by a thick plastic layer , although not recessed into the casing , so it can be handled in any way you please ( with bare fingers , stylus or plectrum ) .
At 3.2 inch diagonal , 16:9 aspect ratio , 16 million colors and 640x360 - pixel resolution ( 39x69 mm ) , the 5800 Tube 's screen is a true marvel .
In this department it 's closest rival is the Apple iPhone 3G with its 3.5 - inch screen and 320x480 resolution ; however it can't stand up to the 5800 in terms of picture quality - bigger diagonals can't make up for the lack of resolution ( although the iPhone is around 20 percent brighter ) .
On the other hand , on this front both phones do much better than handsets armed with 2 - 2.6 inch QVGA screens and it's not even close .
Bar the 5800 Tube there will be only one more phone featuring a screen of this caliber - the HTC Touch HD ( 3.8 inches and 480x800 pixel resolution ) .
However , it does n't compare quite favourably to the Nokia 5800 , since it'll retail for almost thrice as much .
The 5800 's screen rotates automatically , depending on what position you hold it in - it takes the phone a split second to change the setup , and generally it is no different from the HTC Diamond or Apple iPhone in this regard .
The phone 's display remains fairly legible under direct sunlight , although you might run into certain glitches regarding its readability , but nothing major - the iPhone has got just the same set of problems .
The screen can accommodate up to 14 text and 3 service lines ; all in all , the 5800 's display is perfect for viewing images , videos and browsing long lists .

Keypad , text input
The 5800 houses only three mechanical keys on the front - Call , End and Menu .
Pressing the End button anywhere in the phone will get you back to the previous menu level .
Also , there are three methods of text input ; not methods really , but different keyboards altogether .
The first one is a pretty much standard alphanumeric keypad rendered on the 5800 Tube 's display - it kicks in only when you hold the phone vertically and offers a quite convenient way to text with one hand .
At the same time , it 's next to impossible to do that with the iPhone .
I remember how a friend of mine had to stop by the roadside to message me a street address ; he was pleasantly surprised with the Nokia 5800 's setup however , as it allowed for seamless single - handed operation .
Next up - miniQWERTY keypad , available in both landscape and portrait setups .
Clearly , it 's much easier to text with it using the plectrum or bundled stylus .
The 5800 will enlarge the button you are hovering over .
By the way , women wo n't experience any difficulties with the 5800 - it responds even to slightest touches of fingernails .
The last but certainly not the least - a no-frills QWERTY thumbboard that launches only when holding the phone sideways .
It packs in quite sizable buttons that are easy to tap , even with both hands on the screen .
All in all , the Nokia 5800 comes with a wealth of texting options - no other phone out three can offer a similar number of options on this front .
When texting with the Prediction feature on you can tap on a word and pick another variant .
Handwriting text input , at least in my opinion , is more of a gimmick , although with the help of stylus you can make it work .
I 'm not sure whether many actually use it on a regular basis , but it 's a saving grace in Asia .
The tactile feedback offered in the 5800 Tube is similar to Samusng 's VibeZ technology - the phone vibrates a little whenever you touch it .
While it does n't really feel like you " pressed " a button on the screen , the phone seamlessly reacts to all taps .
Over our quality time with the Nokia 5800 we experienced very few misclicks - all in all , the screen here proved to be pretty responsive and accurate .
Also , it allows texting with the full - sized QWERTY - keyboard in all menus ( not only in the browser application , like in the iPhone ) , which is a major plus .
In order to deal the text entry issue once and for all we carried out several tests with our focus group : five members used the Apple iPhone on a regular basis , some had no previous experience with touchscreen phones and the rest had n't used touch - sensitive displays in ages .
We offered all these people to punch in a couple of text fragments , including this one : " The tropical storm churned near the eastern coast of Mexico late Monday and is expected to make landfall in the overnight hours " .
We used the text input speed achieved with the iPhone 's on - screen keyboard as the benchmark for this test - kudos to Apple , it 's still one of the finest thumbboards around .

What 's the best thing about the Nokia 5800 ?
It comes equipped with a wide array of texting options , and none of them is hard wired , meaning that it 's up to you to decide which one suits you best .
And there is no way all haters can deny the results of our tests .
Although the 5800's on - screen keypads feel somewhat different from that of the iPhone , it wo n't take you too long to come to grips with the Tube 's text input methods .

Battery
The handset utilizes a 1320 mAh Li-Ion battery ( BL - 5J ) .
The 5800 is rated for 8.8 hours of talk time ( GSM ) and 400 hours of standby .
Music time - up to 35 hours , video recording time ( top resolution and quality settings ) - up to 210 minutes , video playback time - up to 5 hours .
The handset 's battery life averaged 3 days in our tests , when we used the 5800 for about two hours of calls , a dozen or two snaps , several minutes of video , and around an hour of music / radio .
It takes the 5800 around one hour to charge from empty to full .
Below is our chart of battery times we managed to squeeze out of the N85 :
GPS - navigation – 4 -4.5 hours
Video playback – 3 hours 20 minuts ( H.264 in speakerphone mode )
WEB - surfing ( EDGE ) – 4 hours
Wi -Fi ( non - stop data upload ) – 5 hours
Music ( in earphones ) – 34 hours
Radio – 25.5 hours
Games – 5 hours
The hardest part of the battery test was to actually see how long it'd take games to drain the 5800 's battery .
On balance , though , the new Tube is in line with other Nokia 's latest and greatest offerings in the way of battery life , furthermore it sets the new record time for a non -stop music session .
While you 'd expect such a phone to have a less impressive stamina , the 5800 XpressMusic turned out to be a pretty able device on this front .
Back to the table of contents >>>
Performance
Here I 'm going to betray my usual rule and ponder over the 5800 Tube 's ARM 11 CPU ( running at 369 Mhz ) in general instead of giving you bare numbers .
Nothing amuses me more than claims that every phone 's performance hinges solely on its CPU speed .
Yeah , right .
Wait , no , it does n't .
As far as mobile devices are concerned , it 's more about whether their OS is tweaked to go along with certain hardware .
That is , Symbian - based solutions rarely need blazing - fast CPUs .
The Nokia 5800 is here to prove this once again with its speedy animation and seamless transitions between menus ; although there are some minor hiccups here and there , it 's still a pretty decent performer overall .
I can't remember how many times I 've said this already , but the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is as fast as it gets for this type of smartphones - if you want to make sure of this , just watch our videos where we do a walkthrough around the 5800 's interface and menus .
Another question bothering many people around online forums is how well the Nokia 5800 fares in synthetic tests ?
Way below average .
Why ?
Basically , these tests have n't been turned to evaluate this type of phones at all - they launch in compatibility mode with extra buttons tied up to the screen and show pretty subpar numbers because of that .
But again , the 5800's OS is pretty speedy and no one will come out disappointed after trying it once .

Memory
The device comes equipped with 128 Mb of RAM , after first launch you will get around 70 - 74 Mb of free memory at your disposal , plus there are 81 Mb on top of that reserved in the phone for your personal data .
The 5800 deals with microSD memory cards ( hot - swappable ) , the phone comes packaged with a 8 Gb unit .
There are no restrictions as far as memory card 's size is concerned - our handset easily identified a 32 Gb card .
USB .
Using the USB settings you can choose one of the following modes
Data Transfer ( Mass Storage USB ) – memory cards is available , no drivers required , as your OS identifies the handset automatically .

Media Transfer
The 5800 's data transfer speeds top out at 5 Mb/s , the phone does n't recharge itself over USB .
Bluetooth .
The phone comes with Bluetooth v2.0 , with support for EDR .
The following profiles are supported :
Dial Up Networking Profile ( Gateway )
Object Push Profile ( Server and Client )
File Transfer Profile ( Server )
Hands Free Profile ( Audio Gateway )
Headset Profile ( Audio Gateway )
Basic Imaging Profile ( Image Push Responder and Initiator )
Remote SIM Access Profile ( Server )
Device Identification Profile
Phone Book Access Profile ( Server )
Stereo Audio Streaming :
Generic Audio / Video Distribution Profile
Audio / Video Remote Control Profile ( A/V Remote Control Target )
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile ( Audio Source )
The top speed you can get with the 5800's Bluetooth connection is around 100 Kb/s .
We also tested its A2DP profile in pair with the Sony Ericsson DS970 headset , which worked just fine - we managed our play list , skipped within tracks and adjusted volume seamlessly , however we could n't make current track 's title show up on the headset 's display .
Wi -Fi .
This handset comes armed with Wi - Fi ( IEEE 802.11 g ) support .
All security standards are supported , including WEP , WPA , WPA 2 , with other advanced settings available .
The 5800 boasts the WiFi Wizard , which can search and tap into available networks in background mode .
Back to the table of contents >>>
The 5800 Tube comes packaged with Nokia Maps 2.0 application , whose major attraction on this particular device is the ability to control the map itself by touching the screen .
Other than that it 's little to no different ( in fact it does offer slightly more detailed maps ) from the version designed for touchscreen - less handsets .
But its touch - sensitive display alone makes the 5800 Nokia 's finest navigation - savvy offering to date .
Plus it utilizes an extremely loud voice for turn - by - turn navigation and allows you to control most of its features right on the screen .
All this makes it pretty similar to stand - alone navigators ; however over at Nokia they prefer to keep mum about this fact - after all , their navigation - centric smartphones are still around .
I wo n't be surprised , though , if they roll - out a new navigation - heavy phone with a touchscreen some time next September .
Back to the table of contents >>>
Music department
As far as music quality goes , the 5800 offers an unparalleled experience for an S60 device , but while it stands in one line with the N85 and the likes , it can't keep up with the Motorola ZN5 , Samsung i8510 INNOV8 and some other solutions .
Nevertheless , it 's still good enough to take on the Apple iPod , plus less sophisticated users wo n't notice any difference at all when listening to music in stock earphones .
The 5800 Tube comes boxed with iPhone - grade earphones , meaning that they 'll probably be the first thing you will need to get rid of .
Custom headphones may be plugged either into the 3.5 mm jack on the phone 's casing or the remote control .
The latter is nothing to write home about - we have already seen it in several previous phones from Nokia .
As far as our RMAA tests go , the 5800 came pretty close to the Nokia N85 - it was n't much of a revelation , but seemed like a worthy alternative to many popular stand - alone MP3 - players .
Frequency response ( from 40 Hz to 15 kHz ) , dB : +0.11 , - 0.97 Average Noise level , dB ( A ) : - 85.6 Good Dynamic range , dB ( A ) : 85.2 Good THD , % : 0.0065 Very Good IMD , % : 0.325 Average Stereo crosstalk , dB : - 75.8 Very Good Intermodulation at 10 kHz , % : 0.061 Good
General performance : Good
The following formats are supported : AAC , AAC + , eAAC , eAAC + , MP3 , MP4 , M4A , WMA , Mobile XMF , SP - MIDI , AMR ( NB - AMR ) , MIDI Tones ( poly 64 ) , RealAudio 7,8,10 , True tones ( WB - AMR ) , WAV .
MP3 - files with various bit rates , including VBR , are seamlessly played back by the N81 .
Upon synchronization with Windows Media Player 11 and higher , you can take advantage of protected DRM - files ( Janus DRM ) .
Equalizers .
When the equalizer settings are modified the audio experience varies considerably .
Every one of the 6 pre-installed equalizers features 8 bands and is fully user - manageable , save for the default settings .
The list of presets is as follows - Bass Booster , Classical , Jazz , Pop , Rock .
In the Sound Settings you can adjust sound balance , Stereo Widening and Loudness .
The handset has random and repeat ( all or one track ) playback modes .
When the standby screen is active is displays information about the currently playing track .
Bringing up the Music Menu allows you to browse all tracks , playlists and sort the library by artists , albums , genres and composers .
The music library ( or the track list ) gets updated automatically on every successful synchronization with a PC via Nokia PC Suite except if you use a memory card with pre-loaded tracks .
It 's worth noting , amongst all the other features , the Library Detail feature ..
Podcasting – podcasts are now integrated right into the music player , whereas previously they were placed in a separate application .
You can access podcasts either from the player 's menu or launch the application separately , which will give you access to the library , Nokia 's podcast catalogue , search , synchronization settings and so on .
You can also choose to get your subscribed podcasts uploaded automatically ( within the home network or via some specific access point ) .
All in all this app is a breeze to navigate around and quite useful at that .
Music store – allows you to access the Nokia Music Store to buy tracks , albums and download them to your device .
FM - radio – the 5800 comes bundled with a pretty standard radio application that offers to pick your region when first launched ( this choice will affect the FM frequencies you 'll have access to later on ) .
Among its features are RDS , auto tuning and some neat visual enhancements .

Camera
Since Nokia did n't see any point in arming the 5800 Tube with anything more than the bare minimum for the industry on this front , they threw in only a 3.2 Mpix CMOS module with autofocus and macromode ( Tessar lens from Carl Zeiss ( 2.8 , 3.7 ) and dual LED lfash ) .
The camera application can be activated by punching the side - mounted shortcut key - it takes the 5800 around a second to bring up the viewfinder up to the top .
Since the camera interface runs on a touch - sensitive screen , it 's pretty easy to browse through all its settings with only a couple of taps .
To zoom in / out you will need to use the volume controls .
Curiously , due to the camera application 's dated design it does n't support geo tagging
You can go for one of the following resolutions :
Print 3M – Large
Print 2M – Medium
Multimedia message 0.3M
Scene mode ) Automatic , User Defined , Close - Up , Portrait , Landscape , Sports , Night , Night Portrait .
You enabled the screen grid and use the self - timer feature
Effects : Sepia , B&W , Vivid , Negative .
White balance - , Sunny , Cloudy , Incandescent , Fluorescent .
Contrast - from - 2 to + 2 . Adjustable ISO ( low , medium , high ) and sharpness
Video recording .
When recording video with 5800 , there are considerably fewer settings , than in the still image mode .
There is a software image stabilizer that was first introduced in the Nokia N80 .
You can adjust the white balance , choosing from Automatic , Sun , Cloudy , Incandescent , Fluorescent .
The overlay pool includes Sepia , Black & White , Negative .
There are only two shooting modes - auto or night mode .
Maximum resolution - 640x480 pixels ( mpeg4 ) , you can also mute sound , although there is no way you can adjust the 5800's FPS , which is locked at 30 .
The handset allows recording videos until you run out of free memory

Impressions
Call quality was never an issue with the 5800 , as it easily lived up to our expectations of a Nokia - branded phone .
Ring tones sounded quite loud and we were happy with them even in noisy environments .
The vibro alter was of moderate strength .
You also can mute the 5800 's notification sounds and ringtones simply by flipping it face - down .
So , first things first , when the 5800 Tube is going to arrive ?
On December 5th it will kick off in Russia and several other markets ; however the rest of Europe wo n't see it until early 2009 solely because Nokia do n't want to tear up their own portfolio before the Christmas season .
The 5800 XpressMusic will retail for 279 Euros before subsidies and rebates on all European markets .
Intestingly , while they will face some deficit early on , nobody is going to alter the phone 's price tag .
It 's vitally important for Nokia to stick to the price point they announced several days ago to get themselves another bestselling phone .
Nokia 's first touchscreen smartphone is n't a mixed bag by any means .
Going for it are a stable OS , decent sales package that very few other phones have , and a wealth of multimedia features onboard .
For a moment it may feel like a perfect phone , but there is no such thing , right ?
In fact it does have some glitches in the way of software ( for example when adding the Birthday field the phone automatically closes the contact menu ) , but we certainly expected to see more of them in this newly designed operating system .
On balance the 5800 Tube offers pretty decent sound quality , audible stereo speakers , WiFi connectivity , and a sizable display that will remain the best on the market for a quite a while .
Frankly , I can hardly find anything to criticize the 5800 for , given how little it goes for - there has never been a phone like this before and now it raises the bar to a wholly new level .
Well , it 's about time I wrapped it all up - no point in praising this phone any further , I suppose .
Another thing of note about the 5800 Tube is that it simply wo n't face any challenges on the market - the Apple iPhone is a steep , fashion - savvy offering that has been deprived of many standard features , so a comparison between these two phones would seem a little too far - fetched .
It does have smoother and more eye - candy menus , similar video capabilities , but that 's about it - in fact the iPhone packs in around a tenth of what the Nokia 5800 has to offer in terms of functionality .
It would n't be right to put them in one league and then berate the iPhone for lacking so many useful feats .
So let the iPhone remain the ultimate choice for all fashion - conscious users , while the Nokia 5800 will be the way to go for everyone who is after a well - rounded do - it - all solution .
The revolution is already here and its name is " Nokia 5800 XpressMusic " - there will be no other similarly geared and at the same time well - balanced phone in 2009 .
It sports an unparalleled price / quality ratio and changes the rules for all phone makers out there , including Nokia itself .
In the next installment of this review we will cover the 5800 Tube 's OS - S60 5th edition - as well as all its features and abilities .

It is a hard thing , being right about everything all the time .
Nobody likes a know - it - all , and we wait for the moment when the know - it - all is wrong to insist that he never really knew anything in the first place .
The know - it - all , far from living in smug superiority , has the burden of being right the next time , too .
Certainly no one has ever been so right about so many things so much of the time as John Stuart Mill , the nineteenth - century English philosopher , politician , and know - it - all nonpareil who is the subject of a fine new biography by the British journalist Richard Reeves , “ John Stuart Mill : Victorian Firebrand ” ( Overlook ; $ 40 ) .
The book ’s subtitle , meant to be excitingly commercial , is ill chosen ; a firebrand should flame and then die out , while Mill burned for half a century with a steady heat so well regulated that it continues to warm his causes today — “ Victorian Low - Simmering Hot Plate ” might be closer to it .
Mill credited his lover , Harriet Taylor , as the co-creator of his best - known works .
Illustration by Ralph Steadman
Mill believed in complete equality between the sexes , not just women ’s colleges and , someday , female suffrage but absolute parity ; he believed in equal process for all , the end of slavery , votes for the working classes , and the right to birth control ( he was arrested at seventeen for helping poor people obtain contraception ) , and in the common intelligence of all the races of mankind .
He led the fight for due process for detainees accused of terrorism ; argued for teaching Arabic , in order not to alienate potential native radicals ; and opposed adulterating Anglo - American liberalism with too much systematic French theory — all this along with an intelligent acceptance of the free market as an engine of prosperity and a desire to see its excesses and inequalities curbed .
He was right about nearly everything , even when contemplating what was wrong : open - minded and magnanimous to a fault , he saw through Thomas Carlyle ’s reactionary politics to his genius , and his essay on Coleridge , a leading conservative of the previous generation , is a model appreciation of a writer whose views are all wrong but whose writing is still wonderful .
Mill was an enemy of religious bigotry and superstition , and a friend of toleration and free thought , without overdoing either .
( No one has ever been more eloquent about the ethical virtues of Jesus of Nazareth . )
All of which makes trouble for a biographer .
Every time we turn a corner , there is Mill , smiling just a touch too complacently at having got there first .
Admiration for intelligence and truth easily turns into resentment at the person who has them ; Aristides the Just was banished from Athens because people were fed up with hearing him called Aristides the Just .
It is one of the many virtues of Reeves ’s funny , humane biography that it brings
Mill to life in the only way sententious great men can be brought to life , and that is by showing us what he was like when he lost his heart and when he lost his reason .
Both happened to him just once , but that was sufficient .
Mill ’s is a story of a man out in the pure sun of reason and rational inquiry , lit at night by the romantic moonlight of a little bit of love and just enough madness .
Mill ’s boyhood was one of the strangest of the nineteenth century , and is one subject of his own matchless memoir , published posthumously .
He was born in 1806 to a driven Scottish writer , James Mill , and a passive and mostly invisible mother .
Chosen for an experiment in education , he was crammed with learning by his father and his father ’s mentor , the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham .
The aim was to produce a mind distended out of all proportion — force - fed facts , as unlucky geese are force - fed corn .
The foie gras of the boy ’s mind was then to be dined on by a grateful nation ; the boy ’s life , like the goose ’s comfort , was secondary .
Latin , Greek , ancient history , political economy : “ By the age of six , ” Reeves notes , “ young Mill had written a history of Rome ; by seven he was reading Plato in Greek ; at eight soaking up Sophocles . ”
By twelve , he more or less sat his examinations for university entrance .
The curriculum had no room for new poetry , and not much for old music .
It was nothing but history , math , economics , the classics , and the Benthamite axioms : actions could lead to pleasure or pain , happiness or distress , and the right action was the one that led to the most happiness for the most people .
In hard hands , the principle could seem like a mechanical parody of ethics , but it had its points .
Bentham ’s real achievement was to squeeze the piety out of Enlightenment talk of “ rights . ”
People did n’t have rights because their creator endowed them with rights ; they had them because rights were useful to have .
Mill ’s odd education became one of the nightmares of the nineteenth century ; in “ Little Men , ” Louisa May Alcott imagines a child who is so stuffed with learning by an ambitious father that he blows his circuits and becomes permanently feebleminded .
But Mill emerged as the prodigy he was meant to be .
At the age of seventeen , he became a clerk at the East India Company , the private corporation that then ran India , and remained at its headquarters in London for thirty - five years , administering Indian affairs at a distance — a servant of British imperialism , but a benevolent kind .
( When , later , the government tried to cut funds for Indian colonial colleges teaching Arabic and Sanskrit , Mill fought to keep the practice going , for fear of losing all contact with the élites .
“ Without knowing the language of a people , we never really know their thoughts , their feelings , and their type of character , ” he wrote . )
He was such a demon for work that , growing overheated through feverish memo - writing , he would gradually strip off his clothes and work gravely at his stool without waistcoat or pants , as his colleagues watched in prim Victorian wonder .
More important for his thought , Mill became , before he was twenty , a popular writer out on the radical edge of journalism .
He plunged into the new world of professional writing in newspapers and magazines that was as much a part of the early Victorian scene as the booming railroad .
He became a leading contributor to , and by far the most effective polemicist for , the Westminster Review , which Bentham had started in 1823 as a counterpart to the conservative Quarterly Review and Edinburgh Review .
“ Journalism is to modern Europe what political oratory was to Athens and Rome , ” the young Mill announced grandly .
While some of the great minds of the previous century , Samuel Johnson most memorably , had begun as journalists , where the money was , and had been promoted in the popular mind to the dignity of philosophers , Mill began in philosophy , where ideas were found , and chose to write for the magazines and papers , where the fighting was .
Through the eighteen - twenties , Mill attacked David Hume ’s history ( Hume , though philosophically radical , was politically conservative ) , William Cobbett ’s sentimental populism , the false idea of “ balance ” in the British constitution ( if a government was indeed perfectly “ balanced , ” then “ the machine must stand still ” ) , and discrimination against Catholics .
In all of it , he was still following his mentors ’ ideas , and affecting his mentors ’ chilly mien .
“ The description so often given of a Benthamite , as a mere reasoning machine . . . was during two or three years of my life not altogether untrue of me , ” he confessed much later .
Reasoning machines , as we all know , have a high failure rate ; sooner or later , the hard drive just stops spinning .
Mill ’s did , too : in 1826 , he was plunged into a black depression .
His description in his memoir of his breakdown , which lasted for about two years , is among the best in English : “ I sought no comfort by speaking to others of what I felt .
If I had loved anyone sufficiently to make confiding my griefs a necessity , I should not have been in the condition I was . ”
Though he was able to continue working , he could no longer write .
With his quick intelligence , he recognized that the problem lay somewhere in his formation , in things that had been given too little attention .
He turned to music for solace .
It helped for a while , until he grew obsessed with the thought that there are only so many notes , and so many combinations of notes , and that , sooner or later , they would be used up , and all melody exhausted .
Poetry saved him .
He read the early romantics , Coleridge and Wordsworth in particular , and by the end of the decade was cured , or at least better .
He began to see a new light .
It could n’t change his affect : he remained a tight , mild , buttoned - down man .
But it changed his affections .
From that time on , he was as evangelical for the arts as any Ruskinian .
( “ He was most emphatically a philosopher , but then he read Wordsworth , ” a disappointed utilitarian friend remarked in 1840 . )
He toured Italy regularly , making rounds of the churches to see the pictures .
He became an aesthete — a dutiful and systematic one , but an aesthete all the same .
His love of poetry and music and art also led him toward conservative thought .
Aesthetes always bend to the right , in part because the best music and the best buildings were made in the past , and become an argument for its qualities .
Someone entering Chartres becomes , for a moment , a medieval Catholic , and a person looking at Bellini or Titian has to admit that an unequal society can make unequalled pictures .
To love old art is to honor old arrangements .
But even new and progressive art is , as Mill knew , a product of imagination and inspiration , not of fair dealing and transparent processes ; the central concerns of liberalism — fairness , equity , individual rights — really do n’t enter into it .
Mozart , whom Mill loved , would have benefitted as a person had he lived in a world that gave him the right to vote for his congressman , collect an old - age pension , and write letters to the editor on general subjects , and that gave his older sister her chance at composing , too .
But not a note of his music would have been any better .
Art is a product of eccentric genius , which we can protect , but which no theory of utility can explain .
So when , in 1834 , Mill — having been chastened by madness and instructed by art ( and having mourned , and been emancipated by , the death of Bentham , two years earlier ) — began a new journal , the London Review , the contributor he sought most eagerly was no utilitarian but the great Scottish reactionary prose - poet Thomas Carlyle .
( The keen friendship between these two utterly unlike men would itself be a good subject for a book . )
Mill revered Carlyle ’s originality of vision and soul , while Carlyle , though he mocked Mill ’s pensive faith in rational argument , recognized that the younger man had the far more finished and exact mind .
The friendship survived even the most scarifying incident in the history of letters , when Mill ’s housemaid accidentally burned the only manuscript of Carlyle ’s history of the French Revolution in the kitchen fire .
( Carlyle was goodhumored about it , perhaps because , like many writers , he really preferred having the project to brood on to the brief melodrama of publication . )
Throughout the eighteen - thirties , the give - and - take between Carlyle ’s deeply pessimistic sense of the primal violence that lay beneath the surface of civilization and Mill ’s insistence that the cure for the primal illness was more civilization was one of the creative engines of English thought .
Beginning in the late eighteen - twenties , Mill took on a great deal of Continental philosophy that , then as now , was regarded as just this side of charlatanism by his bread - and - butter Anglo - Saxon colleagues .
He borrowed the term “ self - development ” from the German Romantic philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt , and considered that , rather than utilitarian pleasure , to be the end of life .
A good life for Mill , post - madness , is not one where you have queued before the slot machine of utility and got the candy it dispenses .
It is one where you have gone out into the world to build the best self you can — travelled where you wanted and seen what you could and said what you had to , sung your own songs and heard your own poems .
Mill was a romantic and an epicurean in a gray tweed suit , and his mature liberalism is both what a narrow historian means by liberalism — a theory of free conduct justified by its good results — and what the rest of us mean when we say that someone is liberal - minded : open to all the pleasures of life and generous in their enjoyment .
Like every intelligent Englishman of an epicurean cast , he spent as much time as he could in France .
Though he was quietly Francophile from early on , his illness and recovery made him declaratively so .
He bought a little house in the papal town of Avignon , in the South of France ; it became the home of his heart , where , in his later years , he lived and wrote , and where , eventually , he died .
He always condescended to the French , as even Francophile Englishmen will : “ Whenever anything goes amiss , the habitual impulse of French people is to say , ‘ Il faut de la patience ’ ” — One must be patient — “ and of English people , ‘ What a shame . ’
The people who think it a shame when anything goes wrong — who rush to the conclusion that the evil could and ought to have been prevented , are those who , in the long run , do most to make the world better . ”
The hopes that had been raised and then ruined by the 1848 revolution in France played the same role for Mill ’s generation that the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rise of Putin have played in our time : inspiring proof that liberalism might win after all , followed by the crushing realization that it was no match for authoritarian , strongman nationalism , which , in France , took the form of the papier - mâché emperor Louis - Napoleon .
( The French experience burned Mill badly .
It led him , for a while , to propose , in the ideal republic , giving educated voters more votes than uneducated ones — it was a nation of peasants who had voted in Louis - Napoleon . )
Yet France , even after Mill ’s disappointments with its politics , remained for him the great good place .
The humanizing influence of French civilization — “ the free and genial atmosphere of Continental life , ” as he called it — tempered his drier certainties .
The mature Mill is a stable thinker but not a systematic one .
He recognizes the existence of half - truths alongside near - truths , and of “ almost so ”s right by “ yes , nearly ”s .
“ Truth , in the great practical concerns of life , is so much a question of the reconciling and combining of opposites , ” he once wrote .
“ Even progress , which ought to superadd , for the most part only substitutes , one partial and incomplete truth for another . ”
Throughout the thirties and forties in early - Victorian England , no one was more attended to than the radical Mill .
We can only envy his public , for he would have been a terrible pundit for our sound - bite age .
He is n’t an aphorist ; his stuff takes space .
Mill ’s sentences sway and ponder with the heavy grace of elephants , and are often about the same size .
Defending a philosophy of hedonism , he writes sentences that contain more philosophy than hedonism : “ The happiness which they meant was not a life of rapture ; but moments of such , in an existence made up of few and transitory pains , many and various pleasures , with a decided predominance of the active over the passive , and having as the foundation of the whole , not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing . ”
“ Gather ye rosebuds while ye may , ” in other words , but no rosebuds fall on the page .
Whatever the subject , Mill surveys the ground , clears it of underbrush , builds a house of straw to demonstrate what a shoddy house looks like , sets it on fire , and in its place builds a house of brick , which he dares you to knock down .
The house of brick is , as Victorian brick houses usually were , lacking in grace and lightness and charm , but it still stands .
You do n’t come away from Mill dazzled , as you do with Ruskin or Carlyle , but you come away with a place to live your life .
Mill had an allergy to dogma , including his own — which makes him an occasional friend to the dogmatist .
When someone says that proof of God ’s existence can be found in Nature , he does n’t say it ’s bosh .
He asks what this would actually entail if it were true , and infers that such a creator would have to be limited , inept , well - meaning , forgetful , and in a daily contest with another power : “ A Being of great but limited power . . . who desires , and pays some regard to , the happiness of his creatures , but who seems to have some other motives of action which he cares more for , and who can hardly be supposed to have created the universe for that purpose alone . ”
What natural theology , taken seriously , shows is not the great Watchmaker or the All - Seeing Jove but the absent - minded Landlord , a sort of eternal Lord Emsworth , who , though he helps the young lovers , cares mainly about his pig .
But Mill really means it : take the argument for God ’s existence seriously , and that ’s where it leads you .
That ’s the key thing about Mill , hustling between London and Avignon , climbing mountains and administering India and surveying churches : he always really means it .
When , in the eighteen - sixties , the English - appointed governor of Jamaica punished a native uprising with hideous cruelty — the accused were tortured and many hanged , after trumpery trials —
Mill led the fight in England against him , chairing a committee to have him tried not for maladministration but for murder .
( A committee formed in defense of the governor included Dickens and Carlyle . )
When Mill said that his rights were worthless unless everyone else had them , too , he really meant it .
His friendship with Carlyle broke only when the Scotsman ’s racism became too much for Mill , a passionate abolitionist , to bear .
Of all Mill ’s causes , his championing of the rights of women is still the most heroic , and its heroism turns out to be rooted in a passionate love for another person .
Mill said that he had always been a feminist , but there is n’t any doubt that the engine of his feminism was his friend , love , collaborator , and eventual wife , Harriet Taylor .
They met at her home , in Finsbury , in the summer of 1830 , over dinner among liberal friends .
Harriet , a year younger than Mill , was married , to a slow - witted , well - meaning pharmacist named John Taylor ; they had two children .
She was smart and pretty — “ a small head , a swan - like throat , and a complexion like a pearl , ” the daughter of someone present at the momentous dinner wrote later — and already oppressed by her very unequal marriage .
If you see her pictures , and make allowances for the cosmetic conventions of the portraiture of the time , she still looks pretty wonderful : big Natalie Portman eyes and that fine long neck .
She and Mill fell for each other quickly , and began working together .
Within a year , someone was writing to her to ask , of a new review of Byron , “ Did you or Mill do it ? ”
For the rest of the decade , theirs was a complicated lobster quadrille of love .
If the lovers were just a touch less fierce - looking , Mill and Taylor would make as good a Victorian love story as Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett .
They were seen everywhere together .
Carlyle ’s wife , Jane , gossiped that “ Mrs. Taylor , tho ’ encumbered with a husband and children , has ogled John Mill so successfully that he was desperately in love . ”
After years of intrigue , the Taylors finally decided on a separation .
To test Mill ’s love , Harriet went to Paris , and invited him to spend six weeks with her there .
The interlude was splendid — but then Harriet , with a rather sweet imperiousness , allowed her husband to come to Paris for his own audition .
Harriet ultimately decided — with mingled propriety , uncertainty , and something like flirtatiousness — that they could share her , on an alternating schedule , at the Taylor house , her husband entertaining guests with her on some days , and Mill on others .
Taylor paid the bills , while Mill stocked the wine cellar .
When John and Harriet were pining for each other , they held secret meetings at the London zoo , by the cage of their “ old friend Rhino , ” whose horn — as they perhaps knew , perhaps did not — was an Asian agent of erotic love .
The gossips gossiped all the more .
The gawking Carlyle reported that in France they had “ eatin ’ grapes off o’ one bunch , like two love - birds . ”
Though in his memoir Mill denied that they had had sex before they were married , there are purring letters that suggest the contrary .
“ While you can love me as you so sweetly & beautifully shewed in that hour yesterday , I have all I care for or desire , ” he wrote in one letter .
“ The influence of that dear little hour has kept me in spirits ever since . ”
An earlier biographer of Mill , Bruce Mazlish , makes the point that Mill ’s mother was the real missing presence in his life , and that Harriet ( as Yoko Ono did for John Lennon ) helped fill his need for a woman who was both an intellectual match and thoroughly maternal .
The romance in Mill ’s life helped turn him from a thinking machine into a feeling mensch ; the know - it - all became an anything - for - love .
Harriet ’s own writing of the eighteen - thirties and forties on the oppression of marriage has the urgency of immediate experience .
A smart woman who had been obliged to be someone ’s idea of a wife , she had been at that table with the dumb little dictator :
“ The most insignificant of men , the man who can obtain influence or consideration nowhere else , finds one place where he is chief and head .
There is one person , often greatly his superior in understanding , who is obliged to consult him , and whom he is not obliged to consult .
He is judge , magistrate , ruler , over their joint concerns . ”
Mill and Taylor , in their later writing , most famously in the 1869 “ The Subjection of Women , ” are n’t content to show that women would be happier if freer ; they go right to the ground and ask what reason we have for thinking that any restraint on women ’s freedom is just .
The arguments against women ’s liberty have to do with what is natural for women to do , or what women are capable of doing , or what some men would be offended by .
They take each case and show that its only rationale is our slavery to custom .
Women are naturally passive ?
Go tell Queen Elizabeth .
They are happy in their lot ?
All slaves say as much to the slave master .
They are “ designed ” to have children ?
No argument from nature can ever alter an argument from ethics : if women want to raise children , excellent ; if they do n’t , there is no natural reason to think they must any more than there is a reason to think that male philosophers should all put down their pens and go out hunting for mammoths .
Mill makes the point again and again that no one can possibly know what women are or are not “ naturally ” good at , since their opportunities have been so vanishingly small compared with the length of their oppression .
Arguing against the notion that women have no talent for the fine arts , Mill makes the shrewd point that in the one liberal art where women are encouraged as much as men , acting on the stage , everyone admits that they ’re just as good or better .
In any case , nature has nothing to do with what should be done .
In his essay on “ Nature , ” he writes , “ Nature can not be a proper model for us to imitate .
Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills ; torture because nature tortures ; ruin and devastate because nature does the like ; or we ought not to consider what nature does , but what it is good to do . ”
Mill ’s rejection of a natural case is n’t that anything goes ; it ’s that nobody can really know what goes until someone goes farther .
He does n’t believe in a blank slate on which anything can be inscribed ; he believes in the power of the chalk - holding hand to change the sum on the blackboard .
On a list of modern words that changed the most lives , those which Harriet and John wrought together in “ The Subjection of Women ” must rank high .
Before it , women were for all intents and purposes chattel ; afterward , they would sooner or later have to be made citizens .
You could argue against it , try to unmake it , but you could n’t ignore it .
The beach was taken , and the cautious odd couple by the rhino ’s cage had taken it .
John and Harriet ’s intellectual idyll was long - lived in shadow , short - lived in sunlight .
Mr. Taylor died in 1849 , and in 1851 John and Harriet were married .
But after only seven and a half years Harriet died of one of those sad , unnamed wasting diseases that blighted the period .
Mill had a monument — of the same Carrara marble as Michelangelo ’s David — constructed for her in Avignon , with an inscription that included the lines “ Were there but a few hearts and intellects like hers / this earth would already become the hoped - for heaven . ”
That same month , Mill sent off to the publisher the finished manuscript of “ On Liberty , ” dedicating it to the memory of “ the friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement . ”
( Darwin was finishing “ On the Origin of Species ” that same year , and also saw it published the next ; the two books remain the bedrock of the liberal age . )
Reeves rightly calls “ On Liberty ” “ the greatest celebration of the value of human freedom ever written . ”
Mill has a principle of liberty , but far more important is that he starts a practice of liberal thought .
The utility principle is installed , as one might install a piece of software , but is employed only fitfully .
No shrewd new proof is proposed .
It is the negative side of Mill ’s claim that changes everything .
He reverses figure and ground in the argument .
When he asks us to think about liberty , he does n’t want us to ask , Can this odd thing people are doing be deduced from some ethical axiom that lets me call it “ good , ” and permits them to go on doing it ?
He wants us to ask something simpler :
Is this practice causing me any real harm ?
Not potential harm to my feelings , not social harm to my idea of right , not damage to the great precepts of religion or to my stuffy uncle ’s sense of propriety .
Unless the speaker is actually about to cut your throat , you have to let him work his jaw .
And , by really meaning it , this essentially conservative and tradition - loving man showed that all kinds of practices can stand scrutiny and not be damaged , and that the authoritarian position is not the strongest one but merely the most frightened .
Nothing is worse for being looked at .
No idea is good enough to exist unopposed .
Fundamental differences lie even at the heart of religion and must be freely aired .
Christianity is not against argument ; it is an argument — should one follow the Greek morality of St. Paul ( which includes slavery ) or the Jewish morality of St. Mark ( which implies the Seder ) ?
The usual objection to Mill ’s argument is that free societies will still differ radically about what they want to be free for : my idea of fun is not yours , or Genghis Khan’s .
Mill knew this —he knew that you could n’t prove that good things were good .
But he also knew that questions not decidable by proof were still amenable to argument , and that he would rather have the side of the argument that suggested that health , prosperity , and pleasure were good things than the side that said they were n’t .
Advisers to Mr. Obama said they expected him to take swift action on two fronts .
First , they said , he will probably revoke a Bush administration directive that sharply restricted states ’ ability to expand the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
In addition , they said , he will support Congressional efforts to expand the program before March 31 , 2009 , when at least 42 states are projected to exhaust their allotments of federal money .
Ronald F. Pollack , the executive director of Families USA , a liberal - leaning consumer group that has worked closely with Congress and the Obama team , said , “ The prospects for meaningful health care reform have never looked better . ”
Among Mr. Obama ’s health care strategists , Mr. Pollack said , are former Senator Tom Daschle ; Jeanne M. Lambrew , a former Clinton aide ; Neera Tanden , who was director of domestic policy for the Obama campaign ; and Representative Rahm Emanuel , who will be White House chief of staff .
In his plan , Mr. Baucus makes these proposals :
¶ People age 55 to 64 should be able to buy Medicare coverage if they do not have access to a public insurance program or a group health plan .
More than four million people in this age group are uninsured .
¶ Medicaid would be available to everyone below the poverty level , providing at least seven million more people with access to the program .
In many states , adults with incomes well below the poverty level  $ 17,600 for a family of three  are ineligible for Medicaid .
¶ The State Children ’s Health Insurance Program would be expanded to cover all uninsured youngsters in families with incomes at or below 250 percent of the poverty level ( $ 44,000 for a family of three ) .
This would raise the income limit in about half the states .
Mr. Baucus would also make it easier for many legal immigrants to qualify for Medicaid and the children ’s health program .
Under current law , such immigrants are generally barred from the programs in their first five years in the United States .
He would lift that ban .
According to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the chief proponent of the big bank bailout , flooding the banks with taxpayers ’ money was supposed to get them to start lending freely again .
And that , in turn , was supposed to stabilize the markets and prevent the downturn from being worse than it otherwise would be .
It was not entirely clear from the start exactly how Mr. Paulson would ensure that things would go that way .
Indeed , earlier this month , shortly after the bailout was enacted , The Times ’s Mark Landler reported that Treasury officials also wanted to steer the bailout billions to banks that would use the money to buy up other banks .
Now , lo and behold , with $ 250 billion in bailout funds committed to dozens of large and regional banks , it turns out that many of the recipients of this investment from taxpayers are not all that interested in making loans .
And it appears that Mr. Paulson is not so bothered by their reluctance .
Mr. Paulson and the bailout recipients have some explaining to do .
Congress should plan hearings as soon as possible  and take action to set a clear strategy .
Christmas tree prices ARE going through the roof but this is just ridiculous
It 's going to leave more than a few pine needles on his carpet .
But that 's a price Greig Howe is happy to pay for having one of the most stunning Christmas trees ever seen in suburbia .
Thirty - five feet tall , it stretches from the floor of his living room right up through the top of his home .
Festive fun :
The 35ft tree that appears to shoot up through all three floors of a house in Dorset
Well , it appears to .
In reality Mr Howe has created a breathtaking optical illusion .
The 35 - year - old designer spent two days installing the tree in his six - bedroom detached home in Bournemouth to make it look like it had smashed through the ceilings .
To do so , he cut it into three sections with a chainsaw and then enlisted the help of seven friends to put it into place , using ropes .
Greig Howe and his son
Harry pose in front of their six - bedroom home , which has been uniquely converted for Christmas
He put the bottom part of the trunk in the front room before squeezing the middle section into the spare bedroom immediately above - after removing the window for access .
The top of the tree , complete with star , was then fixed to the roof - acting as a handy landing signal to Santa when he calls this Christmas .
Mr Howe , who is separated and has three sons , Harry , 11 , Roni , three , and one - year - old Finn , said the tree cost more than £ 250 to buy and install .
Mr Howe in his living room .
The skate park designer had to remove a bay window to squeeze the tree into position
And then he had to splash out on the 160 large baubles and 2,000 lights that adorn it .
' I really wanted to give the kids a Christmas they would n't forget , ' he said .
' From the outside it appears to be one huge tree that has shot up through the ceilings and floorboards and out through the roof .
Harry Howe , 11 , sits in the family 's spare bedroom that now houses the tree 's middle trunk
' People keep stopping and laughing at it and Harry absolutely loves it . '
Mr Howe bought the tree from a private yard in the New Forest , after Harry expressed disappointment with last year 's 5 ft version .
But he did n't know about his father 's plans until he arrived home from school to find the top of the tree apparently sticking out of the roof .
The giant tree spills out of the Howes ' home in daylight
He said yesterday : ' I think it looks wicked .
Last year we had a tree that was about the same size as me so I asked Dad if he could get a bigger one this year .
' But I did n't think it would be this big .
I came home and could n't believe it when I saw it .
I could n't speak .
I really thought the tree had gone through the roof . '

( CNN ) -- Congress kicked off a special lame - duck session Monday -- and a partisan battle over the fate of the nation 's Big Three automakers .
Workers leave a General Motors Powertrain plant in Warren , Michigan , last week .
Senate Democrats were trying to earn GOP support for their proposed bailout of the Big Three automakers that would use up to $ 25 billion of funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , the $ 700 billion measure that passed in October to help bail out financial institutions .
Democrats would like to see a vote Wednesday , but some concede they probably do n't have the support .
President Bush and GOP leaders in Congress say they'd be willing to lift some restrictions on an already - approved program to dole out $ 25 billion in loans meant to help U.S. automakers design more fuel - efficient vehicles .
" We 're surprised that Senate Democrats would propose a bailout that fails to require automakers to make the hard decisions needed to restructure and become viable , " White House Secretary Dana Perino said .
" It would add another $ 25 billion to the $ 25 billion already allocated for the auto industry , raiding the TARP of funds needed to stabilize our financial system and encourage new lending to help our economy grow .
" Congress should instead accelerate the existing $ 25 billion already appropriated for the auto industry by amending the Energy Department 's loan program -- but only for those firms that make the difficult choices and do the restructuring necessary to become viable without additional taxpayer subsidies , " Perino said .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , speaking on the Senate floor Monday , urged action on the plan to provide TARP money to automakers .
" If we move forward , we can protect American jobs , help American families and prevent our economy from falling further into a recession , " he said .
A Senate Democratic aide said the bill " requires a long - term financial plan from any loan recipient , and includes robust language to provide for oversight and taxpayer protections and to limit executive compensation . "
Read a draft of the bill ( PDF )
Reid said in the event his bill fails , there would be an alternative piece of legislation that focuses on unemployment insurance and relief for the auto industry 's workforce .
House Democratic leaders and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , met with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday afternoon .
The meeting was to include an update on TARP and discussion about using those funds to help the Big Three .
Frank said a House version of the bill would require automakers to repay the loans in spring if they can't prove their viability .
It also would limit bonuses paid by companies taking the federal money and reaffirm a commitment to more fuel - efficient vehicles .
Sen . Carl Levin , D - Michigan , is drafting legislation to throw a lifeline to Detroit , Michigan , home of the Big Three companies .
" One out of 10 jobs in this country are auto - related .
Twenty percent of retail sales are auto - related or automobiles , so this is a national problem , " Levin told NBC 's " Meet the Press " on Sunday .
Watch what some say are the costs of letting the Big Three fail »
The automakers have come on hard times of late .
Ford announced this month that it lost $ 3 billion last quarter .
General Motors is trading at about $ 3 a share , the lowest figure at which its stock has traded in more than 60 years .
Chrysler has announced numerous plant closings and thousands of job cuts as its sales have plummeted over the last year .
The Center for Automotive Research , a think tank in Ann Arbor , Michigan , that is pushing for a bailout , estimates about 2.5 million job cuts if just half of the Big Three 's manufacturing capacity shuts down .
About 240,000 of those job losses would be at the automakers ; 800,000 would be at various suppliers and dealerships ; and another 1.4 million job losses would come from businesses that rely on automaker spending , the think tank estimates .
A letter is being circulated by Levin and Sen. George Voinovich , R - Ohio , to all senators for their signatures in support of the auto industry bailout .
iReport.com :
No choice but to bail out automakers ?
The letter -- written to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- says the Big Three " face rapidly evaporating operational liquidity " and " soon may not be able to continue to operate . "
But some think the TARP money is for the financial system only .
" There 's a line of companies , of industries waiting at Treasury just to see if they can get their hands on that $ 700 billion , " Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN's " Late Edition " on Sunday .
" That is for the financial system .
It 's to stabilize the financial system .
That should not be used . "
Sen .
Bob Casey , D - Pennsylvania , said last week he can't condone using TARP funds for the auto industry when the money has yet to help homeowners facing foreclosure .
Sen . Richard Shelby , R - Alabama , one of the most vocal critics of the proposed lifeline , suggested Sunday that bailing out the Big Three would be a waste of taxpayer dollars because it would reward the companies for mismanagement .
Shelby , the ranking member on the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , further said in his remarks on NBC's " Meet the Press " that the government should allow the companies to file bankruptcy .
See how foreign car companies have flocked to the U.S. »
" They would be , in a lot of people 's judgment , a lot better off to go through Chapter 11 , where they could reorganize , get rid of the management , get rid of the boards -- the people who 've brought them where they are today , " Shelby said .
Watch CNN 's Jack Cafferty explore whether the auto giant is worth saving »
Democrats say the automakers need the existing $ 25 billion in loans and an additional bridge loan just to survive through the year .
However , many Democratic leaders say they realize the folly of bailing out Detroit without specifying Congress ' expectations of the industry .
President - elect Barack Obama told CBS ' " 60 Minutes " on Sunday that Detroit needed help , but he opposes writing a " blank check . "
iReport.com : Reader believes auto bailout must come with " binding conditions "
Sen . Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , who heads the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , said last week , " Clearly we should n't be writing checks without some clear conditionality of what 's going to happen with that industry -- if they 're going to change and get back on their feet again . "
Democratic leaders would need 60 votes in the Senate to avoid a GOP filibuster , and as of last week , Dodd was certain they did n't have the numbers .
Gaining those numbers became more problematic Sunday , when Obama officially relinquished his Senate seat .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden , a Delaware Democrat , is also expected to be absent from this week 's wrangling .
The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on the issue Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday .
Despite the proposal 's infinitesimal chance of succeeding , Democratic leadership aides said proponents will push for a vote this week .
The pessimistic Dodd , however , has said his party should consider waiting for Obama to take office .
With Obama in office , the Treasury can act without legislation .
Also , with all run -off elections decided , party leaders will know the exact makeup of the 111th Congress , though Democrats are not likely to garner a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate .

Rachel Nickell was killed on Wimbledon Common in front of her young son
The Metropolitan Police force has rejected calls for an inquiry into errors made when police investigated the killing of Rachel Nickell in 1992 .
On Thursday convicted killer Robert Napper admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
Police then apologised to Colin Stagg , wrongly accused of her murder in 1994 .
They said more could have been done to catch Napper and prevent his further crimes but insisted the way murder is investigated has changed significantly .
Labour MP Keith Vaz had called for the police to review their procedures .
Rachel Nickell , 23 , was stabbed 49 times as she walked on south - west London 's Wimbledon Common with her two - year - old son Alex on 15 July 1992 .
We need to make sure whatever the technology involved that this kind of thing never happens again
Keith Vaz MP
The police hunt for her killer led to Mr Stagg , from Roehampton , south - west London , who appeared on trial for murder in 1994 .
But the case was thrown out after evidence from an undercover policewoman was ruled inadmissible .
Mr Stagg , who spent 13 months in custody , was awarded £ 706,000 compensation from the Home Office earlier this year .
' I apologise ' On Thursday , the Met 's Assistant Commissioner John Yates apologised to Mr Stagg .
He said : " It is clear he is completely innocent of any involvement in this case and I apologise to him for the mistakes that were made in the early 1990s . "
He added : " We do say , however , that the way murder is investigated now has changed significantly from 16 years ago . "
Killer who slipped through the net Question marks still hang over the original investigation and the missed opportunities to catch Napper , who went on to kill another young mother and her daughter .
Keith Vaz , chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee , said : " We need to make sure whatever the technology involved that this kind of thing never happens again , so an internal review is extremely necessary . "
But the Met told the BBC the case had been extensively reviewed already and lessons had been learned .
Speaking on Radio 4 's Today programme , Peter Neyroud chief executive officer of the National Policing Improvement Agency , said : " The lessons of the Rachel Nickell case have been learnt - certainly critical ones about improvements to forensic work and improvements in senior investigating officer training .
" We have actually had legislation about one issue , which is the regulation of the covert activity .
" If you put those together and compare 1992 to what we 've got now , I think Colin Stagg would have been ruled out pretty quickly due to the forensic evidence . "
Dangerous man But barrister William Clegg QC , who has represented both Mr Stagg and Napper , told the programme : " It seems to me the problem with the Rachel Nickell case was that the police became overly reliant on the view of a purported expert in the form of the profiler .
" That is a failing that has happened since then on a number of occasions . "
He called for courts to intervene more , as they do in the US , to make sure the expert 's evidence " is not only relevant but also reliable " .
An Old Bailey judge told Napper , 42 , a convicted killer and serial rapist , he would be held indefinitely at Broadmoor high security hospital .
Mr Justice Griffiths Williams said : " You are on any view a very dangerous man . "
Earlier , the court had heard psychiatrists believed Napper had paranoid schizophrenia and Asperger 's syndrome at the time of the killing .
Napper admitted the killing of Samantha and Jazmine Bissett
He was questioned in December 1995 about Miss Nickell 's killing , but denied involvement .
He had been sent to Broadmoor secure hospital two months earlier for raping and killing Samantha Bissett , 27 , and her four - year - old daughter Jazmine in Plumstead , south London , in November 1993 .
A tiny particle of Napper 's DNA was picked up when Miss Nickell 's body was swabbed soon after her death .
But it was too small to be analysed until recent advances made it possible .
A match to Napper was confirmed in 2004 .
He was interviewed again in Broadmoor in 2006 , but again did not own up to the crime .
In 1989 , officers failed to question him after his mother rang a local police station to say he had confessed to a rape .
Napper was also questioned about a series of sex attacks in 1992 , but was wrongly eliminated .

After five months of scraping and digging into the soil at a lonely spot near the Martian north pole , NASA 's Mars Phoenix Lander has finally succumbed to the cold , dark Martian winter .
NASA scientists announced yesterday that they had n't received a communication from the lander since November 2 , and pronounced the death of Phoenix .
While the mission was expected to end this way , with the lander 's solar panels unable to get enough light from the fading sun and temperatures dropping rapidly , Phoenix 's legions of fans could n't help but mourn the demise of the robot explorer .
NASA official Doug McCuistion counseled people to
view Phoenix 's end as " an Irish wake rather than a funeral .
It 's certainly been a grand adventure , " McCuistion said [ AP ] .
The beginning of the end for Phoenix came
on Oct. 27 , just after Phoenix finished its last major experiment analyzing Martian soil , [ when ] an unexpected dust storm hit .
The batteries , already low from running the experiment , ran out of energy .
The spacecraft first put itself into a low - energy “ safe mode , ” then fell silent .
It revived itself on Oct. 30 , but , with the dust still swirling , was never able to fully recharge its batteries .
Each day , the solar panels would generate enough electricity for the spacecraft to wake up , but then the batteries drained again [ The New York Times ] .
NASA will continue to listen for a signal for a few more weeks , but no further communications are expected .
NASA scientists say they 're not too downcast by the end of the mission ; they 're focusing on what Phoenix accomplished .
The lander will be remembered most for being the first to spot water ice in a trench dug in the Martian soil , and the first to " taste " that ice in its sample ovens .
Phoenix also found clays in the soil that must have formed in the presence of liquid water , which indicate that Mars could have been more hospitable to life in its warmer past .
However , the mission did experience a few glitches , most notably with the
tiny test ovens designed to sniff for traces of organic , or carbon - based compounds .
Several oven doors failed to open all the way ; the lander also had trouble getting the dirt into the ovens and a short circuit threatened to render the instrument useless [ AP ] .
Temperatures at the Martian north pole will soon plummet to below - 250 degrees Fahrenheit , and carbon dioxide ice is expected to encase Phoenix , destroying its electronics .
However , if Phoenix somehow survives the cruel winter , it 's programmed with a " Lazarus mode " that
could also allow the lander to rise from hibernation in the Martian spring — October 2009 here on Earth .
" There is a possibility that it could try to come alive and contact us again .
The chances are probably low , " NASA 's McCuistion said .
Many of the instruments aboard Phoenix have been used up , but " it might be interesting " to employ the craft a while longer as a Mars weather station , McCuistion said [ National Geographic News ] .

EAST LANSING , Mich. , December 10 , 2008 — A Michigan State University student government leader has been found guilty of “ spamming ” and misuse of university resources after she criticized the administration ’s plan to change the school calendar .
MSU junior Kara Spencer had carefully selected and e-mailed 391 of the school ’s faculty members , encouraging them to express their views about the changes .
Spencer , who plans to appeal her unconstitutional punishment , has turned to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help .
“ It is outrageous that MSU ’s Student - Faculty Judiciary would find against a student who did nothing more than write members of her community who might be concerned about a major administrative decision , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ MSU must immediately reverse this unjust punishment and revise its policy . ”
In late August , MSU ’s administration revealed to members of the Faculty Council the administration ’s plans to shorten the school ’s Academic Calendar and Fall Welcome ( freshman orientation ) schedules , and asked that comments about the proposed changes be submitted by September 30 .
Given the highly controversial nature of the changes , members of the University Committee on Student Affairs ( UCSA ) met and exchanged e-mails in mid-September to construct a formal response .
UCSA consists of several student government members ( including Spencer ) , several faculty members , and several MSU administrators .
On September 14 , Spencer notified UCSA that she would send a personal version of the formal response to faculty members .
She noted that she had “ compiled a database of all faculty on campus ” for this purpose .
None of the faculty members or administrators involved in the discussion gave any indication that MSU would choose to repress the e-mail or charge Spencer with any breaches of policy .
One of the committee members even encouraged her to proceed .
On or about September 15 , Spencer carefully selected 391 faculty members — roughly 8 percent of MSU ’s faculty — and e-mailed them her version of UCSA ’s letter .
Spencer ’s e-mail argued that the proposed calendar changes “ will greatly affect both faculty and students alike , ” and called for “ an inclusive dialogue among members of the University community ” prior to adoption .
On September 16 , MSU Network Administrator Randall J. Hall summoned Spencer to a mandatory “ investigation . ”
The next day , Hall alleged that Spencer had violated as many as five MSU policies by sending what he called unauthorized “ spam . ”
After Spencer requested a hearing before the Student - Faculty Judiciary , FIRE wrote MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon , calling on her to end the unconstitutional investigation .
MSU chose to proceed with the hearing , however , and Simon falsely claimed that the policy was acceptable because it was “ content neutral . ”
MSU proceeded with its shameful hearing on December 2 , and the Judiciary notified Spencer this afternoon that she had been found guilty of violating MSU ’s Network Acceptable Use Policy and of engaging in an “ unauthorized ” use of the MSU network .
Today , Spencer was punished with a formal “ Warning ” placed in her student file .
MSU ’s “ spam ” policy prohibits the sending of an unsolicited e-mail to more than about 20 - 30 recipients over two days without prior permission .
“ MSU ’s decision defies the First Amendment , fairness , and common sense , ” Adam Kissel , Director of FIRE ’s Individual Rights Defense Program , said .
“ MSU is effectively preventing the campus community from sending e-mails criticizing the administration to more than an extremely small fraction of the MSU community .
The university should be ashamed , and the president should immediately overturn this illiberal finding . ”

Newsweek has released a new , intriguing article in their “ Secrets of the 2008 Campaign ” series .
Among the juicy tidbits is a pre-debate quote from Barack Obama about the challenge of solving environmental problems .
[ social_buttons ]
The package of secret tales includes stories about how both campaigns had their computer systems hacked , how Sarah Palin walked into a briefing in only a towel , and also has some worrisome anecdotes about increased threats of violence against the Obama family .
It would be folly to try to explain the context of the quote about going green from Obama myself , so here is the Newsweek segment verbatim :
The debates unnerved both candidates .
When he was preparing for them during the Democratic primaries , Obama was recorded saying , “ I do n’t consider this to be a good format for me , which makes me more cautious .
I often find myself trapped by the questions and thinking to myself , ‘ You know , this is a stupid question , but let me … answer it . ’
So when Brian Williams is asking me about what ’s a personal thing that you ’ve done [ that ’s green ] , and I say , you know , ‘ Well , I planted a bunch of trees . ’
And he says , ‘ I ’m talking about personal . ’
What I ’m thinking in my head is , ‘ Well , the truth is , Brian , we ca n’t solve global warming because I f—ing changed light bulbs in my house .
It ’s because of something collective ’ . ”

There has been a " catastrophic slippage " in standards of science taught in schools , leaving children with a superficial understanding of chemistry , biology and physics , according to the Royal Society of Chemistry .
Declining standards in schools , linked to teachers focusing on test results rather than analytical skills , risks starving the country of vital skills , the RSC said .
In a competition run by the society , 1,300 pupils with a keen interest in science sat chemistry questions from O - level and GCSE papers set every decade since the 1960s .
The questions were selected to test logical reasoning and problem - solving .
Only 35 % got the toughest questions from the most recent GCSE papers right .
But the pupils fared progressively worse when doing the older O - level papers .
For the 1980s O - level papers , 23 % of questions were answered correctly .
On the 1970s papers , only 18 % of answers were right and on the 1960s papers , just 15 % of questions were answered correctly .
The government said the results merely demonstrated that science had evolved in 40 years , but Richard Pike , chief executive of the RSC , said : " The brightest pupils are not being stretched , or trained in mathematical techniques , because they can get a grade A* without doing a single calculation .
Conversely , the majority get at least a ' good pass ' – grade C – by showing merely a superficial knowledge on a wide range of issues , but no understanding of the fundamentals .
A mark of 20 % was sufficient in one of this summer 's GCSE science examinations . "
He said surveys had revealed that around half of independent schools have withdrawn GCSEs in mathematics and science subjects to opt for tougher , more traditional international GCSEs .
The RSC is petitioning the prime minister to take action .
Michael Gove , the shadow children 's secretary , said : " We 've slipped 10 places in the international league tables for science , and children are being asked questions that show our curriculum is n't preparing them for the challenges for the 21st century .
That 's why we need to make sure that our exams are as good as the world 's best . "
A department for children , schools and families spokesperson said that standards in science were in fact improving in response to better funding of schools .
" Times have changed – it is unlikely that pupils from the 1960s could answer questions set today , given that the role of science in society has changed so much in the last 40 years , " she said .
• Try some of the questions for yourself .
• And here are the answers
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. food prices will rise by at least 7 percent in 2009 because of higher feed costs for chickens , hogs and cattle , said a group of food - industry economists on Thursday .
It would be the third year in a row that food prices rose faster than the overall U.S. inflation rate .
Food inflation is the highest since 1990 .
“ The sizable increase in the cost of producing food has not been fully passed on to the consumer , ” said private consultant Bill Lapp .
He foresaw food inflation of 7 percent - 9 percent in 2009 .
During a teleconference , economists from the National Chicken Council and the consultancy Farm Econ said food inflation could be 7 percent - 8 percent .
The teleconference was arranged by a group of major foodmakers .
Wholesale prices for items used by foodmakers have climbed more rapidly than grocery and restaurant prices , so higher consumer prices are in store , said Lapp .
Although grain prices have declined since summer , this year ’s corn , wheat and soybean crops are forecast to fetch prices at the farm gate that are double their 2005 levels .
Corn and soybeans are major ingredients in feed rations .
“ We ’ve been losing money for more than a year , ” said Bill Roenigk , economist for the Chicken Council , who said producers intend to cut production by as much as 12 percent .
“ We need to recover these feed costs . ”
Thomas Elam , head of Farm Econ , said poultry , hog and cattle producers would cut production in coming months because of feed costs , meaning less meat on the retail market but at higher prices .
Menu prices are restaurants up 4.3 percent so far this year , the largest increase since 1990 , said Hudson Riehle of the National Restaurant Association .
He said one - third of each sales dollar goes to food purchases .
Agriculture Department forecasts also say pricey meats will drive food inflation in 2008 .
Americans spend more than $ 1 trillion a year on groceries , snacks , carry - out foods and restaurant meals .
Farmers get 20 cents of the food dollar .
The rest goes to processing , labor , transportation and distribution .
I had no intention of buying a rug on our trip to Turkey in December 2006 .
Certainly , not on the first day .
I ’d already purchased a rug ; when my son and I had been abducted in Tunis , Tunisia in 1999 .
But , that ’s a different story .
Yet , there I was , just 4 hours after arriving in Istanbul , shaking hands with a rug merchant as he packed up our newly purchased kilin carpet .
How did this happen ?
Educators , business people , publishers , we all seek to influence others , and we are all influenced by others .
Perhaps my experience in Turkey , seen through the prism of an expert in the principles of influence and persuasion can help us all .
First , let me describe the events leading up to the purchase .
Then , I ’ll relate those events to principles contained in the book Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini .
Our hotel , the Mavi Ev , or Blue House Hotel , was just across the street from the famous Blue Mosque in Turkey .
As soon as we stepped out to go visit the mosque , the first person approached us ,
Salesman : “ Do you want to buy a rug ? ”
Me : “ No thank you . ”
Salesman : “ Where are you from ? ”
Me : “ No thank you , we ’re on our way to view the mosque . ”
In the 50 yards between the hotel and the entrance to the mosque , we were approached at least 5 times , in similar ways .
The sales people were pleasant , often humorous , never hostile .
But always persistent , asking at least 5 to 6 questions to try to engage us .
“ How long are you staying in Turkey ? ”
“ How do you like Turkey so far ? ”
“ Are you thirsty or hungry ? ”
“ Would you like some apple tea ? ”
“ Do you know where you are going ? ”
After the Blue Mosque , we walked across the park to the Hagia Sophia , and were approached another 5 to 6 times .
But , as we walked up to the Hagia Sophia , we found out that it had just closed , and someone came up to us .
Person : “ It ’s a shame that the Hagia Sophia closes so early .
Have you seen the Cisterna Basilica , yet ?
It ’s still open . ”
Me : “ Yes , that ’s one of the things I ’ve wanted to see . ”
Person : “ Let me show you where the entrance is , it ’s just a block from here . ”
Me : “ We can probably find it . ”
Person : “ I know , but it is really no trouble and will save you some time .
How long are you in Turkey for ? ”
Me : “ We ’re staying for 9 days . ”
Person : “ The entrance is just here , make sure that you walk through all of the passages .
Some people just go into the Cisterna , take a look , and then come back up .
There is a whole passage to follow , and you ’ll see the pillars of Minerva and eventually come out about a block down the street . ”
Me : “ Thank you . ”
Person : “ I ’ll wait for you at the exit .
In case you ’d like to have a glass of tea and see our showroom .
There wo n’t be any pressure for you to buy anything , but as long as you ’re in Istanbul , you should get to know what types of things are on sale . ”
Me : “ Thank you , but we ’re not buying anything today .
If we buy anything , it will be on our last day . ”
Person : “ I did n’t say anything about buying anything .
After all , no one needs to buy a rug .
But , this will just give you a chance to get educated , and no museums or mosques will be open at that time , anyhow , and it will be too early for dinner . ”
We entered the Cisterna .
And , sure enough , at first it seemed that we should just go in and take a look , but we walked around the whole path , and it was definitely worth the extra time .
By the way , if you do end up in Turkey and visit the Cisterna , bring a tripod .
It ’s large and dark , and you can get striking pictures with a 2 to 3 second exposure .
As we emerged from the exit , who do you think we saw ?
Person : “ How did you like it ? ”
Me : “ It was pretty extraordinary . ”
Person : “ Did you get to take any pictures ?
Can I see them ? ”
Me : “ Sure , take a look . ”
Person : “ And , now , maybe you would honor me by taking some time to have a glass of tea , relax , and learn about Turkish carpets .
My shop is just 20 meters this way . ”
And so , on our first day , we ended up in a Turkish rug merchant .
But still , we had no intention of actually buying anything .
The job of the first person was to bring people to the shop ; he was the shill .
This was actually the end of our interaction with him .
Once in the shop , we primarily interacted with one of the owners .
Owner : “ Come , sit down .
Let me explain the different types of rugs to you , and educate you so you ’ll know a good rug from a cheap one .
Here , have some tea . ”
Owner : “ You know , no one comes to Turkey to buy a rug .
It ’s not something that you need .
Yet , most people end up buying one .
Why ?
Because , it ’s art .
It ’s something they decide that they like .
And , it ’s something that they will have and enjoy for the rest of their lives .
A good rug will last for over 100 years . ”
Then , he proceeded to explain the five different types of rugs , the different materials , the different types of knots , and how rugs changed colors as you looked at them from different angles .
And also , how December is their slowest season , how they would never be able to devote this much time to someone in the summer season , how to tell real wool and natural dyes from synthetics , and how the prices of rugs are usually 25 % less in December than in the summer .
After about 45 minutes , with the education winding down , he asked us which , if any , of the rugs we liked , and if we wanted to see more of that type of rug .
Rightly or wrongly , at this point , I felt a little guilty .
We ’d used up 45 minutes of his time , along with three assistants , we ’d drunk his apple tea , we ’d learned a lot about rugs .
I was still not willing to purchase a rug , but we were at least willing to let him know which of the rugs , we liked .
Once the family had picked one of the rugs , he then proceeded to show us about 20 rugs of the same type .
Next , he asked us which three of those rugs we liked the best .
It was then that my wife said , “ you know , we really do need to replace the rug in the dining room sometime , as well as the rug in Rosie ’s ( our daughter ) room .
But , we do not need to purchase a rug at this time . ”
The owner then asked my daughter , “ if you could have one of these rugs , and if you did n’t have to pay for it , can you see any of them working in your room ? ”
And she pointed to one of the rugs .
“ I really like that one . ”
Owner to Rosie : “ You have very good taste .
That rug is 100 % wool .
Look here , that ’s how you can tell that they dyes are natural and not artificial .
Look at the weave , this is how you can tell it is not machine made .
It takes someone three to four months working full time to make a rug like this . ”
Owner to me : “ I know that you are not looking to purchase a rug .
In the summer , I would start off with a price of around $ 3,000 for this rug , and we would easily sell it for more than $ 2,500 .
But , if you were interested at all , I ’d offer you this rug at $ 1,800 . ”
Me : “ Thank you , but we really are not interested in purchasing a rug right now . ”
Owner : “ Nearly everyone who comes to Turkey is not interested in buying a rug .
But , you know , nearly everyone who comes ends up buying one .
Because they find something that they really like , something that is going to last them the rest of their lives , and something that they will forever remember their trip to Turkey with . ”
Owner : “ Is there any price , where , if you could own this rug for that price , you would walk out of here happy ? ”
Me : “ Well , I ’m really not looking to purchase a rug . ”
Owner : “ Yes , and you may end up not purchasing one .
But is there any price where you would say , ‘ I am happy to buy that rug . ” ?
Me : “ I guess , if I could have that rug for $ 800 , I ’d probably be happy . ”
Owner : “ This is a rug that I would be selling in the summer for over $ 2,500 .
But you know , ” looking at Rosie , “ you are a very lucky young lady to have a father who has the means and the desire to purchase something like this for you that you really want .
I hope you appreciate him . ”
Me : “ Wait a minute , that ’s a line that I ’ve used in sales training before .
That comes right from Joe Girardi . ”
Owner : “ You are in sales ?
What do you sell ? ”
Me : “ I ’m in education , but I used to sell and I used to train sales people . ”
At this point the owner comes right up to me , within about two inches .
He grasps my right hand in his , starts shaking it , and says , “ I think we can come to a deal .
How about $ 1,500 for the rug ? ”
Me : “ I really did n’t come here to buy a rug .
I said that I ’d be happy to purchase the rug for $ 800 , but it really was n’t my intent to purchase one .
Owner , still holding and shaking hands with me : “ How about $ 1,400 ? ”
Me : “ Well , maybe $ 900 . ”
Owner , still shaking my hand : “ $ 1,300 . ”
Me : “ 1,000 ”
Owner : “ I just cannot sell it for 1,000 , let ’s say we have a deal at $ 1,100 . ”
Me : “ Okay . ”
And that was it .
My daughter now has a Kilin rug from Turkey in her bedroom .
My son is just shaking his head , “ Dad , you did it again . ”
How did the two sales people do it ?
According to Robert Cialdini , there are 6 weapons of influence .
We can all use them , and they are used on us , either knowingly or by accident :
Reciprocation : we try to repay what another person has provided us Commitment and consistency : we desire to be consistent with what we have already done Social proof : we tend to rely on what other people are doing to determine our own actions Liking : we tend to go along with and follow people we like Authority : we feel a sense of duty to follow someone who has authority Scarcity : opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited
You can see how the rug salesmen used practically every one of these weapons in getting me to purchase the rug .
Reciprocation :
The shill gave helped us find a suitable site after we were unable to enter the Hagia Sophia , then , he provided additional instructions to make sure we enjoyed it fully .
The shop owner gave us snacks and apple tea , plus spent a lot of time with us educating us on oriental carpets .
Commitment and consistency :
Once the shill told me that he would meet us at the exit , and once I had not denied that we would , consistency led us to follow him to the shop .
But the real and masterly use of the consistency weapon was by the shop owner , who came up to me and started shaking my hand as we negotiated price .
It ’s hard to back down from making a deal as you are affirming it by shaking someone ’s hand .
I ’m going to try that technique sometime with my kids when I need them to do something that they really do n’t want to do , like pick up their rooms .
Social proof :
There was the shaking of hands by the shop owner ; if he was signaling that we had a deal , who was I to say we did not ?
But , there was also the assumptive closing by the shill , saying that we would meet at the exit of the Cisterna Basilica .
Liking : Both the shill used helpfulness , stories , interest in our concerns as ways to get us to like them , to create a rapport , before any selling started .
Authority : We went into a lot of shops in Istanbul .
I have to say that in practically every single one , we ended up talking with the owner .
Of course , I have no way of knowing if it was really the owner , but the person spoke as someone in authority .
Scarcity : knowing that prices were generally a lot higher , and that was confirmed by my son , who ’d been in Istanbul for the past three months , let us feel that we would not have the opportunity to purchase at that price in subsequent trips .
What lessons can we take from this ?
First , in subsequent negotiations and interactions , we can be more cognizant of the techniques that the sales people were using ; “ Oh , this is the ‘ reciprocation ’ technique , do n’t feel that you need to reciprocate .
Only purchase if you want the item . ”
Being more aware of these weapons let ’s us be more resistant .
Second , we can utilize these techniques ourselves .
Instead of launching into immediately telling someone what to do ( as in “ go clean your room ” , or “ do you want to buy this service ? ” ) , we can find a way to offer something , we can spend time to insure that the person is in a receptive mood where they like us , we can create a perception of scarcity .
Third , read Robert Cialdini ’s book .
It will provide even more examples to help you manage better , lead better , and resist others who would try to influence you to do things that you do n’t really want to .
And , with all that , we ’re happy we bought the rug ; it will provide us with a lifetime of memories of our trip to Turkey .

Come next May I ’ll be finally leaving the University of Illinois with a B.S. in Computer Science and heading out into the “ real world ” .
This means I need a job , so beginning last September I made it my mission to find a good one .
Advance 3 months later , I ’ve done 7 on - campus interviews , 6 on - site interviews , gotten 4 job offers , and finally accepted a position with Jump Trading in Chicago .
There are plenty of places providing good advice on what to do when you ’re in an interview , but not too much on actually getting invited for interviews in the first place .
Hopefully the advice below can help fill in the gaps .
Kick Ass at Career Fairs
Up until a year ago , I took the on -campus career fairs at UIUC for granted .
Then I studied abroad for a year in London and I realized these events are gold , because it ’s really difficult to find a job when all you can do is email resumes .
In comparison to that experience , getting interviews out of a career fair ( at least at a school that is recognized as good in CS ) is like shooting fish in a barrel .
Research Companies
Find the list of employers who will be at the fair and who are hiring CS grads , visit their websites and make your own list of companies you want to chat with .
Learn something about what each company does , and note what in your past experience ( in industry or in class ) is most closely related .
Customize Resumes
You should hopefully already have a default resume – but you should customize that to each company on your list to visit .
For each company modify your “ objective ” ( or purpose , etc ) section to specifically mention at least the following :
Whether you are looking for a full - time position , an internship or a co-op position
The name of the position you are applying for ( do n’t just say “ software engineer ” , look on their website )
The name of the company you are applying to A rough time - frame of when you ’re looking to start For example , my Microsoft resume read something like “ Seeking a full - time position as a Software Development Engineer with Microsoft beginning Summer 2009 ” .
This accomplishes two goals – firstly , the recruiter is going to have to ask people for this information all day long , so they will appreciate you providing it up front .
Secondly and more importantly , it shows you are n’t just carpet - bombing the career fair with your resumes , you already know something about the company and specifically wanted to speak with them .
The majority of recruiters I talked with specifically mentioned they liked that I had targeted my resume to them .
It ’s also a good idea to bring a couple generic resumes with you in case you end up talking to a company you had n’t planned on visiting .
Dress Smart
I do n’t think you need to wear a suit to a career fair or an interview ( at least not for software jobs ) – I do n’t even own a suit .
That said , I think it ’s to your detriment to waltz in with jeans and a t - shirt .
Interview attire seems to be a hotly debated topic , but personally I wear business casual and I think it makes a better impression .
Bring a Schedule
If you ’re doing well , you should be able to get a couple of on - campus interviews the day or two after the fair .
From personal experience , if you do n’t bring your schedule you ’ll start getting confused about when you can and ca n’t schedule interviews , so plan ahead and write down when you ’re free .
Approach in Order of Importance
No matter how much you ’ve prepared , it can still be a little daunting to approach companies at a career fair .
It ’s better that you save your dream companies for last , and approach other companies first to work off your nerves and get a feel for what you ’re doing .
Failure is a part of life , including the job hunting part , so take it in stride and move on .
Control the Conversation
With the prep work out of the way , you just need to execute .
Here ’s how I think a good conversation should go :
Walk up , introduce yourself , give a firm handshake .
The recruiter may ask how much you know about the company , here ’s where the research you did beforehand comes in handy .
Let them know you ’ve got the basic idea , and then ask them one or two intelligent questions to show your interest and get some more specific information .
Hand them the custom resume ( do n’t give them the wrong one ! ) , point out what you think is most relevant , and discuss !
Do n’t run away too early – wait until you are either offered an interview , they elaborate on what you should do to be considered ( submit online , etc ) , or they thank you for stopping by .
Do n’t Forget to Follow Up
Some companies have a special process for arranging on - campus interviews , for example many companies that come to UIUC use our online system to accept resumes and do interview sign - ups .
If a company mentions you have to do some extra steps to be considered , get them written down and do them ASAP .
If you follow these steps ( or your own version of them ) , you should stand a good chance of getting interviews .
In my experience many people go to career fairs unprepared and do n’t do very well , but it does n’t have to be that way if you take a couple hours beforehand and do some preparation .
Two little boys , but in which war ?
Harris sings
Two Little Boys on Top of the Pops in 1969 , and again 39 years on
SMASHED HITS
Classic pop , reappraised by the Magazine
Rolf Harris has re-recorded his 1969 number one Two Little Boys with a Welsh male voice choir to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I .
But the song has roots stretching back to Nelson 's death .
Rock legend has it that John Lennon sent Rolf Harris a telegram to congratulate him on getting an anti-Vietnam song to the top of the Christmas hit parade .
But in 1969 , as in its forthcoming remake , the song seems to be set in the cavalries of World War I .
So which war is it that Jack and Joe , the song 's protagonists , are fighting in ?
Please turn on JavaScript .

The song is a charmingly simple two - act story .
In act one , the two little boys play war games on wooden horses - Jack 's horse breaks , but Joe " rescues " his friend , saying " there 's room on my horse for two " .
Then , act two , after " long years had passed " and " war came so fast " , the pair are in an actual war .
Joe lies injured on the battlefield , but this time it is Jack who rescues him for real , trembling and explaining : " I think it 's that I remember / When we were two little boys . "
But Harris 's initial response to hearing the song back in the 1960s was far from positive .
" I thought it was really namby - pamby and awful , " he said .
In the liner notes to The Definitive Rolf Harris , the singer recalls Australian folkie Ted Egan singing it to him , keeping rhythm by bashing his table .

" I was sitting there feeling uncomfortable and wondering what I was going to say to him about the song when he had finished , because he was such a nice bloke and it was such an awful song .
" Suddenly he was singing the line , ' Did you think I would leave you dying ? ' and all the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and arms . "
Harris then performed the song on his British TV variety show and recorded it as a single - " we had one spare track after take three , so we asked the trumpeter to re-record his bit and it gave the song a ghostly feel . "
Thatcher 's favourite But Two Little Boys was not Egan 's own composition - he'd learned it as a child from his mother , who knew the original music hall version , credited to Madden / Morse , turn of the century songwriters to Al Jolson .
And since Madden and Morse were both American , this would seem to place the story in the American Civil War - better fitting the horses than Vietnam .
OTHER VERSIONS Splodgenessabounds ' punk version ( # 26 , 1980 ) Billy Connolly 's police brutality skit Two Little Boys In Blue Sung by Spud following a funeral in Trainspotting ( 1996 ) Country version by John Denver A capella version by Sinéad O'Connor Hartlepool United terrace anthem And so it was that Harris had the last number one of the 1960s - a typically incongruous highlight of a career that has included musical experimentation with Kate Bush , fronting " hip " TV show The Young Generation With Rolf Harris , painting the Queen 's portrait and overseeing the operations in Animal Hospital .
To some , the most unexpected highlight of all was Margaret Thatcher choosing Two Little Boys as a personal favourite , when she appeared on a radio show in 1979 .
But it perhaps makes more sense than some other politicians ' desert island picks - it 's much more like a fondly remembered children 's story than a normal pop song .
And in fact , the tale of Jack and Joe bears a striking resemblance to an actual children 's story - from 1884 .
Male voice choirs do it for me every time .
It reminds me of my proud Welsh grandfather
David R , Pontivy , France
What makes men cry ?
In Jackanapes , by Juliana Horatia Ewing , childhood chums Jackanapes and Tony play on hobby horses at a fair .
Later , on a Napoleonic battlefield , Tony loses control of his horse ( " Tony Johnson was always unlucky with horses , from the days of the giddy - go - round onwards " ) , but is saved by Jack ( " Leave you ?
To save my skin ?
No , Tony , not to save my soul ! " )
And if the Peninsular War of 1807 - 1814 is also present in the song , then so too is an earlier battle : JH Ewing 's grandfather was the chaplain on HMS Victory and had held the dying Nelson in his arms .
Nelson 's death .
Is the man holding him the real inspiration for Two Little Boys ?
The new version - conceived of while Harris was recording a documentary about his father 's experience at Ypres - brings it firmly back to World War I , but it 's the childish simplicity of the lyric - its namby - pambyness , if you like - that makes the tale of wartime compassion applicable to any conflict .
One thing is for sure - the combination of a male voice choir and battlefield bravery makes the new recording a prime contender for Things That Make Blokes Cry.

A team of 10 local authority snoops was sent out to sift through the wheelie bins of 400 unsuspecting households for a “ waste audit ” .
Some black bins stuffed with rotting food , plastic wrappers and cans were taken away for further examination .
But yesterday Labour - run Lancashire County Council was accused of a “ gross invasion of privacy and a waste of taxpayers ’ money ” .
Julie Botham , 43 , of Burnley – one of the towns targeted by the council snoops – said : “ It ’s unbelievable that council inspectors are resorting to SAS tactics simply to see what kind of rubbish we are throwing out .
“ We ’re hardly public enemy number one , yet they way they are snooping around us makes us feel we are like wanted terrorists . ”

I.B.M.’s chief executive , Samuel J. Palmisano , is proposing a technology - fueled economic recovery plan that calls for public and private investment in more efficient systems for utility grids , traffic management , food distribution , water conservation and health care .
Recent technology advances make this possible , and the need is apparent , Mr. Palmisano will say in a speech he is scheduled to deliver Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York .
Sixty - seven percent of electrical energy , for example , is lost because of inefficient power generation and grid management .
Congested highways cost $ 78 billion a year in squandered working hours and gas burned .
Mr. Palmisano ’s speech never mentions I.B.M. , but his proposal has a self - serving side .
I.B.M. is increasingly playing the role of lead contractor in these so - called smart infrastructure projects around the world , from a traffic management network in Stockholm to electric grids in Texas .
Some economists and policy experts say similar projects are a good way to improve the long - term health of the economy , potentially providing a foundation for innovation and growth across a range of industries .
Lily Allen 's Frightening Airport Strip Search
Singerand supermodeldid n't get a warm welcome when they landed at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates .
Instead they were subjected to a strip search
The women were not the only celebrities who were put through this humiliating experience .
They were in the country to attend the grand opening of the Atlantis Palms Hotel , which is located on the man-made Palm Jumeirah Island .
Here is what Lily had to say about the situation :
" I was strip searched , which was so nice as soon as you arrive .
I knew I did n't have anything on me so I was n't worried .
I was n't paranoid , just terrified .
It was at the airport and took more than an hour .
It was really scary as they did n't tell you what they were doing , they just said , ' Take off trousers ' and I was like , ' Ahhh , hello ! ' "
Agyness and her boyfriend , The Strokes star , were both also asked to undress for a search .
The model said that " it was traumatic but none the less it is their culture and one must respect that . "
The hotel did send out warning to the guests ahead of time about the strict laws on bringing drugs into the country .
The photos at the top are of Lily at the Atlantis Palm opening and on the right a few days later when she arrived back home .

As you probably already know , Jesus is a pretty popular guy .
He ’s so popular , in fact , that he ’s inspired people from all walks of life to create their very own versions of the Son of God that somehow take him to another level .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain railed against Democratic control of Washington during his closing argument of his presidential campaign .
The public 's opinon of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has improved .
And the Republican presidential nominee warned America about the liberal trio of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid and presidential nominee Barack Obama .
" We 're getting a glimpse of what one - party rule would look like under Obama , Pelosi and Reid .
Apparently , it starts with lowering our defenses and raising our taxes , " McCain said repeatedly on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to Election Day .
Not only did Obama beat McCain in the presidential election , the Democrats picked up seats in Congress .
And a new national poll suggests why a majority of voters did n't seem to buy McCain 's argument .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Tuesday , 59 percent of those questioned think that Democratic control of both the executive and legislative branches will be good for the country , with 38 percent saying that such one - party control will be bad .

" That much good will from the public opens a window of opportunity for the Democrats , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" But the public expects results and may not listen to excuses for very long if a Democratic Congress and a Democratic White House can't get their act together in time . "
The poll also suggests that the public has a positive view of the Democratic Party , with 62 percent having a favorable opinion and 31 percent an unfavorable opinion .
That is not the case for the Republicans , with a majority , 54 percent , having an unfavorable view of the GOP and 38 percent holding a positive view .
" The public has a positive view of the Democratic Party , while the GOP ' brand ' is hurting .
Overall views of the Democratic Party have gone from 53 percent favorable in October to 62 percent favorable now ; the GOP overall has seen a 5 - point drop in its favorable rating , " Holland said .
Watch how pessimistic the nation is »
The 62 percent figure is the " the highest opinion of the Democrats in at least 16 years , since before Bill Clinton got elected , " said Bill Schneider , a CNN senior political analyst .
" When has the Republican Party image ever been that bad ?
Answer : when the Republican Congress impeached President Clinton at the end of 1998 , " Schneider added .
The poll indicates that the public is split regarding top Democrats in Congress -- but that 's an improvement .
" Democratic congressional leaders , much maligned this fall , have also seen a boost in their approval rating .
Nearly half of those polled now approve of how congressional Democrats are handling their job , up from just a third who felt that way a month ago , " Holland said .
" Same thing happens when you ask them about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Good - bad , 50 - 50 , among voters who even know who they are , " Schneider said .
It 's a different story for the GOP , with just 24 percent approving of how Republican leaders are handling their jobs with nearly three in four disapproving .
But that does n't mean the public wants to see the GOP shut out of government .
Seven out of eight want the Democrats to include Republican views in any legislation they pass .
" What about those times , and they will occur , when Barack Obama and the Democratic leaders in Congress disagree ?
The public is likely to side with Obama ; 59 percent say they are more likely to trust him than the congressional Democrats , " Holland said .
With Senate contests in Alaska , Georgia and Minnesota still unresolved , the Democrats have increased from 51 to 57 seats in the chamber .
Two independent senators , Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Saunders of Vermont , are allied with the Democrats .
In the House of Representatives , the Democrats have picked up 20 seats , to 255 , with six races still undecided .
" There 's an opening here for a new Democratic majority .
But it 's just that , an opening .
It all depends on how President Obama does .
And whether he can overcome the red - blue divide in the country .
Something neither of the baby boomer presidents , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , could do , " Schneider said .
The CNN Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday , with 1,246 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Report : CBS mulled tapping Limbaugh , Drudge , Coulter to probe ' memogate ' Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Dan Rather 's faulty reporting on President Bush 's National Guard service in 2004 ignited a firestorm of criticism in the right - wing blogosphere , and it's been revealed that CBS considered tapping some of the anchor 's most vicious conservative critics for an " independent " panel probing the matter .
New court documents filed in Rather 's ongoing $ 70 million lawsuit against his former employer reveal a list of figures the network considered appointing to the panel , including right - wing firebrands Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter and Matt Drudge .
CBS ended up appointing Louis Boccardi , the former head of the Associated Press , and Dick Thornburgh , a former US Attorney , to probe Rather 's reporting .
The panel recommended firing four employees in January of 2005 .
Rather has previously criticized the inclusion of Thornburgh , who was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush .
In court filings this week , the New York Observer reports , Rather 's legal team alleges CBS only considered conservatives for the panel .
" Only conservative lawyers were considered for the Panel , " Rather 's lawyers write .
" [ T ] heir names were vetted by Viacoms Washington lobbyists ( as well as with unnamed ' GOP folks ' ) . "
Included in the court papers were a list of " others " CBS considered :  William Buckley
 Robert Novak
 Kate OBeirne
 Nicholas Von Hoffman
 Tucker Carlson
 Pat Buchanan
 George Will
 Lou Dobbs
 Matt Drudge
 Robert Barkley
 Robert Kagan
 Fred Barnes
 William Kristol
 John Podhoretz
 David Brooks
 William Safire
 Bernard Goldberg
 Ann Coulter
 Andrew Sullivan
 Christopher Hitchens
 PJ ORourke
 Christopher Caldwell
 Elliot Abrams
 Charles Krauthammer
 William Bennett
 Rush Limbaugh Also included on the list was Boccardi ; David Gergen , a former adviser to Presidents Reagan and Clinton ; Gene Roberts , the former managing editor of the New York Times ; and Dick Wald , the former NBC News president .
CBS lawyers previously said they appointed Thornburgh , a conservative lawyer , " to open itself up to its harshest conservative critics " in order to counter accusations that the network had a liberal bias .
Rather 's primary goal is to force CBS to hand over thousands of documents generated by Boccardi and Thornburgh 's panel , Portfolio reports .
" CBS induced Mr. Rather to apologize personally on national television , to abandon his own further investigation , and to stay silent about his belief in the truth of the story by falsely and tortiously promising Mr. Rather , among other things , that the Panel would conduct a full and independent investigation , " reads the 25 - page motion from Rather 's attorneys .
" The Panel 's failure to do so evidences CBS 's true motivations were not to report the news , but to appease the Bush Administration and its partisan allies in Congress , whose anger over the substance of an important news story threatened the business interests of its parent , Viacom Inc . "
Quebecers are heading to the polls Monday to vote in their second provincial election in as many years .
The Quebec Liberal Party , the Action Démocratique du Québec and the Parti Québécois all hope to form the next government .
Polls are open are open Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET .
Liberal Leader Jean Charest called a snap election this fall on the grounds he needs a majority to steer the province through the global financial crisis .
The ADQ is hoping to hold on to its unprecedented gains made in the 2007 election when it elected 41 members to the legislature and formed Quebec 's official opposition .
Two members crossed the floor to join the Liberals prior to the election call Nov. 5 .
The PQ will be looking to win back sovereigntist supporters who turned their backs on the separatist party in the last election .
Both the Green party and upstart Québec Solidaire are banking on making a breakthrough and electing a member of the provincial legislature for the first time in history .
ADQ Leader Mario Dumont urged voters to cast their ballot even if they did n't want another election .
" Not voting is rewarding the party that called this election , " he said while campaigning in Thetford Mines on Sunday .
" Abstaining is our worst enemy . "
According to the province 's election agency , more than 5.7 million Quebecers are registered to vote .
Nearly 12 per cent of registered voters cast their ballot in advance polls , up from 10.23 per cent in 2007 .
Polling stations are open Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET .
Any Canadian citizen age 18 and over who has lived in Quebec for more than six months can vote , as long as they are registered on the voters ' list .
To cast a ballot , voters have to confirm their identity by providing one of the following documents :
Health card .
Driver 's licence .
Canadian passport .
Indian status card .
Canadian Armed Forces identification card .
Employers must provide workers with at least four consecutive hours to go vote during polling hours on election day .

The green movement has espoused the use of bicycles as a carbon - neutral form of transportation .
Health experts suggest bicycle riding can combat childhood obesity .
A new report reveals an estimated 389,300 children and adolescents 18 - years and younger were treated in emergency departments for bicycle - related injuries , making bicycles second only to cars in consumer products that cause childhood injuries .
Even with mandated helmets and safety programs , children are experiencing contusions and abrasions ( 30 percent ) , lacerations ( 30 percent ) and fractures ( 19 percent ) mostly to their extremities followed closely by face and head injuries .
According to the study , boys are 70 % more likely than girls to be hurt on bikes .
Tracy Mehan , a research associate at the Center for Injury Research and Policy of The Research Institute at Nationwide Children ’s Hospital and author of a new study explains the results : [ social_buttons ]
While the number of injuries decreased slightly over the 16 - year study period , in 2005 an average of 850 children per day were seen in emergency departments for bicycle - related injuries .
The magnitude of bicycle - related injuries each year is evidence that prevention of these injuries needs to remain a priority .
I believe it is unfair to blame bicycles completely for childhood injuries , and although I agree more efforts should be placed on safety and helmet programs , I imagine a majority of these injuries were car - related .
If car - related bicycle injuries were credited to just cars , I wonder how bicycles would fair on the list of consumer products causing childhood injuries .
A huge aspect of prevention that needs to be addressed is driver education so that children are safe while sharing the road .

FARGO , N.D.  Federal Customs and Border Protection authorities are preparing to launch unmanned aircraft patrols from this state , the first time such monitoring will occur along the nation ’s northern border .
A Predator B aircraft , delivered to Grand Forks on Saturday , will make runs along the northern edge of North Dakota using sensors that can provide video and detect heat and changes to landscape , Customs and Border Protection officials said .
The plane , which can go 260 miles per hour and fly as high as 50,000 feet , can stay aloft for 18 hours .
The first missions , designed to help spot people crossing the border illegally or avoiding ports of entry , are expected to start next month .
Similar aircraft have patrolled the nation ’s southern border since 2005 , where they have helped lead to the discovery of more than 18,000 pounds of marijuana and 4,000 illegal immigrants , a spokesman for the agency said .
Alcohol and attitudes are two of the key factors that health professionals need to be aware of when they are dealing with sexually active teenagers .
Researchers from the University of Sheffield , UK , found considerable differences between the way that boys and girls aged 14 to 16 viewed a series of sexual scenarios .
" The girls who took part in our focus groups were more likely to see their partner 's point of view and were more aware of the complex nature of relationships than the boys " says nurse researcher Dr Mark Hayter .
Ten focus groups were held with 35 teenagers who had accessed nurse - led sexual health outreach clinics for contraception .
These clinics are often held in conjunction with youth clubs in areas where teenage pregnancy rates are high .
The participants were presented with a series of scenarios – a girl and a boy both reluctant to have sex , a girl who had had a numbers of partners and a girl who felt pressured to have sex because her friends had paired off with two boys leaving her with a third .
" The objective of this study was to explore the broad gender - based attitudes and opinions towards all of the case studies , not just to explore any differences between attitudes towards any one particular case study " explains Dr Hayter , who carried out the research with Christina Harrison , a sexual health specialist nurse from Doncaster Primary Care Trust .
" Male and female attitudes clearly differed .
The girls ' responses were more empathic and complex because they face more complex social pressures when it comes to having sex .
The young men on the other hand appeared to follow behaviour patterns that included pressuring girls to have sex , often with the use of alcohol .
" We also noticed that the boys often used aggressive language about relationships - an element that was missing from the girls ' focus groups .
For example they suggested that a girlfriend who slept around would probably pay a physical price and that using tactics like getting a girl drunk were acceptable .
" In one of the boys ' focus groups there was even a suggestion that it was OK for a boy to force his girlfriend to have sex and the group started trying to differentiate between ' just a bit of pressure ' and ' proper rape ' . "
The researchers concede that the focus group format could have encouraged stereotypical male and female behaviour , but point out that in the real world teenagers ' behaviour is shaped by the sort of peer pressure displayed during the sessions .
Sexual health is a major issue in all cultures , with increasing numbers of young people between 13 and 18 being affected by sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , unplanned pregnancies and abortions .
" Studies from the USA , Europe and Asia all indicate that adolescence is a time of sexual vulnerability " says Dr Hayter .
" The UK certainly reflects this trend and has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies and STIs in Europe .
In some areas it is common to see pregnancy rates of up to 19 per 1000 in the 13 - 16 age group . "
Distinct trends can also be seen from the international literature , including sexual activity at a younger age and increased risk taking , such as unprotected sex with new or casual partners .
This behaviour is strong influenced by social and contextual factors closely related to peer pressure , alcohol use and gender power .
" Nurses working in sexual health clinics used by young people should be aware of the ways in which their clients think about sex and relationships " concludes Dr Hayter .
" Providing information and contraception is only one element of promoting sexual health .
" When it comes to female clients , nurses should develop interventions that can strengthen self - esteem and teach young girls how to respond positively to the social pressures they face around sex .
" It would also be helpful to encourage young male clients to empathise with their female partners .
" Last , but definitely not least , clinics need to treat alcohol use by their clients as a higher priority , integrating advice and help about harmful drinking into their sexual health promotion work . "

Monopoly in the view of mathematics Deutsche Version ( Monopoly - Ausgabe und Sprache )
Have you ever noticed that you are more often visiting Illinois Avenue than Park Place ?
In long term the difference of both frequencies is 45 % !
But how we can determine this number ?
There mainly are two different possiblities , which are demonstrated using two interactive visualisations :
1 . First we can take two dice and roll them very often ( this way is called Monte Carlo method ) :
Move a token like you do it during a Monopoly match and count the positions you are landing on .
If the number of rolls is big enough you 'll find 40 probablities , one for each of the 40 positions , as limits of the counted frequencies .
If you are looking for a quicker way you can use a computer , which is rolling the dice , moving the token and counting the frequencies .
Click here to start such a simulation .
2 . Also you can compute the probabilities of reaching the 40 positions after the first move , then after the second move and so on .
If you want to see the changing of these probabilities and their long term tendency you can start an animation here .
If you are n't afraid of forumulas you can also solve a system of 121 linear equations including 120 variables .
For the mathematical background have a look to books of probability theory ( you 'll find the details in chapters concering the so called Markov chains ) .
These pages are an interactive supplement of chapter 16 ( " Markov chains and the game Monopoly " ) of my book " Luck , Logic and White Lies : The Mathematics of Games " ( preface and contens ) .
The results are based on the American edition .
Compared to other editions ( for example the German edition ) there are some minor differences coming from other sets of " Chance " and " Community Chest " cards .
To see the visualisations you need a browser with enabled JavaScript ( Netscape 6.2 resp . Internet Explorer 5.0 or newer ) .
A lot gets filed under " conspiracy theory . "
King 's murder .
WMDs .
Rigged voting machines .
Though it has turned out there was good reason for suspecting all three official versions .
" Conspiracy theory " is label given to things so people do n't investigate , so they are marginalized .
It 's like calling people " kooks " which , if anyone remembers , included mothers and some doctors saying breast feeding was healthier than bottle feeding , as was having fathers in the delivery room .
The slurs against those who resist officialdom 's certainty and control continues , with a growing objection to mandated vaccinations at a time when vaccinations are suspected of being linked to autism .
And no one needs to strain to think of what anti-war people were called during Vietnam or even with Iraq .
Freedom of thought seems to be okay so long as it is not attached to freedom of speech that asks serious - and extremely important - questions of authority .
I have been told by people on Dailykos not to touch 9/11 , it could get me thrown off .
I have had a close journalist friend say it will marginalize anyone who touches it .
The ads " about " high fructose corn syrup are in that vein .
Put out by the Corn Refiners in the US , they mock anyone who even begins to say they heard some worrisome thing about HFCS .
The point of the ad - and I can't think of another that attempt to do this - is to suggest that anyone who raises the topic itself will be humiliated .
It is a warning not to even talk about a subject involving all our health .
That 's impressive .
Who designs such a bizarre and undemocratic - at - its - core ad ?
With the timing so perfect for such a shhh-ing ad ....
" Researchers have found new evidence that soft drinks sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) may contribute to the development of diabetes , particularly in children .
In a laboratory study of commonly consumed carbonated beverages , the scientists found that drinks containing the syrup had high levels of reactive compounds that have been shown by others to have the potential to trigger cell and tissue damage that could cause the disease , which is at epidemic levels . "
Click here .
So , in the midst of an epidemic in which type 2 diabetes has increased by 90 % .
Click here .
The public is being told by ad companies paid by corporations , that anyone who mentions HFCS will be mocked .
Marginalized .
Shut up .
Is n't that what they are telling us - about a product that appears linked to an epidemic of illness and death across the country ?
So , now I come to 9/11 , a subject I avoid personally .
Never liked how it was used to inflame hatred and all that flowed from it .
Did n't read about it , did n't want to hear about it .
But on election night , I happened to read an Oped News article that included scientific studies and videos .
I do n't know why I looked but I did .
I am a logical person and in very basic ways , a mechanical one , and now I am having trouble with what I saw .
I kept looking at the buildings falling and I reading the scientists ' comments that it is n't possible for airplanes to have caused them to fall in that way and I read the government explanations and went back again and again to the video and to the scientific data and ....
So , I am in a quandary .
The science and what I saw with my own eyes and what makes logical sense do n't fit what we were told .
Then , the other day I saw a video by a Catholic priest in the UK .
And my journalist friend had warned me after the first article and before the YouTube video , that it 's a waste of time to go down that road .
But the priest said we are faced with an immense , world - changing lie .
So , concerned and not wanting to be alone with my own thoughts , I sent both links out to people .
" Somehow , given the astounding things that have happened to all of us recently - the sheer scale of moral bankruptcy and cruelty - I listen and read the following with a new eye and ear .
Anything that uses us now seems possible these days ...
I hope my sending this ( out of my own confusion and concern about it ) , does n't make you think less of me .
I was taught we are supposed to have courage to look at things - even about very hard things - and think .
The fact that we are somehow not supposed to think about this , makes it seem all the more important to do so , at least privately .
So , I am just passing this on , with no position taken .
The first video is of a Catholic priest .
The second is material from mechanical engineers , including from MIT .
One person responded this way :
" This stuff gets filed under conspiracy theory :-(
There is a lot of it going around , as I recall this is the hardest to debunk .
I believe the Bush administration has committed many sins of omission on9 / 11 , but there are no sins of commission .
Not even they are that low ... "
And I responded :
" The thing is , if they are that low and we face that , what happens ?
We subtract " terrorism " from an explanation for things and in doing so , we take the driving force for world destructiveness and for police state control everywhere , away .
We would suddenly see that our enemies are not our enemies but those who are running wars and Guantanamo .
We would see the world entirely differently .

A woman from the US has had a live worm removed from her brain .
Surgeons thought Rosemary Alvarez had a brain tumour , but on operating they discovered the worm .
Dr Peter Nakaji said Mrs Alvarez probably picked up the worm after eating undercooked meat .
This video contains scenes of surgery .
Their target markets are cost - and power - conscious small and medium businesses , schools and developing countries where fully - fledged PCs are prohibitively expensive , impractical or draw too much power .
In a telephone interview , Nicholls , a commercial pilot until the collapse of Ansett in 2001 , said his company , ThinLinX , had just partnered with a " major , global company " that predominantly made software .
He would not give further details or comment on whether the company in question was Microsoft , saying he was bound by a non-disclosure agreement .
The company would be making its own announcement within the next month .
Formed in 2003 with money from an angel investor and two Commonwealth Government grants , ThinLinX has spent the past five years undertaking research and development and " perfecting the design " .
Nicholls released his first thin computers 2 ½ years ago and began selling them through the ThinLinX website for $ 250 each .
He is now on the verge of launching a new , faster range , with the entry - level model selling for " just under $ US100 " .
" We just reached the break - even point recently ...
It 's been a very long , bumpy road to say the least , and a lot of money , " said Nicholls , who has been involved with IT since the early 1980s when he developed a modem for his Atari computer .
Cloud computing has become a hot topic this year as broadband connections improve and companies such as Google and Microsoft release software applications that live on the internet instead of locally on the user 's PC .
The main benefit of storing data online is that it can then be accessed from any device with an internet connection and , since most of the processing is done on a remote server , the device can be extremely cheap and underpowered .
Seeing promise in the trend , companies such as HP , Dell and Sun Microsystems are increasingly investing in the development of simple , low - end machines capable of doing little more than hooking into the cloud and browsing the web .
Nicholls said that , despite all the recent buzz , he had been experimenting with cloud computing for a while , able to access his Linux desktop on any computer around the world for the past five years .
That tinkering gave him the idea for the Hot - E computers .
" It 's just a really cut - down single board computer and what we 've done is try to reduce the cost as much as possible by reducing the number of chips in it , " he said .
" The developing world was the focus inititally but this thing has got a practical use anywhere ... you could put 50 of them in a classroom and they 're only using 3 watts each instead of 200 or 300 watts that normal PCs use . "
Nicholls said he envisioned future revisions of the Hot - E being used as extra PCs in the home .
" If you had a media centre running in the lounge and it's got a TV tuner built into it plus a hard drive that stores DVDs and movies ...
I could see kids sitting in the bedroom being able to watch TV , movies and play MP3s using the Hot - E , " he said .

Introduction
It is necessary by the nature of the subject matter for me to make some preliminary disclaimers .
If I were to argue either for or against argumentation ethics in this article , I would perhaps implicitly be endorsing them merely by engaging in argument .
I say " perhaps " because this depends on what meaning we attach to " argumentation " and what ethics we suppose is presupposed when we engage in argumentation .
But since I wish to take a neutral position at this time , I do not argue for or against argumentation ethics here .
I take no position , and by taking no position my remarks cannot be construed as implicitly endorsing argumentation ethics either by direct support or by the indirect support of criticizing it .
Neither can they be taken as critical argumentation against argumentation ethics .
This article simply records publically a number of my current thoughts about the doctrine of argumentation ethics and its relation to self - ownership .
None of my remarks should be construed as either being against or for this doctrine and if at times they seem to , that is the fault of my prose .
In the past , I have occasionally spoken favorably of argumentation ethics as a supporting rationale for property .
I do not now deny that position ; but neither do I re-affirm it in this article .
At this moment , I am merely thinking out loud ; I say no more than what occurs to me .
I neither affirm nor deny that there is an implied ethics among those who engage in argumentation .
I merely record various positions and ideas .
However , the fact of the matter is that these positions leave me personally in doubt that such an ethics exists ; or , if it does exist , that it has within it the presupposition of full human self - ownership ; or , even if the argumentation approach has merit , and it may , that it can provide all that much support to the notion of self - ownership .
Due to the peculiarities of the argument for argumentation ethics , this doubt is not and cannot be presented as any kind of direct argument against argumentation ethics without possibly undermining that doubt .
This , in its own way , shows one possible strength of the position taken by argumentation ethics .
Yet I use the qualifier " possibly " intentionally to underline the position of doubt that is presented here .
If I do not present counter - arguments , then why present anything at all ?
Why record doubts ?
Well , why not ?
This helps me to think through the issues .
One or two readers may even be interested .
And our understanding of the supports for and nature of property and self - ownership is too important to let rest on foundations that may be useful to have and to think about and yet may be shaky or less firm than one might at first think .
My initial encounter
My first encounter with argumentation ethics occurred some time around 1995 .
I ran across and read Hoppe ’s article " The Justice of Economic Efficiency , " reprinted in Volume 3 of Austrian Economics , edited by Littlechild .
Being ignorant of the background of the argument , I did not fully understand it , yet its importance and newness were obvious .
He had brought to bear his own genius in a way that his brilliant precursors ( Rothbard , Apel , and Habermas ) , who had reconnoitered this subject , had not .
I was enthusiastic and / or hopeful that argumentation ethics provided some kind of smoking gun in support of property rights .
I thought then that Hoppe had made a highly original and useful advance in our knowledge .
I think the same today .
Argumentation ethics , as he stated the case , provides a support for property .
Its basic proposition , among other things , implies that socialism cannot be argumentatively justified .
This is very important and , in a sense that needs to be elaborated upon , holds up and yet does not hold up .
The support may be more restrictive than supporters of property rights may have hoped for , me being one of them .
For any theory , we have to ask such questions as what are the limitations of the argument ?
How strong a support does it provide ?
Can no more be said ?
Does it claim more than it delivers ?
Does it have any weak spots ?
My basic feeling at the time was a favorable attitude combined with suspending judgment .
This was and is an ingrained habit of me as a researcher .
I needed to learn and ponder more , and especially because my knowledge of philosophy was very rusty , engaged fully as I was in doing finance research .
Furthermore , although my feelings led me in the opposite direction , I was accustomed to believing that one could say very little logically about the justice of economic matters .
My suspended judgment also relied on intuition .
It seemed rather counter - intuitive  meaning I could not wholly believe  that such important matters as justice and property could be based on a kind of abstract argument built upon the very discussion of these matters .
Where could such linguistic approaches get us ?
I had no firm logical or other basis for suspending judgment .
I had merely whispers of thoughts , suspicions , and doubts , various questions , if you will .
I could not accept the doctrine wholeheartedly .
This attitude is the stock - in - trade of those who do finance research and perhaps all researchers .
It leads to a thorough questioning of any new finding in order to understand what it is really saying .
At any rate , it was and is my attitude .
I actually put the whole matter aside until 2005 when , stimulated by the ongoing Iraq debacle , I began writing for LewRockwell.com .
And I kept putting it aside until now , not that the matter is fully settled in my mind ; but the time has come to crystallize some reflections .
Hoppe ’s argument in brief
Let us now quote Hoppe for a condensed version of his argument :
( i) " Whether or not persons have any rights and , if so , which ones , can only be decided in the course of argumentation ( propositional exchange ) .
Justification — proof , conjecture , refutation — is argumentative justification .
Anyone who denied this proposition would become involved in a performative contradiction because his denial would itself constitute an argument . "
( ii ) " Moreover , it follows from the a priori of argumentation that everything that must be presupposed in the course of an argumentation as the logical and praxeological precondition of argumentation cannot in turn be argumentatively disputed as regards its validity without becoming thereby entangled in an internal ( performative ) contradiction . "
( iii ) " No one could propose anything and expect the other party to convince himself of the validity of this proposition or deny it and propose something else unless his and his opponent ’s right to exclusive control over their respective bodies and standing rooms were presupposed . "
Hoppe makes clear that there are several other matters essential to his full argument such as that the argument must be between moral beings , that the argument is a form of human action and not simply free - floating sounds , and that we must recognize that resources , such as one ’s body , that are used in argumentation , are scarce .
Hoppe also directs us to the roots of his approach that lie in the work on discourse ethics of two modern philosophers , K.O. Apel and Jürgen Habermas .
I will use Apel as the source because of one paper , to be mentioned shortly , that criticizes Apel ’s claims .
And I should note before proceeding further that there are other very good arguments that Hoppe makes , often contiguous to or intermingled with his various presentations of the argumentation ethics argument , that I am not commenting upon here .
There are arguments about homesteading .
There are critiques of those who wish to maintain values rather than physical integrity .
There are arguments favoring a rule of first come , first to appropriate , and criticizing those who fail to make the prior - later distinction , etc .
Examining these arguments and the extent to which they can be maintained independently of argumentation ethics is beyond the scope of this article .
The argument ’s meaning
The basic idea is that a person engaged in argumentation presupposes various ethical conditions by engaging in argument .
For example , Apel thinks that those who " engage in serious argumentation … have necessarily already recognized an ethical and normative principle , namely the principle according to which all the disputed questions , all the disagreements , all the conflicts , etc. , that arise between the communicating partners , can be resolved only by means of arguments likely to produce a consensus , " Habermas believes that the arguers , for example , presuppose that they are using language in the same way , that no relevant argument can be excluded , and that no force will be used to settle the matter .
These philosophers are interested in understanding what ethics people adhere to by examining the ethical assumptions that underlie argumentation .
The Wikipedia article on Discourse Ethics accurately explains Hoppe ’s contribution as follows : Hoppe " argues that because argumentation , or discourse , is by its nature a conflict - free way of interacting , and requires individual control of resources in order to argue and be alive to do so , that certain norms are presupposed as true by anyone engaging in genuine discourse .
These norms include the libertarian principle of non-aggression , which itself implies libertarian rights .
Therefore , no one can argumentatively deny libertarian rights without self - contradiction . "
In particular , anyone who argues presupposes that both he and others with whom he argues have self - ownership of their bodies .
( Questions about what self - ownership means are beyond my scope here . )
Consequently , by the definition of argumentation , no one can argue against self - ownership without self - contradiction .
In fact , Apel argues that one cannot argue against the existence of a cognitive and universal foundation for ethics implicit in discourse without the counter - argument negating itself and validating that which it seeks to undermine .
It is for this reason that I make no attempt to argue against argumentation ethics directly .
Doubt - raising considerations
I now get into the heart of this article , which is to examine those matters that raise doubts in my mind about argumentation ethics .
For perhaps the last time , I will say that this may be taken as a form of public exhibitionism rather than an attempt to enter an intellectual argument .
If the statements sound like arguments against Hoppe ’s argument , that is only because of my limitations in phrasing them as verbal renderings of my internal doubts .
Furthermore , the doubts I raise are subject themselves to doubt .
The assertions I may seem to make are not put forward as truth claims .
I merely display them as an artist displays a series of paintings .
1. Self - ownership , it has been postulated by Hoppe , " can only be decided in the course of argumentation ( propositional exchange ) . "
Argumentation is basically discussion or talk , perhaps of a certain type inasmuch as philosophers disagree on what propositions are .
Must self - ownership be settled by talk ?
Suppose some people attempt to decide the issue .
Are there not ways they may select to decide it that do not involve discussion ?
They could devise a physical demonstration .
They could put it to a vote .
They could settle it by force .
They could cast lots .
They could look at entrails .
They could have a test of strength .
They could run a gauntlet .
They might let a leader , priest , or oracle ( an authority ) decide the matter .
They could appeal to a pre-determined rule or code .
They could appeal to a pre-determined scale of values .
They could appeal to revelatory sources such as the Word of God .
Perhaps argumentation is not the sole means of deciding the question of self - ownership ( or rights in oneself . )
Why ca n’t people settle the issue of self - ownership using one or more of the other available means that I have listed ?
2 . Let us pursue point # 1 further and find where it leads us .
Argumentation , as the term is used by Apel , Habermas , and Hoppe , apparently refers to deciding matters in some abstract and sanitized sense , that is , deciding in some rational way using thought processes .
Argumentation , after all , commonly means reasoning , proving , questioning , making a case , etc. Habermas says that argumentation presupposes that no force is used .
Hoppe claims that validity and truth only emerge as an idea in argumentation and only within argumentation are truth claims made and decided upon .
If these concepts of argumentation are involved , if argumentation means reasoning about truth claims , then again , we ask , must all truth claims be decided only by reasoning ?
The answer given by the proponents is " Yes . "
Yet this claim apparently rules out divine revelation as knowledge as well as intuition and judgment .
It gives priority to human reason for no apparent reason , but many of us who are Christians , and some who are not , would argue that human reason is a flawed instrument for arriving at truth .
Leaving revelation aside , why , for example , is force logically excluded as a means of settling ( or deciding ) self - ownership ?
This seems implausible .
After all , American slave - owners settled the matter of self - ownership by buying and selling slaves .
They did not engage in argumentation with their victims .
Neither do many criminals argue with their victims .
Force is only one particular means of settling matters .
Those who use it need not attempt to justify it by argumentation , and if they do use argument , there is no guarantee that their choice of rationales implies that they respect others as self - owners .
They may be manipulative in their use of language .
3 . If the argumentation theorists insist , as they seem to , that only reasoning is involved in argumentation , then let us go along with them for the moment .
But I wonder , as we follow this course , does n’t the definition of argumentation predetermine the results ?
When people argue , by the stipulated definition of argumentation theorists , they use reasoning , which is neither force nor deception .
And then it is no great surprise to notice that not using force is a presupposition of argumentation .
In this case , it is surely true that when a socialist argues against self - ownership , there is then a performative contradiction .
But it is also true that if the argumentation theorists limit the " deciding " to the use of reasoning , then within the premise of their argument they smuggle in the ethical idea that they then uncover as a presupposition , which is no use of force , or , in Hoppe ’s context , the respect for self - ownership .
To point out that the reasoning in this argument , whether deductive or inductive , is circular is not new .
Human reasoning is circular .
Even so , human reasoning still has the extraordinary virtue of providing logical links between one proposition and another , and these links may be very surprising and informative .
The simple rules of integer arithmetic lead in amazing directions !
Who would have thought that 19×19 + 9 — 74×5 = 0 ?
Who would have thought that the square root of 2 cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers ?
So the question always becomes :
How much do we seem to grasp anew when we follow a reasoning process ?
In this case , how much do we newly discover when we define argumentation as involving reasoning ( and no force ) and then examine the beliefs of those who engage in argument ?
At least while arguing , they are letting the other fellow live .
This seems not so surprising .
The inference is awfully close to the premise .
Do we even know whether they believe what they are saying or what they are secretly planning to do next ?
Are we so sure that they are affirming private property ?
4 . Are people even capable of settling all matters by discussion ?
In particular , is it even possible to decide the matter of self - ownership by discussion ?
Simply because those who discuss the matter assume self - ownership while they discuss it does not mean that each person owns himself or that justice means that each person should own himself .
There is no necessary connection between the discussion and either the actual degree of justice or the truth of what justice may mean .
For example , what if the issue has already been decided for us , with the answer being that the ultimate owner is not we but God ?
5 . The aim of argumentation ethics is to uncover an objective ethics using reason alone .
For libertarians , it is to prove that aggressive force is wrong ( unjust ) and / or that self - ownership is right ( just ) .
This is a very old aim .
Philosophers have long sought to find objective justice and / or objective ethics by recourse to reason alone .
But they have not succeeded .
Have Habermas and Apel succeeded where so many others have failed ?
We are entitled to have our doubts , given the failure - strewn history of inquiry into this matter .
A proposed solution may look good for a few years , until another genius points out its failings .
6 . But let us examine this matter on its own merits .
What Apel and Habermas have done is point out that if a man argues , then he is displaying a certain set of ethics .
This shows only that the ethics are , in some sense , accepted or being used .
This , however , does not prove that those ethics are just .
Such a proof requires criteria of justice .
One must go outside of the ethics implicit in argumentation in order to decide whether or not those ethics are just .
And , in fact , Hoppe does not prove that there is justice in economic efficiency or that capitalism is just while socialism is not .
He has to bring in , despite his aversion to ad hoceries with which I concur , his own ad hoc " universalization " principle .
And in the end , he does not prove that socialism is unjust .
He proves that it is not argumentatively justified .
That is how he defines justice .
But are justice and justifiability the same ?
7 . Let us now consider matters from a Christian standpoint .
Even if the reader is not Christian , the discussion is highly instructive and below , when we discuss skepticism , we will find that an analogous development occurs .
Do we own ourselves ?
Ultimately ?
No , we do not .
The Creator owns us , says the Christian .
Think of the analogy of stockholders that own a corporation but hire managers to run it .
In the Christian view , we are not the stockholders of ourselves .
God is the sole stockholder .
We are more like the Board of Directors and management .
More accurately , God has made us more like independent businessmen .
We mostly operate our own businesses ( ourselves ) , even if ultimately we do not own them .
In a good many matters , we also are instructed to make various concessions to other businessmen .
We are not instructed to lead entirely independent lives without regard for others .
According to the Habermas / Apel / Hoppe approach , self - ownership is supposedly a question that we the managers can only decide by discussion among ourselves .
God is not needed .
In the Christian approach , that question is decided already by Scripture .
When human beings discuss the matter of self - ownership without reference to God , what happens ?
Some of us insist each of us as a human being owns himself fully .
Neither God nor his stipulated property concessions enter the picture .
Others of us insist that in some , in fact all sorts of matters , all of us together as human beings must decide things ; or a few of us may decide for all of us .
We do not each own ourselves .
God again need not be considered .
All of those in these two opposing camps ( roughly Rothbard libertarians versus socialists ) claim to be neutral and scientific in their approaches , even though they have already ruled out God .
Yet there seems to be no way to settle this conflict between the two groups despite many years trying .
Then , in recent years , a few of us , who follow the argumentation ethics and who also claim neutrality , insist that by discussing the matter amongst ourselves at all , we are endorsing full self - ownership implicitly .
They tell us that we have implicitly settled the matter .
And if any of us who is Christian protests that this is not so , that human beings are not the ultimate owners of themselves , he is said to contradict himself .
He is said to confirm his own endorsement of self - ownership even as he argues against self - ownership .
He had better sit down and be quiet because if he argues , he contradicts himself and supports human self - ownership .
Really ?
We see now that this supposed contradiction is false .
The Christian is arguing against human self - ownership because he believes the matter has already been decided in favor of God ’s ownership .
The Christian argues his position , not because he believes that men own themselves , but because God owns them and he is enjoined to argue , not use violence to settle matters .
The Christian is following the ethics of argumentation ethics , indeed , but not because he believes in human self - ownership .
And it is invalid to infer that he does .
The proponent of argumentation ethics sees a contradiction where there is none because he is attempting to infer too much from the observation that the Christian is discussing the matter .
Hoppe ’s model says that if a person argues against man ’s self - ownership , he supports it implicitly by arguing .
This is not always true .
A Christian argues against it because ( a ) he believes that God is man ’s owner , not man , and ( b ) he is not supposed to use violence to make his point .
Therefore , to infer that the Christian believes in man ’s self - ownership ( or that he is contradicting himself ) when he argues is incorrect .
And this difference in belief is non-trivial .
The implications of human self - ownership versus God ’s ownership are considerable .
The Christian belief shows that there is a problem with argumentation ethics , and the problem is this .
There are many possible ethics that may undergird a discussion , and from a single - point observation of discussion occurring , there is no way to infer which of the possible ethical systems prevails in a person ’s mind .
We will see next that this same kind of problem occurs with argumentation ethics when we move to a non-Christian skeptical perspective .
8 . The philosopher Frédéric Cossutta , in a 2003 paper titled " Toward a Skeptical Criticism of Transcendental Pragmatics , " sets forth several discussions that act against the Apel claim of having founded an objective ethics in the process of argumentation .
He does this by using skeptical approaches .
To show the power of their theories , Apel , Habermas , and Hoppe all bring in what may be called nave skeptics who argue directly against their doctrines .
These straw men are easily defeated because merely by arguing , they validate the doctrinal claims of their opponents .
Cossutta reminds us that the philosophy of true skeptics , such as Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus , is far more sophisticated than these skeptical straw men : " We can raise an objection against Apel ’s argument grounded upon his misconception of the real nature of historical skepticism .
On this point , he shares common prejudices , such as the caricature elaborated by all the doctrines that need the straw man of anti-philosophy to create a contrario their own conditions of possibility .
A reappraisal of skepticism as an authentic philosophy and , notably , a reappraisal of the status it gives to contradiction , permits us to reject Apel ’s argument . "
Properly applied skepticism " effectively evades the grasp of the performative self - contradiction . "
To a limited extent , I have in this article tried to act as a sophisticated skeptic might by not attacking argumentation ethics with argumentation .
I do not argue that it is impossible to argue as a nave skeptic might .
I merely present the contradictory arguments for your perusal .
As Cossutta writes : " … if the skeptic demonstrated the impossibility of argumentation as would the dogmatist , he would indeed be guilty of a performative contradiction , but he just displays the contradictory arguments , without having to assert anything himself .
He lets the contradictory game of appearances play itself out , and notes that this assertion is only valid insofar as it appears to him to be thus . "
9 . One sophisticated skeptical approach is to hypothesize " an ethically negative orientation of the pragmatic presuppositions of communicative activity . "
This is done by reversing the argumentation propositions .
Cossutta explains : " One could find philosophical analogues of this way of inscribing bad faith or duplicity at the level of origin , for instance in such pessimistic theories of human nature as that of Hobbes , who derives a possessive individualism from a geometry of the passions or in philosophical frameworks in which inauthenticity would be central , and as in the chapter in Sartre ’s Being and Nothingness dealing with bad faith .
Similarly , instead of asserting that u2018 the universal claim of discourse is that of an intersubjectively identical validity of meaning , ’ we could set forth as an a priori rule the primacy of misunderstanding or of u2018interincomprehension , ’ as does , for instance , the theory of discourse developed by D. Maingueneau , who coined this new word ( 1983 ) . "
For example , with Hoppe ’s argument we might proceed as follows .
We suppose that discussion is aimed at feigning agreement or faking the process of deciding upon the validity of propositions .
Suppose that the parties feign a conflict - free environment .
The norm only appears to be that everyone has self - ownership .
In fact , it is not the norm .
The opposite is the norm , namely , non-self - ownership .
We can imagine argumentation that is done using deception , dishonesty , manipulation , and such .
The people engaged in this need not be arguing in good faith .
There is bad - faith instead of good - faith discussion .
Their presuppositions about self - ownership need not be those of libertarians .
This is a special case of skeptical methodology that seeks to reverse the premises in order to show that an alternative exists , so that one should perhaps suspend firm judgment about a model .
One can not then sustain a dogma .
For example , the following statement made by Hoppe is falsified in this scenario : " It is only as long as there is at least an implicit recognition of each individual ’s property right in his or her own body that argumentation can take place . "
What I have done is suggest the appearance of argumentation with the actuality being its opposite .
In such a situation , someone who argues against self - ownership does not contradict the norm , but someone who argues in favor of it does .
Anyone who makes a truth claim now implicitly assumes the norm : " Everyone has the right to aggress uninvitedly against the body of any other person . "
This reversal does not prove anything .
It does not even argue against Hoppe ’s theorem , and therefore it avoids performative contradiction .
In fact , someone who argues for self - ownership in this negative scenario now has a performative contradiction .
What the reversal demonstrates is more basic .
It shows that from observing discussion alone , as in the Christian case , we are unable to infer ethics .
As Cossutta says : " all the maxims of discourse ethics will have to be doubled by their negative counterparts by asserting that they are on the same level and are associated with the same argumentative force , a determination favorable to one or the other being neutralized by a suspension of judgment ( the skeptical epoche ) .
We can thus avoid the performative contradiction taken absolutely … "
Cossutta reaches a very strong negative conclusion that rejects the ability to extract ethics from argumentation : " We are faced with the radical impossibility of deciding and , consequently , with the impossibility of founding the existence of the ethical presuppositions of communicative activity within a transcendental perspective . "
The overall result of the preceding is to view discourse from a neutral point of view .
Cossutta goes on to bolster his case for language neutrality by citing the work of linguist Antoine Culioli and others .
Cossutta writes : " … no language interaction presupposes understanding as the precondition of a communication , but only as its horizon , its possible goal .
Linguistic activity does not presuppose anything other than the possibility of an interactive space , which does not prejudge the nature of the social liaison : neither pro nor contra is assumed , nor is the underlying purpose of the interaction , the will to agree and understand representing only one case amongst others . "
10 . Cossutta provides a quote that gives us the flavor of skepticism : " But Timon , his disciple , did ; he contends that those who want to be happy must pay attention to three principles : first , what things are by nature ; secondly , what our attitude toward them is to be ; and finally , what will happen if one behaves in conformity to that attitude .
He says that , according to Pyrrho , things are indifferent ( adiaphora ) , unstable ( astathmeta ) , and cannot be determined ( anepikrita ) .
Consequently , neither our sensations nor our opinions can be true or false .
We must not trust them ; instead , we must remain free of opinion ( adoxastous ) , free of inclinations ( aklineis ) , and free of agitation ( akradantous einai ) ; we must say that each thing is no more than it is not , or that it both is and is not , or that it neither is nor is not . "
Pyrrho is saying that human beings on their own can only view all facts in the universe as indifferent , changing , and ultimately indeterminable .
This includes themselves and their own thinking .
It includes the statements that Pyrrho is making .
And the consequence of this is that there is no truth or falsity to be found in phenomena themselves .
Furthermore , no meaning or purpose is to be found by looking at these brute facts ( " neither our sensations nor our opinions can be true or false . " )
Following Cornelius Van
Til , we may say that if there is no God to make the facts what they are , then they can have no meaning .
I summarize Van Til ’s position briefly in the next two paragraphs .
If there is no active , sustaining , self - contained , and self - conscious God , then there is no objective meaning to or knowledge of events .
Without God , all that happens are particulars and they are open to any interpretation .
( This is what the skeptics also conclude . )
Man can not see meaning in facts without interpretation .
Facts are therefore theory - laden .
Without a grounding in truth , particular events or candidate facts become a jumble .
So then , without God , there are really no true facts .
There are what Van Til calls “ brute facts . ”
There is then no objective knowledge .
To be facts , facts must be God-interpreted facts .
Men , being in the image of God , can then understand these facts .
Men create realities for themselves but without presuming God these constructions are random creations , neither true nor false .
There can not be true knowledge without an anchor in an objective or absolute knowledge , which is what God is and provides .
Do we have true knowledge of how to fly an airplane ?
Yes , to an extent we do although we still do not understand or know all the forces involved .
How do we have such knowledge ?
Because there is non-randomness that arises because God made it so .
Without God , there are only brute facts ( really just particulars . )
If we do have this true knowledge of how to fly a plane , and we surely do have it , it means we can reject the premise of no God .
God suffices to overcome the skeptical position to which all man-based philosophies are condemned .
Ignoring God has to lead to the skeptical position enunciated by Pyrrho .
Human beings cannot find their way out of their self - made philosophical puzzles and boxes if they start from the premise that there is no God as self - conscious Creator and sustainer of every aspect of the universe and instead seek to answer all questions using human reason alone .
The result of such reasoning , or attempts to find a rational ethics , is that skepticism has to win the day over all the other philosophies that , like it , also ignore God .
Many scientists and philosophers uncomfortably squirm at this conclusion .
They would like to have everything in nature be subject to discoverable natural laws ( i.e. , they ’d like to deny an all - powerful and supernatural God ) while also they would like to object to the skeptical position .
They would prefer that man or nature or some combination deliver the truth and be the God .
They basically seek out stable laws , natural and moral , that inhere in nature , man , or man ’s language .
But their discoveries do not ever explain the why and wherefore of such regularities as are discovered .
Negating God or else invoking a God created in man ’s image or to satisfy man ’s needs , philosopher after philosopher adopts , usually inadequate and untenable , bootstrap theories of values in which man somehow lifts himself up by his own bootstraps to discover who he is and what universal values are .
Argumentation ethics is such a theory .
In fact , argumentation ethics is simply a natural rights theory of a new kind .
But , all such theories that are bereft of the Christian God run aground on the shoals of skepticism .
No matter how hard they try and how many laws and regularities they uncover , philosophies , including argumentation ethics , that ignore God cannot overcome the questions raised by sophisticated skepticism .
They cannot find a safe harbor and mooring .
Hoppe ’s position appears to be more sophisticated and less vulnerable .
But is it ?
He makes no claim to have gotten an ought from an is , and he explicitly notes that the ought - is gap can not be logically bridged .
The self - ownership property as derived from argumentation ethics is for him a matter of thought and thought only .
Calling it " fair " or " just " does not imply for him that one ought to follow it or strive for it .
The norm remains " true " or " valid " in the sense that it is the norm that is argumentatively justifiable .
But if there is such a norm , where does this norm come from ?
Do people socially determine the norm and therefore truth ?
How can we be sure that this norm is truth ?
Hoppe says : " … those people who would propagate and enforce such different , invalid norms would again have to be classified as uninformed or dishonest , insofar as one had made it clear to them that their alternative norm proposals or enforcements cannot and never will be justifiable in argumentation . "
In other words , the nonaggression axiom is truth because it is the norm that is justifiable via argumentation , and behavior that goes against it is either ignorant or corrupt .
The twin concepts of nonaggression and argumentation ethics are being elevated to godly status .
But even if the nonaggression axiom does capture an important aspect of moral truth , if that axiom is supported only by the argumentation ethics defense , then it remains vulnerable to each of the many doubts raised earlier .
Conclusion
Since I am only presenting doubts and not making affirmations , despite my relapses into declarative sentences that seem to dispense truths , and since I have finished presenting them , this article is almost at its end .
In this article , I do not leave the questions in the hands of the good reader , because I am not entering the stream of argumentation on these questions .
Consider me as merely a mental exhibitionist .
Ordinarily I would send a paper such as this to the man most concerned , Hans Hoppe , whom I have met and have the highest respect for .
But if I were to do that , it would imply that I was engaging in the process of argumentation .
This , I fear , would undermine my message .
So I have not done so .
Hoppe has written : " By being alive and formulating propositions , then , one demonstrates that any ethic except that of private property is invalid . "
Are matters this simple ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
I have my doubts .
Stalin was alive and formulated propositions .
Has Hoppe placed all of us in his sights ?
Has he slain the objections of both the skeptic and the Christian ?
Maybe .
But I wonder .
May there not be a skeptic who is alive and lives so as to fool his neighbor through argumentation and take his belongings ?
May I not be alive and argue for delegated self - ownership so as to maintain the property of God entrusted to my care ?

If there ’s one indulgence that ’s practically unavoidable this time of year , it may well be the tray of holiday cookies .
Adorned with sprinkles , spread with jam and frosting or dusted with powdered sugar , such cookies are a far cry from a healthful snack .
Still , many cooks may nonetheless stand in their kitchens and wonder :
Is it better to make them with margarine or butter ?
Butter and margarine have a similar overall fat content -- and therefore a lot of calories , says Katherine Zeratsky , a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
But the composition of the fats in butter and margarine differs significantly .
“ You have to pick the lesser of two evils , ” Zeratsky says .
“ In butter , it ’s the saturated fat content , and in margarine , it ’s trans fat . ”
A tablespoon of butter contains more than three times the amount of cholesterol - raising saturated fat than the same amount of margarine -- 7 grams in butter compared with 2 grams in margarine .

In addition , butter and margarine contain mono - and polyunsaturated fats , but margarine contains them in far greater amounts : close to 9 grams per tablespoon compared with butter ’s 3.5 grams .
These fats do n’t raise LDL cholesterol -- and some can help lower it , says Penny Kris-Etherton , professor of nutrition at Penn State University in University Park , Penn .
Margarine ’s drawback is its trans - fat content .
Margarines are made from blends of vegetable oils , such as corn , soybean , safflower or canola .
Hydrogenation , a chemical process , replaces double chemical bonds in those oils with single chemical bonds , making the liquid oils solid at room temperature .
When that replacement process is incomplete , the result is a partially hydrogenated oil , also known as a trans fat .
Trans fats are what make margarine solid instead of liquid -- but they ’ve also been shown to be even worse for heart health than saturated fats .
Not only do trans fats raise LDL cholesterol levels , they also lower HDL , or good , cholesterol .
For the last two years , manufacturers have been forced to list trans fats on food labels ; as a result , many have reformulated their margarines ( and other products ) to lower or eliminate their trans fat content .
But the letter of the law is such that a food can claim to have no trans fat as long as it contains less than 0.5 gram of trans fat per serving .
“ Even when the label says trans fat - free , it does n’t really mean that , ” says Barry Swanson , a food science professor at Washington State University in Pullman .

Food scientists , meanwhile , are still experimenting with alternatives to trans fats , which have been put into foods since the label law , says Richard Hartel , professor of food engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Many manufacturers are replacing trans fats with a blend of vegetable fats ; one common substitute is palm oil , which was condemned decades ago for its large fraction -- 50 % -- of saturated fat .
Today , manufacturers often alter that fraction , but the final fraction of saturated fats in margarine containing palm oil may not be discernible from the label , Swanson says .
Butter , on the other hand , is and always has been churned milk , a fact that makes it preferable to certain consumers , Zeratsky says .
But that very fact means that butter , as an animal product , is loaded not only with saturated fat but also contains cholesterol -- something margarine does n’t contain .
Of course , when it comes to baking cookies , there are other factors on which to base the butter or margarine decision : aesthetics and flavor .
Butter contains an abundance of small - chain fatty acids , which readily break down during the baking process into a variety of molecules with a range of flavors -- lending baked goods a rich , buttery flavor , Swanson says .
The flavor imparted by the long - chain molecules in vegetable oils , on the other hand , is far less complex .

Butter and margarine both tend to make thin , flat cookies .
Though tub margarine often has more of a healthful profile than stick margarine -- it has more polyunsaturated fat and is less likely to contain trans fat -- cookies made with tub margarine will be very thin and oily due to tub margarine ’s high liquid content , says Eric Decker , chairman of the department of food science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst .
Of course , sticklers for a cookie with light texture and volume know that the secret is neither butter nor margarine -- it ’s often shortening or lard , fat content be damned .
Hartel , author of “ Food Bites : The Science of the Foods We Eat , ” says he uses a combination of butter and shortening when baking cookies .
“ Ultimately , that ’s a personal choice .
The key is not to eat too many cookies . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin says she is not interested in running for the U.S. Senate and prefers her current position as governor of Alaska .
“ No , I ’m not planning on it because I think the people of Alaska will best be served with me as their governor , ” Palin , who has two years left in her term , told NBC television in an interview .
Interest in the 44 - year - old first - term governor has remained intense since she and Republican presidential candidate John McCain lost the election to Democrat Barack Obama and his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden a week ago .
She has granted several television interviews since then .
Palin has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2012 or a possible contender for the Alaskan U.S. Senate seat held by Ted Stevens , who may be forced out of Congress because he was convicted of seven felonies for failing to report more than $ 250,000 in gifts .
If Stevens loses his seat , Palin could run for it in a special election .
“ You know , when you talk about that white hot spotlight -- that ’s not really attractive to me , ” Palin said about running .
But she left open the possibility of running for president .
Obama would be up for re-election in 2012 .

“ Well , life is very unpredictable .
And that ’s the excitement of life .
You never know what is around the next corner , ” Palin said .
“ And I do not know what is around the next corner .
I do n’t know what opportunities will be there . ”
In an interview broadcast on Monday , Palin also suggested she might run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents itself .
“ Show me where the open door is .
Even if it ’s cracked up a little bit , maybe I ’ll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it , but do n’t let me miss an open door , ” Palin said in an interview on Fox News ’
“ On The Record ” program .
She did not specify which office she might be interested in seeking .
“ If there is an open door in ‘ 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ’ll plow through that door , ” Palin said in the Fox interview .
India has become the fourth nation to join the stuff - on - the - Moon club , after the Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft in lunar orbit successfully launched an impact probe at the lunar surface this afternoon .
The 35 - kg impactor was blazoned with the Indian flag .
" It will signify the entry of India on Moon , " an Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) official said , quoted by the Times of India .
The probe drop was described as a " perfect operation " .
The Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) module was primarily intended " to demonstrate the technologies required for landing the probe at a desired location on the Moon " , according to ISRO .
It consisted of a " honeycomb structure " and carried a video camera and a mass spectrometer for examination of the tenuous lunar atmosphere during descent .
Indian TV reported the story under the headers " Indian flag lands on lunar surface " and " Tricolour on Moon " .
Chandrayaan - 1 will remain in orbit above the Moon for two years , carrying out scientific research .
Apart from the MIP it carries a further ten experiments and instruments .
There 's more on the MIP from ISRO here . ®
The United States is projected to spend more on defense in FY 2009 than the next 45 highest spending countries combined , yet a push by conservatives and the military , backed by arms companies , is trying to lock the defense budget at 4 % of GDP .
The unholy triumvirate of Pentagon deskwarriors , arms manufacturers and conservative fans of defense pork are ramping up a pressure campaign right now designed to inflate the military 's budget requirements and thus provide a cushion for what they believe will be an Obama administration 's pullback from record defense spending levels under Bush .
By January , that campaign will be in high gear , with lobbyists and pundits enlisted to push for money to fund everything from missile defense plans against non-existant threats to stealth jets as counter - terrorism platforms against small groups of men with improvised bombs .
The centerpiece of their pressure plan is “ Four Percent for Freedom ” - a notion that defense spending should be pegged at a baseline of four percent of national GDP , forever amen .
It 's a dishonest and misleading slogan invented by the neoconservative Heritage Foundation but pushed by Dubya , John McCain , Republican lawmakers , CJCS Admiral Mullen and SecDef Bob Gates - one which if turned into policy will hamstring Obama 's budget options , perpetuate a massive world of pork and undermine civilian control of the military .
In this quarter 's Parameters , the journal of the Army War College , Travis Sharp of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation lays out the reasons why Obama and the nation should say " No " to the triumvirate 's lobbying .
The campaign is dishonest from the get - go .
It 's based on a claim that even Bush 's profligate defense spending amounts to only 3.43 % of GDP - but it neglects to account for $ 26 billion in non-DOD spending and $ 170 billion in supplementary spending on the misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Taken all together , those amount to 4.73 % of GDP and a staggering $ 711 billion dollars - a bailout a year or almost 50 % of the governments budget .
It 's a vastly higher sum , in real terms , than the U.S. has ever spent on defense before and it outstrips , by a wide margin , spending by the rest of the world .
This means the United States will spend significantly more , in inflation - adjusted dollars , for defense in FY 2009 than it did during the peak years of the Korean War ( 1953 ; $ 545 billion ) , the Vietnam War ( 1968 ; $ 550 billion ) , or the 1980s Reagan - era buildup ( 1989 ; $ 522 billion ) .
War ( 1953 ; $ 545 billion ) , the Vietnam War ( 1968 ; $ 550 billion ) , or the 1980s Reagan - era buildup ( 1989 ; $ 522 billion ) .
The United States is also projected to spend more on defense in FY 2009 than the next 45 highest spending countries combined , including 5.8 times more than China ( second highest ) , 10.2 times more than Russia ( third highest ) , and 98.6 times more than Iran ( 22d highest ) .
Indeed , the United States is expected to account for 48 percent of the world ’s total military spending in FY 2009 .
Travis points out that the only way the Bush administration could perpetuate this kind of overspend was through a massive increase in the deficit .
If there is to be fiscal responsibility ( as conservatives continually preach but do n't practise ) then that 's not an option .
Either taxes must rise or spending must be cut .
As Travis writes : " Money spent on defense is money not spent on education , deficit reduction , infrastructure , housing assistance , or other important domestic spending priorities . "
Hamstringing Obama 's budgetary options , then blaming him for the fallout , is a prospect sufficient to get many Republicans on board with this 4 % conjob .
But why should your retirement , your child 's education or the future financial soundness of the nation suffer so that Republican 's have a stick to beat Obama with , or furnish some dinosaur generals with shiny new toys which are overkill against any range of possible state enemies and do n't have any application to today 's non-state threats ?
Our current armed forces have more than sufficient budget and manpower to deal with the current threat and [ fourth - generation warfare ] threats .
However , they must be reorganized to fight the enemy as he is rather than remaining organized to fight the enemy of the past .
The United States could take some current funding away from expensive high - tech weaponry , which may be useless in future Iraq - style conflicts , and redirect it toward enhanced intelligence , diplomacy , counterinsurgency training , language competency , humanitarian assistance , and nuclear nonproliferation programs .
A final argument against any 4 % baseline is that it takes the power of the purse away from Congress , and the power of executive decision away from the Commander in Chief , in a very meaningful way .
With no ability to set overall budgetary limits , civilian control of the military would be weakened and the current wasteful and pork - laden system would be set in stone beyond the powers of lawmakers .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) reported in March 2008 that current programs are delivered 21 months late on average , five months later than the average in FY 2000 .
In FY 2000 , the total acquisition cost of 75 programs increased from the initial estimate by six percent ; by FY 2007 , the cost growth percentage had more than quadrupled to 26 percent .
30 “ In most cases , programs also failed to deliver capabilities when promised — often forcing warfighters to spend additional funds on maintaining legacy systems , ” GAO concluded .
This is what the unholy triumvirate want to keep -- a system that keeps the generals politically powerful , each in their own feudal holding , by virtue of the massive budgets they command .
One that the arms manufacturers make out like bandits from .
One that the political troughers and think - tank lobbists benefit from greatly .
If they can make political hay from it too -- all the while neglecting to mention that it 's your retirement , your child 's education , you family 's health , your taxes which will pay for their pork , then all well and good to their eyes .
Keep an eye on the Four percenters , they 're going to be vocal and pervasive .
The time to start countering their narrative and framing is now .

Just - auto reports that Honda is dropping dark hints about its future as a Japanese domestic .
In fact , if the island nation ’s government does n’t do some of that currency manipluation that Detroit ’s been blaming for their lost U.S. market share for God knows how long , HoMoCo may up stakes and move .
“ Chief executive Takeo Fukui told a small group of reporters in Tokyo on Friday the strong yen could cripple Japanese industry and spur massive layoffs , and added the automaker would be forced to send more production overseas if the dollar persisted below JPY100 .
‘ If the government is saying , ‘ We do n’t care about the export industry ’ , then that ’s fine – we ’ll act accordingly … we could switch to importing more cars into Japan , bring research and development facilities overseas , and in an extreme scenario move our headquarters offshore .
It would cause nothing short of a hollowing out of Japanese industry . ”
Whoa .
So much for the suggestion that Detroit ’s been hobbled by Japan ’s support for its domestic automakers .
Who ’d a thunk it ?

Congratulations , tolerance mau-mauers : Your shakedown of a Christian - targeted dating website worked .
Homosexuals will no longer be denied the inalienable " right " to hook up with same - sex partners on eHarmony .
What a landmark triumph for social progress , eh ?
New Jersey plaintiff Eric McKinley can now crown himself the new Rosa Parks -- heroically breaking down inhumane barriers to Internet matchmaking by forcing a law - abiding private company to provide services it was never created to provide .
" Men seeking men " has now been enshrined with " I have a dream " as a civil rights rallying cry of the 21st century .
Bully for you , Mr. McKinley .
You bully .
Neil Warren , eHarmony 's founder , is a gentle , grandfatherly businessman who launched his popular dating site to support heterosexual marriage .
A " Focus on the Family " author with a divinity degree , Warren encourages healthy , lasting unions between men and women of all faiths , mixed faiths or no faith at all .
Do n't like what eHarmony sells ?
Go somewhere else .
There are thousands upon thousands of dating sites on the Internet that cater to gays , lesbians , Jews , Muslims , Trekkies , runners , you name it .
No matter .
In the name of tolerance , McKinley refused to tolerate eHarmony 's right to operate a lawful business that did n't give him what he wanted .
He filed a discrimination complaint against eHarmony with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights in 2005 .
To be clear : eHarmony never , ever refused to do business with anyone .
The company broke no laws .
Their great " sin " was not providing a politically correct service that a publicity - seeking gay plaintiff demanded they provide .
For three years , the company battled McKinley 's legal shakedown artists -- and staved off other opportunists as well .
The dating site had been previously sued by a lesbian looking to force the company to match her up with another woman , and by a married man who ridiculously sought to force the company to find him prospects for an adulterous relationship .
This case is akin to a meat - eater suing a vegetarian restaurant for not offering him a rib - eye , or a female patient suing a vasectomy doctor for not providing her hysterectomy services .
But rather than defend the persecuted business , the New Jersey attorney general intervened on behalf of the gay plaintiff and wrangled an agreement out of eHarmony to change its entire business model .
The company agreed not only to offer same - sex dating services on a new site , but also to offer six - month subscriptions for free to 10,000 gay users , pay McKinley $ 5,000 and fork over $ 50,000 to New Jersey 's Civil Rights division " to cover investigation - related administrative costs . "
Oh , and that 's not all .
Yield , yield to the grievance - mongers :
Additional terms of the settlement include :
-- eHarmony , Inc. will post photos of same - sex couples in the " Diversity " section of its website as successful relationships are created using the company 's same - sex matching service .
In addition , eHarmony , Inc. will include photos of same - sex couples , as well as individual same - sex users , in advertising materials used to promote its same - sex matching services ;
-- eHarmony , Inc. will revise anti-discrimination statements placed on company websites , in company handbooks and other company publications to make plain that it does not discriminate on the basis of " sexual orientation " ;
-- the company has committed to advertising and public relations / marketing dedicated to its same - sex matching service , and will retain a media consultant experienced in promoting the " fair , accurate and inclusive " representation of gay and lesbian people in the media to determine the most effective way of reaching the gay and lesbian communities .
I have enormous sympathy for eHarmony , whose attorney explained that they gave in to the unfair settlement because " litigation outcomes can be unpredictable . "
The recent mob response to the passage of Proposition 8 , the traditional marriage measure in California , must have also weighed on eHarmony management 's minds .
But capitulation will only yield a worse , entirely predictable outcome : more shakedowns of private businesses that hold views deemed unacceptable by the Equality - at - All - Costs Brigade .
Perhaps heterosexual men and women should start filing lawsuits against gay dating websites and undermine their businesses .
Coerced tolerance and diversity - by - fiat cut both ways .
This 3D representation of the three planets orbiting the star HR 8799 shows the system is located 90 degrees away from the Milky Way galactic center , lower than the sun .
( All orbital diameters are greatly exaggerated . )
Astronomershave taken what they say are the first - ever direct images of planets outside ofour solar system , including a visible - light snapshot of a single - planet systemand an infrared picture of a multiple - planet system .
Earth - likeworlds might also exist in the three - planet system , but if so they are too dimto photograph .
The other newfound planet orbitsa star called Fomalhaut , which is visible without the aid of a telescope .
It is the 18th brightest star in the sky .
The massiveworlds , each much heftierthan Jupiter ( at least for the three - planet system ) , could change how astronomers define the term ?
planet , ? oneplanet - hunter said .
Breakthroughtechnology
Until now , scientists have inferred the presence of planets mainly by detecting an unseenworld 's gravitational tug on its host star or waiting for the planet to transitin front of its star and then detecting a dip in the star 's light .
While thesemethods have helped to identify more than 300 extrasolar planets to date , astronomers have struggled to actually directly image and see such inferred planets .
The fourphotographed exoplanets are discussed in two research papers published onlinetoday by the journal Science .
" Everyextrasolar planet detected so far has been a wobble on a graph .
These are thefirst pictures of an entire system , " said Bruce Macintosh , anastrophysicist from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , andpart of the team that photographed the multi-planet system in infrared light .
"
We 've been trying to image planets for eight years with no luck and nowwe have pictures of three planets at once . "
Astronomershaveclaimed previously to have directly imaged a planet , with at least two suchobjects , though not everybody agreed the objects were planets .
Instead , theymay be dim , failed stars known as brown dwarfs .
Multi-planetsnapshots
Macintosh , lead researcher Christian Marois of the NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysicsin Canada , and colleagues used the Gemini North telescope and W.M. KeckObservatory on Hawaii's Mauna Kea to obtain infrared images .
Infrared radiationrepresents heat and , along with everything from radio waves to visible lightand X - rays , is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The trio ofworlds orbits a star named HR 8799 , which is about 130 light - years away in theconstellation Pegasus and about 1.5 times as massive as the sun .
The planetsare located at distances from their star of 24 , 38 and 68 astronomical units ( AU ) .
( An astronomical unit equals the average Earth - sun distance of 93 millionmiles , or about 150 million km . )
Other planet - finding techniques work out toonly about 5 AU from a star .
The planetclosest to the star weighs in at 10 times the mass of Jupiter , followed byanother 10 Jupiter - mass planet and then , farther out , a world seven times theheft of Jupiter .
Byastronomical standards , the planets are fresh out of the oven , forming about 60 million years ago .
That means the orbs are still glowing from heat leftoverfrom their formation .
Earth , by comparison , is about 4.5 billion years old .
The mostdistant planet orbits just inside a diskof dusty debris , similar to that produced by the icy objects of the solarsystem 's Kuiper belt , which lies just beyond the orbit of Neptune .
The setupof this planetary system , along with its dusty belt , suggests it is a scaled - upversion of our solar system , Macintosh said .
That means other planets closer into the host star could be waiting for discovery .
" Ithink there 's a very high probability that there are more planets in the systemthat we can't detect yet , " Macintosh said .
" One of the things thatdistinguishes this system from most of the extrasolar planets that are alreadyknown is that HR 8799 has its giant planets in the outer parts ?
like our solarsystem does ?
and so has ' room ' for smaller terrestrial planets , far beyond ourcurrent ability to see , in the inner parts . "
Hubble'sdiscovery
Universityof California , Berkeley , astronomer Paul Kalas led the team of astronomers whotook the visible - light snapshot of the single - planet system .
The exoplanet hasbeen named Fomalhaut b , and is estimated to weigh no more than three Jupiter masses .
The HubbleSpace Telescope 's Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to make the image .
The camerais equipped with a coronagraph that blocks out the light of the host star , allowing astronomers to view a much fainter planet .
" It 'skind of like if driving into the sun and suddenly you flip down your visor , youcan see the road easier , " Kalas said during a telephone interview .
Infact , Fomalhaut b is 1 billion times fainter than its star .
" It 's not easyto see .
That kind of sensitivity has never been seen before , " he added .
Fomalhaut bis about 25 light - years from Earth .
Photos taken in 2004 and 2006 show theplanet 's movement over a 21 - month period and suggest the planet likely orbitsits star Fomalhaut every 872 years at a distance of 119 astronomical units ( AU ) , or 11 billion miles ( nearly 18 billion km ) .
That 's about four times the distancebetween Neptune and the sun .
Kalas suspectedthe planet 's existence in 2004 ( published in 2005 ) after Hubble images hehad taken revealed a dusty belt that had a sharp inner edge around Fomalhaut .
The sculpted nature of the ring suggested a planet in an elliptical orbit wasshaping the belt 's inner edge .
And it was .
" Thegravity of Fomalhaut b is the key reason that the vast dust belt surrounding Fomalhaut is cleanly sculpted into a ring and offset from the star , " Kalassaid .
" We predicted this in 2005 , and now we have the direct proof . "
Kalas ' teamalso suspects that the planet could be surrounded by a ring system with thedimensions of Jupiter 's early rings , before the dust and debris coalesced intothe four Galilean moons .
What 's aplanet ?
The successful image results could change howplanets are defined , said Sara Seager , an astrophysicist at MIT who was notinvolved in the discoveries .
Until now , mass has been one of the critical pieces of information that could place anobject into or out of the planet club .
Objects that are too massive , aboveabout 13 Jupiter masses , are considered brown dwarfs .
But now formation couldalso be part of the formula .
Both of the new planetary systems revealed dustydisks and suggest the planets must have formed similar to how planets in oursolar system and elsewhere are thought to have formed .
So , mostastronomers would call the four objects planets , although their masses are onlyinferred from the luminosities seen in the images .
" Takentogether , these discoveries are going to change what we call a planet , " Seager told SPACE.com .
" Until now people have been arguing abouthow big can an object be and still be a planet . "
Seageradded , referring to the multi-planet system , " People want to call theupper mass 12 Jupiter masses .
I think it 's going to force us to reconsider whata planet is , because even if they are more massive than what we want to call aplanet , they 're in a disk . "
In addition , she said , nobody has ever spottedthree stars orbiting a host star , as would have to be the case if you were tocall the three planets something other than planets .
Aimingfor Earth - like planets
Theserecent direct images reveal giant , gaseous exoplanets in a new light for thefirst time , revealing not the effects of the planets but the planetsthemselves .
The next goal would be direct images of an Earth - likeplanet , the astronomers say .
" Thediscovery of the HR 8799 system is a crucial step on the road to the ultimatedetection of another Earth , " Macintosh said .
The problemis that terrestrial ( Earth - like ) planets are orders of magnitude fainter thanthe giant Jupiter - like worlds , and they are much closer in to their host stars .
That means the glare from the star would be overwhelming with today ' stechnology .
The pay - offcould be big , though , as such rocky planets could orbit within their habitablezones ( where temperatures would allow the existence of liquid water ) .
" Thereis plenty of empty space between Fomalhaut b and the star for other planets tohappily reside in stable orbits , " Kalas said .
" We 'll probably have towait for the James Webb Space Telescope to give us a clear view of the regioncloser to the star where a planet could host liquid water on the surface . "
DIGG THIS
When one walks into a business , most often you are greeted .
As part of treating customers as their very livelihood , companies usually enact policies that make it a requirement for employees to acknowledge the arrival of a client or customer .
Imagine , however , if instead of getting a " hello " or " good morning , " the manager of the store asks you to greet him .
Further , imagine if the manager holds you at gunpoint and threatens you with imprisonment .
Assuming you could escape , chances are that you ’d never go back to that store .
Yet this is what happens in the courts .
Virtually everyone in the courtroom has to rise when the judge enters .
Failure to do so might result in contempt of court — you can get a fine or be sentenced to jail time for your audacity .
This is , of course , absurd .
First of all , government courts are financed through taxation .
People who do not use the system at all , for example , still have to pay .
This is a form of redistribution , also known as socialism .
Aside from the fact that the resources to run the system are extracted aggressively , often the accused are victims rather than victimizers .
Laws and ordinances regulating peaceful drug or firearm possession or usage , municipal codes regulating assembly , zoning , prostitution and gambling , for example , violate no rights and therefore have no victims .
Thus , when an innocent person is brought ( violently or through the threat thereof ) to one of those government courts , the last thing one expects is to be further humiliated by having to stand for the judge .
If anything , the judge should be kissing the defendant ’s feet and begging for forgiveness .
We should not be surprised that the state does whatever possible to assert its aggressive political power in every instance ; the courtroom is not an exception .
Perhaps in the old days it was customary to rise for the judge .
So what ?
Today , however , I see this not as a gesture of respect but as a demand for obedience .
The judge , a state bureaucrat , has no authority over anyone .
Prove that the judge and the court deserve any respect .
After all , they were the ones ( along with the legislative and executive branches ) to kidnap people from their homes , families and places of employment , only to be dragged to face " justice . "
Show that , especially in the case of victimless crimes , the defendant should stand for the judge .
The concept of contempt of court , so long as the state holds a monopoly over this institution , is a farce .
I believe it is the court , along with all the thugs it employs , who is in contempt .
Anyone willing to show the violence of the court by refusing to obey is a hero .
Rising for the judge is bowing to the state .

Elected Officials Score Lower than the General Public
The ISI civic Literacy survey was not designed to test the civic knowledge of elected officials , but it did discover evidence of an interesting pattern that may merit further exploration .
Are You Smarter Than a Politician ?
Of the 2,508 People surveyed , 164 say they have held an elected government office at least once in their life .
Their average score on the civic literacy test is 44 % , compared to 49 % for those who have not held an elected office .
Officeholders are less likely than other respondents to correctly answer 29 of the 33 test questions .
This table shows the “ knowledge gap ” for each question : the difference between the percentage of common citizens who answered correctly and the percentage of officeholders who answered correctly .

All survey respondents were asked whether they have ever engaged in any of 13 different political and civic activities .
These included , for example , registering to vote , signing a petition , contacting a public official , publishing a letter to the editor , and whether they have ever been elected to a government office .
Among the 2,508 respondents , 164 say they have been elected to a government office at least once .
This sub-sample of officeholders yields a startling result : elected officials score lower than the general public .
Those who have held elective office earn an average score of 44 % on the civic literacy test , which is five percentage points lower than the average score of 49 % for those who have never been elected .
It would be most interesting to explore whether this statistically significant result is maintained across larger samples of elected officials .
The elected officeholders come from the ranks of Democrats ( 40 % ) , Republicans ( 31 % ) , Independents ( 21 % ) , and those who say they belong to no party or indicate no affiliation ( 8 % ) .
None were asked to specify what office they held , so the proportion in which they held local , state , or federal positions is unknown .
Not all officeholders do poorly , of course .
Some elected officials rank among the highest scorers .
But the failure rate on the test among those who have won public office is higher ( 74 % ) than among those who have not ( 71 % ) .
Officeholders scored lower on all sub - themes of the test : political history , cultural institutions , foreign relations , and market economy .
In each of the following areas , for example , officeholders do more poorly than non-officeholders :
Seventy - nine percent of those who have been elected to government office do not know the Bill of Rights expressly prohibits establishing an official religion for the U.S .
Thirty percent do not know that “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ” are the inalienable rights referred to in the Declaration of Independence .
Twenty - seven percent cannot name even one right or freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment .
Forty - three percent do not know what the Electoral College does .
One in five thinks it either “ trains those aspiring for higher political office ” or “ was established to supervise the first televised presidential debates . ”
Fifty - four percent do not know the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war .
Thirty - nine percent think that power belongs to the president , and 10 % think it belongs to the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Only 32 % can properly define the free enterprise system , and only 41 % can identify business profit as “ revenue minus expenses . ”
On some questions , Americans who have held elected office do better than Americans who have not .
They are a little more likely , for example , to recognize the language of the Gettysburg Address ( 23 % to 21 % ) and to know that the question of whether slavery should be allowed to expand into new territories was the main issue in the Lincoln–Douglas debates ( 25 % to 20 % ) .
Officeholders and non-officeholders find it equally difficult to identify the three branches of government .
Only 49 % of each group can name the legislative , executive , and judicial .

What happened
Citigroup ’s board is reportedly meeting Friday to discuss selling off pieces of the banking giant or even the whole company , among other options , after Citi ’s stock fell 26 percent Thursday to below $ 5 a share , its lowest close since 1994 .
Citi was once the largest U.S. bank , with a market value of $ 274 billion ; now it ’s No. 5 , worth about $ 26 billion .
( Bloomberg )
What the commentators said
Clearly , people “ are quickly losing faith in Citigroup , ” said Mara Der Hovanesian in BusinessWeek online .
The bank is “ doing its best to calm investors , " and one high - roller , Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , pledged Thursday to raise his stake by $ 350 million , to 5 percent .
But the market is worried about Citi ’s exposure to toxic assets , and many think “ some sort of government intervention ” will be needed .
How the government could help “ is an open question , ” said Dan Wilchins in Reuters .
The U.S. Treasury has already invested $ 25 billion in Citi , and it could invest more to “ soothe investors . ”
It could take an 80 percent stake , as with AIG ; guarantee Citi ’s debt ; or force its liquidation or breakup , as with Washington Mutual .
CEO Vikram Pandit is already “ dismantling parts of the company , ” said Liz Moyer in Forbes online .
He ’s aiming to cut 52,000 jobs , half from selling off businesses .
But Pandit is n’t keen on truly breaking up his megabank , and selling or spinning off major units “ may be impossible , ” anyway , in this market .
These days Samuel Adams is more likely to be known as a brand of beer than a revolutionary leader .
While it is true that he ran his father 's Boston malt house for a time , he was perhaps the most forceful single figure behind the American Revolution .
He was also America 's first great political operative , mastering the arts of spin and strategy in ways that future generations of David Axelrods and Lee Atwaters could profitably emulate .
Ira Stoll , in his pithy and well - researched biography , sets out to rescue Adams from historical obscurity .

The spicules of sponges viewed under high magnification Sea sponges can beam light deep inside their bodies , and do so using the natural equivalent of fibre optic cables , scientists have found .
Sponges are among the oldest and simplest of Earth 's animals .
The discovery that they use such a futuristic light transmission system has therefore delighted researchers .
The finding , made by a German team , is published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology .
Whereas other animals pass electrical currents around their bodies using nerve cells , sponges appear to be the only animals capable of transmitting light around their bodies in this way , the group says .
This may help explain why some sponges are able to grow so big , and also clear up a long - standing mystery about how other , much smaller organisms are able to live deep within the bodies of large sponges .
Glass skeletons Sponges mainly live in the sea , and are extremely primitive organisms .
They lack muscles , nerves and internal organs , for example , and are essentially a diverse set of cells supported by a hard exoskeleton .
Two of the three major types of sponge build their skeletons using special structures called spicules .
These are made from silica and are basically glass rods .
Previous experiments suggested that light can pass along these structures .
Now , Franz Brummer , of the University of Stuttgart , and colleagues have proved that living sponges use these internal glass rods as light conductors .
Photosensitive paper was placed inside sponges of the species T. aurantium Light reaching the surface of the sponge is reflected off the insides of each spicule in much the same way light bounces along the inside of a fibre optic cable used to transmit electronic data .
In doing so , light is beamed deep into the sponge .
Brummer 's team made the discovery using living sponges of the species Tethya aurantium .
They collected the sponges from shallow waters off the coast of Croatia , and then transferred them to tanks of seawater .
They then implanted light sensitive paper deep inside each sponge .
They did so under dark conditions and then exposed the surface of the sponge to light .
When they checked the paper , they found it was covered in spots , which corresponded exactly with where light would exit each spicule .
Shared existence
In a control experiment , the researchers tested another sponge that does not grow using glass spicules .
No light entered deep within it , showing that spicules are necessary to transmit the light .
" Sponges are fascinating animals and there 're lots about them we are waiting to discover , " says Brummer .
He suspects that deep - sea sponges may use giant natural fibre optic arrays to harvest what little light reaches them .
" Sponges in the deep sea can form spicules up to one metre long and two centimetres in diameter , " he explains .
Beaming light deep inside their bodies may explain why some sponges grow to such large sizes , and develop rounded shapes .
To grow big , sponges need essential nutrients , including carbon , nitrogen and other metabolites .
These are provided by smaller organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria , with which the sponges have a symbiotic relationship .
But these smaller organisms need light to survive .
Because of this they usually live on the outside of sponges .
In 1994 , however , researchers discovered that algae sometimes do live deep within the bodies of sponges , creating a mystery as to how they survive there .
The answer , as Brummer 's team has now confirmed , is that they live off light beamed down to them .

Word Associations
This series uses the same bigram dataset as the word spectrum visualization .
To eliminate occlusion , I developed an entirely different layout .
Now , instead of a continuous spectrum of words , words are bucketed into one of 25 different rays .
Each of these represent a different tendency of use ( ranging from 0 to 100 % in 4 % intervals ) .
There is a nice visual analogy at play - the " lean " of each ray represents the strength of the tendency towards one of the two terms .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s Communists expect the global financial crisis will cause social unrest and help them challenge for power , the party ’s leader said on Saturday .
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov greets the audience during Party 's annual congress in Moscow , November 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Alexander Natruskin
Gennady Zyuganov told the party ’s annual congress the Communists should make maximum use of the growing public discontent caused by the economic downturn to try to restore their political strength .
“ The wind of history is blowing in our sails again ...
At this time of crisis the world of imperialism is starting to die .
We are standing on the threshold of political and social shifts , ” Zyuganov said in a 2 - hour speech opening the congress .
Russia ’s Communists ruled the Soviet Union for eight decades and remained a major opposition force for several years after the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 .
But the party has since lost much of its authority and many analysts say it is too weak to seriously challenge for power .
The Russian authorities are trying to minimise the impact of the financial crisis by promising billions of dollars of state aid .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has pledged higher social payments to the needy and lower taxes for business .
“ The authorities are clearly not coping with managing the country ...
A mass social protest is brewing and it is hard to predict now when and in what shape it will explode , ” Zyuganov said .
The Kremlin has acknowledged the crisis will lead to a rise in popular discontent , challenging the massive popularity that Putin secured in eight years as president and handed on to his successor , Dmitry Medvedev .
Medvedev has ordered police to stamp out any social unrest arising from the crisis and Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev has said higher unemployment could lead to a rise in crime .
“ We should secure the support of society well before the political crisis comes ...
We have to squeeze everything we can from this situation , ” Zyuganov said .
Zyuganov trailed far behind Medvedev at the presidential election in March and his party ’s contingent in parliament is dwarfed by the pro-Kremlin majority .
Many Russians associate Communist rule with empty shelves in the shops and endless queues .
Russia has been among the biggest losers from the global financial crisis .
The benchmark RTS stock exchange has fallen about 70 percent since peaks in May , and the rouble has been hit by tumbling prices for oil , Russia ’s main export .
The impact on ordinary people so far has been limited , partly because share ownership is not widespread and few people have private pensions .
But firms in some sectors have started laying off staff .
Russia ’s liberal opposition movement , Solidarity , also predicts that the fallout from the economic crisis will force Putin and Medvedev from power by 2012 .
Aid agencies expect the number of cholera cases to rise A cholera outbreak is threatening tens of thousands of people who have fled fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo , an aid agency has warned .
Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) says it has seen more than 45 cases around the city of Goma and the number could rise .
Meanwhile , the UN says fresh fighting has erupted between rebels in an area to the east of the country .
It is the first new fighting since African leaders called for a ceasefire during a summit in Nairobi on Friday .
MSF doctor Megan Hunter said people in the Kibati camp , close to Goma were living in " very bad sanitary conditions " .
See detailed map of the area
She said that in the Kibati camp alone , MSF had seen 45 people with suspected cholera since Friday .
" All the risk factors are there for an explosion of a major epidemic , " said Ms Hunter .
There are also fears that the disease could be spread further if increased fighting causes infected people to run away from camps .
Rwanda 's role in conflict Congolese head home despite fear
In pictures : Rebel advance
An estimated 250,000 people have now fled the fighting between rebel forces of Gen Laurent Nkunda and pro-government militias .
Gen Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attacks by Rwandan Hutu rebels , who fled to Congo after the 1994 genocide .
The UN mission in DR Congo , Monuc , said on Sunday that a new front had opened up in the conflict .
Fighting was reported near Ngungu , 60 km ( 37 miles ) to the west of Goma .
A UN spokesman said thousands of civilians had fled to a peacekeeping base to escape the fighting but that it was not clear how the clashes had started .
Previously , fighting had been largely to the north of Goma , where Gen Nkunda halted his advance 10 days ago Correspondents say the fighting has raised fears that the rebels could be trying to encircle the city .
African forces African leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire and for UN peacekeepers to get greater powers .
At a summit in Nairobi on Friday , leaders from seven countries said the peacekeepers ' mandate should be amended to give them " peace - making " capabilities .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement The Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) has also called for a ceasefire and said it may consider deploying peacekeeping troops .
" SADC will not stand by and witness any destructive acts of violence by any armed groups and if necessary will send peacekeeping forces , " the group said in a statement from Johannesburg .
The UN has 17,000 peacekeepers in DR Congo , making Monuc its largest mission in the world .
But only a few hundred peacekeepers are in the areas affected by the latest violence , and human rights groups have also criticised the UN for failing to prevent the killings .
The UN has accused both sides of war crimes , following the reported killing of several civilians in the eastern town of Kiwanja this week .

THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE ‘ BEGGING ’….
Not to belabor the point , but the exploits of Joe Lieberman have apparently led to some confusion , even among Democrats who should know better .
Sen . Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) … said he disagreed with stripping Lieberman of his chair .
“ No , I do n’t think there should be retribution , ” he said .
“ I think reconciliation is in order , not revenge or retribution . ”
Bayh suggested that Lieberman apologize and “ let bygones be bygones . ”
Let ’s cut the nonsense .
Reid offered Lieberman a chance to stay in the Democratic caucus , keep his seniority , and become the chairman of some other committee .
Lieberman thinks that ’s “ unacceptable ” and reportedly “ begged ” to stay on as chairman of Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
Bayh thinks this is about “ revenge or retribution . ”
It ’s not .
For that matter , it ’s only partly about holding Lieberman accountable for his betrayals .
This is actually about a specific power Lieberman is intent on keeping for a specific reason .
This seems to be routinely overlooked , but take a moment to consider what the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs actually does : it ’s the committee principally responsible for oversight of the executive branch .
It ’s an accountability committee , charged with investigating the conduct of the White House and the president ’s administration .
As chairman of this committee for the last two years , Lieberman decided not to pursue any accusations of wrongdoing against the Bush administration .
Lieberman ’s House counterpart — Rep. Henry Waxman ’s Oversight Committee — was a vigilant watchdog , holding hearings , issuing subpoenas , and launching multiple investigations .
Lieberman preferred to let his committee do no real work at all .
It was arguably the most pathetic display of this Congress .
And yet , now Lieberman acts as if keeping this chairmanship is the single most important part of his public life .
Why would he be so desperate to keep the gavel of a committee he has n’t used ?
I ’ll let you in on a secret : he wants to start using the power of this committee against Obama .
Lieberman did n’t want to hold Bush accountable , but he seems exceedingly anxious to keep the committee that would go after Obama with a vengeance , effectively becoming a Waxman - like figure — holding hearings , issuing subpoenas , and launching investigations against the Democratic president .
Lieberman does n’t care about “ reconciliation , ” he cares about going after a Democratic administration .
Why else would he fight diligently to be chairman of one committee instead of another ?
In anticipation of Senate Dems deciding Lieberman ’s fate , MyDD ’s Josh Orton , AmericaBlog ’s John Aravosis , and others , are getting organized , preparing to push the party to do what Harry Reid apparently wants to do .
It ’s a very worthwhile endeavor .
Update :
It looks like David Sirota was thinking very much along the same lines .
Filmmaker 's ' Warning ' explores consequences of Bush - era abuses Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday December 20 , 2008
Print This Email This Five iconoclastic authors , one crucial message .
Filmmaker JP
Sottile , after years toeing the line among the ranks of mainstream press , has broken away .
His new documentary , ' The Warning , ' is nothing if not an urgent plea for a return to Constitutional values in an age of rampant abuse .
Comprised of interviews with authors Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. ( " Crimes Against Nature " ) , Naomi Wolf ( " The End of America " ) , Naomi Klein ( " The Shock Doctrine " ) , Chris Hedges ( " American Fascists " ) and Joe Conason ( " It Can Happen Here " ) , ' The Warning ' plumbs deep the frightening , totalitarian advances seen in US governance since the appointment of George W. Bush , and the threats these new executive powers pose in the coming years .
" A lot of people are very hopeful for an Obama administration , " said Sottile speaking to RAW STORY .
" And one of the questions that comes up is , now that Bush is leaving , do you think this film is relevant ?
I think it 's more relevant than ever . "
Sottile spent a portion of his career at PBS , with The News Hours with Jim Lehrer , pursuing what he calls an " antiseptic " way of handling the news .
" But here were five people who were saying something very , very important , and very , very startling , and basically was being ignored by the mainstream media , " he said .
Sottile 's film avoids cinematic flare in favor of an 85 - minute , focused , heavily researched diatribe that caustically categorizes the Bush administration 's most egregious abuses .
" One of the reasons for the rise of alternative press on the Web is because people are turning off their TVs , " said Sottile , expanding on his reasons for breaking away from televised journalism .
" They do n't trust the media .
The American people regard the media pretty much the same way they regard lawyers .
I think the fact that important questions have not been asked by the media after 9/11 , in the lead - up to the Iraq war , people are reacting to that . "
Moving forward , Sottile said he plans future ' Truth to Power ' films on the neoconservative ideology , and the use of depleted uranium in Iraq .

Flies expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in their retina cells or other tissues can be tracked by specially modified video cameras , creating a real time computer record of movement and gene expression .
The new technique , described in the open access journal BMC Biotechnology , will allow detailed analyses of correlations between behavior , gene expression and aging .
John Tower led a team of researchers from the University of Southern California , Los Angeles , who carried out the fluorescent experiments in Drosophila flies .
When the flies are illuminated with blue light , the authors ' video tracking system allows tissue - specific GFP expression to be visualized , then quantified and correlated with 3D animal movement in real time .
According to Tower , " These methods allow specific temporal patterns of gene expression to be correlated with temporal patterns of animal activity , behavior and mortality " .
The green fluorescent protein gene is isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and encodes a protein that absorbs blue light and emits green light .
When a fly expressing GFP is illuminated by blue LEDs , filtered cameras can detect the green fluorescence that results and the fly 's movement can be tracked at a rate of 60 frames per second .
By linking the expression of GFP to the expression of other reporter genes , it is possible to determine when these genes are on or off , and how this is associated with a fly 's behavior .
Tower said , " A large number of strains exist where GFP or some other auto - fluorescent protein is used as a reporter for specific gene expression in Drosophila and other organisms .
- Our methods should be readily adaptable to such reagents , for example we have recently been successful in tracking DsRED fluorescent flies " .

Obama not ' likely ' to push repeal of Bush tax cuts
Obama adviser Bill Daley says Obama will " more likely than not " postpone a tax increase for the rich until 2011 , when the Bush tax cuts expire , rather than pushing to repeal them now .
He made the comment on " Meet the Press , " and it's a suggestion that Obama will tailor his initiatives to avoid burdening the struggling economy — even at the cost of a widening deficit .

Front - window spy cam puts Tenderloin on the Web

Somewhere in a room with high ceilings and a wall full of law books , the city 's deep thinkers are still arguing about how to use San Francisco 's video surveillance cameras .
More than three years after they went up , that civic camera program is still mired with restrictions , regulations and red tape .
Nobody 's watching the 76 cameras ' feeds , the cops can't rely on the tapes for clear footage , and prosecutors say they 're often worthless .
The city will likely ponder this issue for years more .
Meanwhile , citizens and business owners have their own program , installing cameras at entrances to stores , apartment buildings and restaurants .
More often than not , the police use these cameras to solve murders , assaults and thefts .
And now a self - described computer geek named Adam Jackson has gone a step further .
He 's created adamsblock.com - one of the hottest live shows on the Internet - simply by pointing a camera out his Tenderloin apartment window .
Jackson , 22 , moved to the city in June from a small beach town in Florida and quickly discovered the realities of San Francisco real estate .
Prices were so high that he said he " jumped on the first place I found . "
It turned out to be on Taylor Street , just across from Glide Memorial Church .
It 's an ideal location - for watching crack deals , late - night violence and random crazy behavior .
" By the third night I was basically fed up with the crime and noise , " Jackson said .
" I did n't really have a plan .
I just put the Webcam up , my girlfriend made a little Web page to display it , and here we are . "
If you have n't checked out adamsblock.com , you are missing one of the greatest at - work time - killers ever to pop up on your monitor .
There are two cameras , both on 24 hours a day , and a real - time chat room that crackles with activity .
And no wonder - there is always something to talk about .
Jackson 's camera has caught a man throwing himself into the side of a bus , apparently hoping to work an injury scam .
It did n't work .
The bus did n't stop .
Viewers have also watched fights , car chases and break - ins .
If it sounds like an idea that might attract a crowd , you 're right .
After clips were posted on YouTube , the original group of 50 viewers grew to more than 500,000 .
A dot -com company gave Jackson a high - resolution camera and Lefty O'Doul 's , the nearby restaurant , chipped in for a microphone .
Jackson got the new camera Monday and started the improved site Tuesday .
The results have been pretty dramatic .
In three days , adamsblock.com has had 80,000 views and 25,000 visitors , a remarkable 40 percent of whom live outside the United States .
On Friday , a woman from the United Kingdom joined the regulars in competing to see who could be first to identify the number stamped on the trunk of taxis that drive by .
" At any given time , " Jackson said , " there is an average of over 100 people in the chat room . "
Jackson is now hoping to parlay that interest to a fundraising effort for Glide Memorial .
Starting at noon on Dec. 13 , he will host a 24 - hour live Web fundraiser .
He 's hoping to pull in $ 5,000 to help fund Glide 's programs .
That 's all great , but there 's more to this .
With people watching at all hours of the day and night , some of them have watched crimes taking place .
Viewers picked up the phone and called 911 , and the police arrived in no time flat .
Last week Jackson stopped by a neighborhood bar a few blocks away and noticed something interesting .
" I saw a lot of the old regulars who used to be on my block , " he said .
" They 'd moved since I put the camera up . "
That 's not unexpected , said police Capt .
Gary Jimenez from the Tenderloin Station .
Take the vicious , gang - related shooting on Turk Street in August .
As soon as it happened , his officers went to local businesses and found " four cameras , all of them positively identifying the guy and his accomplices .
We caught him two blocks away . "
Of course , there was a city camera that also captured the scene .
" But we did n't get the tape for three days , " Jimenez said .
Jackson knows how effective the private cameras can be .
Late one night when three characters stood on his sidewalk yelling , " We 're going to shoot you , " Jackson knew he was on to something .
Now Jackson , who said his day job is as a social media consultant , is eager to take this to the next level .
He says if interested people in high - crime areas e-mail him ( adam@dailytechtalk.com ) , he will help set up a camera .
He only asks that the new sites split any advertising revenue with him .
Jackson envisions a network of cameras , tied together through a single Web site , so viewers can keep an eye on the streets at all hours .
Of course , that was the original idea behind the city 's cameras .
The problem is that they 've become so entangled in red tape that they are rarely effective .
Private operators , like Jackson , may be a real alternative .
What about those who say they are they an invasion of privacy ?
They will not get a sympathetic hearing from Jimenez .
" What 's the big deal ? " he said .
" We may have a thousand cameras in the Tenderloin .
You cannot walk down the street without being filmed .
If a few more people want to jump on this , I say God bless 'em . "
BLAMING KRISTOL FOR PALIN ….
There ’s been quite a bit of animosity of late between the McCain campaign and Bill Kristol .
This was n’t at all expected , given that Kristol has been a McCain cheerleader for years .
But the two are n’t getting along well this week at all .
Kristol wrote a column urging McCain to “ fire his campaign ” and “ start over . ”
A campaign spokesperson responded that Kristol had “ bought into the Obama campaign ’s party line . ”
Kristol fired back that the McCain campaign is composed of “ a bunch of nice young kids ” who are “ out there spinning implausibly . ”
The campaign responded once more , saying , “ [ I ] t ’s a good thing Bill Kristol has never run a political campaign because he ’d probably have to fire himself at least two or three times . ”
The ongoing animosity may have something to do with the McCain campaign blaming Kristol for one its biggest problems — picking Sarah Palin was his idea .
Harper ’s Scott Horton told Glenn Greenwald that McCain aides see Palin as a “ total disaster , ” and see Kristol as culpable .
“ We ’ve got a lot of finger - pointing going on within the camp , and I ’d say there ’s a pretty broad agreement amongst a number of the senior - most advisors to McCain that the Palin pick is worse than disappointing .
It ’s a total disaster , as one describes to me .
And there is a sort of blame game going on there . [… ]
“ I would say the anger and irritation between a number of the senior people in the McCain camp and Bill Kristol is become really acute … .
They view this man as the guy who gave them this albatross , Sarah Palin .
I think there ’s a lot of real anger about it .
There ’s also recognition that it ’s too late to do anything . ”
I ’m the last guy who would defend Kristol , and the campaign aides are certainly right to perceive Palin as humiliating , but this is n’t Kristol ’s fault .
Sure , he recommended Palin and vouched for her , but the McCain campaign thought it was wise to listen to Bill Kristol .
They ’ve made that mistake quite a few times , changing campaign strategy to match Kristol ’s advice .
It ’s failed every time .
Who ’s worse , the fool or the fools who listened to him ?
Wow .
In addition to raising important issues of temperament , this also raises health issues that people may not be thinking about .
My dad was a P.O.W. , and I remember when he got ill during my childhood , my mother quoted his doctor as saying that after going through that experience , he “ would n’t make old bones ” .
My dad passed away at 65 .
John McCain just turned 72 .
McCain has said that sometimes he makes rash decisions , and that sometimes they come back to bite him , but he always takes responsibility and lives with the consequences .
That ’s nice , but what happens when it ’s not just McCain , but the world that is asked to live with those consequences ?
There has been lots of discussion about John McCain ’s judgment in choosing Palin as a running mate .
To be honest , I am still amazed that Sarah Palin actually accepted this position in the first place , and what it says about her judgment .
I have mentioned before , that many Alaskans , including State Senate President Lyda Green ( a long time critic of Palin ) have questioned her qualifications to be governor .
“ She ’s in over her head ” was a common sentiment on the blog comments in the Anchorage Daily News well before the VP rumors began to swirl .
So , knowing that she was facing investigation , knowing that a significant chunk of Alaskans questioned if she was ‘ over her head ’ , knowing that the media is ruthless in its ‘ vetting ’ process of candidates , knowing that Alaska is facing some pretty big issues of its own ( new pipeline project ) , and knowing that every waking moment of her time will be spent trying to get up to speed while her family , her friends , and her town are put under a giant magnifying glass … she took it .
Knowing that she has 3 school age children , a pregnant unwed teen and a special needs infant that will need a tremendous amount of love and care , she took it .
Knowing that she ’d only been out of the country once , in 2007 , knowing that she held a journalism degree and has no foreign policy background or experience , and knowing that she ’d have to be on national television debating Joe Biden , she took it .
Knowing that historically , she has a statistical 1 in 3 chance of being the president of the United States by succession , not including the four bouts with skin cancer and the P.O.W. factor , she took it .
Would you have taken it ?
I ’m guessing that most of us would think , “ Are you kidding ?
No way ! ”
And we would be right , and prudent , and we would be putting our country first .
The mainstream media has finally woken up to the dangers of the government 's proposed Communications Data database – the detail of which openDemocracy published back in August As National Coordinator of NO2ID I suppose I should be grateful for small mercies .
But this hardly includes the thin sugar - coating on the Home Secretary 's speech last week when she described her promised ' consultation ' on the Communications Data Bill .
Hers was a transparent attempt to misdirect the argument .
The government says it wo n't be storing the content of your telephone or internet use , as if that makes it all right .
It is however proposing to record – for life – the details of everyone you call or write to and what websites you visit .
Do you want the State ( which in the UK means a large and growing number who can gain access to its systems ) to have a record of your religious and political interests , your sexual curiosities , your financial and medical worries , your wider ( or narrower ) concerns and your special relationships ; not to mention a trace of what it reckons ‘ you ’ have done on your computer even when it is done by someone else ?
You do n’t ?
But Jacqui Smith says they are only keeping this information " just in case " it ever become of interest to the authorities .
Were an individual to spy on you like this , it would be called stalking .
Which is a crime .
It is not a defence for a stalker to claim , “ I was only following her in case she fell over ” .
The action of continuous snooping is itself recognised in law as a wrongdoing .
Now we hear that the government is considering compulsory registration of all mobile phones .
Clearly , this is motivated by the same desire to monitor all communications data in yet a further extension of the stalker state .
Sometimes , quite often in fact , the government comes up with ideas that are not just very expensive and inefficient and – as with stalking – plain wrong .
In addition there are times when it is hard to imagine anything more designed to make matters worse .
This is a classic example .
Registering ownership of a mobile phone with your passport would work only on the compliant .
Organised criminals ( and terrorists ) would have a neat range of options open to them : they could use stolen phones , or buy phones second hand in private deals ; they could re-programme the International Mobile Equipment Identifier ( IMEI ) of the mobile phone handset , and maybe sell such a service to others ; they could forge or steal the ID required to buy the phones ; bully or deceive others into buying a phone for them ( or even just swap phones ) ; use a foreign phone , clone phones or corrupt the supply chain .
Compulsory registration not only wo n't seriously hinder criminals , it may actually assist them and will certainly create a profitable ‘ secondary ’ market in sub-prime , sliced up fraud .
Fraud is already enough of a problem with dodgy mobile phone shops or crooked employees getting access to your credit card or bank details , without any need to make it worse .
But worse it will become if as now proposed the government forces you to hand over your passport or ID card when you acquire a new blower .
Such a law will only fuel more copying , cloning and trafficking in personal data .
Fraudsters and organised criminals will be rubbing their hands with glee .
But , however much it may not work in defending us from crime , terrorism and identity - theft , the problem with arguing against these measures in this way is that it accepts the premise and appears to accept that they are being put forward in good faith .
It is a bit like arguing against torture on the grounds that it produces bad information .
The government ’s desire to track and record all digital traces of our lives is an assault on liberty .
It is a basic right – yes , a human right – to be free to call whoever you choose , to read , write and watch what you want in your browser without the State keeping tabs on you , and your friends and your connections .
The government is attacking our right to remain a private citizen .
Ah , but ' if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear ' comes the tired refrain … Wrong .
Dead wrong .
Privacy is necessary , many secrets are good .
Let 's just take a few examples – such as high - level negotiations in either the private or public sectors .
Under the proposed system of blanket surveillance , the government of the day may always gain an advantage in , say , pay negotiations or industrial disputes when it can easily identify which union leaders and officials are talking to each other away from the table .
The content of the call or e-mail is never the only useful information .
In many situations , simply knowing who is talking to who can provide the upper hand .
And what sort of deterrent to commercial investment in the UK will it be when directors realise that the British state apparatus is monitoring who they and their employees are calling , and when ?
Or will their communications be given a cosy exemption when the government belatedly wakes up to the fact that trampling on commercial confidentiality is bad for business .
And for campaigners like me and my colleagues , fighting against this or any future government ?
Or investigative journalists rooting out corruption within an establishment which will , of course , have back door access ?
Or a whole host of others whose safety depends on anonymity - are we to be forced into criminality in order to protect our sources and contacts , ourselves and our loved ones ?
You do n't have to agree with everything I 've said .
I certainly hope it wo n't come true .
But it could , if you simply put up with what the stalker state is trying to do .
Please write NOW to your MP expressing your disgust at this government 's move towards spying on its people continually , and ask what he or she intends to do about it .
( N.B . Please write in your own words - it is much more effective . )
When she compromised her own musical impulses by appearing at the Blue Angel in New York , Capitol Records decided to take a risk ; her first album for them , produced by Alan Livingstone , was released in 1950 .
The record was a hit and , wearing exotic clothes and jewellery , Yma Sumac played to packed houses at the Hollywood Bowl and New York ’s Hotel Pierre .
Her voice became so well known that she became the subject of impersonations by comediennes : Joan Turner would do three or four bars of a Simac number and then spit , and growl : “ Yma Tarmac - huh ! ’
Researchers at the University of Rochester have shown that the human brain — once thought to be a seriously flawed decision maker — is actually hard - wired to allow us to make the best decisions possible with the information we are given .
The findings are published in today 's issue of the journal Neuron .
Neuroscientists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky received a 2002 Nobel Prize for their 1979 research that argued humans rarely make rational decisions .
Since then , this has become conventional wisdom among cognition researchers
Contrary to Kahnneman and Tversky 's research , Alex Pouget , associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester , has shown that people do indeed make optimal decisions — but only when their unconscious brain makes the choice .
" A lot of the early work in this field was on conscious decision making , but most of the decisions you make are n't based on conscious reasoning , " says Pouget .
" You do n't consciously decide to stop at a red light or steer around an obstacle in the road .
Once we started looking at the decisions our brains make without our knowledge , we found that they almost always reach the right decision , given the information they had to work with . "
Pouget says that Kahneman 's approach was to tell a subject that there was a certain percent chance that one of two choices in a test was " right . "
This meant a person had to consciously compute the percentages to get a right answer — something few people could do accurately .
Pouget has been demonstrating for years that certain aspects of human cognition are carried out with surprising accuracy .
He has employed what he describes as a very simple unconscious - decision test .
A series of dots appears on a computer screen , most of which are moving in random directions .
A controlled number of these dots are purposely moving uniformly in the same direction , and the test subject simply has to say whether he believes those dots are moving to the left or right .
The longer the subject watches the dots , the more evidence he accumulates and the more sure he becomes of the dots ' motion .
Subjects in this test performed exactly as if their brains were subconsciously gathering information before reaching a confidence threshold , which was then reported to the conscious mind as a definite , sure answer .
The subjects , however , were never aware of the complex computations going on , instead they simply " realized " suddenly that the dots were moving in one direction or another .
The characteristics of the underlying computation fit with Pouget 's extensive earlier work that suggested the human brain is wired naturally to perform calculations of this kind .
" We 've been developing and strengthening this hypothesis for years — how the brain represents probability distributions , " says Pouget .
" We knew the results of this kind of test fit perfectly with our ideas , but we had to devise a way to see the neurons in action .
We wanted to see if , in fact , humans are really good decision makers after all , just not quite so good at doing it consciously .
Kahneman explicitly told his subjects what the chances were , but we let people 's unconscious mind work it out .
It 's weird , but people rarely make optimal decisions when they are told the percentages up front . "
Pouget analyzed the data from a test performed in the laboratory of Michael Shadlen , a professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Washington .
Shadlen 's team watched the activity of a pair of neurons that normally respond to the sight of things moving to the left or right .
For instance , when the test consisted of a few dots moving to the right within the jumble of other random dots , the neuron coding for " rightward movement " would occasionally fire .
As the test continued , the neuron would fire more and more frequently until it reached a certain threshold , triggering a flurry of activity in the brain and a response from the subject of " rightward . "
Pouget says a probabilistic decision - making system like this has several advantages .
The most important is that it allows us to reach a reasonable decision in a reasonable amount of time .
If we had to wait until we 're 99 percent sure before we make a decision , Pouget says , then we would waste time accumulating data unnecessarily .
If we only required a 51 percent certainty , then we might reach a decision before enough data has been collected .
Another main advantage is that when we finally reach a decision , we have a sense of how certain we are of it — say , 60 percent or 90 percent — depending on where the triggering threshold has been set .
Pouget is now investigating how the brain sets this threshold for each decision , since it does not appear to have the same threshold for each kind of question it encounters .

Ricordo la Treccani , come il nome di una delle più autorevoli enciclopedie che nella mia adolescenza erano anche sinonimo di un enorme quantità di tomi dal prezzo spropositato ( complessivamente l’Enciclopedia consta di 62 volumi , per un totale di 56.000 pagine con circa 50 milioni di parole , anche se quest ’ anno ha lanciato una edizione speciale in soli 3 volumi ) e stampata su carta speciale garantita 200 anni , che avrebbe dovuto contenere , nelle intenzioni forse troppo ambiziose dei suoi autori , tutto lo scibile dell ’umanità .
Non ho mai posseduto la Treccani e mai l’ho potuta consultare per le mie ricerche scolastiche , e sono quindi contento di constatare che finalmente potrò farlo ora che ha deciso di pubblicare gratuitamente sul web una porzione consistente dell ’ opera globale delle enciclopedie e dei dizionari Treccani .
Se , infatti , in passato il sito dell ’Enciclopedia Treccani era una semplice vetrina web , oggi tutti possono finalmente consultare liberamente oltre 160 mila lemmi .
E’ interessante notare , però , che il nuovo sito web 2.0 della Treccani , non mette solo online parte del suo vasto patrimonio enciclopedico , ma anche una serie di strumenti utili e interattivi , come widget , toolbar e feed rss per categoria , per farne un punto di riferimento del sapere in Rete , attorno al quale creare una sorta di social network della cultura italiana .
E’ infatti possibile , commentare le voci enciclopediche , segnalare contenuti per arricchire il patrimonio Treccani , inserire parole chiave ( tag ) utili a creare percorsi tematici e ricerche incrociate , e si potranno scaricare widget per consultare le risorse enciclopediche direttamente dal proprio sito .
Infine , è possibile anche creare un proprio profilo personale per salvare percorsi di navigazione e link utili , scambiarsi messaggi , intervenire in dibattiti , ricevere aggiornamenti e porre quesiti alla redazione .
Come nelle enciclopedie cartacee non mancano i riferimenti da una voce all ’altra , anche nel portale Treccani l’ipertestualizzazione è pervasiva : ogni parola dei lemmi delle enciclopedie e del vocabolario è un rimando , ogni rimando è un approfondimento .
Basta , infatti , come avviene avviene per il dizionario
De Mauro , fare un doppio click su una qualsiasi parola del testo e si verrà subito rimandati alla relativa voce del Vocabolario online o della Enciclopedia online .
Pensate che , la progettazione e l’avvio del portale hanno richiesto un investimento di meno di 500 mila euro per due anni di lavoro , e il coinvolgimento di sei persone dello staff che lavorano quotidianamente sul portale .
Niente male per un paese abituato a fare i conti con futuristici portali alla stregua di Italia .it , costato ben 45 milioni di euro !
Il fuggevole del Dizionario De Mauro
E se una nuova enciclopedia , pronta a collaborare o a sfidare Wikipedia , è nata , ecco che per un attimo la Rete ha tremato alla notizia che la famosa versione online del Dizionario italiano De Mauro Paravia , stava per sparire per fare posto , nell ’ homepage del sito , al Dizionario dei sinonimi e contrari De Mauro Paravia .
Infatti , come sarà noto a tutti , il De Mauro è l’unico dizionario italiano completo di tutti i lemmi , tanto da essere un riferimento web per moltissimi utenti Internet , da anni linkato da blog e siti per la sua comodità di utilizzo .
Certamente , esistono da tempo molte alternative , come il Vocabolario Treccani , il dizionario Garzanti ( accessibile , però , dietro registrazione ) , il nuovo ed internazionale Google Dictionary ( tanto da permettere di cercare il significato di una parola in circa 21 lingue , realizzando anche le corrispondenze tra una lingua e l’altra ) , e i collaborativi Dizionario Italiano e , forse più famoso , Wikizionario , ma tutti sono ancora troppo giovani per essere completi e diffusi sul web come il De Mauro .
Infatti , sulla sua scia , sono nati moltissimi plugin per le toolbar , estensioni per firefox , e barre di ricerca che interrogavano direttamente questo database , e da anni veniva linkato da moltissimi siti web .
Fortunatamente , si è scoperto che , almeno per ora , il dizionario italiano aveva solo cambiato indirizzo web .
Ora si trova su old .demauroparavia .it e grazie alla collaborazione del webmaster , tutte le richieste provenienti search plugin di Firefox e che puntavano al vecchio demauroparavia.it , ora vengono automaticamente rigirate su old.demauroparavia.it .
I benefici dei siti
Wiki che non potranno mai cessare di esistere
Insomma , per ora il pericolo è stato scongiurato , ma sicuramente è stato utile a molti , me compreso , ad aprire gli occhi sulla caducità delle informazioni su internet .
Se è vero che se una cosa c’è su internet è probabile che una sua traccia sarà disponibile per sempre , è anche vero che se sparisce un database enorme , come il De Mauro appunto , sarà ben difficile rimpiazzarlo in poco tempo con un altro di pari livello .
E’ per questo che progetti come il Wikizionario , e in generale , Wikipedia sono le migliori soluzioni per tutti , in quanto , proprio per la loro natura collaborativa e free , possono crescere costantemente nel tempo , migliorandosi e perfezionandosi , e possono essere liberamente replicate su qualsiasi sito o supporto .
Infatti , è possibile scaricare l’intero contenuto e struttura di Wikipedia ( un enorme dump XML del database ) , da http://static.wikipedia.org/downloads/

We can safely stop calling Star Wars a movie and recognize it for what it really is : a virulent media infection .
It 's a great movie to be sure , but there are many superior movies , and none of them have inspired , say , thousands of people to dress up as faceless , nameless secondary characters .
One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest was a great movie , but you do n't see 200 sanitarium orderlies marching in the Rose Parade .
Nowhere can you witness Star Wars ' contagious qualities more clearly than in the realm of fan - made videos that , to one extent or another , retell the story of Star Wars Episode IV : A New Hope , the movie formerly known simply as Star Wars .
Here are some of the best .

Modern computing gives the average middle - class American a level of graphical processing power that would have made a ' 70s - era special effects engineer pant continuously .
But that 's no fun !
Why render lifelike X - wing starfighters when you can build one out of cardboard and run around the park ?

Star Wars Remake
Balanced precariously on the line between impressive and ridiculous , this silent , late - '70s remake stars a micro-encephalic Darth Vader and a 10 - year - old Han Solo .
While not as self - consciously goofy as " Star Wars Sweded , " cardboard is still vitally important to the oeuvre .
They managed to recruit an impressive Mark Hamill " Luke - alike , " though .
Yes , I just made that pun right in front of you .

Lego Star Wars
The Lego Star Wars games are a couple of the best co-op games out there , especially to play with younger children or friends who are n't really into videogames .
As an added bonus , they 're chock - full of amusing cut scenes portrayed with the sort of mute humor that only plastic bricks can provide .
Even with the actual game parts removed , the resulting video is still fun to watch .

Star Wars in Three Minutes With Action Figures
I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who thought of trying to play out the entire Star Wars movie using the little action figures with the uncomfortable - looking embedded lightsabers as a kid .
So I find it satisfying that at least one person has made an all - figure reinterpretation of the movie .
Plus , it 's brief .
Lightsabers portrayed by : Glowing , computer - generated lines .
That 's actually kind of disappointing .
Star Wars Shortened
The George Lucas Appreciation Society – I 'm not sure if the fact that there are only three people in the society is supposed to be a backhanded slam – covers all three original movies in just less than 10 minutes .
Twice .

Star Wars in Thirty Seconds With Bunnies
You can't really argue with the fact that bunnies make things good .
For instance , any given piece of chocolate can be improved by being melted down and formed into a bunny shape .
So it 's natural that Star Wars with bunnies ( or , in some cases , aliens with bunny - ear implants ) is head - devouringly amusing .
Although Princess Leia 's tied - up little bunny ears look painful .

Star Wars Movie Mistakes
What better way to appreciate a classic film than by going through it bit by bit , nit - picking all the small errors ?
If you 're the sort of person who always notices when a movie character 's cigarette keeps changing length from shot to shot , you 'll enjoy this .
You 'll also enjoy it if you like seeing widescreen movies squashed into YouTube dimensions .

Store Wars
If you prefer your comedy served up with a side dish of heavy - handed social moralizing , this is the film for you .
All the characters are portrayed by veggies and other edibles fighting over the concept of organic food .

Thumb Wars
This little tribute combines comedy and nostalgia with intensely disturbing creepiness .
All the characters , most of the spaceships and many of the props are thumbs , but what makes this particularly notable are the little faces the filmmakers digitally superimpose on the thumbs .
The faces combine the eeriness of upside - down chin puppets with staring wide - eyed marionettes , creating creatures that would claw at the dream centers of my brain if they were n't , you know , thumbs .
Lightsabers portrayed by : You know , thumbs .
Star Wars According to a 3 Year Old
This is n't the shortest summary of Star Wars in this list , but it may capture the essence of the film better than anything else .
I think the sublime apex of the Star Wars experience lies in her description of what the nerdiest among us call The Battle of Yavin : " The big thing that blowed up stuff , we blowed it up together . "

Should " Joe the Plumber " be allowed to do plumbing work without all the requisite licenses and affiliations ?
What if he were calling himself an interior designer ?
A recent article in Regulation magazine discusses how many states are passing regulations on interior design .
I recently read Francis Schaeffer 's compelling A Christian Manifesto , and it argues that there are situations in which we have not just the right but the moral duty to disobey the state .
Let 's go ahead and take Romans 13 as the standard by which the state 's justice is measured , and assume for the sake of argument that states and state - like organizations are restricted to punishing evil and rewarding good .
Now let 's consider whether interior design regulations measure up .
Do regulations on interior design punish evil and reward good ?
Certainly not .
One justification for these regulations is that they prevent unscrupulous unlicensed designers from committing crimes against their unwitting customers — say , by recommending venetian blinds that do n't match the curtains — but this is similar to the punishment of " precrime " in the movie Minority Report .
In an imperfect world there will always be unscrupulous people doing unscrupulous things , but fraud and deceit are best handled by a sound legal system ( consisting of competing private courts ! ) than by entrenched bureaucracy .
So what is rewarded and punished in a regime where interior design is regulated ?
It 's actually the perverse opposite of what the state is enjoined to do in the Bible .
The state punishes those who do good ( those who provide services that customers are willing to pay for at a price they are willing to pay ) and rewards those who do evil ( those who use the coercive power of the state to prevent people from entering the marketplace and earning a living ) .
Schaeffer would argue that we do not only have a right but a moral duty to disobey such unjust laws .
And I 'm going to do that right now by making a couple of recommendations as an unlicensed " interior designer . "
I 'm a big fan of functionality in interior design , and my wife has a special gift for finding great , functional furniture at thrift stores and junk shops , which she can then paint to match the rest of our furniture .
Hence , our living room furniture is an eclectic mix of stuff we bought new ( our couch and our big comfy chair ) and stuff we got at thrift stores .
If you want to save money and live in a comfortable ambient environment , I recommend that you do the same .
We also have several paintings and prints hanging on the walls : one is a print that we won in a giveaway on a cruise ship ; the other was a wedding gift from my sister - in - law ( who studied art in college ) , and the other is an excellent painting that my wife ( untrained in painting , and unlicensed ! ) did .
All three match our decor and provide a nice balance in our living room and dining room .
Now let 's move on to the office .
We have a couple of pressed - wood desks from K - Mart ( one might actually be from Wal - Mart , but I do n't remember ) , a filing cabinet I picked up in grad school that Wash U would have thrown away ( reduce , reuse , recycle ! ) , a few bookcases ( one that we got from my parents , one that we got from a thrift store , one that was a wedding gift from my wife , and one that we found next to a dumpster when we lived in St. Louis ) , my wife 's sewing desk , and the most comfortable futon in the world ( bought from a friend in grad school ) .
So here are my interior design recommendations for people who want to live like economics professors : scour thrift stores and junk shops , keep an eye open for stuff people are throwing away , and go for " functional " rather than " cute . "
Suffice it to say that taking fashion or interior design advice from an economics professor is probably not a very good idea .
As my wife can no doubt tell you emphatically , interior design is absolutely not my comparative advantage ; ergo , it stands to reason that I would probably be smacked around by the invisible hand and then led to other employments if I tried to do this professionally .
You follow my unregulated advice at your own peril , and no government has the right to deny you that choice .
This introduces all sorts of thorny issues .
Once the regulatory ball gets rolling , when do we stop it ?
I'm a professor at a school in Tennessee and I wrote the first draft of this article from a friend 's finished basement in West Virginia — well appointed with memorabilia celebrating the Florida State Seminoles , the West Virginia Mountaineers , and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , I might add — for a research institute in Alabama .
I do n't want to open Pandora 's Box , here , but is n't this interstate commerce ?
Should n't there be a federal agency charged with regulating interstate trade in interior design tips ?
Where does it all end ?
There is no plausible economic justification for government regulation of interior design rather than private certification .
The idea that the state has the legitimate authority to tell people whether they can or cannot recommend shades of paint without a license is a moral absurdity .
Laws and regulations like these are not laws and regulations we have a duty to obey .
If anything , as Schaeffer might argue , we have a moral duty to disobey them .
Despite billions spent , weather satellites may not fly Red tape , overruns ground satellites
Billions spent on weather craft that may never make it to space
LOGAN , UTAH —
In the high - tech satellite business , where billions flow to wealthy firms headquartered in sleek metropolitan office parks , it seems unlikely that one of the world 's most sophisticated weather sensors would be built here , amid the craggy peaks of northern Utah .
Scientists say it has the power to predict tornadoes , enhance hurricane forecasts and help airlines save millions in expensive jet fuel , all by providing precise readings of the swirling winds and vapors that churn severe weather systems .
But instead of barreling through orbit more than 20,000 miles above Earth , this $ 100 million atmospheric camera , known as GIFTS , spent part of last summer tucked in the corner of a drab storeroom here , covered in tarp and blocking an emergency exit — a fact not overlooked by the local fire marshal , who ordered scientists to haul it someplace else .
For the sensor 's creators , it has been a humbling anticlimax : Despite seven years of development and testing , millions in taxpayer dollars , and support from think tanks and governments around the world , GIFTS may never fly in space .
Instead , it provides a vivid if complex example of how bureaucracy , budget cuts and broken promises have driven many of the government 's weather and climate satellites into costly and unprecedented decline .
According to congressional testimony and government officials and experts from around the world , the United States ' network of weather and climate satellites is declining so severely that it may soon start losing critical data that could help predict severe storms like Hurricanes Ike and Gustav .
In the multibillion dollar arena of U.S. climate science , the GIFTS project was relatively small .
But similar storylines have played out like bad sequels , as numerous satellites have been delayed , cancelled or held earthbound by cut budgets and cost overruns .
Some that provide crucial information continue to operate years longer than intended , threatening to fail at any time .
" It 's fair to say that the ( earth ) science situation is as bad as it's ever been in recent years , " said Rick Anthes , president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and co-chair of a government - sponsored study to determine the country 's earth science priorities .
" There are a lot of cheap words out there about how important science and technology are to the future of the U.S. , but we 're not getting the appropriations . "
Congress hears dark report
The struggle has played out largely behind the scenes , in the arcane worlds of research laboratories and congressional hearings .
At its center have been federal agencies such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which fund much of the nation 's climate science and weather research .
Records and interviews show that scientists and government officials have for years warned that cuts to research budgets at both agencies could imperil the nation 's satellite systems .
Congress and the Bush Administration have done little in response — a condition intensified by mounting federal debt and overruns in key programs .
" We 're looking at a bailout , the war in Iraq , and a deficit budget , " said Eric Barron , former dean of the University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences and now head of a Colorado - based climate research organization .
" If anything , I think the science community is a little more nervous . "
Testimony given to Congress by scientists has painted a dire picture .
A 2005 report by a government - commissioned panel of earth scientists warned Congress that the nation 's network of Earth - observing satellites was " at risk of collapse . "
In 2006 , the testimony of former astronaut and retired Marine Corps Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr. likened NASA 's attempts to adequately support its myriad directives to " trying to fit 15 pounds of stuff into a 5 - pound sack . "
A 2007 report sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that 40 percent of nation 's more than 100 climate sensors could go dark by 2010 — not enough to blind forecasters , but enough to weaken the data used by researchers who rely on history to gauge trends .
Climate researchers — the scientists working to figure what effect global warming may one day have on Gulf Coast hurricanes , for example — count on regular , uninterrupted satellite readings to gauge whether the environment is changing .
If a critical satellite fails , scientists will be left poorly prepared to predict events that could cause hurricanes and droughts .
Projects hit the wall
Many scientists agree that NASA , NOAA and other agencies are doing the best they can with the money they have been given , despite the costs and uncertainty of building cutting - edge satellite technology .
For example , the multibillion - dollar satellite system known as NPOESS has continued to progress , but some scientists worry that overruns on the project have forced NOAA to scale back other research programs , Barron and others said .
NPOESS and another large weather satellite project , GOES -R , will together cost more than $ 20 billion by some estimates .
And according to federal audits , both are already years behind schedule and billions over budget .
Another widely publicized project known as DSCOVR , was scrapped in 2006 despite more than $ 100 million being spent to develop it .
The satellite would have measured how well the Earth reflects the sun 's rays .
Its creator , Francisco Valero of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , said he blames political infighting for its demise .
" We take for granted that we can now know the weather four or five days in advance , " said retired National Weather Service Director Joe Friday , who now consults for the NPOESS program .
" If we do n't have those satellites , we 'd barely be back to understanding what the weather will do two or three days from now . "
NASA , which plays a leading role in building many of the country 's weather and climate satellites , has trimmed tens of millions from its earth science programs since at least 2004 , when the agency was charged with retiring the space shuttle and building a new set of space vehicles to return humans to the moon .
President George Bush agreed to supplement that effort with billions in new funding .
But the money never came .
After years of complaints by scientists and policymakers , Congress and the White House this fall enacted a bill that could boost NASA 's budget by about $ 3 billion next year , a significant increase for an agency with a current budget of $ 17 billion .
Still , the money may come too late to save some projects — among them , the star - crossed satellite known as GIFTS .
A 10 - year odyssey
GIFTS ' journey from state - of - the - art storm - tracker to warehouse fire hazard began nearly a decade ago , in universities and offices from Langley , Va. , to the sloping peaks of northeast Utah .
When it was approved in 1999 , the project was hailed as experimental but revolutionary .
The sensor was ambitious , but so was its price tag : more than $ 250 million , spread across four government agencies .
Foremost among the investors was NASA , which committed roughly $ 100 million .
The GIFTS sensor was a cutting - edge marriage of new technology with a sensing technique conceptualized more than 100 years ago .
The result would have been more rapid , detailed measurements of the environmental conditions that drive severe weather , leading to earlier warnings and more accurate forecasts .
The principal investigator of the project , Bill Smith , described the sensor as a " revolutionary " three - dimensional movie camera that would provide real - time data on wind , temperatures and vapors that could be fed into models that predict severe weather .
" It can see tornadoes forming a couple hours before you can even see them on radar , " he said last summer .
" It 's the first of its kind . "
The GIFTS instrument was widely seen as a tool that could advance modern weather science , perhaps becoming a fixture on future generations of weather satellites .
But before it could be launched , the program unraveled .
It started in 2002 , when the Navy , which had agreed to handle the satellite 's launch , pulled money from GIFTS in order to accelerate another satellite project , a spokesman said at the time .
With millions already invested , NASA began looking for partner agencies to shoulder the launch burden , which by some estimates exceeded the cost of the sensor itself .
They came close , but never close enough .
Several foreign governments , including Russia , expressed interest , as did the influential World Meteorological Organization , but nobody could put up enough money to get the satellite ready for space .
In 2005 , an independent panel of scientists testified to Congress that NASA and NOAA should invest in completing the project , but neither agency acted upon the recommendation .
Among the most decisive words Smith received from NASA came in 2006 , when he was forwarded a letter from space agency Administrator Michael Griffin to his counterparts in the Russian Federal Space Agency .
It read , in part : '' Due to funding constraints , NASA does not intend to complete a flight - qualified instrument . ''
So seven years after it began with so much promise and ambition , GIFTS was sealed in a nitrogen - filled capsule slightly smaller than a Volkswagen Beetle and placed in storage , where it has stayed as its creators have fought , so far in vain , to fly in space .
People often see patterns where none exist in an attempt to give structure and security to unpredictable situations , a new study on loss of control suggests .
People turn to superstitions , rituals and conspiracy theories as a way to deal with complex or chaotic circumstances , according to the study , published in the journal Science .
For instance , it found the study 's participants saw imaginary trends in the stock market in their attempt to control the situation , said University of Texas professor Jennifer Whitson , who conducted the study with Adam Galinsky , a professor at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill .
" What we found is that when people feel like there is a lack of control — that they are in a more volatile situation — they are more likely to form strong conclusions , even though there is no pattern between the data they see and the companies they evaluate , " Whitson said .
Although the participants were given the same ratio of positive to negative information about the different companies , those who lacked control chose to invest in companies that did not warrant it , she said .
People often trick themselves into seeing and believing connections that simply do n't exist to create order , she said .
The less control people have over their lives , the most likely they are to try to regain control through mental gymnastics , Galinsky said .
Feelings of control are so important to people that a lack of control is inherently threatening , he said .
Although some misperceptions can be bad or lead a person astray , they 're extremely common and most likely satisfy a deep and enduring psychological need , he said .
The psychological need is for control and the ability to minimize uncertainty , Whitson said .

The post More beautiful fold zipping showed a formulation of left - fold zipping , simplified from the ideas in Max Rabkin ’s Beautiful folding .
I claimed that the semantic functions are the inevitable ( natural ) ones in that they preserve zipping stucture .
This post gives the promised proofs .
The correctness of fold zipping can be expressed as follows .
Is cfoldl a Zip morphism , and is cfoldl ' a Zip ' morphism ?
( See More beautiful fold zipping for definitions of these functions and classes , and see Simplifying semantics with type class morphisms for the notion of type class morphisms . )
Non-strict
The non -strict version is simpler , though less useful .
We want to prove
cfoldl ( f `zip` f ' ) == cfoldl f `zip` cfoldl f '
First , substitute the definition of zip for functions .
instance Zip ( (-> ) u ) where zip = lift A2 ( , )
This definition is a standard one for zipping applicative functors .
Given the Applicative instance for functions , this Zip instance is equivalent to
instance Zip ( (-> ) u ) where r `zip` s = u -> ( r u , s u )
So the Zip morphism property becomes
cfoldl ( f `zip` f ' ) bs == ( cfoldl f bs , cfoldl f ' bs )
We ’ll want some structure to our folds as well :
cfoldl ( F op e `zip` F op ' e' ) bs == ( cfoldl ( F op e ) bs , cfoldl ( F op ' e' ) bs )
Simplify the LHS :
cfoldl ( F op e `zip` F op ' e' ) bs == {-
Fold zip def -} cfoldl ( F op ' ' ( e , e ' ) ) bs where ( a , a ' ) `op ' '` b = ( a `op` b , a ' `op '` b ) == {- cfoldl def -} foldl op ' ' ( e , e ' ) bs where ( a , a ' ) `op ' '` b = ( a `op` b , a ' `op '` b)
Then simplify the RHS :
( cfoldl ( F op e ) bs , cfoldl ( F op ' e' ) bs ) == {- cfoldl def -} ( foldl op e bs , foldl op ' e' bs )
So the morphism law becomes
foldl op '' ( e , e ' ) bs == ( foldl op e bs , foldl op ' e' bs ) where ( a , a ' ) `op ' '` b = ( a `op` b , a ' `op '` b)
We ’ll prove this form inductively in the list bs , using the definition of foldl :
foldl :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a foldl op a [ ] = a foldl op a ( b: bs ) = foldl op ( a `op` b ) bs
First , empty lists .
foldl op '' ( e , e ' ) [ ] where op '' = ... == {- foldl def -} ( e , e ' ) == {- foldl def , twice -} ( foldl op e [ ] , foldl op ' e' [ ] )
Next , non-empty lists .
foldl op '' ( e , e ' ) ( b: bs ) where op ' ' = ... == {- foldl def - } foldl op '' ( ( e , e ' ) `op ' '` b ) bs where op '' = ... == {- op '' definition -} foldl op '' ( e `op` b , e ' `op '` b ) bs where op '' = ... == {- induction hypothesis -} ( foldl op ( e `op` b ) bs , foldl op ' ( e ' `op '` b ) bs ) == {- foldl def , twice -} ( foldl op e ( b : bs ) , foldl op ' e' ( b : bs ) )
Strict
The morphism law :
cfoldl ' ( f `zip '` f ' ) == cfoldl ' f `zip '` cfoldl ' f '
which simplifies to
foldl ' op '' ( P e e ' ) bs == P ( foldl ' op e bs ) ( foldl ' op ' e' bs ) where P a a ' `op ' '` b = P ( a `op` b ) ( a ' `op '` b)
This property can be proved similarly to the non-strict version .
The new aspect is manipulating the use of seq .
Again , use induction on lists , guided by the fold definition :
foldl ' :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a foldl ' op a [ ] = a foldl ' op a ( b: bs ) = let a ' = a `op` b in a ' `seq` foldl ' f a' bs
First , empty lists .
foldl op '' ( P e e ' ) [ ] where op '' = ... == {- foldl def -} P e e ' == {- foldl def , twice -} P ( foldl op e [ ] ) ( foldl op ' e' [ ] )
Next , non-empty lists .
For simplicity , I ’ll inline the let in the definition of foldl ' ( which affects performance but not meaning ) :
foldl ' op '' ( P e e ' ) ( b: bs ) where op '' = ... == {- foldl ' def -} ( ( P e e ' ) `op ''` b) `seq` foldl ' op '' ( ( P e e ' ) `op ''` b ) bs where op '' = ... == {- op '' definition -} P ( e `op` b ) ( e ' `op '` b) `seq` foldl ' op '' ( P ( e `op` b ) ( e ' `op '` b ) ) bs == {- induction hypothesis -} P ( e `op` b ) ( e ' `op '` b ) `seq` P ( foldl ' op ( e `op` b ) bs ) ( foldl ' op ' ( e ' `op` b ) bs ) == {- P strictness -} P ( e `op` b ) ( e ' `op '` b ) `seq` P ( ( e `op` b ) `seq` foldl ' op ( e `op` b ) bs ) ( ( e ' `op` b ) `seq` foldl ' op ' ( e ' `op` b ) bs ) == {- foldl ' def , twice -} P ( foldl ' op e ( b : bs ) ) ( foldl ' op ' e' ( b : bs ) )
That ’s it .

Consumer Internet Predictions for 2009 December 11 , 2008
Posted by jeremyliew in 2009
For the last two years I ’ve been making predictions about the consumer internet , and this year is no exception .
First let ’s take a look at how I did on last years predictions :
1. Social Media advertising , Online Video advertising and In - Game advertising start to become scalable .
Grade : B- .
We ’re seeing much greater scale on social media and online video advertising , with a standard emerging for online video , and movement towards a standard for social networks .
In - game saw some progress but not as much .
2. Structured web emerges .
Grade : C. Notwithstanding the Powerset acquisition , the structured / semantic web has n’t been a real theme for 2008 .
3. Games 2.0
Grade : A . This year was a breakout year for social networking games , web based games and free to play games .
I see this growth driving several of next years predictions as well , as you ’ll see below .
Now on to new predictions .
Note that the remainder of this article is cross posted at the Wall Street Journal .
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Last year , consumer Internet startups sprung up left and right , looking for U.S. traffic growth and relying on the robust growth of the advertising market to make money .
We enter 2009 looking down the barrel of a recession .
In this environment , I predict the following trends for consumer Internet companies :
1. Consumers seek cheap thrills
Even in a recession , people will still want to be entertained .
The Great Depression saw resilience and even growth in movie ticket sales as one of the cheapest ways for people to entertain themselves .
As this economy tightens through 2009 , we ’ll find growing numbers of “ time rich - cash poor ” consumers seeking today ’s lowest cost methods to entertain themselves .
In general , this will benefit two categories of consumer Internet companies .
First , social media and social networks .
These are free and endlessly entertaining .
As mainstream media companies cut costs , the relative value and quality of user generated content increases .
MySpace , YouTube and Facebook all rank in the top 10 Web sites by aggregate time spent according to comScore .
The most popular applications on Facebook and MySpace are all games , entertainment and lightweight communication , and these can provide endless hours of entertainment for users .
It is n’t just Facebook and MySpace that will benefit though .
Smaller social media sites that have built enough of a critical mass to have a self sustaining community will also see growing usage over the next year .
Second , games .
Games are one of the most cost effective means of entertainment available .
While a $ 10 movie ticket can provide 90 minutes of entertainment , a $ 60 computer game can easily provide 50 - 100 hours of entertainment .
Free - to - play web based games make this math even more compelling , whether they be casual game portals like Pogo , virtual worlds like Gaia or massively multiplayer games like Runescape .
The Web site with the highest amount of time spent per visitor in October was Pogo.com with 444 minutes / visitor .
Number two was Yahoo , with just 291 minutes / visitor in the same period .
Games in general , and free games in particular , can provide a lot of cheap thrills .
2 . Trading real money for virtual goods
In Asia people have been paying real money for virtual goods for years .
It is the primary business model for games and Internet companies in China and Korea , far more important that advertising .
We ’re starting to see similar behavior in the U.S. , also led here by online games and social networks .
On the back of the rise of social networks and games , 2009 will be the first real breakout year for this business model in the US .
To people who do not spend time on social networks , it seems crazy that people would pay real money to buy each other virtual gifts – pictures of things ranging from birthday cakes to hugging penguins – and then display them on their profile pages .
But estimates peg Facebook ’s digital gifts sales in the $ 35 million – 50 million range this year .
As more human interaction moves online , these social tokens of appreciation move online in parallel .
In the same way , gamers are more than willing to buy virtual goods
In 2007 , Nexon made $ 30 million selling virtual goods to U.S. players of their games .
These items either allow players extra powers in the game ( e.g a bigger gun ) , or allow players to customize the way that their character looks ( e.g. cool sunglasses ) .
People want to win , and they want to look good doing it .
Dozens of other games companies are now employing this model in the U.S .
Why would this recession be a time for virtual goods to take off in the U.S. ?
It actually has nothing to do with the economy , Rather , two new payment mechanisms are becoming available now that allow gamers , many young and without credit cards , to play these games to their full capacity .
The first is that prepaid game cards are now being sold at retail , with Target leading the charge .
The second is incentive marketing .
If a player take an action ( like signing up for a ring tone service , or completing a survey ) the advertiser who benefits will fund the purchase of that players desired virtual goods .
One virtual world company , Gaia , used to have three full time employees who did nothing but open envelopes of cash that their teen and ‘ tween players sent them to buy virtual goods .
Since rolling out their new payment mechanisms , their revenues have doubled and they no longer have to open envelopes full of pocket money .
Asia and Europe have led the US in the adoption of free to play games because they have had good alternative payment mechanisms in place for longer , including mobile payments and credits available for sale at internet cafes .
Now the U.S. is ready to catch up .
3 . Web 2.0 leaders pull further away from the pack
In a recession , when advertising budgets are cut , there is a flight to quality among advertisers .
Size and “ brand name ” are good proxies for quality .
Advertisers will want to buy advertising on big , well known websites .
The big online media companies like Yahoo and AOL will benefit from this .
However , they are already so big that they cannot escape the overall shrinkage of ad budgets .
On the other hand , many Web 2.0 companies , like Facebook and Digg , have build large user bases but have not yet built out their capacity to monetize their traffic .
These companies will see the benefit of the advertiser flight to quality .
However , as they are only now building out their sales forces , they will likely continue to see strong revenue growth in 2009 .
4 . Online ad prices continue to fall , alternatives help make up some of the ground
The Internet advertising market , like all markets , responds to changes in supply and demand .
In the current recession , demand for advertising is likely to decrease .
At the same time , supply of online inventory , page views , is continuing to increase .
Social networks and other social media sites in particular are creating masses of new inventory .
As a result , the price of online advertising will continue to fall in 2009 .
Targeting may mitigate some of this fall .
Better targeting is steadily improving the effectiveness of direct response advertising ( the equivalent of TV infomercials ) .
This targeting takes many forms , but all have demonstrated an ability to lift conversion rates over “ run of network ” advertising .
As targeting technology improves , and as the data that publishers and networks collect about users increases in quantity and quality , we will see a better ability to match the right ad to the right person , and charge more for that ad .
5. Getting serious about monetizing non U.S. traffic
The U.S. led the way on the internet , and for a long time the U.S. dominated overall Internet usage .
In the past couple of years this situation has changed .
China passed the U.S. as the country with the most internet users this year .
Top sites like Yahoo , MSN , Facebook and MySpace all have more users internationally than in the US .
Serving an international user costs the same as serving a U.S. user , but making money from an international user is much harder .
In 2009 , I expect Internet companies to get serious about making money from their international traffic .
The US market represents about half of all online advertising , which is partly what makes monetizing international traffic so difficult .
Building up direct ad sales teams ( and networks ) internationally will partially help to bridge the gap , but this will not be enough .
As noted previously , in Asia direct monetization models ( i.e. selling things directly to users ) have proven to be a better business model than advertising .
U.S. companies will need to understand and embrace the direct monetization models that have worked well overseas , principally mobile monetization , premium subscriptions models and digital goods models based on selling greater functionality , scarcity or status .
Silver linings to dark clouds
These trends will benefit some internet companies but disadvantage others .
I hope that your company finds the right way to navigate these shifting shoals .
Let me know if you agree or disagree with these predictions , or if there are other trends that you think I ’ve missed .
Did you know , when you eat cookies , that you are , more than likely , eating palm oil ?
No ?
You probably did n’t .
Most people do n’t , so do n’t beat yourself up about it .
Unfortunately , palm oil is bad news â€ “ both for you and for orangutans all the way over in Indonesia .
It harms your health , the animals , and the environment , all at the same time .
According to many reports , orangutans are ‘ dying for cookies , ’ and not in the way sugar - starved dieters do .
They ’re literally dying because the palm oil plantations that are needed to make cookies , biofuel and other products that contain the oil are destroying the Indonesia and other areas that the orangutans call home .
Crackers , cereals , pastries , and microwave popcorn are all guilty , as are companies like Oreo , Pepperidge Farm , Keebler , Mrs. Fields and many others .
One of the sneaky ways that palm oil shows up in foods is by making you feel better in other ways .
You see your favorite snack food there on the shelf .
In big , bold letters it proclaims that it now has 0 grams of trans fat !
You feel better about eating it , but have you ever looked to see what else might have changed ?
If the trans fat went away , what else moved in to take its place ?
Palm oil , which is saturated fat , which is basically just as bad for you , especially in large amounts .
About sixty percent of the palm oil in the world is produced by Malaysia .
This is important , because Malaysia does n’t like the United States telling people that palm oil is bad for them .
The country does n’t want it listed as a saturated fat anymore .
They think it ’s being ‘ lumped in ’ with other oils that are worse to eat and being unfairly treated , mostly by the soybean growers .
While palm oil may have its place in some foods and other items , the majority of it is only there because of the push to remove unhealthy trans fat from many staples of the average American diet .
However , since palm oil is actually not really any healthier , there is nothing being gained by people who eat it and everything being lost by the animals and plants that formerly lived where clearing is taking place to build palm oil processing and harvesting facilities .
A lot of orangutans are feeling the pain of the way that industry is changing and the demands that are being placed on the individuals who must provide palm oil and other items for human needs .
There are Websites where people can donate to the cause of these poor animals and where they can stay updated on the continued efforts to ensure that no more orangutans are harmed and there is no further destruction of the environment .
Palm oil is found in most margarine , shortening , potato chips , cooking oil , soups , sauces , crackers , baked goods , and confectionery products as well as biofuel , lubricants , detergents , soaps , and cosmetics including lipstick , makeup remover , body lotion , and sun cream .
Most people do n’t realize how much palm oil they use or ingest over the course of their lifetimes and how unhealthy it is for all involved .
There are some places in the world where elephants are being used for slave labor on palm oil plantations .
If they are not needed for that , they are simply killed because they are in the way of progress .
By 2020 , it is believed that the need for palm oil will double and that means that 1,160 square miles of new crops will have to be planted â€ “ and land will have to be cleared and habitats destroyed to do this .
So many rainforests are being destroyed , and the chief reason for that is economics .
People want the items that palm oil is used in and for , so there is a strong market for the substance .
This desire to make money is clearly going to supersede any concerns that these companies have about the environment or the people who purchase their products .

In the same way that DVD region - coding has no place in this , the age of Amazon , eBay and unlocked players , television broadcasters have no business trying to restrict their content on the web .
I can illustrate from my own experience with two examples of how they ’ve tried and failed :
1. Crossing Streams – I do a lot of my morning newsgathering courtesy of reddit.com , an awesome social bookmarking site run by the good folks at WIRED .
Often there ’s a link to a poignant Daily Show clip from the night before .
But because I live in Canada , when I click through to see the video — or even to their home page for that matter — I get redirected from Comedy Central in the US and A to The Comedy Network in Cana - duh .
If you ’re also reading this from north of the 49th parallel try it for yourself and see what I mean .
So what ’s the big deal , you ask ?
The very same Daily Show clips are available on both sites , after all …
Well , why exactly is this even necessary in the first place ?
If ComedyCentral.com is smart enough to figure out that I ’m from Canada , surely it can be programmed to include IP addresses from this country as well .
Could it be that there is country - specific advertising that these two networks want to alternately block or force me to see ?
Wow , that sounds familiar …
Kind of like television !
Thing is , the internet has this thing called a proxy server , where a site can be fooled into thinking a user is from somewhere else , and for those pesky ads Firefox has a plugin called AdBlock Plus .
Half - time score : Internet 1 , Broadcasters 0 .
2. iFailer – BBC ’s much - lauded iPlayer was launched on Christmas Day , 2007 to bring the Beeb ’s vast catalogue of programming ” to a mass , mainstream audience . ”
But while streaming radio is offered worldwide , on - demand video is currently UK only , despite most of the very same programming being available on BBC America , BBC Canada and another 20 or so channels around the world .
I have a personal interest in the iPlayer because of a just - announced client for S60 smartphones , but even though my handset gets me online anywhere in the world , you guessed it — the mobile version of iPlayer only works in the original Nanny State .
Of course , I could easily get around this with a Slingbox hooked up to my TV and a mobile client on my handset — not only is it entirely legal , but I can watch any channel I want from anywhere in the world !
Final tally : Internet 2 , Broadcasters 0 .
Let me be perfectly clear on this : Broadcasters , do not mess with our internet ; you will fail .
It ’s called the World Wide Web for a reason — if you ’re not willing to show whatever it is that you ’re shilling to a global audience then please get the fuck off and leave us alone .
Thank - you .
The Obama bandwagon is moving fast and furious , rolling over the few remaining pockets of dissent even as it prepares to take power .
The mainstream media , particularly on television , has lost all sense of objectivity and proportion , and their reporting of the president - elect ’s doings has taken on a distinctly Soviet air .
" Our Glorious Leader Picks the White House Dog " is the emblematic headline of a servile fourth estate .
The political atmosphere is positively eerie : amid calls for " unity " and attacks on " toxic " language that is " divisive , " there is an odd uniformity of thought similar to the virtual unanimity that gripped the nation in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Groupthink is all the rage , and the media has joined in the fun .
Due to this love - fest , they ’re oblivious to the warning signs that worry us few and scattered skeptics .
They somehow missed the Dear Leader ’s call for a civilian " national security force , " for example , one that is " just as well - funded " and " just as powerful " as the U.S. military .
Media Matters for America , which is shaping up rather nicely as Obama ’s semi-official media shill , claims Obama ’s remarks were just about expanding the already existing Americorps program and the president - elect was taken out of context .
Yet his words speak for themselves , as do the words of his recently chosen chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , who declared in his book :
" It ’s time for a real PATRIOT Act that brings out the patriot in all of us .
We propose universal civilian service for every young American .
Under this plan , All Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five will be asked to serve their country by going through three months of basic training , civil defense preparation , and community service . "
Some Republicans , Rahm brays , " will squeal about individual freedom . "
Well , let ’s hope that part is n’t true .
Because if it ’s only Republicans who object to this militaristic scheme to solve the unemployment problem by outfitting the out - of - work with spiffy new uniforms , then we ’re really in a lot more trouble than even I imagined .
If George W. Bush and / or John McCain had called for the creation of a domestic paramilitary force , the liberals and certainly the Left would have seen it as an ominous development , with the more excitable types raising the specter of fascism .
Is it left to good old Joe Farah alone to point out the dangers inherent in such a far out proposal ?
" If we ’re going to create some kind of national force as big , powerful , and well - funded as our combined U.S. military forces , is n’t this rather a big deal ?
I thought Democrats generally believed the U.S. spent too much on the military .
How is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the Navy , Army , Marines , and Air Force put together ?
Is Obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that ?
If not , why did he say it ?
What did he mean ? "
We ’ll soon find out what he meant , perhaps a lot sooner than any of us would like .
The pool of unemployed young males is growing larger by the week  always a dangerous development for our rulers  and it ’s a matter of some urgency for the incoming administration .
The Obama - Emanuel plan would , in effect , militarize labor short of actually going to war .
How else to sop up this deepening pool of idleness and inevitable social and political unrest ?
Either draft them into the army or jail them , whichever comes first .
Militarism has infected American life to an enormous degree : that ’s one of the consequences of 9/11 we ’re still living with , although in the Age of Obama it will be given a leftish gloss .
The " battle " for economic recovery will be framed in military terms , as , amid calls for " national unity , " a cult of personality forms around a charismatic leader .
With government even more bloated with power and self - regard than ever before , this is a dangerous moment in our history , one that could easily see the country fall prey , once again , to the hubris of " idealists . "
And do n’t forget we ’re still engaged in two foreign wars .
Obama ’s battlefields of choice are Afghanistan and the wilds of Waziristan , instead of boring old Iraq  which is , at any rate , just about played out as an effective narrative in the ongoing story of our eternal " war on terrorism . "
Prepare yourself .
From now on we ’ll be hearing the Obama - ites hailing the " surge " on the Afghan front , amid renewed vows to catch the long - gone Osama bin Laden and support the precarious authority of Afghan President Hamid Karzai  the best dressed and least powerful ruler in the region .
Popularly known as the mayor of Kabul , since his domain seems not to extend beyond the boundaries of his capital city , Karzai is a pathetic and tragic figure , whose task of keeping order in a country that has never known it is positively Sisyphean .
He has been gaining some political traction and even a degree of credibility lately by openly imploring Obama to cut out the NATO bombing that is " mistakenly " slaughtering scores of civilians on what seems like a daily basis .
Obama ’s promise to escalate the war on that front is likely to ratchet up tensions within NATO as well as with our Afghan ally .
If Iraq was and is a quagmire , then Afghanistan is a boneyard that  if the fate of would - be conquerors over the years is any indication  we ’ll soon find ourselves buried in .
The British tried and failed , as did the Russians , who , it could be argued , spent the last energies of their fading power trying to incorporate the Afghans into the Soviet empire .
I hate to tell the Obama cult this , but no , we ca n’t  and we should n’t even try .
Obama has n’t even taken office yet , and already he ’s announcing an " international effort " to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , their pursuit of which , according to our own CIA , has long since been dropped .
If this is the Obama style of diplomacy , then the value of those much - touted " negotiations " with the Iranians , the Syrians , etc. , which we were promised during the campaign will be questionable at best .
The United States is on the wrong course in so many ways that it will take a gargantuan effort to turn the ship of state around .
Yet it can be done  but only if the advocates of a new foreign policy for America stay focused .
This means avoiding the trap of partisan politics and keeping our powder dry , staying ever vigilant against the schemes of a War Party that never sleeps .
Antiwar.com is your eyes and ears : we sift through rumors of war so that you do n’t have to .
We keep watch on the enemies of peace , so that you ’re forewarned and forearmed .
That ’s why the survival of Antiwar.com is so essential , and , I fear our continued survival is indeed at stake .
It ’s a combination of two major factors that has me very worried : the economic downturn and the Obama victory .
Complacency and poverty are the two big reasons why we ’re well behind in our current fundraising campaign .
Our usual donors are either broke  the average donation is $ 50  or else convinced that getting rid of Bush / McCain means the Eternal War is over and done with .
As Obama has himself made all too clear , however , this is very far from the truth .
But I am afraid it will be quite some time before this impresses itself upon many of our regular readers .
That is why I ’ve emphasized the dangers over the opportunities posed by the new administration .
There are opportunities aplenty , but these require a reasonably well - informed and focused antiwar constituency .
Which is precisely what Antiwar.com has spent the last decade - plus assiduously cultivating and growing .
It would be a shame if it all foundered on the rocks of the Second Great Depression and sank beneath the frenzied wave of Obama - mania .
Yet that ’s precisely what will happen unless we make our modest fundraising goal this winter .
I appeal to my readers , both longtime regulars and occasional visitors , to consider the value of this Web site and the service it performs .
We report what ’s happening in the world , and the War Party ’s connections to most of the bad news , without fear or partisan favor .
I have received a lot of letters about my recent columns criticizing Obama , one of which went to far as to state : " Forget the honeymoon ?
Forget any future donations to Antiwar.com . "
Well , then , so be it .
Those kinds of people were never the base of our support , and they are n’t now .
At any rate , we ca n’t help being what we are  and we ’re ready to take the consequences for not toeing some party line .
Antiwar.com will criticize the new administration when and where it merits it , and praise them when they ’ve earned it  no more , no less .
Sure , we ’ll give them a chance .
But Obama ’s appointments in the national security realm are vitally important , and indicative of the general approach this White House will take to the issue of war and peace .
The likely continuation of the Gates regime at the Pentagon and the Emanuel appointment do not bode well for the future .
( This is not to even mention the baleful influence of the enthusiastic interventionist Joe Biden . )
Do n’t fall for the audacity of hype  and remember that yes we can dissent in the age of Obama , though to what extent depends entirely on him .
This is not the time to let down our guard .
Indeed , it is time to reenergize a peace movement that has been woefully ineffective , lo these many years , in large part because it had no hope of swaying the White House and a thoroughly passive Congress .
This time around , however , the situation is quite different : we can pressure Obama to do the right thing .
But that ’s only if we know what the right thing is .
Information is power , and that ’s what we have to offer you here , in abundance .
So , please , make your contribution to Antiwar.com today  because you know you ’re gonna need us tomorrow .
ATHENS , Greece ( CNN ) --
Authorities vowed to re-impose order after demonstrators rose up across Greece Monday in a third day of rioting over Saturday 's killing of a 15 - year - old boy that has left dozens injured and scores of properties destroyed .
" Under no circumstances will the government accept what is occurring , " said Greek Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos .
" We will do what is necessary . "
It was unclear what would be necessary to placate the demonstrators .
" We 've just lost count of how many demonstrations are taking place now , " a police spokesman in Athens told CNN .
Police said 34 civilians and 16 police officers were injured Monday in rioting that spread into new municipalities , including Trikala , Larissam and Veria .
Riots broke out Saturday in Thessaloniki and Athens , where police killed the teen .

Demonstrators had torched three government buildings and three offices of the ruling conservative political party in downtown Athens , a National Fire Brigade spokesman told Greek state television .

Thirty - five cars and 160 trash containers also had been set ablaze , he said .

Demonstrators Monday barricaded streets in Athens and Thessaloniki and hurled gasoline bombs as they battled with police .
Clouds of tear gas hung over the capital city as riot police continued to battle the hundreds of young self - styled anarchists rioting over the boy 's death .
" Rage is what I feel for what has happened , rage , and that this cop who did it must see what it is to kill a kid and to destroy a life , " a student in Athens told reporters Monday .

In a nationally televised address broadcast on state television , Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis condemned the violence and promised to punish those responsible for Saturday 's shooting .
He also announced a decision to drop plans to reimburse business owners affected by the rioting .
The police officer who fired the fatal shot has been charged with " manslaughter with intent " and suspended from duty , police said , adding that a second police officer was arrested Saturday on criminal accessory charges .
Government officials have condemned the shooting .
" An investigation is under way and those found responsible will be punished , " said Pavlopoulos .
" Measures will also be taken to avoid such incidents again in the future . "

On Monday , authorities conducted an autopsy on the teenage boy in an effort to answer questions about the circumstances of the shooting , but the boy 's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings , the Athens coroner told CNN .
The U.S. and British embassies issued warnings to employees and tourists on Sunday , instructing them to avoid downtown Athens and other major cities until rioting subsides .
Tourists in central
Athens hotels were advised by hotel staff not to leave their rooms as police fanned out across the city .
" There are lots of burning bins and debris in the street and a huge amount of tear gas in the air , which we got choked with on the way back to our hotel , " according to Joel Brown , a CNN senior press officer visiting Athens on Sunday .
A police statement about the teenage boy 's death said the incident started when six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones .
The teen was shot as he tried to throw a petrol bomb at the officers , police said .
Other angry teens converged on the site almost immediately .
Fighting between youths and police erupted elsewhere , including Thessaloniki , the country 's second - largest city .
Hundreds of young people took to the streets of the sprawling port city , finally barricading themselves behind the gates of a state university .
Authorities have been barred from entering university grounds since tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta .
It was not clear what authorities would do about the demonstrators still holed up at the university .
No deaths have been reported since Saturday .
Police said Monday that 20 protesters had been rounded up for questioning .
Journalist Anthee Carassava in Athens contributed to this report .

Aquaholic drinks himself to death by gorging on a hosepipe
Andrew Else drank so much water from a garden hose that his heart failed
The brother of a mentally disturbed man who drank himself to death by gorging on a hosepipe yesterday criticised the care home looking after him .
Stephen Else , 54 , said his autistic brother Andrew - an ' aquaholic ' who had been addicted to drinking water for 30 years - should never have been left alone near free - flowing water .
Mr Else , 54 , from Milton Keynes , told his brother 's inquest : ' The water drinking had been a problem for years .
I am concerned about the access he had to the hosepipe .
' Here is something with which it is easy to drink a large quantity of water very quickly .
Andrew was obviously drinking from it , but no one took the decision to turn it off . '
The inquest at Newbury town hall in Berkshire heard how Andrew Else , 51 , developed the condition after suffering stomach pains in his 20s .
He would often go to extreme lengths to satisfy his craving , regularly drinking from bathroom taps .
Although staff at the Voyage centre in Theale near Reading were told to monitor him after he was spotted drinking from the hosepipe on May 25 , he was later found drenched and lifeless .
Patima Silima , deputy manager of the Voyage centre in Theale , near Reading , Berks , told the inquest that her staff had done all they could to monitor Mr Else 's behaviour on the day he died .
She said : ' I spotted him drinking water from the hosepipe in the garden at around 5 pm , so I told the staff to monitor him .
' A little later I looked out into the garden and saw him trying to turn the hosepipe tap off .
His jumper and knees were wet , so for me it was clear he had been drinking again .
' We brought him indoors and gave him some medication to calm him down and he seemed to be fine . '
But Mrs Silima told the hearing that she was called into the garden at 8.15 pm to find Mr Else collapsed on the ground .
She added : ' His lips had changed colour and he was cold . '
Pathologist Dr Colin McCormick said Mr Else had died from over - consumption of water which had diluted the levels of sodium in his blood , causing heart failure
Toxicology tests also found he had died from water intoxication - a condition known as hyponatraemia - after drinking several litres .
Mrs Silima added : ' Andrew was always trying to get the water .
We gave him lots of tea and drinks like everyone else but it was a big problem . '
Recording a verdict of accidental death Pearl Willis , deputy coroner for Berkshire , said : ' Andrew was an emotional individual who had a fascination with drinking water spanning many years .
' He would n't have known the dangers of drinking too much water , and although maybe the hosepipe should have been turned off earlier , I feel it is appropriate to record a verdict of accidental death . '
For every lit author like Cormac McCarthy , who borrows science fiction themes , there are ten authors who start out writing science fiction , and then become beloved of literary hipsters .
Here 's a partial list .
Advertisement
It 's funny , when you think about it , that so much attention gets paid to the McCarthys , Atwoods , Lessings and Roths of the world , who are known for their lit writing but try their hand at speculative fiction here and there .
There are really just a handful of them who 've made an impression , whereas there are tons of SF authors who 've gone the other way - and yet , people seldom talk about it .
Mary Shelley , H.G. Wells , Jules Verne and Edgar Allan
Poe are all writers whose names come up a lot when you talk about science fiction authors who have become beloved of the lit-mongers .
To some extent , I think Shelley , Wells , Verne and Poe predate the genre- ification of SF , since they were writing at a time before the term was invented .
In any case , they 've all long since been embraced as fully literary .
( Well , mostly .
Of Poe , critic V.S. Pritchett famously said he was " a second class writer , but a fertilizing exclaimer . " )
" I get the sense that Wells in his day was a " novel of ideas " guy / polemicist who was later gerrymandered into SF , " says Douglas Wolk , author of Reading Comics .

H.P. Lovecraft was clearly a genre writer in his time , thanks to his association with Weird Tales and other magazines .
Nowadays , he 's the subject of a book - length essay by fancy - pants French guy Michel Houellebecq , and the prestigious Library Of America has collected his stories .

Stanislaw Lem .
A few science fiction authors have gotten published in the New Yorker , but Lem was a regular fixture there for years .
Lem 's satires , in which Ijon Tichy encounters weird time paradoxes , surrealistic societies and philosophical dead - ends , are tailor made for the lit crowd .

Gene Wolfe also got his work published in the New Yorker , as well as other fancy literary magazines .
He 's been compared to Proust , G.K. Chesterton and Dickens by critics in the Washington Post and other places .
( I read a bunch of Wolfe 's short stories the other day , and the Dickens comparison seemed particularly apt - they felt almost too 19th century for my taste , but he was clearly doing a good job of capturing a certain smoky industrial revolution feeling to his otherworldly stories . )
Ursula K. LeGuin is another author that nobody even questions the literariness of any more .
Her latest book , Lavinia , has been greeted as a pure work of literature , with tons of articles about her contributions to the literature of ideas .
The Cleveland Plain Dealer names it one of the best books of 2008 , without regard to genre .
Advertisement
John Crowley is the uber - example of someone who crossed over - his earliest novels ( The Deep , Beasts and Engine Summer ) were pure SF and fantasy .
His fourth book , the fantasy novel Little , Big , not only won the World Fantasy Award for best novel , but also praise from mega-critic Harold Bloom .
He 's since won a American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in Literature , and he teaches at Yale .
Advertisement
Octavia Butler is another obvious choice .
Just look at this gigantic list of journal articles about her , which appears to be outdated in any case .
Including things like " Power and Repetition : Philosophies of ( Literary ) History in Octavia E. Butler 's Kindred , " from the journal Contemporary Literature .

Philip K . Dick is another one I barely feel the need to justify .
Just read this disturbing excerpt from an article in Lingua Franca :
WHEN THE NOVELIST PHILIP K .
DICK DIED IN 1982 , THE INFLUENTIAL literary theorist Fredric Jameson eulogized him as " the Shakespeare of science fiction . "
At the time of this encomium , Dick was hardly famous .
The author of more than fifty books , he had an enthusiastic following among science fiction fans .
But he was rarely read by anyone else .
These days ,
Dick is far better known .
Vintage publishes his fiction in a uniform paperback edition .
Hollywood filmmakers transform his stories of imaginary worlds and conspiratorial cartels into movies like Screamers and Total Recall .
Meanwhile , academic critics laud him as a postmodernist visionary , a canny prophet of virtual reality , corporate espionage , and the schizoid nature of identity in a digitized world .
Indeed , beginning in the last years of his life and continuing to the present , these critics have played a key role in the canonization of Philip K. Dick .
But did Dick return the favor ?
Not exactly .
To their considerable anguish , Dick 's academic champions have had to contend with the revelation that their hero wrote letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation denouncing them .
In these letters , Dick claimed that Jameson and other literary theorists were agents of a KGB conspiracy to take over American science fiction .
When he sent these messages , Dick was not in the best state of mind :
He frequently heard voices and saw visions , often bathed in a mysterious pink light .
Even so , the news of his surreptitious campaign against his academic admirers has left some of them deeply disturbed .

Harlan Ellison shows up in a surprising number of college syllabi , including a lot of science fiction writing classes but also a lot of generic " advanced composition " and English classes .
His most commonly assigned story seems to be " Repent , Harlequin !
Said The Tick - Tock Man . "
It 's assigned often enough that there 's a study guide for it .
And as his bio proudly notes , he had a story in the 1993 Best American Short Stories .
Samuel R. Delany has easily become a lit - nerd must - read , thanks to his dense , challengiang narratives .
It also did n't hurt , notes Wolk , that he 's written smut and literary theory as well .
" I 've quoted him in a theory context , " Wolk says .
Check out this progression of Delany book covers , from lurid to literary :

William Gibson was heading for literary status for ages , thanks to his cyberpunk classics like Neuromancer and Count Zero .
But when he switched to writing books set in the present , with Pattern Recognition and Spook Country , it became fashionable to talk about him as influential in his own time .
The New York Times called Spook Country " the first post - post - 9/11 novel . "
He was interviewed in the California Literary Review , and people started talking about the quality of his prose .
Advertisement
Kurt Vonnegut caused some debate among the people I asked about this topic .
Was this literary idol ever considered a science fiction author ?
On the pro side , people cited the ultra-pulpy original covers of Player Piano and Sirens Of Titan , his first two books .
" Where do you think [ his fictional science fiction author ] Kilgore Trout came from ? " asks science fiction critic Mike Berry .
On the other hand , his early stories appeared in Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post .
If anything , one person suggested , Vonnegut is going the other way :
He used to have literary cache , but now lit - snobs find him embarrassing .
So it goes .
Advertisement
Jonathan Lethem got suggested by several people including Susan Marie Groppi from StrangeHorizons .
It took me a while to remember that Lethem actually did start out as a science fiction author , before becoming a literary darling .
( Check out his story collection The Wall Of The Sky , The Wall Of The Eye , which contains a bunch of stories that would n't be out of place in a typical issue of Asimov 's or Analog .
And at least one , " Vanilla Dunk , " was in Asimov's . )
Ray Bradbury belongs on this list , if only for Fahrenheit 451 , which is taught in college lit classes everywhere .
Type the term " fahrenheit 451 sparknotes " into Google and you get 9,000 results , thanks to desperate term - paper - writing kids all over .
( I did n't even type in that phrase .
Google auto - suggested it . )

Weird - cyber author Rudy Rucker pops up on college syllabuses you 'd expect , for science fiction writing classes .
But also classes in rhetoric , and philosophy .
James Tiptree , Jr. gets on the list , if only because the male persona of writer Alice Sheldon has garnered lots of attention from gender theorists .
The recent award - winning biography by Julie Phillips sparked more interest in Tiptree 's life in the mainstream media , but also started people paying more attention to Tiptree 's mind - bending stories , especially " Houston , Houston , Do You Read . "
Advertisement
Neal Stephenson is another author who seems like an obvious inclusion .
His latest book , Anathem , was greeted everywhere as a serious novel , not particularly as a science fiction book .
Here 's Pulitzer Prize - winning book critic Michael Dirda , writing in the Washington Post :
For the past 30 years I 've been a zealous advocate for literary science fiction and fantasy , arguing that writers such as Gene Wolfe , Thomas M. Disch , John Crowley , Ursula K. Le Guin , Howard Waldrop and a handful of others are significant American authors , as well as artists of the first rank ...
Neal Stephenson has established himself as one of these genre - transcending gods , read passionately by geeks and fans , but also admired as a novelist of ideas , a 21st - century Thomas Pynchon .
Advertisement
( He goes on to say that Anathem is a bit of a disappointment , actually . )
To be honest , I 'd forgotten about Thomas M. Disch until I read the above quote , and then smacked my forehead .
Before he died , Disch was as well known for his criticism ( The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of ) and poetry as for his fiction , a surefire way to get literary cache .
The Telegraph even called him " excessively literary by the standards of his time . "
Advertisement
Dan Simmons is in the process of transitioning to literary icon , according to some of my friends who monitor such things zealously .
( They have a monitor board , and it lights up when a previously - tagged author starts to swim upstream towards the literary spawning grounds . )
His use of literary allusions , especially Keats , probably does n't hurt .
Salon.com proclaimed him a literary master in 2002 .
Howard Waldrop is as well known in lit circles as he is in speculative fiction circles .
Dirda , once again , champions him as up there with Dick and other postmodern storytellers .
Advertisement
Carol Emshwiller won an NEA grant and a Pushcart Prize , and has had her stories in lit journals like McSweeney 's and the Voice Literary Supplement .
Methodology :
To some extent , this is just based on years of reading critics , and seeing who actually gets published in literary magazines and stuff .
I also did a search on college syllabuses to see which authors are actually getting taught in college lit classes .
And I polled my Twitter and Facebook homies .
Advertisement
( I'm leaving out some " urban fantasy " ish writers like Kelly Link , China Mieville or Neil Gaiman , in the interests of keeping this list from being too long .
Plus once you get into magic and fantasy elements , you have to talk about the " magical realism " vogue of the 1990s and how that intersected with lit fiction and fantasy .
And this is a blog post , not a book . )
Also : I 'm not talking here about mainstream success , or having your books made into movies , or becoming a household name .
I 'm talking about acclaim from lit-nerds , a community that 's just as insular as science fiction fans .
As a member of both communities , I know they both have their odd grooming rituals and fetishes .
An author like Philip K . Dick has long since passed the point of being " cool " for lit-nerds to discover .
Now , if you 're a lit-nerd and you have n't read Dick , your compadres just look at you pityingly .
Ditto for Le Guin or Delany .
Nobody in lit circles bothers to call them literary any more , they just are .

Finally , as I said above , this is a partial list .
Feel free to suggest other people I left out .

Lil Wayne Welcomes Baby Son : Another Lil Wayne
welcomed a new son , on Wednesday , October 22 in Cincinnati , Ohio .
The blessed event took place at Christ Hospital according to a rep for the musician who provided the details to MTV News .
The baby 's mother has not been identified but rumors indicate her name is Sarah and she is a University of Cincinnati college student who met the rapper three years ago and has been in an ' on again , off again ' relationship with Lil Wayne .
The rapper has an 8 year old daughter Reginae Carter , with Antonia ' Toya ' Johnson , his high school sweetheart .
The pair married in 2004 and divorced two years later .
Earlier this year there was a malicious internet rumor that Lil Wayne 's daughter had died .
Check out the details here .
Lil Wayne was named Lyricist of the Year by BET Hip - Hop Awards on Saturday night .
The show will air tonight , October 23 at 8:00 eastern .

The roster shaping up for the Barack Obama administration is starting to look a little familiar , with an ironic pattern emerging as one name after another is added to it .
A striking number of new and potential team members can trace their professional history to the same political birthplace -- the administration of one President Bill Clinton .
There ’s Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , of course , the former first lady now on track to become secretary of State .
And Rep. Rahm Emanuel , the former Bill Clinton aide who will be Obama ’s chief of staff .
And Eric H. Holder Jr. , once deputy to former Atty .
Gen. Janet Reno and now Obama ’s likely pick for attorney general .
There ’s the new White House lawyer , the budget director , and so on .
For all his talk of transformation , Obama ’s earliest decisions suggest something odd :
The more things change , the more they look like the 1990s .
Some see a Clinton Restoration in the making .
Advertisement
“ Voters hoping to see Obama bring a lot of fresh faces to D.C. must be disappointed , ” said Alex Conant , a spokesman for the Republican National Committee .
“ So far , it ’s been more like Clinton.gov than Change.gov . ”
It makes sense that the incoming Democratic president might fish for talent in the same pond as the last Democratic president .
If Obama is looking for depth of expertise , there ’s a good chance that many job prospects were in or around the White House a decade ago .
But there ’s a certain irony to the developing pattern , given Obama ’s campaign pledge not to spend the next four years “ refighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s . ”
“ There ’s no question about the talent level , ” said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a former Congressional Budget Office director and senior policy advisor to Republican Sen.
John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
“ They have a public relations problem in the appearance of not really fulfilling the , quote , ‘ change ’ mandate . ”
Advertisement
The Clinton alums began to populate the new team right away , when Obama picked Emanuel from the Illinois congressional delegation for the first big assignment .
Emanuel , who had served as political director in the Clinton White House , agreed to help assemble and captain the Obama team as chief of staff .
Since then , the Clinton names have flowed plentifully , with more than two dozen set either to serve on an Obama transition team or to actually take positions in the new administration .
Gregory Craig , who was President Clinton ’s impeachment lawyer , will serve as White House counsel .
Vice President Al Gore ’s chief of staff , Ron Klain , will do the same job for Joe Biden .
Gore ’s counsel , Lisa Brown , will be staff secretary .
At the same time , Sen. Clinton appears likely to head the State Department .
By some lights , Obama never really considered Clinton as his vice presidential running mate , instead floating her name for the job without going to the trouble of formally vetting her .
But developments this week suggest she got a more thorough review this time around .
Advertisement
Hoping to ease qualms about how the former president ’s tangled business dealings might affect his wife ’s shot at the job , Bill Clinton even gave the Obama transition team a complete list of more than 200,000 donors to his presidential library and charitable foundation , according to a Democrat familiar with discussions between the two camps .
The former president had not previously released this material , arguing that many donors had given money under the assumption that the gifts would not be disclosed .
With that donor list in hand , Obama had important new information needed to investigate whether making Sen.
Clinton secretary of State might pose any conflicts of interest .
Clinton loyalists saw her prospects of becoming secretary of State improve as rivals for the position fell away .
Allies of Clinton consider her expected nomination a smart one .
Advertisement
“ You have to give the president - elect an incredible amount of credit for building a Cabinet with stars in it , ” said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , credited with helping Clinton win that state ’s primary .
“ It goes against the grain .
You ’re told , ‘ Do n’t have anyone in there with their own base of support , or too famous . ’ ”
Still , Clinton could complicate things .
Obama has a vast network of volunteers whom he is counting on to help him get what he wants out of Congress -- supporters who worked explicitly for “ change . ”
Tom Bethany , 22 , is an Obama voter who briefly ran the Obama campus campaign organization at Bowling Green State University in Ohio .
He says he ’s worried about the abundance of people with ties to the Clinton White House landing jobs .
“ I think Obama ’s message of change could very easily be lost , ” Bethany said , “ if he picks the same people who ’ve been running in Washington and promising the same things for years .
. . .
There are a lot of young Democrats I know who wanted change and wanted something different . ”
Advertisement
James Lautzenheiser , 27 , an Obama volunteer from Ohio , is also dubious .
“ It seems as though the more that these Cabinet positions get filled by Clinton - era folks , [ the more ] we lose the possibility for change , ” Lautzenheiser said .
“ If all this is just going to be a third Clinton term , then should we expect a reemergence of another Bush next time around to repeal all the progress ? ”
Still , the list grows .
On the economic team , several Clinton administration veterans are in the mix .
Former Clinton economic advisor and current Congressional Budget Office Director Peter R. Orszag is the possible budget director .
Jack Lew , former White House budget director , could have a post on the National Economic Council .
Daniel Tarullo , an assistant to President Clinton on international economic affairs , may land there too .
Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers , who had been mentioned frequently for Obama ’s Treasury secretary , was asked to be a senior White House advisor .
And Obama tapped Timothy F. Geithner , a Summers protege and Clinton Treasury undersecretary for international affairs , for Treasury secretary .

This is probably my favorite Special Comment by Keith Olbermann .
Proposition 8 is a travesty , and an affront to human dignity .
Olbermann 's call to civility and decency to those who voted against it is perhaps the most articulate , emotionally resounding and logical rebuttal to their arguments , and a reminder that some issues supersede politics .
The Indian navy is now patrolling off the Somali coast An Indian navy warship has destroyed a suspected Somali pirate vessel after it came under attack in the Gulf of Aden .
INS Tabar sank the pirate " mother ship " after it failed to stop for investigation and opened fire instead , an Indian navy statement said .
There has been a surge in piracy incidents off the coast of Somalia .
The latest attack came days after the Saudi - owned Sirius Star supertanker and its 25 crew were seized by pirates and anchored off the Somali coast .
Vela International , operators of the Sirius Star , told the BBC no demands had yet been received from the pirates .
The company also said all the crew were safe .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Analysts say the pattern of other hijackings suggests a ransom request is likely to follow .
Given the value of the tanker and its cargo , that is expected to be a sizeable demand .
Two of the captive crew are British .
The UK Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , said the Royal Navy was co-ordinating the European response to the incident .
" The problem of piracy around Somalia is a grave danger to the stability in the region , " he told the BBC .
Somalia has not had a functioning national government since 1991 and has suffered continuing civil strife .
Explosions India is among several countries already patrolling the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes which connects the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean .

The Indian navy said the Tabar spotted the pirate vessel while patrolling 285 nautical miles ( 528 km ) south - west of Salalah in Oman on Tuesday evening .
The navy said the pirates on board were armed with guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers .
When it demanded the vessel stop for investigation , the pirate ship responded by threatening to " blow up the naval warship if it closed on her " , the statement said .
Pirates then fired on the Tabar , and the Indians say they retaliated and that there was an explosion on the pirate vessel , which sank .
" Fire broke out on the vessel and explosions were heard , possibly due to exploding ammunition that was stored in the vessel , " the Indian navy said .
Some of the pirates tried to escape on two speedboats .
The Indian sailors gave chase but one boat was later found abandoned , while a second boat escaped .
INS Tabar has been patrolling the Gulf of Aden since 23 October , and has escorted 35 ships safely through the " pirate - infested waters " , the statement said .
Last week , helicopter - borne Indian marine commandos stopped pirates from boarding and hijacking an Indian merchant vessel .
Ransoms
On Tuesday , a cargo ship and a fishing vessel became the latest to join more than 90 vessels attacked by the pirates this year .
THE SIRIUS STAR Carrying 2 m barrels of oil Biggest vessel to be hijacked
The first vessel , a 25 - crew cargo vessel transporting wheat to Iran , was attacked in the Gulf of Aden , while contact was lost with the crew of 12 on the fishing boat .
Piracy off the coast of East Africa and the Gulf of Aden - an area of more than 1 m sq miles ( 2.6 m sq km ) - is estimated to have cost up to $ 30 m in ransoms this year , a UK think tank has said .
The hijackings account for one - third of all global piracy incidents this year and the situation is getting out of control , according to the International Maritime Bureau .
The pirates who seized the Sirius Star are a sophisticated group with contacts in Dubai and neighbouring countries , says the BBC Somali Service 's Yusuf Garaad .
Much of their ransom money from previous hijackings has been used to buy new boats and weapons as well as develop a network across the Horn of Africa , he adds .

Cindy Sheehan gets 40 Seconds to speak to Nancy Pelosi confetti [ at ] lmi.net )
Wednesday Oct 29th , 2008 6:05 PM by Robert B. Livingston
Having refused to be a guest on KQED´s public affairs program Forum because she was not allowed equal time , America´s leading peace activist Cindy Sheehan audaciously called in to the program this morning to get a chance to address House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Upon stating that Nancy Pelosi has ducked her responsibility of meeting with her San Francisco constituents since 2006 , the impatient program host , Michael Krasny , interrupted Cindy to prod her to ask the question his call screeners had agreed to .
In all , Cindy Sheehan was granted less than 40 seconds to speak , and was not allowed to respond to Nancy Pelosi´s answer .
Cindy Sheehan is running against Nancy Pelosi for California´s District 8 Congressional Seat in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Cindy Sheehan gets 40 Seconds to speak to Nancy Pelosi
San Francisco , California
October 29 , 2008
Robert B. Livingston
According to the Wikipedia , KQED 88.5 FM is the the most listened to NPR station in the United States .
Between 9 and 11 AM weekdays , tens of thousands of the San Francisco Bay Area´s more civic - minded residents tune in when the radio station broadcasts Forum , a public affairs call - in program .
This morning in a nod to democracy , Forum devoted the hour from 10 to 11 to giving its listening public a chance to get to know the candidates in this year´s District 8 Congressional race .
District 8 represents the greater part of San Francisco -- and it has an especially noteworthy race this year because America´s leading peace activist Cindy Sheehan is in the race as an independent candidate .
As has been largely its custom in past major political races , Forum gave the bulk of its program ( the first half of the program´s hour ) to the sitting incumbent , in this case , House speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Forum allocated the second half of the program to two of her challengers , the Republican Party candidate Dana Walsh and the Libertarian Party candidate Philip Berg .
Cindy Sheehan , although invited to share the second half - hour with Walsh and Berg , had refused to attend on principle : because the program´s time was divided unfairly among all the candidates .
Nevertheless ,
Cindy took advantage of the opportunity Forum dangles to all its listeners to have a say , and managed to call in to the station and address Nancy Pelosi shortly before the Speaker´s time ran out .
¨ I just want to know why you haven´t represented the people of your district and why you haven´t impeached George Bush and Dick Cheney ? ¨
Cindy was able to ask Pelosi .
Nancy Pelosi thanked Cindy for her call and expressed her admiration for her courage .
¨ If I honestly believed that the president had violated the Constitution of the United States , and if my colleagues believed that , I think you would have seen the president impeached , ¨ she answered .
As an independent appealing to voters in all parties , Cindy Sheehan has been significantly endorsed by the Green Party whose members have out - polled Republicans in San Francisco in recent years .
Many keen political observers can only guess at how election results may differ if real debates between incumbents and challengers were allowed in public -- or on the airwaves .
Cindy Sheehan has repeatedly challenged Nancy Pelosi to a debate , but Pelosi has always refused .
Since before becoming the powerful Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi has neither met with local anti-war activists nor held a public town - hall meeting to address her constituents ´ concerns .
Here is a transcript of this morning´s brief exchange between Cindy Sheehan , Forum host Michael Krasny , and Nancy Pelosi :
[ Nancy Pelosi finishes answering another caller´s question . ]
Krasny :
Well , we´ve got a caller here who I think maybe ... familiar to you Speaker Pelosi .
It ´s Cindy Sheehan on the line ....
Pelosi : Good morning Cindy .
Sheehen : Good morning Ms. Pelosi .
Pelosi : Good morning to you .
Sheehan :
It ´s nice to talk to you .
Pelosi : My pleasure .
Sheehan : Um .
Well first you answer the question about the debate which I think that you -- if you really cared about the voters in San Francisco you could find an hour to debate your opponents , because you do have some opponents here in San Francisco .
You haven´t had a town hall meeting ...
Krasny interrupts : ´ Scuse me , Cindy Sheehan , you had a question you wanted to ask the Speaker ?
Sheehan : I do .
I do .
Over 60 % of this district in 2006 voted for an impeachment resolution and I just want to know why you haven´t represented the people of your district and why you haven´t impeached George Bush and Dick Cheney .
And you still have time .
Krasny : Alright , thank you for that direct question .
Pelosi : Thank you Cindy .
First may I commend Cindy for her race for congress and again express the respect that I have for her for her courage in speaking out in what she believes in , so articulately .
The issue of impeachment is a very controversial one in my own caucus and certainly in the country .
The idea that if we disagree with the president we should begin impeachment proceedings is one , that is again , controversial .
There are those who believe they have the evidence that the president would be convicted if impeached .
Um .
I don´t know that we have seen that .
I have said that the people who would like to see the president impeached the most are the Republicans .
They should love to see the Democrats , as soon as we took power , go down the path of impeaching the president , dividing the country , and neglecting what we wanted to do on minimum wage , and children´s health , and veterans´ benefits and the rest of that , because it would totally consume the congress .
It is , again , again , controversial , but if I honestly believed that the president had violated the Constitution of the United States , and if my colleagues believed that , I think you would have seen the president impeached .
Krasny :
Let me see if we can get a quick other call in here .
Brian go ahead .
You ´re on .
Brian : Hi. I´m Brian .
I´m very interested in ....
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 October 11
Explanation : On September 30 , a spectacular bolide or fireball meteor surprised a group of amateur astronomers enjoying dark night skies over the Oklahoma panhandle 's Black Mesa State Park in the Midwestern US .
Flashing past familiar constellations Taurus ( top ) and Orion , the extremely bright meteor was captured by a hillside camera overlooking the 2008 Okie - Tex Star Party .
Astronomy enthusiast Howard Edin reports that he was looking in the opposite direction at the time , but saw the whole observing field light up and at first thought someone had turned on their car headlights .
So far the sighting of a such a bright bolide meteor , produced as a space rock is vaporized hurtling through Earth 's atmosphere , really is a matter of luck .
But that could change .
Earlier this week the discovery and follow - up tracking of tiny asteroid 2008 TC3 allowed astronomers to predict the time and location of its impact with the atmosphere .
While no ground - based sightings of the fireball seem to have been reported , this first ever impact prediction was confirmed by at least some detections of an air burst and bright flash on October 7th over northern Sudan .
We 've always been warned to be vigilant about what information we provide when online .
Between phishing , malware , and DNS spoofing it 's difficult to blindly trust any online entity these days .
But if we have a secure connection to a known site , we 're okay then , right ?
Not always ...
Someone might still be listening in .
Just because you think your connection is secure , does n't mean that it is .
In fact , as
we reported
a few weeks ago , researchers have found a way to wirelessly listen in on your keyboard activity -- sort of a passive , non-intrusive keylogger .
Perhaps a bit more common is the act of listening in on wireless networking communications .
Even such efforts as disabling router SSIDs and using MAC address filtering are n't foolproof -- SSIDs can be sniffed and MAC addresses can be spoofed .
That is where encryption was supposed to save the day ; but the initial WEP algorithm proved to be too weak and could be easily cracked within minutes .
Replacing WEP were the much more robust WPA and WPA2 encryption protocols .
While not guaranteed to be absolutely secure ( they are subject to brute - force dictionary attacks of guessing passkeys ) , they proved to be robust enough to withstand cracking attempts ...
Until now that is .
Credit : Microsoft
Apparently , a pair of researchers , Erik Tews and Martin Beck , will be speaking at next week 's PacSec Conference in Tokyo about how they cracked the WPA protocol .
Apparently they first found a way to get a WPA - enabled router to " send them large amounts of data . "
The large data pool gives them more encrypted communications to analyze .
They claim that with their new technique , they were able to crack WPA 's TKIP key in less than 15 minutes .
As part of this technique requires receiving a substantial amount of data from a router , they have so far only been able to crack WPA by listening in on communications from the router , and not by listening in on communications from a connected client to a router .
They claim , however , that " the attack could also be used to send bogus information to a client connected to the router . "
While this is the first known , non-dictionary - based , crack of WPA , this could be just the tip of the iceberg now that the genie is out of the bottle .
Once Tews and Beck make their presentation and eventually publish their findings , others may make further developments based on their work or find similar cracking methods .
For the time being , WPA2 is still considered a secure encryption protocol ...
But for how long ?
The American economy lost 159,000 jobs in September , the worst month of retrenchment in five years , the government reported on Friday , amplifying fears that an already painful downturn had entered a more severe stage that could persist well into next year .
Employment has diminished for nine consecutive months , eliminating 760,000 jobs , according to the Labor Department ’s report .
And that does not count the traumatic events of recent weeks , as a string of Wall Street institutions collapsed , prompting the $ 700 billion emergency rescue package approved by Congress on Friday .
“ It ’s a dismal report , and the worst thing about it is that it does not reflect the recent seizure that we ’ve seen in the credit markets , ” said Michael T. Darda , chief economist at MKM Partners , a research and trading firm in Greenwich , Conn .
“ There ’s really nothing good about this report at all .
We ’ve lost jobs in nearly every area of the economy , and this is going to get worse before it gets better because the credit markets have deteriorated basically on a daily basis for the last few weeks . ”
Though the bailout may restore order to the financial system and eventually filter through the economy by making it easier for businesses to secure capital , few analysts expect it to swiftly reverse the nation ’s fortunes .
Housing prices continue to fall , eroding household wealth just as millions suffer the weight of unmanageable debt .
The deteriorating job market has taken paychecks out of the economy , reinforcing a predilection for thrift that has cut sales from car showrooms to hair salons .
With today ’s plunge in the stock market , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index has now fallen 42 percent over the last year .
Just how bad is that ?
It ’s nearly as bad as one terrible 12 - month period from late 1973 to late 1974 .
Other than that , it ’s the worst decline since 1932 .
These historical comparisons are best done in real — that is , inflation - adjusted — terms , so that ’s what we will use from here .
In real terms , the decline since Oct. 9 , 2007 , has been about 45 percent .
From the end of September 1973 to the end of September 1974 , the S.&P. 500 dropped 48 percent .
Robert Shiller , an economist , keeps stock - market data going back to 1871 .
The only other 12 - month periods worse than the current one all came in 1932 .
In the early months of 1932 , stocks were trading for about 45 percent to 55 percent less than they had been a year before .
And then they kept falling .
The worst 12 - month period happened between June 1931 and June 1932 , when the stocks fell 62 percent .
( Mr. Shiller ’s data is monthly , so there was probably a 365 - day period that was slightly worse than this . )
Earlier this week , I mentioned that the market was closing in on a dubious milestone : having fallen more than 50 percent from its inflation - adjusted peak , which came in August 2000 .
This afternoon , it blew through that milestone .
It ’s now 53 percent lower than its peak .
This is the third great bear market of the last century .
The country 's leading police officer on gang culture warns today that gang members are getting younger and that they are resorting to lethal violence much more swiftly for the most trivial slights .
In an interview with the Guardian , Commander Sue Akers of the Metropolitan police identified other trends , including the emergence of a small number of girl gangs , and how women are being used to carry and conceal weapons .
Speaking at the end of a week in which Sean Mercer , 18 , was convicted of murdering 11 - year - old Rhys Jones , Akers said the only way to counter the threat of further violence was long - term investment that offers gang members a real alternative to crime .
Mercer was 16 at the time of the killing .
" You can carry on with a stick , but you need a carrot at the end of the day , " said Akers .
" Some of the gang members go to prison and , when they come out , they get back into the gangs , because life does n't seem to offer them much else . "
The rise in teenage gang crime is turning into a priority issue for ministers .
There have been 66 teenage murders in Britain this year , mainly knife attacks .
London has had 30 murders ; there were six in Scotland , five in Greater Manchester and four in Merseyside .
The British Crime Survey is to start documenting the number of teenage murders separately .
The government has also launched a new programme to tackle gang crime .
Akers , the spokesperson on gangs for the Association of Chief Police Officers and one of the Met 's most experienced officers in the field , told the Guardian : " We 're seeing young kids killing other young kids .
We 've seen 14 - and 15 - year - olds being killed over what seems the most trivial slights or just a glance .
In the past , they would use violence over something like enforcing debts but now it 's over this ' respect ' issue , the smallest insult . "
Gangs no longer split down racial lines but were formed as a result of territory , neighbourhood or shared interest .
" There is less focus on ethnicity now , " she said .
Akers said people must distinguish between youths who hang around together on street corners and may commit minor antisocial offences and the real gangs involved in violence and criminality .
A growing number of senior officers advocate offering alternatives to gang life .
She pointed to work being done in Glasgow , similar to the Boston Ceasefire project in the US .
Police tactics can have an immediate effect , she said , citing the apparent success of stop - and - search in London .
" But - and it is a big but - if there are no alternatives for gang members , then they just go back to it .
It takes time and investment .
We need to get really , really focused on the very young . "
British gangs differ from US gangs in structure and hierarchy , she said .
" Ours are more fluid and more fickle .
Gangs disappear and fragment , they can be allies one week and not another . "
A small number of girl gangs had emerged in London , " and some gangs use women to look after their weapons " .
The vast majority remained young men and boys .
Government bailout hits $ 8.5 trillion
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Government bailout hits $ 8.5 trillion 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The federal government committed an additional $ 800 billion to two new loan programs on Tuesday , bringing its cumulative commitment to financial rescue initiatives to a staggering $ 8.5 trillion , according to Bloomberg News .
That sum represents almost 60 percent of the nation 's estimated gross domestic product .
Given the unprecedented size and complexity of these programs and the fact that many have never been tried before , it 's impossible to predict how much they will cost taxpayers .
The final cost wo n't be known for many years .
The money has been committed to a wide array of programs , including loans and loan guarantees , asset purchases , equity investments in financial companies , tax breaks for banks , help for struggling homeowners and a currency stabilization fund .
Most of the money , about $ 5.5 trillion , comes from the Federal Reserve , which as an independent entity does not need congressional approval to lend money to banks or , in " unusual and exigent circumstances , " to other financial institutions .
To stimulate lending , the Fed said on Tuesday it will purchase up to $ 600 billion in mortgage debt issued or backed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and government housing agencies .
It also will lend up to $ 200 billion to holders of securities backed by consumer and small - business loans .
All but $ 20 billion of that $ 800 billion represents new commitments , a Fed spokeswoman said .
About $ 1.1 trillion of the $ 8.5 trillion is coming from the Treasury Department , including $ 700 billion approved by Congress in dramatic fashion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The rest of the commitments are coming from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Housing Administration .
Only about $ 3.2 trillion of the $ 8.5 trillion has been tapped so far , according to Bloomberg .
Some of it might never be .
Relatively little of the money represents direct outlays of cash with no strings attached , such as the $ 168 billion in stimulus checks mailed last spring .
Where it 's going
Most of the money is going into loans or loan guarantees , asset purchases or stock investments on which the government could see some return .
" If the economy were to miraculously recover , the taxpayer could make money .
That 's not my best guess or even a likely scenario , " but it 's not inconceivable , says Anil Kashyap , a professor at the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business .
The risk / reward ratio for taxpayers varies greatly from program to program .
For example , the first deal the government made when it bailed out insurance giant AIG had little risk and a lot of potential upside for taxpayers , Kashyap said .
" Then it turned out the situation ( at AIG ) was worse than realized , and the terms were so brutal ( to AIG ) that we had to renegotiate .
Now we have given them a lot more credit on more generous terms . "
Kashyap says the worst deal for taxpayers could be the Citigroup deal announced late Sunday .
The government agreed to buy an additional $ 20 billion in preferred stock and absorb up to $ 249 billion in losses on troubled assets owned by Citi .
Given that Citigroup 's entire market value on Friday was $ 20.5 billion , " instead of taking that $ 20 billion in preferred shares we could have bought the company , " he says .
It 's hard to say how much the overall rescue attempt will add to the annual deficit or the national debt because the government accounts for each program differently .
If the Treasury borrows money to finance a program , that money adds to the federal debt and must eventually be paid off , with interest , says Diane Lim Rogers , chief economist with the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan group that aims to eliminate federal deficits .
The federal debt held by the public has risen to $ 6.4 trillion from $ 5.5 trillion at the end of August .
( Total debt , including that owed to Social Security and other government agencies , stands at more than $ 10 trillion . )
However , a $ 1 billion increase in the federal debt does not necessarily increase the annual budget deficit by $ 1 billion because it is expected to be repaid over time , Rogers said .
Annual deficit
A deficit arises when the government 's expenditures exceed its revenues in a particular year .
Some estimate that the federal deficit will exceed $ 1 trillion this fiscal year as a result of the economic slowdown and efforts to revive it .
The Fed 's activities to shore up the financial system do not show up directly on the federal budget , although they can have an impact .
The Fed lends money from its own balance sheet or by essentially creating new money .
It has been doing both this year .
The problem is , " if you print money all the time , the money becomes worth less , " Rogers says .
This usually leads to higher inflation and higher interest rates .
The value of the dollar also falls because foreign investors become less willing to invest in the United States .
Today , interest rates are relatively low and the dollar has been mostly strengthening this year because U.S. Treasury securities " are still for the moment a very safe thing to be investing in because the financial market is so unstable , " Rogers said .
" Once we stabilize the stock market , people will not be so enamored of clutching onto Treasurys . "
At that point , interest rates and inflation will rise .
Increased borrowing by the Treasury will also put upward pressure on interest rates .
Deflation a big concern
Today , however , the Fed is more worried about deflation than inflation and is willing to flood the market with money if necessary to prevent an economic collapse .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke " has ordered the helicopters to get ready , " said Axel Merk , president of Merk Investments .
" The helicopters are hovering and the first cash is making it through the seams .
Soon , a door may be opened . "
Rogers says her biggest fear is not hyperinflation and the social unrest it could unleash .
" I 'm more worried about a lot of federal dollars being committed and not having much to show for it .
My worst fear is we are leaving our children with a huge debt burden and not much left to pay it back . "
David Friedman
responds to Eric Boehlert 's article "
The Media Myth : Detroit's $ 70 - an - hour Autoworker
" :
A good deal of Boehlert 's indignation is based on the fact that labor costs as calculated include pension and medical benefits to retired workers .
He regards this as obviously wrong , since the money is n't being paid to the current workers .
But it is n't that simple .
The cost of pensions is incurred when the worker is employed but paid when he retires .
If labor costs only count what is currently paid to current workers , the cost of pensions will be left out , substantially understating both the benefit to the auto worker and the cost to the company .
Ideally , the calculation should be done using costs when incurred .
But pension and medical costs are not known when they are incurred , since at that point the company does not know when the worker will retire , how long he will live thereafter or what his medical costs will be .
So the choice is either to use a current estimate of the future cost of benefits to current employees or a current figure for current cost of benefits to past employees .
Neither gives a reliable figure for the future cost currently being incurred and it is not obvious which is better .
Exclusive to STR
Charles Ponzi achieved in his lifetime something very rare : his surname became part of the English Language .
Thomas Crapper did that in the 1860s , when he developed and marketed the modern toilet , and so did Sir Robert Peel when he organized the British police ; to this day , agents of that force may be called " bobbies " or sometimes " peelers . "
But how many other examples can one recall ?
Recently I read Charles ' bio , and saw something I 'd not noticed before : although convicted of the swindle , he may not have been very guilty at all .
A misjudgment , for sure ; a business miscalculation , yes .
But not necessarily much worse than that .
This seems to me to have large implications for the evident wide acceptance by society of some far bigger , modern swindles .
So let 's review the facts .
In early 1920 he started trading in Boston to import something from Italy and sell it in that city .
Like all other imports , the buying price overseas was much lower than the selling price at home ; that 's why things get imported .
Tea , for example , was famously shipped from the Orient because Bostonians paid a lot more for it than the price at which Indian and Chinese growers were willing to sell .
So it was in Ponzi 's case ; the merchandise was the " International Postal Reply Coupon " or IPRC , upon which the world 's post offices had agreed ; the idea was that if you wished to write someone in another country and extend to him the courtesy of a prepaid reply , you would buy one ( in Rome , Italy , say ) for whatever the Italian post office charged for a letter to America , and the recipient in Rome , Georgia could take the IPRC to his local post office and exchange it for US stamps sufficient to send the reply .
Probably , when the agreement was signed , the respective postal rates were much the same so the managers reckoned that any small anomalies would come out in the wash and increased revenues would result ( especially if the IPRCs were purchased but never used ) because it would boost business .
But they did n't anticipate a rapid fall in the exchange rate of Italian currency .
By 1919 , it cost much less in dollar terms to send a letter from Italy to the US , than to send a reply from the US to Italy .
Therefore , by sending dollars to a friend in Florence , said friend could exchange them and buy a pack of IPRCs and ship them to Boston , where they could be exchanged for stamps which could be sold ( at a small discount , say ) for many times more dollars than had been sent East .
That is what Ponzi was the first to spot .
Neat work !
I do n't have the particular figures , but it might have been that he could send $ 1,000 to Italy and after paying all expenses and commissions sell the resulting US stamps in Boston the following month for $ 5,000 profit , all perfectly legally .
Wow .
Being generous as well as greedy , Chuck invited others to share the wealth , by offering to return several percentage points per month on capital invested in the business ; and Bostonians lined up to do so .
From obscure poverty at the end of 1919 , the genius businessman had by mid-1920 bought for cash a mansion in the right location , with clothing and automobile to match .
Business boomed so well , that he fell behind in its administration .
Not unreasonably , his priority was to manage the capital flow , and he neglected the matter of importing shiploads of IPRCs and selling the US stamps they could buy .
The flow of coupons failed to keep up with the flow of investment money .
This created no cash shortage at all , because there was so much new money coming in that Ponzi had no difficulty at all in paying dividends as promised , nor even in refunding principal to the few who claimed it .
Meanwhile , imported IPRCs were accumulating , and when time permitted , he could easily get around to buying stamps and selling them , and then importing more , i.e. , operating the core of his business .
But in mid-1920 , he did n't .
It 's in that minor omission that we find the moral core of the matter .
Did he fail to move the merchandise because he was just too busy , while fully intending to get around to it when he could ?
Or did he , at some point in the spring of 1920 , realize that he did n't ever need to -- that he could go on taking in and paying out money until the net flow turned negative , and then skip town ?
The former would be harmless neglect , the latter would be fraud .
Without being able to peer in to Ponzi 's mind , it 's a tough call .
Government intervened , as it often does when someone outside its immediate circle of supporters begins to make spectacular amounts of money .
Its agents sniffed around , and news of that sent some investors back to Ponzi to recover their funds -- which he enabled them to do , with a smile and a cherry on top , so the panic stopped .
Then later that Summer , a fresh wave of snooping took place , by Barron of Barron's , and it was found from the Post Office that there had been no abnormal redemption of IPRCs .
A visit to the Ponzi office revealed bales of them , imported but unredeemed .
Then it became clear that Ponzi had not in fact been carrying out the business operation he had advertised , and he was arrested and his office closed ; he was later imprisoned , many lost their savings , and his name entered our language in " Ponzi Scheme . "
I think it is quite credible that his actual failure was a mere oversight , and that had he been left in peace , he would have got round to moving the imports and made fortunes for himself and all his investors .
Eventually he'd have had to close down because the postal agreements would have been revised to reflect the exchange rate imbalance , but that would have been done with due warning and the business could have wound down in an orderly fashion with many winners and few losers , if any .
That possible , relative innocence , however , does not apply to the many who have imitated Ponzi since 1920 , deliberately operating what they always knew to be swindles in which new , incoming funds were used to pay dividends on earlier amounts so as to attract yet more new investments .
It 's quite simple to operate a Ponzi plan : fabricate a business tale and promise unusually high returns , and wait for money to arrive .
Pay the promised dividends , attract yet more investments .
When the net inflow turns negative , hop on a plane to Brazil , having stashed the loot somewhere very safe .
Such schemes are around still ; I came across one last month , called PQI .
They are usually closed down by the fuzz , before that point of peak net inflow is reached .
The biggest of them all by far , however , was launched just 15 years after Charles Ponzi's was closed , is still running after 73 years , and is called " Social Security Insurance . "
The fabricated business tale is that it's an " insurance " plan , under which premiums would top up a large reserve of funds , the returns on which would be used to pay the promised benefits .
In truth , there are no such funds , and benefits are paid from new , incoming funds exactly as happens in any other Ponzi scheme ; the differences are that ( a ) the point of maximum net inflow has long since passed , but instead of going out of business , SS has prolonged the fraud by reducing benefits and increasing premiums , ( b ) those premiums are not volunteered but are payments compelled at gunpoint , ( c ) the whole scheme is perfumed by backing it with the full faith and credit of the US Government , and ( d ) the fuzz descends not on the operators of the scheme but upon any who refuse to support it .
To call that a Ponzi scheme is to dishonor the memory of a businessman who was certainly creative and quite possibly honest .
Oil prices as a function of working hours by the French minimum wage .
For 2008 the oil price is taken as the July peak .
My mental model of oil prices evolving with scarce supply and expanding monetary mass .
Back in July , no one that I am aware of was forecasting a 100 $ drop in oil prices during the following six months .
Even Daniel Yergin , the Nemesis of modern day Peak Oil study , was at the time predicting higher prices .
Back then a friend told me to go short on oil , because all price forecasts by CERA are wrong .
If I were a trader , I would have probably followed that advice , but could never imagine what was to come .
One of my first dives into the Peak Oil world was with Kenneth Deffeyes ' book Beyond Oil .
In it , the Princeton Professor explains how resources ' prices go through chaotic periods in face of scarce supply .
Without knowing it , he derived an expression to explain movements like spot Natural Gas prices in the US after 2002 , that was equivalent to Queueing Theory .
This made immediate sense to me , after studying this theory in my formative years at the University .
Let me try to explain briefly what this theory is .
Imagine a supermarket with a certain number of points - of - sale ( POS ) , to which a certain number of costumers arrive per hour .
Queueing
Theory allows one to derive information like the average queue length at each POS and the average waiting time each costumer spends in the queue .
This information is not only useful for supermarket managers but also in other fields like transport and tele - communications .
Queueing
Theory shows also provides another important result : if the load on the system goes above a certain threshold , it becomes impossible to predict queue lengths or waiting times , and the system goes into chaos .
Going back to the supermarket , imagine that for some reason the flow of costumers increases several - fold over its normal rhythm ( e.g. Black Friday in the US ) .
At first , lengthy queues form at each POS , waiting periods then go beyond costumers ' patience , and they simply start quitting the queue and leaving the supermarket without shopping .
The dissatisfaction is such that costumers quit entering the supermarket altogether and the manager is eventually forced to close down some POS .
But this is Black Friday , the avalanche of costumers eventually returns and it starts all over again .
During this chaotic period a random sample of queue length at any given POS can result in any possible number and becomes effectively impossible to predict .
Substituting costumers by oil importers , POS by oil exporters and queue length by oil prices we have the international oil market .
This chaotic outcome with respect to commodities prices in face of scarce supply was studied by Ugo Bardi , who found interesting examples of it in the past .
I first got to know his work soon after I read Kenneth Deffeyes ' book and was especially impressed with the pattern
Ugo identified in whale oil prices after the peak in sperm whale catches in 1850 .
The Whaling Industry was possibly the largest of its time , on a global scale that in many ways can be compared with the modern day Oil Industry .
To me a most fascinating aspect about Peak Whale Oil is that in the book Moby Dick , published right about that time , Herman Melville lays down quite clearly the reasons for a coming decline of the Industry : in his view Easy Sperm Whale was over .
With all this information I became convinced an increased volatility in oil prices would unfold , eventually leading to a series of " boom and bust " cycles , just like whale oil prices in the XIX century .
Predictions of oil prices would become impossible , and I never attempted to forecast them .
Another important aspect to my understanding of this issue was presented by Carlos Cramez and Jean Laherrère in 2006 at the seminar that kicked off ASPO - Portugal .
They showed a chart with oil prices in terms of the number of working hours required to buy the oil in the US and France , and concluded that to return to 1980 's levels , the last oil crisis , prices would have to reach something like 125 $ per barrel ( in 2006 dollars ) .
This number stuck to my mind , and I assumed this would be about the level at which the " boom " would turn around into " bust " .
Jean updated this graph recently and was kind enough to mail it to me , showing that by July , prices were very close to the level that had caused pain previously .
When oil prices fell after that , they did so in dollar terms , but not so much against the euro , thus the 2008 barrel price in working hours will be below the 1979 - 1985 period but will likely surpass the 1974 - 1978 period .
Finally there was another piece to add to this puzzle : paper currency supply has been growing by two digit percentages every year .
So these fluctuations would possibly occur within a band of ever higher numbers but without never surpassing the 1980s record oil price in terms of working hours .
The following is a graphic rendition of this mental model for the long term evolution of oil prices .
Back in July with prices nighing on 150 $ , I was getting concerned that either my mental model was rubbish or that the fist turn was now overdue .
I had the opportunity to write at that time that oil prices had become unbearable to many people in developed countries , protesters were dying in picket lines and less scrupulous people started stealing diesel from their neighbours .
Something had to break and something broke .
But I would expect something more in the line with the price turn that took place in the second half of 2006 and could never imagine so much in such a short time : more than 100 $ in six months .
As anyone knows , oil prices are in fact being pulled down by the Credit Freeze .
It is perhaps worth to take a look back to the events that lead to to this point , and oil 's important role in these events :
1999 : Glass - Steagall
Act is fully repealed ;
2001 : September the 11th , NATO goes to war ;
2002 : Interest rates are now at historic lows , monetary mass starts expanding fast to finance the war ( eventually reaching as low as 1 % in the US ) ;
2003 : Half of NATO invades Iraq ;
2004 : OPEC 's spare capacity dries up ;
2005 : Oil prices go above 60 $ , interest rates are inverted towards ascent ;
2006 : US interest rates reach 5.25 % ; households are confronted with increasing daily prices and increasing mortgages simultaneously ;
2007 : The US housing market bubble pops ;
2008 : Bear Stearns and the Lehman Brothers collapse , panic leads to a halt of the fractional reserve system , Central Banks are effectively unable to put their monetary policy at work ;
Interest rates set by the European Central Bank , the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England .
The most important thing to take home here is that the Fed started the rate hike in 2004 / 2005 because it misunderstood the oil price rise as a consequence of its poor monetary policy .
But instead crude oil production had reached a plateau that remained up to the second half of 2008 .
In fact , the underlying physical economy stopped growing soon after the invasion of Iraq .
With this interest rate hike , millions of American families slowly became unable to honour their debt compromises , squeezed between mortgages and consumer prices , both rising .
This lead to a sharp decline in home prices ( demand collapsed , supply sky - rocketed ) that were the physical collateral for much of the paper currency created during the low interest rates years .
Losing this collateral , banks had to devalue or even write off asset after asset on their balance sheets .
These problems started to affect an increasing number of banks and financial institutions to the point of breaking trust among them .
The rest is history .
In Europe , events unfolded in similar ways , although the interest rate swings were of smaller magnitude .
Here the rate set by the ECB never dipped below 2 % and never went above 4.25 % .
The problem was that many European banks had acquired financial instruments backed by assets in the US housing market ; within days of the spectacular collapse of Lehman Brothers , several institutions here started showing serious difficulties .
In spite of the reversal in monetary policy by the ECB , the inter - banking lending rate , Euribor , was perilously going up , menacing to squeeze households .
Governments are scrambling to invert the Credit Freeze and get their economies back on track .
Luckily the ease seems to be coming first to Europe : the action by the ECB rapidly reducing interest rates and by state governments in providing credit and guarantees to ailing banks ( or in some cases simply nationalizing them ) has apparently restored confidence , as the collapsing Euribor rates show .
Households in Europe are now facing declining consumer prices , with the fall in commodities ' prices , and declining mortgages .
This will bring some ease to European families and eventually pave the way for a turn around in Demand and avoid a serious expansion of unemployment .
A major difficulty remaining is that an economic turn in Europe also depends on a turn in aggregate Demand of its main trading partners - especially the US .
In the US , things are not as simple .
Not only were the interest rates swings much wider , but more importantly , the crisis is coinciding with the beginning of the transition between two governments ( from two different parties ) .
Interest rates have been brought down to the floor again and consumer prices are falling ( also a consequence of a turn of the dollar exchange rates with other major paper currencies ) , but it came too late to avoid unemployment expanding .
Restoring the confidence in the banking market seems a harder task , and similar to Europe , easing households from their obligations does n't guarantee an immediate pick up in aggregate Demand .
All these actions by Governments and Central Banks , that translate into a rapid expansion of money supply , do n't go without consequences .
But that will be an issue for another time .
__________________
The Credit Freeze impacted the oil market in two different ways :
a) It decreased Demand , by crippling industrial activity -- this is especially the case in the US where unemployment is already reaching significant numbers ; in Europe several states entered Recession in the third quarter .
At this moment there is n't enough data yet to evaluate how much Demand contracted ; only in following months , as institutions like the IEA or the EIA produce their regular reports , it will be known .
b ) Companies hedging their business in the futures market were forced to liquidate their positions in order to meet near term obligations , leading to a collapse of the number of transactions in the market .
Now that oil Demand has retracted , bringing prices down with it , the opposite phenomenon occurs : Supply destruction .
Current prices are too low for the development of many oil reserves , especially those on the fringe of technology .
The perfect example is the sub - salt layer reservoirs identified in the Santos Basin off Brasil .
A recent study by Deloitte pointed 90 $ / barrel as the break even for production from these fields .
An optimistic figure possibly , given that as indicated by Brazilian scientists last year , the technology for doing is so is yet to be developed .
With time , new projects needed to offset aging fields wo n't be there , either because of lack of exploratory activity or lack of financing .
Even healthy fields can become unprofitable and be mothballed or abandoned .
Supply will go down to the point it can't fulfill Demand any more at low prices , the cycle will be closed and a new " boom " phase will unfold .
It would be interesting to know when this new cycle will start .
That 's all but easy , made even more difficult by unpredictable monetary policy shifts .
Looking at the present futures market , presenting a heavy contango pattern , it does n't seem like an oil price rise is imminent .
Likely , only when the futures market moves toward backwardation will the environment be propitious for a new price rally .
The impossibility of predicting long / mid term oil prices is a serious problem for governments and businesses planing ahead .
But this is all part of the game : the destructive process of dependence on scarce resources .
If a steady increase in prices was the outcome ( as some believed ) , business would be able to plan ahead , for instance hedging on the futures market .
Instead , these unpredictable price swings are very disruptive .
Taking the example of an airline company , if it plans for a high oil price and prices go down , it will likely loose competitiveness .
On the other hand , if it plans for a low price and it happens to go higher , the company will lose profits and eventually have financial difficulties .
If Queueing Theory applies fully to the oil market , prices are effectively impossible to predict in the long term , guaranteeing losses to all airline companies .
Probably these " boom - and - bust " cycles will henceforth perpetuate until at least one of two things happens :
a ) A " bust " phase permanently erases an important part of Demand ;
b) A " boom " phase eventually takes place supported mainly by alternative energies ;
I 'm hoping for b ) .
This is my mother - in - law ’s recipe , one she prepares every Christmas , and while it contains some ingredients some might find patently objectionable and morally repugnant , I have absolutely no problem embarrassing myself by eating piece after piece each and every year .
It ’s but one in a sea of rum cake recipes , but because it ’s so easy and so delicious , I feel compelled to share .
Preheat oven to 325 F .
Grease and flour a bundt cake pan .
Sprinkle nuts over bottom of pan .
If desired , sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar over the nuts .
Mix all cake ingredients together .
Pour batter into pan over nuts .
Smooth out ’til the top is even .
Bake for 1 hour , or a little less if the pan is black .
Do not overbake !
Glaze :
While cake has ten minutes to go , make the glaze .
Melt butter in saucepan .
Stir in water and sugar .
Boil for 4 to 5 minutes , stirring constantly .
Turn off flame and pour in rum .
Stir to combine and reheat for 30 seconds .
Remove cake from oven .
Immediately drizzle 1/3 of the glaze on the bottom ( top ) of the cake .
Allow to sit for five minutes .
Invert the cake onto a serving plate .
Prick surface a hundred times with a fork ( gently , please . )
Slowly drizzle remaining rum glaze all over the top of the cake , allowing it to drip down the sides .
Cool to room temperature before serving to ensure glaze has soaked in .
Eat. Enjoy .
And do n’t feel guilty .
It ’s Christmastime !

Christmas is coming !
Have you heard ?
The Cast of Characters : Yellow Cake Mix , Rum ( dark or light will work ) , Vanilla Pudding Mix , Eggs , Canola Oil , Water , Sugar , and Butter .
And a Bundt cake pan would be nice .
Preheat oven to 325 degrees .
Then pour the dry cake mix into a large mixing bowl .
Next , dump in the dry vanilla pudding mix .
Crack in four eggs .
Pour in 1/2 cup cold water …
1/2 cup canola oil …
And 1/2 cup rum .
Dark rum is best — it ’s what my mother - in - law uses — but I drank all my dark rum for breakfast before church yesterday morning and did n’t have any left .
I ’m kidding .
* Hiccup * I think .
Next , grab a big ol ’ whisk …
And mix it together ’ til smooth .
Measure a heaping cup of pecan halves .
The recipe calls for “ 1 cup chopped pecans ” , which means you chop the pecans , then measure .
So I just measure a heaping cup of pecan halves , figuring once they ’re all chopped up , they ’ll compress to about a cup .
But then again , I ’m pretty much a fly - by - the - seat - of - my - pants mess in the kitchen , so do n’t listen to me .
Now just chop away !
I like to chop them pretty finely , because I have an aversion to big chunks of nuts in my desserts .
I like ’em tiny .
But only in my desserts .
No hidden meaning in that remark .
And will you look at this !
1 cup of chopped pecans !
I feel like that Cajun chef , Justin…um … Justin something .
He used to be able to pour a teaspoon of salt into his hand , and transfer the salt into a teaspoon , and I ’ll be darned if it did n’t measure EXACTLY a teaspoon .
Only problem is , I ’m not Cajun .
I ’m also not a chef .
Next , you need to grease and flour your Bundt pan — which , in my world , means you grab the stuff in the blue can .
Look , I ’m all for doing things from scratch , but this stuff WORKS .
There are still a couple of baking recipes for which I wo n’t use this , but they ’re getting fewer and farther between .
Here ’s my Bundt pan ; I ’ve had it for years .
If I had it to do over again , I ’d prefer not to have a pan that ’s black inside , because whatever ’s baking seems to brown more quickly .
But I do n’t make Bundt cakes enough to really warrant buying a new one , so I usually decrease my baking time slightly .
Except this time .
I forgot .
Go ahead and spray the heck out of the pan .
Next , sprinkle in the chopped pecans .
Sometimes I also sprinkle some brown sugar over the nuts , but I forgot that , too .
But you feel free to remember , okay ?
It ’s not part of the original recipe , so it ’s entirely optional .
Now just pour the batter over the top of the nuts .
Work slowly so you can distribute it evenly .
Use a rubber spatula …
To even out the top .
You want the cake to bake evenly .
Now pop it into the oven for 1 hour — a little less if it ’s a black pan .
If you overbake it , the cake will be dry …and we do n’t want that .
Let the puddin ’ be all that it can be .
When the cake has about ten minutes left , go ahead and start the rum glaze , which , of course , must start with butter .
This is 1 stick ( 1/2 cup ) , but I wound up adding another 1 / 2 stick , totaling 3/4 cup .
Next , add 1/4 cup water …
And 1 1/2 cups sugar — a little more if you ’re feeling dangerous .
Stir together …
And bring to a gentle boil .
Continue cooking for 4 to 5 minutes , stirring constantly .
Turn off the burner so you wo n’t singe your eyebrows , and pour in 3/4 cup rum .
Stir together , then turn on the burner for thirty seconds , giving the new mixture a short boil .
The mixture will be quite thin , but syrupy .
Time to take the cake out of the oven !
And again , I forgot to decrease the baking time for my black pan .
Ideally , the cake wo n’t be totally pulled away from the sides of the pan .
But if it is , as long as it ’s not burned , it ’s fine .
Now the key here is to get the cake as moist as possible with the yummy , sweet glaze .
In a minute , we ’ll invert the cake , but before that , let ’s drizzle about 1/3 of the glaze over the bottom ( presently the top ) of the cake .
Drizzle it on slowly to give it a chance to seep in , and also let it drip down the sides and middle of the cake pan .
This glaze is going to provide some much - needed moisture .
Let it sit for five minutes to ensure that the glaze seeps in .
After five minutes , invert the cake by placing a cake plate upside down on top of the Bundt pan .
Holding on tightly , flip the pan over so that the Bundt pan is upside down on top of the cake plate .
And because of the nonstick baking spray we used , the pan will lift right off — no harm , no foul .
Hello , my beautiful love - muffin … I mean love - cake .
( You ’ll notice that the part of the cake that was touching the black pan is on the verge of being overly brown .
Not that that will stop me from gorging myself on it or anything . )
Next , grab a fork and begin pricking the cake with the tines .
This is very important , because we want the glaze to be able to seep into the cake .
Just prick - prick - prick all over the sides and top .
All in all , I ’d say I pricked the cake about a hundred times .
And do n’t be violent about it .
Just sing your favorite song , gently poking and pricking along the way .
By the time the first chorus is over , you ’ll be done .
Pricking .
I just ca n’t type that word any more .
Sorry .
Next , begin drizzling the rum glaze over the top of the cake , allowing it to slowly drip down the sides .
Try to keep as much on the cake as possible , but some glaze WILL run down the sides and pool at the bottom of the cake .
The whole glazing process should take five to ten minutes or so .
Be patient .
You really want the glaze to sink into that cake .
And use every last drop from the pan .
Rum glaze is a terrible thing to waste .
Oh , Lord .
How good does THIS look ?
Now .
This is important :
Allow the cake to cool to room temperature , because it tastes better that way , and besides , the rum glaze needs to continue seeping into the cake .
And believe me , the wait is worth it ..
Enjoy !
This rum cake is perfect for holiday parties .
And I ’m having it for breakfast tomorrow .
Do n’t tell anyone .
It ’s like the scene in Gone With the Wind when Rhett says to Scarlett , “ I know you drink in private and I know how MUCH you drink .
You think I care if you like your brandy ? ”
I ’ll bet Scarlett regularly had rum cake for breakfast .
Saucy little minx .
In the end of June this year , President Barack Obama signed the Car Allowance Rebate System ( CARS ) Act .
The Cash for Clunkers program helps car owners purchase a new , fuel - efficient automobile after trading in a less fuel - efficient vehicle .
Pursuant to the CARS
Act car transactions made after July 1 , 2009 , are eligible for CARS program credits .
The Cash for Clunkers program offers a great deal for car buyers , the automobile industry and the economy in general by generating a considerable amount of excitement and controversy .
Does the CARS program , in fact , guarantee that you will be getting a good deal ?
Pros :
1. First , and the most important , car owners may be able to get rid of their old vehicle , to save a lot of money on a new car purchase .
2. CARS
Act helps you purchase a more fuel efficient vehicle , thus decreasing individual owners ’ and the nation ’s oil consumption .
3 . Purchasing a new vehicle will cut down on repair costs .
4 . Taking into consideration that new vehicles are cleaner , the program will decrease vehicle exhaust emissions , lessening the impact on the environment .
Cons :
1 . Through the program you will receive only $ 3,500 or $ 4,500 for the trade - in , regardless of its previous trade - in value .
The program may not benefit you if your vehicle is worth more or even just about that same amount .
2 . The bill will most likely generate an artificial , unsustainable boom in auto sales , which will be temporary and later the car sales will drop back to their original levels , if not lower .
The fact is , a $ 3,500 discount only saves one about $ 50 per month on his / her payments , thus only those who could afford a new car payment and intended to buy one anyway will benefit .
3 . While on one hand boosting the vehicle sales industry , the program will significantly harm mechanic and repair shop operations .
Most small shops focus on repairing old vehicle thus if these vehicles are off the road then they stand to lose a great deal of business .
4 . Not all cars will qualify for this program .
The vehicle has to be old , but not more than 25 years old .
It 's time to raise a glass ( of heavy water ) to a longer life
For centuries mankind has sought the secret of a long and healthy life .
And for centuries it seems we were looking in the wrong place .
Forget exotic pills and potions , the key to prolonged life could be as simple as a glass of water .
Scientists believe ' heavy water ' enriched with a rare form of hydrogen could add as much as ten years to life .
And by also modifying foods , such as steak and eggs , with the hydrogen the way could be cleared to allowing us to eat and drink our way to a healthy old age .
The idea is the brainchild of Mikhail Shchepinov , a former Oxford University scientist .
Elixir of life : ' Heavy ' water could increase your lifespan by 10 years , say scientists
It centres on fortifying the body 's tissues and cells against attack and decay caused by free radicals , dangerous chemicals produced when food is turned into energy .
Such ' attacks ' on proteins are particularly damaging and have been linked to cancer , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
Dr Shchepinov 's theory is based on deuterium , a naturally - occurring isotope , or form of hydrogen , that strengthens the bonds in between and around the body 's cells , making them less vulnerable to attack .
He found that water enriched with deuterium , which is twice as heavy as normal hydrogen , extends the lifespan of worms by 10 per cent .
And fruitflies fed the ' water of life ' lived up to 30 per cent longer .
He now believes people could also benefit from the sweet - tasting water , or from deuterium - enriched ' heavy foods ' .
Foods could be created by either directly supplementing them with deuterium or by enriching the feed of farm animals , this week 's New Scientist reports .
Dr Shchepinov said recently : ' We do n't have to be consuming isotopes as white powder .
If you take a pig and feed these things to a pig , all you need to do is consume the pig in normal fashion . '
The technology was likely to be tested in pet food first , he added .
Dr Shchepinov runs biotech firm Retrotope whose scientific advisers include Aubrey de Grey , a controversial ageing guru .
Dr de Grey , a ' bio - gerontologist ' who leads the Methuselah Foundation , a charity which aims for ' the defeat of age - related disease and the indefinite extension of the healthy human lifespan ' , said the research was ' extremely promising ' .
He said deuterium existed in all living matter at a certain level and it was a case of introducing it in a ' more targeted manner ' .
There was no radiation involved , he added .
Dr Judith Campisi , of the Buck Institute for Age Research in California , said : ' I 've heard some pretty crazy ideas about how we might live longer but I 'm intrigued by this . '
But Tom Kirkwood , of Newcastle University , said : ' Shchepinov 's idea is interesting but . . . the history in the field is cluttered with hypotheses which are only partially supported by the data . '
Among mammals a larger proportion of females than males reproduce , the extent of the imbalance signalled by gender differences in size .
Elephant seal males are three times as massive as females , while gibbons are characterised by physical equality .
The former play winner - take - all , amassing huge harems .
Exclusive possession requires violence to enforce , a reason for the shorter life - expectancy of elephant seal males .
In contrast the gibbon is a monogamist , entering into a cooperative pair bond to defend shared territory and raise offspring .
Evolution 's logic by which the future belongs to the fecund is operative in both cases , but there 's more than one way to skin the cat .
Obviously the size difference in our own species is modest , so some anthropologists may emphasise pair bonds while others argue for a more fluid serial monogamy , but in both cases the presumed evolutionary norm is not extreme polygamy .
Despite these biological truisms , cultural anthropologists know that most societies not only accept polygamy , but idealise it , while evolutionary geneticists report super - male lineages such as that of Genghis Khan which are incredibly fertile .
No one suggests that the conqueror was super - human in size , rather , he illustrates how societies can be converted into a winner - takes - all game .
It is not true that Genghis Khan said the best thing in life was " To crush your enemies , see them driven before you , and to hear the lamentation of their women . "
But there is a reason why many find this myth plausible .
Civilisation has borne witness to the rise of radical inequality ( pdf ) , cultures where the accumulation of wealth and women are the pinnacles of achievement .
Abraham , Jacob and Solomon were the fathers of nations by their many wives as well as slave - owning autocrats .
Hunter - gatherers are no angels , but the structural constraints of their economic system renders it impossible for an ambitious male to control all of a band 's wealth and support dozens of wives .
A custom 's ubiquity does not speak to its virtue .
Because of the adoption of Greco - Roman monogamous norms by western Christianity , Europeans are among the cultures which have rejected polygamy .
During periods of great inequality of power , even self - styled autocrats such as Henry VIII took only one wife at a time .
It was this European society , where elite males were peculiarly constrained in their marital excesses , which eventually led the economic revolution which has so reduced inequality in income over the past two centuries .
Even the gilded - age plutocrat never considered openly collecting women as a sign of power and privilege , so naturally the working man had a reasonable expectation of finding a mate .
Since 1970 the gains in income have gone mostly to the elites , as they did before 1800 .
A positive vision of a society characterised by a modicum of social and economic equality has given way to the liberal individualist ethos , where personal choice is supreme .
Perhaps western societies will revert to the " normal " human type , and accept the inevitability of both radical inequality of marriage and income , becoming Saudis in cloudy climes .
Republican National Convention News Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney gave warmup speeches last night in St. Paul , mostly avoiding any mention of John McCain .
Their speeches could be seen as tryouts for the start of the 2012 campaign in the event Obama is elected President .
Then came the first star of the night , Rudy Giuliani , who attacked Barack Obama bitterly , his voiced dripping with sarcasm the whole time he spoke .
The audience loved it , cheering and giving him a standing ovation over and over .
At one point he mocked Obama for changing his position on so many things , adding : " I hope for his sake , Joe Biden got that VP thing in writing . "
It was vintage Giuliani at its best .
Then came Sarah Palin 's debut for a national audience .
Her speech was written by former White House speechwriter Matthew Scully but she has been rehearsing it for several days with McCain aides coaching her .
Normally , experienced politicians work with speech writers to polish the words , but with such an important speech from someone who has never given a prepared speech to a national audience before , a pro had to write this one .
The speech was powerful and feisty , as expected , and she continued the theme of mocking Obama .
Referring to his first job as a community organizer , she said that being a small town mayor is like being a community organizer , except you have real responsibilities .
She said he has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform , not even in the state senate .
She noted he can give a speech about the wars America is fighting and not use the word " victory " except when he 's talking about his own campaign .
It was a red meat speech and the delegates were delirious .
There is no doubt Palin is an enormous hit with the Republican base .
She electrified the crowd , no two ways about it .
They just loved her .
Any doubts they may have had about her are gone .
What we do n't know yet is how suburban women in Missouri and unemployed factory workers in Ohio are going to react .
Palin and Earmarks
One thing Palin did not mention at all is the touchy subject of earmarks -- spending items inserted into other bills that benefit specific congressional districts or other regions .
These are what are called pork .
John McCain has been a vociferous opponent of them , calling them government waste .
He promises to end them .
Until this week , she has been a strong advocate of getting pork for Alaska .
In fact , she was a strong proponent of the $ 400 million " bridge to nowhere " until it was clear that it was n't going to fly , when she switched sides and opposed it .
As mayor of Wassilla she actively lobbied for many earmarks for her town .
CQ
Politics has the story .
McCain 's Acceptance Speech Tonight Tonight John McCain gets the undivided attention of the nation ( and the rest of the world ) when he makes his acceptance speech .
At one time he considered making it from the Gulf Coast , but it will be made from the convention center in Minnesota .
What will he talk about ?
His biography as a war hero ?
The war in Iraq ?
The threat from Iran ?
The economy ?
He can certainly attack Barack Obama and will do so , but he has to convince people that they should vote for him because he would be a good President not just because Obama would be a bad one .
Unlike Obama 's speech which introduced him to the millions of people who still did n't know him very well , everyone has a pretty good idea of what McCain is like so he has an easier task .
Still , he has to define what this campaign and his presidency would be about .
This is his big chance .
Politico has some ideas what he might emphasize .
McCain 's Fellow Prisoner of War Makes Ad A Navy veteran , Philip Butler , who went to the Naval Academy with John McCain and later was a prisoner of war with him in Vietnam has made an independent ad in which he says : " I think I can say with authority that the prisoner - of - war experience is not a good prerequisite for president of the United States . "
This ad is , of course , reminiscent of the ad by the Swift Boat veterans for Truth ad used so effectively against John Kerry in 2004 .
Butler says it is different however .
He is not demeaning McCain 's service and has great respect for the man , but having been a prisoner of war himself is questioning the idea that you learn a lot from the experience .
He also says that he knows McCain well and is worried about his explosive temper .
McCain and Actuarial Life Expectancy Politico ran a story about the probability of a 72 - year - old man reaching the age of 80 based on actuarial tables .
There is a chance of about 1 in 3 that he wo n't make it .
If you are fascinated by morbidity , Met Life has a do - it - yourself Webform but to do this one you need information about the prospective insurance client 's height and weight and some other data .
Of course actuarial data is great about predicting how many of 100,000 72 - year - olds will make it to 80 but does n't give a definitive answer about any particular one .
Other factors come into play .
In the case of John McCain these include : The President gets the best medical care from the best doctors anywhere on the planet .
The President can have a physical every day if he wants one .
Nothing goes undetected long .
McCain has had the most lethal form of skin cancer ( malignant melanoma ) four times .
McCain smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for most of his adult life but has now quit .
McCain 's father died at 71 and his grandfather died at 61 .
His mother is hale at 96 .
No conclusion here , but Sarah Palin 's chances of having to take the oath of office unexpectedly are much greater than Dick cheney 's were in 2000 since George Bush was much younger and extremely fit physically .
Arizona House Races
There were bitter primaries in Arizona on Tuesday for the open House seat being vacated by Rick Renzi ( R ) who is being dogged by a number of corruption charges .
The winner on the Democratic side is former Arizona house member Ann Kirkpatrick .
The Republican candidate is Sydney Hay , a housewife who also runs a small fitness business from her home .
This is a swing district ( R+2 ) and the two women will fight a pitched battle here , with both national parties getting deeply involved .
The Republican primary in AZ - 05 to choose the opponent in Rep. Harry Mitchell ( D - AZ ) is still too close to call .
David Schweikert has a tiny lead of Susan Smith , but the absentee ballots have not yet been counted .
Today 's Polls CNN commissioned Opinion Research to run conduct polls in three key states .
Iowa , which George Bush won in 2004 , seems to be turning into a rout for Obama .
He has been ahead there all year , but his lead is now 15 points , 55 % to 40 % .
It will be close to impossible for McCain to overturn that .
Minnesota is a state Kerry won , but only by 3 points .
Obama now leads there 53 % to 41 % .
But this poll was taken before the convention , which is getting saturation coverage in the state .
McCain will likely reduce this lead by next week .
Finally , Ohio is still a cliffhanger , with Obama ahead 47 % to 45 % .
No Republican has even been elected President without Ohio , so this state will continue to be a huge battleground .
State Obama McCain Start End Pollster Iowa 55 % 40 % Aug 31 Sep 02 Opinion Research Minnesota 53 % 41 % Aug 31 Sep 02 Opinion Research Ohio 47 % 45 % Aug 31 Sep 02 Opinion Research
There are no nonpartisan polls for the Senate today , but it is worth noting in passing that a Democracy Corps poll in the North Carolina Senate race puts state senator Kay Hagan ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Dole 50 % to 45 % .
Now Democracy Corps. is a Democratic outfit so this result wo n't go in the data base , and partisan pollsters have been known to shade the results a little bit , but with numbers like this a Dole landslide , which some people were expecting , seems less likely .
The race might actually be quite competitive .
DSCC chairman is going to be pouring money into this state like there is no tomorrow and Obama has a huge organization on the ground registering voters , which helps Hagan .
We have our first poll in the NM - 01 seat vacated by Heather Wilson ( R ) when she ran ( unsuccessfully ) for the New Mexico Senate nomination .
Albuquerque city council member Martin Heinrich ( D ) is leading Bernalillo County sheriff Darren White 56 % to 51 % in this D+2 district giving the Democrats an excellent chance of flipping yet another House seat .
No matter what happens in the presidential election , all signs point to the Democrats picking up 10 - 20 House seats , possibly more .
These races fall one at a time with hardly anyone watching , but they add up .

Pete ’s Perspective
By Peter Schiller
In early October when I started this blog , Nathan , a reader asked what my opinion was on the use of pitch counts in major league baseball .
Sorry for the delay Nathan !
This topic , like the use of modern day Bullpens , are both subjects that I definately have an opinion on .
Both of these articles show my “ Old School ” thinking on baseball .
I guess you can say that I ’m sort of a hybrid baseball thinker .
So here it goes …
It is my opinion that there is a good use for pitch counts in major league baseball , but only in certain circumstances .
To use them across the board like teams do these days is a bit too extreme if you ask me !
I think it is an intelligent practice when used for pitchers that have arm or shoulder problems , are in spring training , are older or are in rehab assignments .
I understand that with player ’s salaries the way they are today , that ownership wants to protect their investments by proecting their pitchers .
One way of doing this is by implementing this method of using pitch counts .
Even given this understanding , I still do n’t agree with the over use of this method .
Teams are not optimizing their talent , but instead are being overprotected of all of their pitchers , not just the stars of their pitching staffs .
For example , I have no problem using pitch counts if a player is coming off arm or shoulder surgery of any kind ( rotator cuff , Tommy John , etc. ) .
I think that the use of pitch count in limiting a pitcher ’s duration in a game in this situation is a wise move .
Pitchers are prideful creatures that would rather have their arm fall off than be taken out of a game in the middle of an inning ( for the most part ) .
In this situation , if you do n’t use pitch counts , you chance the player re-injuring the sugically repaired arm or shoulder .
Other good times to use this method are with rookies who have yet to pitch in a 162 game season or in aging players who are struggling to stay healthy over the same 162 games that use to NOT cause them a problem in years past .
For an example of this , see Roger Clemens , this is why he has n’t started until around May the past few years .
Although he is a shoe in for a first ballot Hall of Fame selection , his body just has n’t allowed him to play a full season without giving up on him in August or September when it counts the most !
All other use of this method , in my opinion , is overkill !
To the best of my knowledge , and please correct me if I ’m wrong , but what happens when this method is adopted is that pitchers ( in general ) no longer throw on the side , in warm ups or at any other times like they use to in years past .
American pitchers simply do not throw enough !.
In order to get their arms to full strength and possibly to even strengthen them , you have to throw .
Do n’t just take my word on it , he ’s what some men currently in the game professionally have said concerning the use of pitch counts .
In Japan , they approach things a little differently .
Here is part of an article I found last off season where Tom Verducci , in the Sports Economist ( from 8/7/07 ) , asked former major league manager Bobby Valentine , naow a manager in Japan for a number of years , about how they handle pitchers over in the Japanesse Baseball League .
Valentine … admits that he too coddled pitchers in the majors , though it took understanding the Japanese throwing philosophy for him to see the error of that ccepted practice .
“ The Japanese pitchers have superior mechanics , ” Valentine says .
“ They also have wonderful balance and core and foundation strength .
They work the small muscle groups , and [ Americans ] work the large ones .
The large ones make you look better .
Valentine allows most of his starters to throw 200 bullpen pitches a day in the spring .
“ They have been doing it forever and have not broken down , ” he says .
On the day before a starter takes the mound , he ’ll throw 90 pitches in the pen and , Valentine says , “ have [ his ] best fastball in the ninth inning ” the next day .
It is my hope that Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Boston Red Sox can help drill this Japanesse approach into our American minds & help change the way that teams in the MLB use pitch counts .
He can influence a change in approach by keeping up with his routine while being a very effective major league pitcher .
In an article from USA Today ’s My Wire on 9/17/04 , then Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone had this to say about pitch counts and he ’s still one of the most respected ( yet “ Old School ” ) pitching coaches in the game today .
“ We pay attention to pitch counts , but there are a bunch of priorities ahead of pitch counts , ” says Atlanta ’s Leo Mazzone , one of the best pitching coaches .
“ You use common sense .
What if a guy ’s out there , he ’s got a hundred pitches and he is n’t tired ?
There might be a time when a guy has less than 90 pitches and is shot .
A guy ’s face , his mound presence , his mechanics are going to tell me much more than any pitch count . ”
** For anyone who disagrees with me on this , please chime in & if enough people do so , I ’ll publish those comments outside of the comment section as a later post or as an extention of this post ( at the bottom ) .**
Return to Transcripts main page CNN CAPITAL GANG Analysis of Republican Election Wins in White House , House and Senate , and the Future of the Democratic Party ; Arafat 's Health Creates Concerns On Both Sides Aired November 6 , 2004 - 19:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
ANNOUNCER : Live from Washington , THE CAPITAL GANG .
MARK SHIELDS , HOST : Welcome to THE CAPITAL GANG .
I'm Mark Shields , with the full GANG , Al Hunt , Robert Novak , Kate O'Beirne and Margaret Carlson .
George W. Bush became the first presidential candidate since 1988 to win more than 50 percent of the popular vote , but a Bush margin of only 136,000 votes out of 5.5 million cast in Ohio kept Senator John Kerry from winning the Electoral College with a minority of the popular vote .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE WALKER BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I 've earned capital in this election , and I 'm going to spend it for -- for what I -- what I told the people I 'd spend it on , Social Security and tax reform , moving this economy forward , education , fighting and winning the war on terror .
RICHARD CHENEY , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : President Bush ran forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation 's future , and the nation responded by giving him a mandate .
SEN .
JOHN KERRY ( D - MA ) , FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
We must find common cause .
We must join in common effort , without remorse or recrimination , without anger or rancor .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Bob Novak , is 51 percent of the vote really a mandate ?
BOB NOVAK , CAPITAL GANG :
Of course it is .
It 's a 3.5 million vote margin .
But the people who are saying that it is n't a mandate are the same people who were predicting that John Kerry would win .
When -- the people who did some kind of studies on it , such as the " Evans Novak Political Report " ...
( LAUGHTER )
NOVAK : ... which for weeks had been saying that Bush was going to win -- see , the thing is that a lot of people in this town , the chattering class , the politicians , the nice liberals all around the eastern seacoast , they -- they let their heart talk instead of their heads .
And I 'm afraid some of the people at this -- at this table really thought so .
So the people who say there 's not a mandate want the president , now that he 's won , to say , Oh , we 're going to accept the liberalism that the -- that the voters rejected .
But Mark , this is a conservative country , and it showed it on last Tuesday .
SHIELDS : I always knew Bob would be very humble in victory , and whatever ...
NOVAK : Do n't count on it !
SHIELDS : The olive branch just withered in his hand .
We 're talking about predictions .
Let 's be very frank .
I was wrong in my prediction .
I predicted John Kerry'd have 281 electoral votes .
Kate O'Beirne was right in every one of the predictions .
I mean , she was right in the Electoral College and the House and the Senate , even without being a subscriber to " Evans Novak Political Report " !
( LAUGHTER )
KATE O'BEIRNE , CAPITAL GANG :
Now do you want me to give you the right interpretation , Mark ?
SHIELDS : Yes .
Yes .
O'BEIRNE : Given my track record .
( CROSSTALK )
O'BEIRNE : This was -- this was ...
SHIELDS : ... the post - mortem .
O'BEIRNE :
This was a very , very big win !
George Bush boosted his margin in 45 out of 50 states .
He won on the issue of terrorism .
He won on the issue of taxes .
He won on moral values .
More voters trusted him on the economy than John Kerry .
He won on the personal characteristics of strong leader , crucial , clear on the issues .
It was a very big win -- up among Hispanics dramatically , up among women .
Had he not been up against what he was up against -- this is what 's especially bad news for the Democrats -- an unpopular war , a sketchy economy , high gas prices and the most slanted media coverage in history , it would have been even a bigger win .
It 's a big enough win , given the breadth of issues , the -- across the states , that of course , he has a mandate .
SHIELDS : It 's gone from a mandate to a big enough win .
Al Hunt , if I 'm not mistaken -- I do n't pretend to be Arnold Toynbee , our great historical scholar -- but I think this is the smallest margin a reelected president has received since Woodrow Wilson in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes !
I do n't think the ...
( CROSSTALK )
NOVAK : ... how about Truman ?
SHIELDS : I do n't think they call -- he was not a reelected president .
AL HUNT , CAPITAL GANG :
It was also -- it was also ...
( CROSSTALK )
HUNT : It was smaller than Truman 's margin .
But you 're absolutely right , Mark .
Kate , I agree with you .
If he had governed well in the first term , it would have been a bigger reelection .
And Bob , I just -- I hope someday you 'll tell us how we can get that Evans Novak newsletter because ...
NOVAK : Pay for it !
HUNT : Would you -- oh .
Well , see , I can't afford it .
It was only wealthy people , I guess , knew who was going to win the election .
SHIELDS : Corporate fat cats get it !
HUNT : Mark , there were a couple things that made this seem -- that I think made this seem like a huge victory .
No. 1 was the surprise , in the sense that Bob Novak , of course , who 's always smarter than the rest of us , knew .
But I think the weekend polls showed it was going to be a nip - and - tuck race .
The early exit polls that were leaked all over the place on Tuesday said that Kerry was going to win .
The same thing with the scope , not just a -- you know , a Bush victory , which was not huge , but -- but the Senate and the House .
And so the president starts with a strong hand .
There is no question .
I would just suggest that when you look at what 's ahead that nothing has changed the fact that there is a nightmare in Iraq .
I mean , we are -- you know , we may be blowing Fallujah back to the Stone Age , but I do n't think those terrorists there are looking at the returns in the Marietta , Ohio , precincts .
I think they 're going to be as bad as ever .
And domestically , the president wants to do Social Security partial privatization , tax reform and make tax cuts for the rich permanent .
I would suggest he better pick a priority because he 's not going to get all three done .
And finally , I would just say that I think he 's only going to get some big things done if he has genuine bipartisan cooperation on some of these issues .
( LAUGHTER )
( CROSSTALK )
SHIELDS : Margaret Carlson , Karl Rove -- Karl Rove , to his credit , came out and said he got more votes than anybody in history .
Jim Webb ( ph ) , who was Ronald Reagan 's secretary of the Navy , pointed out that there were 65 million more people ...
MARGARET CARLSON , CAPITAL GANG : Yes , right !
SHIELDS : ... in the country in 2004 than there were in 1984 .
He beat Ronald Reagan 's 1984 ...
O'BEIRNE : Keep telling yourself that !
( CROSSTALK )
SHIELDS : But I mean -- but that , as a percentage -- Ronald Reagan got 59 percent , carried 49 states in 1984 .
That was a sweep .
O'BEIRNE : And it was a lonely victory .
He did n't bring in any -- look at the coattails George Bush had !
SHIELDS : Kate ...
O'BEIRNE : He picked up seats ...
SHIELDS : Kate , we want you ...
O'BEIRNE : ... on -- in a historical
SHIELDS : ... to be humble in victory .
CARLSON : Kate ...
SHIELDS : We just said ...
O'BEIRNE : I 'm just saying !
CARLSON : Kate ...
SHIELDS : We said you 're a prophet , Kate .
O'BEIRNE : Kate ...
O'BEIRNE : Picked up seats in the Senate and the House !
CARLSON : Kate , stop gloating .
SHIELDS : Margaret ?
CARLSON : Kate , it 's not a -- it 's not attractive .
Listen , despite the scholarship of the " Evans Novak Report , " Bob , in fact , was wrong in his predictions .
Listen ...
HUNT : Margaret , let 's chip in together .
Maybe we can get it .
CARLSON : Yes .
Bush acted as if he had a mandate when he was n't elected but appointed .
So I think he 's going to ...
SHIELDS : Good point .
CARLSON : ... behave as if he has one now ...
SHIELDS : Good point .
CARLSON : ... whether or not ...
SHIELDS : Very good point .
CARLSON : ... this 1 percent is historic or not .
NOVAK : One percent ?
CARLSON : One percent .
SHIELDS : Over a majority , 51 percent .
CARLSON : Yes .
Yes , 51 percent .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : So yes ...
( CROSSTALK )
NOVAK : That 's the new math !
That 's the new math .
All right .
SHIELDS : In other words , he won by half as much as Bill Clinton did in 1996 .
NOVAK : Oh , Jesus !
CARLSON : Right .
Right .
But you know , Sam Rayburn said , Watch out for your majorities .
They can sometimes hurt you .
And this could happen this time if he goes too far .
And in fact , you know , people are coming to him and saying , Listen , we want to be paid off , like on judges , and I think he 's going to have a hard time with that .
I think the hopes rest , in the Senate certainly , on the moderates blocking some of these things like Social Security ...
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : ... and the permanent tax cuts ...
O'BEIRNE : The public approved of the job George Bush did in the first four years , and they gave him another four to continue more of the same !
Look , a major problem for the Democrats ...
SHIELDS : Kate !
Kate , Kate , Kate .
Easy .
Easy .
O'BEIRNE : The major problem is this ...
( CROSSTALK )
SHIELDS : ... just want other people to have a chance to speak .
But go ahead .
NOVAK : I want to just -- I want to just say one thing ...
HUNT : She 's on high .
( CROSSTALK )
NOVAK : ... one more thing .
The people ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) watching out here in Kansas and other places may not know what 's going on in this city , that there 's absolute rage that Kerry has lost because they expected him to win .
And the columns that have been written -- not Al Hunt 's -- not yours , Al -- but the columns have been written in " The Washington Post " op - ed page and " The New York Times " op - ed -- they 're just vicious !
There 's just a rage that the American people have elected this person .
And I -- I think it is absolutely funny .
CARLSON : Well , you know , I think it was a little more ...
HUNT : Let me just add this about ...
CARLSON : ... disappointing that ...
HUNT : John Kerry was not the perfect candidate .
I agree with that .
But you know something ?
It was n't John Kerry , the candidate , that lost this election .
I mean , I will agree that , basically , Bush won this election .
There is no question of that .
If Kerry had run a perfect campaign , he would have lost .
And the final point I 'd make , Mark , is let 's do away with exit polls , OK ?
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : The exit polls led us to live out six hours of the Kerry administration , so I think some of the disappointment the next day was -- was keener .
But Bush did not run on his record from the first term .
So it is not as if it 's a validation of that record .
If he'd run on the economy and the war , he would not have won .
NOVAK : Get over it , Margaret !
SHIELDS : Quick .
Quick .
O'BEIRNE : Hopefully , Democrats and liberals will continue to delude themselves the way we 're hearing tonight .
SHIELDS : OK .
And I 'd simply -- I 'd simply say John -- George Bush won this race .
The race was about George Bush .
It was a referendum on George Bush .
He won .
No question about it .
I never heard Bob say , after Bill Clinton won by twice as big a margin first time , and even -- close to three times as big a margin in 1996 , that he had won a mandate .
I never heard there was a question ...
NOVAK : Because he did n't get half the vote !
SHIELDS : Oh !
CARLSON : There was a third party , Bob !
SHIELDS : That 's it .
OK .
Thank you , Bob .
The GANG of five will be back with the Republicans recrowned as kings of the Hill .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : This is -- Welcome back .
Republicans kept their majorities in both houses of Congress .
In the Senate , Republicans now enjoy a 55 - to - 45 edge after gaining four seats , including that of Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
GEORGE ALLEN ( R-VA ) , NATIONAL GOP SENATORIAL COMMITTEE : I said during this campaign that if John Thune could beat Tom Daschle , that would be like winning three votes or three seats .
And indeed , it is .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
This is a governing coalition with the president and the House and the Senate that is going to be right of center .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : The election 's high point for the Democrats was Barack Obama becoming the new United States senator from Illinois .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BARACK OBAMA ( D - IL ) , SENATOR -ELECT :
It 's important for us to be able to work across party lines and build up from the places we agree to , rather than just assume that we can steamroll whichever side is not in power .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : In the U.S. House , Republicans expand their advantage by at least two seats , thanks to five seats picked up in the Texas redistricting .
Three races still remain undecided .
While Senator Daschle is gone , Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi of California remains the House Democratic leader .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
REP .
TOM REYNOLDS , NATIONAL GOP CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE :
She lost seats .
This is a demoralizing loss for House Democrats , and it 's personally damaging to Leader Pelosi .
REP .
NANCY PELOSI ( D - CA ) , MINORITY LEADER :
We had campaigns that will now hold the Republican members , if they are new or if they are reelected , to a different standard , that they have to honor the commitments they are making to their -- their own constituents and that the spotlight will be on them .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Al Hunt , does this election result in a significant change in the balance of power on Capitol Hill ?
HUNT : Well , for Democrats , Tom Daschle 's loss does hurt three times as much .
George Allen is right on that .
Mark , in the House , I do n't think it really changes anything .
They may gain two or three or four more seats , but they had working control anyway , and I do n't think that 's going to be any different in the next Congress .
But the Senate , it does change the landscape , and it's a very difficult environment for the Democrats .
They face a Republican leader who is principally interested in himself running for president in four years .
They ...
SHIELDS : Bill Frist ...
( CROSSTALK )
HUNT : They have Democrats like Chris Dodd , who , after watching the election returns , are now talking about running for governor of Connecticut to get out of Dodge , if you will .
You look at that 2006 line - up , and there 's just no way the Democrats are going to pick up six seats and re-take control two years from now .
So it 's a pretty bleak picture .
There are only two things that could change that .
One , if there 's -- if the handful of Republican moderates in the Senate have any backbone .
That 's not something you usually rely on .
Or secondly , if the majority overreaches .
SHIELDS : Margaret Carlson , Tom Daschle , big loss , in part because the charge made against him was he was an obstructionist ?
Does that then sort of send a little fear through the ranks of the ...
CARLSON : Yes .
SHIELDS : ... remaining Democrats ?
CARLSON : He 'd become an obstructionist and he'd become a creature of Washington because he got a homestead exemption on his property here .
I think it would be a good task for a reporter to find out how many Republicans have those , and I think it 's quite a few .
Listen , it is , as Al says , not a friendly place for Democrats right now .
But remember in Bush 's first term when Charles Grassley , no moderate himself , told Bush , No , I 'm not going to push through that tax cut , and cut it in half .
You can count on some people to push back as a point of -- of honor , that it 's not right to do such big tax cuts , and it 's certainly not going to be right to make them all permanent when we are at war .
SHIELDS : Bob Novak ?
NOVAK : Dream on , Margaret .
The -- in the first place , the Tom Daschle game came to an end .
I would say conservatives are even more delighted by -- or just as delighted by Tom Daschle 's defeat as George W. Bush 's victory because he was playing this phony game of being a gold old boy in South Dakota , and he was a left - wing obstructionist in Washington .
And they 're just delighted to see that come to an end .
Secondly ,
Al , there has been a shift to the right in both chambers .
In the House , a couple of Republican liberals have gone out , and we have a lot of -- much more conservative bunch of new people coming in .
But really , in the Senate , when you have Jim DeMint and Tom Coburn -- Jim DeMint from South Carolina , Tom Coburn from Tennessee -- I mean , from Oklahoma -- I 'm sorry -- those people coming in , you really have a change in the whole climate in the Senate .
I would say that this -- this is a disastrous election for liberals .
SHIELDS : Kate O'Beirne , to show the strength of the Republican pull and the president 's own coattails , I guess -- I mean , Tom Coburn in Oklahoma said that girls should not -- in high school should not go to the restroom by themselves because of " rampant lesbianism " and ...
O'BEIRNE : Is it OK for me to talk now ?
SHIELDS : Sure .
O'BEIRNE : If it 's OK for me to talk now , let me say this .
SHIELDS : No , no .
But I mean ...
O'BEIRNE : For the third election ...
SHIELDS : ... it 's showing the strength ...
O'BEIRNE : For the third election in a row , Democrats have lost seats to Republicans .
What caught up with Tom Daschle is he 's a Washington liberal who pretends to be otherwise back home .
There are a lot of Democrats who are Washington liberals who pretend to be otherwise back home .
There are 12 Democratic senators who are serving in states that George Bush carried by more than 5 points .
They 're all vulnerable .
They were punished in 2002 for obstructing the president 's agenda .
They were punished again in 2004 .
And now we 'll see whether or not they want to continue doing this .
It 's crazy to think that if George Bush had somehow surrendered on judges or taxes that , what , the Democrats in the Senate would have passed tort reform or stopped pounding him on Iraq ?
That 's madness !
The president has a mandate from the public to continue his agenda .
I think that 's what they 're going to be doing with a stronger Senate .
NOVAK : The other thing , Mark , is this is -- the Republican control of the Congress is now moving into its second decade ...
O'BEIRNE : Yes .
NOVAK : ... and as Al said , no -- no relief in sight .
So really , the Democratic Party is really in a position of being the minority party .
SHIELDS : This election is an endorsement for George Bush 's policy in Iraq ?
NOVAK : I think it is .
I think it really is .
O'BEIRNE : Well , the majority of people saw Iraq as part of the war on terror .
That 's true .
And the majority of people barely approved going to Iraq .
That 's true .
CARLSON : Right .
O'BEIRNE : I do think Iraq in general overall hurt him , despite that .
SHIELDS : Last word , Kate O'Beirne .
Next on CAPITAL GANG , Democrats look to the future .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : Welcome back .
Democratic leaders in Congress assessed the future direction of their party .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PELOSI : Democrats are united .
We 're united around core principles of a secure and growing middle class .
We are prepared to go into this next Congress with an initiative , and not just a complaint .
SEN .
HARRY REID ( D - NV ) , MINORITY WHIP :
The president called me this morning .
We had a private discussion , but it was a nice discussion .
And as you know , yesterday I was working against him .
Today I 'm working with him .
Part of my Republicans .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Party chairman Terry McAuliffe said , quote , " This party is stronger than it 's ever been .
We 're in the best financial shape .
We now have , unlike four years ago , millions and millions of new supporters of this party .
We 're debt - free for the first time ever , and we 're beginning to build towards 2008 . "
Former Clinton White House chief of staff Leon Panetta voiced concern .
Quote , " We cannot ignore the swath of red states across the South and the Midwest .
The party of FDR has become the party of Michael Moore and ` Fahrenheit 911 , ' and it does not help us in big parts of the country , " end quote .
Margaret Carlson , who is right , Terry McAuliffe or Leon Panetta ?
CARLSON : Well , Terry 's right about money .
They have a lot of money , although , certainly , the 527s spent more on the Republican side than on the Democratic side .
But Leon Panetta is right in that -- listen , Karl Rove was able to make the election about things other than George Bush 's performance .
It was about , as they say in exit polls , " moral values , " as if everyone in the blue states has immoral values .
You know , the idea that people in the blue states want Britney Spears and Paris Hilton coming into their houses on TV is preposterous , but that government is going to change that is also preposterous .
You know , Bob Dole was the first person to do Viagra ads on television .
So the cultural thing I think is something we all agree on but do n't think that government can stop it .
On the other hand , the people who voted on " moral values " do n't think government can help them with a job or health care , only thinks the government can help on things like , you know , abortion and gay marriage and the culture .
SHIELDS : Kate .
O'BEIRNE : The majority of Americans think we 're safer under George Bush .
That 's his record .
The majority of Americans trust him on terrorism , and more Americans trust him on the economy than trust John Kerry .
That 's all his record .
The Democrats -- Leon Panetta 's exactly right .
The Democrats have got to stop being so contemptuous of social conservative voters .
Long -- many years ago , they wrote off Christian evangelicals , and they paid a very high price for that .
Now they run the risk of writing off huge numbers of other voters .
The Democrats nominated a Catholic veteran .
Catholics and veterans voted against him .
Massachusetts Catholics voted against him .
Massachusetts Catholics supported John Bush by -- George Bush by 17 points over what they did in 2000 .
Now , are they going to write off traditional Catholic voters , like they 've written off evangelicals ?
SHIELDS : Al Hunt .
HUNT : Well , the Catholic vote almost split even .
Bush barely won it .
Mark , I have ...
O'BEIRNE : But they ...
( CROSSTALK )
HUNT : ... never seen -- I 've been in this town now for 35 years .
I 've never seen Democrats as down as I 've seen the last three or four days .
There is no question of that .
They really are depressed , not just because -- because it was a bit of a surprise that they lost as convincingly as they did , but as I said earlier , as they look ahead , they do n't see anything that 's particularly good on the -- on the horizon .
So I think they have a lot of problems that I think Terry McAuliffe glossed over a lot .
There are a couple things , though , that are -- that he said that are right .
They do have a financial base that they did n't have before .
Before , they relied on the fat cats .
That got them every -- they now have a direct mail .
They have huge numbers of contributors .
The Internet is to Democrats what talk radio has been to Republicans .
That is n't going to help them in 2006 .
I do n't know how it 's going to help them in 2008 .
But it builds a base .
They do , however , have to figure out some way -- I agree with Kate on this -- to talk to people out there in middle America .
They have not done that .
I think the debates over the next couple weeks are going to be largely ideological .
I think that misses the point .
( CROSSTALK )
SHIELDS : Let me go to you , but let me just make one point on that .
The Democrats , quite frankly -- you know , they are dispirited and disappointed , but I think there 's a couple of very bright spots .
The party was unified .
They put aside factionalism this time .
NOVAK : Oh !
SHIELDS : They --
Bob , do you want to hear me , or do you want to just make ...
( CROSSTALK )
NOVAK : ... comment on it .
SHIELDS : ... sighs , and so forth ?
In addition to that , they won a majority of the young voters .
They won a majority of the independents .
And Terry McAuliffe is absolutely right .
This party is no longer narcotically dependent upon the six - figure soft money contributions .
They have as many small contributors as the Republicans .
NOVAK : Mark , you may feel that way , but the Democrats I talk to are -- are despondent .
And the real problem , which they wo n't recognize , is they are a liberal party in a conservative country .
That is a real problem .
Now , I want to say a word about Terry McAuliffe , who is a wheeler - dealer in Washington , never should have been party chairman .
He was foisted on the party by Bill and Hillary Clinton .
And all he thinks of is money !
That 's the way he operated in Washington .
And what he did was , he forced through that accelerated primary schedule , which meant that the minute John Kerry won in Iowa , he was the nominee , whether he was a good candidate or not .
And I think he 's been a disaster for ...
( CROSSTALK )
HUNT : ... because he was a lobbyist , I assume you think that our friend , Ed Gillespie , is a wheeler - dealer , too .
SHIELDS : Yes , and Haley Barbour , and then go right through -- do you want to do that , Bob ?
Do you want to do that ?
NOVAK : If you think Ed Gillespie has been running the Republican Party the last two years , you 're more delusional than I thought .
HUNT : No , I think ...
SHIELDS : I 've been ...
( CROSSTALK )
SHIELDS : I 've been critical of Terry McAuliffe on certain policy things , but let 's -- he had 250,000 contributors to the Democratic Party ...
NOVAK : Oh , that 's just wonderful .
SHIELDS : ... when he came there .
When he came there !
There are now -- there are now several million that contributed , and it was -- it 's the first time in history that the Democratic Party has been solvent .
NOVAK : Well , congratulations that he did such a wonderful job in the last -- in the last four years .
They really -- they really had a great four years !
More four years like that , there wo n't be -- they 'll be like the Whig party !
SHIELDS : Is that the end , Bob ?
NOVAK : That 's all .
SHIELDS : That 's all ?
Boy , that 's all you have to hear .
You can tell how humble Bob Novak is in victory .
He 's a wonderful -- you 've seen bad winners ?
This is a sore winner .
Coming up in the second half of THE CAPITAL GANG , our " Sidebar " story , Senator Arlen Specter 's unsolicited advice to President Bush on his nominations to the Supreme Court .
We 'll go " Beyond the Beltway " to look at Yasser Arafat 's declining health and the future of Palestinian leadership .
And our " Outrages of the Week . "
That 's all after these messages and the latest news headlines .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : Welcome back to the second half of THE CAPITAL GANG .
Chief Justice William Rehnquist did not appear at Supreme Court oral arguments and is gravely ill .
President Bush was asked about his future choices for the Supreme Court .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I 'll pick somebody that knows the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law .
You might have had that several times .
I meant what I said .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Republican Senator Arlen Specter , in line to become chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee after his reelection in Pennsylvania Tuesday , discussed restrictions on President Bush 's selections .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
ARLEN SPECTER ( R ) , PENNSYLVANIA :
When you talk about judges who would change the right of a woman to choose and overturn Roe v.
Wade , I think that is unlikely .
And I have said that bluntly during the course of the campaign and before .
When " The Inquirer " endorsed me , they quoted my statement that " Roe v. Wade was inviolate . "
SHIELDS : In a later statement , Senator Specter said he was not warning the president , and added , " In light of the repeated filibusters by Democrats in the last Senate session , I am concerned about a potential repetition of such filibusters .
I expect to work with President Bush in the judicial confirmation process in the years ahead . "
Kate , will President Bush be forced to take Arlen Specter 's advice ?
O'BEIRNE : But for President Bush , Arlen Specter would be cleaning out his office this week because he would have lost that -- in a primary in Pennsylvania .
No , of course he 's not , and he wo n't take Arlen Specter 's advice .
I anticipate battles over judges will become more intense following Tuesday .
Liberals now appreciate we cannot win at the -- at the -- in the voting booth .
It 's more important than ever now that they have the kind of judges who will impose gay marriage , because every time voters have had a chance to adopt it they 've said overwhelming no .
Who will say the Boy Scouts are a discriminatory organization ?
We 've passed bans on abortion supported overwhelmingly by the public .
That they want federal judges knocking down .
So the stakes have risen even higher for the left , because the only place they can get what they want is if it 's imposed by judges .
SHIELDS : Bob Novak , what about -- I mean , Kate 's right that George Bush and Rick Santorum , his very -- his pro-life colleague in the Senate , Arlen Specter 's , went to bat for him in a difficult primary against Congressman Pat Toomey , and they could get some credit for making him acceptable to conservative Republican voters in Pennsylvania .
NOVAK : Exactly .
But Arlen Specter does n't know what gratitude means .
And just in his -- in his exuberance , in his hubris over winning the reelection to a fifth term , he comes out with a warning .
It was a warning to the president , and it was a litmus test .
His position on abortion and judges is indistinguishable from John Kerry's .
Now the question is , there 's a firestorm created , and there 's tremendous pressure on Santorum , what he 's going to do .
Tremendous pressure on Senate Majority Leader Frist .
SHIELDS : So what should they do , deny him the chairmanship ?
NOVAK : Deny him the chairmanship .
What they'd love to do is to get the guy who 's ahead of him seniority , Senator Grassley of Iowa , to take it .
But Grassley would rather stay as chairman over Finance Committee .
SHIELDS : Finance Committee .
NOVAK : He 's not a lawyer .
But it is a -- a lot of people -- I talked to Senator Hatch , who 's term limit -- he 's chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
SHIELDS : Yes .
NOVAK : Senator Hatch said , " Oh , this will blow over . "
But it is n't .
There 's an enormous firestorm from people who voted for George Bush on family values .
And this guy is putting a litmus test on abortion .
SHIELDS : Margaret .
CARLSON : But , you know , I just want to note this one thing that kind of passed by in this election .
George Bush , the Monday before the election , came out and said he was in favor of civil unions and he was against the Ohio ban on gay marriages .
NOVAK : What 's that got to do with this ?
CARLSON : I 'm just saying that this conservative , you know , judges going and approving gay marriage , let us just note that the president ...
NOVAK : I thought we 're talking about abortion .
CARLSON : We are .
But I 'm --
Kate brought up gay marriage , and I thought I would just insert that for the record .
Listen , Bush did n't want Pat Toomey to win that primary .
It was in his interest to have Arlen Specter , who 's a huge vote - getter in Pennsylvania in the general election .
HUNT : He did n't ...
CARLSON : Arlen Specter is not a gracious -- a gracious man .
But I think it would be a terrible mistake to push him aside over this .
SHIELDS : But Al , is n't there going to be pressure ?
Rick Santorum has national ambitions .
And he took a lot of heat for supporting him in the ...
NOVAK : He 's still taking a lot of heat .
SHIELDS : Still taking a lot of heat from my immediate left , for one place .
But I mean is -- can he just kind of quietly go along and support Arlen Specter as chairman ?
HUNT : I do n't know what Mr. Santorum will do .
I 'll defer to Kate and Bob on that .
But I think if they do strip Specter of that chairmanship , that makes him -- that makes him absolutely a Democratic voter on a number of these top issues because he 'll feel no institutional responsibility .
I think there 's going to be some ferocious battles over some court nominees .
Not as many as there have been probably -- there have n't been very many to begin with .
There have only been a handful .
NOVAK : How about chief justice ?
HUNT : And I -- also , I would disagree with Kate .
I mean , if that were the agenda , Kate , then I think your side would be winning .
But I think the agenda really is not to let them viciate the Americans for Disabilities Act , which is ...
NOVAK : Oh , please .
HUNT : ... which is part of the conservative agenda , not to let them overturn Roe v. Wade ; which is part of the agenda ; not to let them do away with affirmative action , which is part of the agenda .
If they nominate -- if the Republicans nominate an Antonin Scalia to be chief justice , there will be a ferocious battle .
O'BEIRNE : And he would be -- and he would be confirmed , because he is so obviously fit to be chief justice .
He would ultimately be confirmed and embarrass any Democratic senator who tried to take him on during the hearings .
SHIELDS : Last word , Kate O'Beirne .
It would be a great fight , Antonin Scalia .
O'BEIRNE : It would be a great fight .
SHIELDS : Coming up in " The Capital Gang Classic , " the last time a president named George Bush was elected with a popular vote , that was 16 years ago .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : Welcome back .
Sixteen years ago , George Herbert Walker Bush won a decisive victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis .
CAPITAL GANG discussed George Bush 's election on November 11 , 1988 .
Our guest was then Congressman Jack Kemp of New York , soon to be named to the cabinet as secretary of Housing and Urban Development .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAT ROBERTSON , CO - HOST :
It looked like presence ( ph ) for the Reagan revolution .
HUNT : Hey , Pat , to steal a phrase from Mike Dukakis , the issue with the Bush administration is -- is competence , not ideology .
NOVAK : These people in the Democratic Party , like Tom Foley , Tony Coelho , even Speaker Jim Wright , who had been trashing Bush , say now that it 's over come to us , baby .
Pass our programs , enact a water - downed version of the Dukakis platform and everything 's going to be OK .
And that 's just the kind of music a moderate Republican like Bush dances to .
REP .
JACK KEMP ( R ) , NEW YORK : Let me -- George Bush knows not only what 's happened in the last eight years ; he knows exactly the way he won this election .
He recognizes , as you said , Pat , that he won on conservative values , conservative ideas and Reaganomics and the Reagan agenda for foreign policy .
ROBERTSON : But seriously , does it make any political sense for him to ditch his strong conservative wing to carry this point ( ph ) in August and September ?
SHIELDS : I do n't think that 's what he thinks he comes from .
I think you 're absolutely right that that is -- that 's the key to the Reagan revolution , but I do n't think that 's what George Bush thinks his strength , his mandate , whatever else comes from .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Who were all those young people ?
Al , did George Bush set a bad example for his son , George W.?
HUNT : George Bush four years later had Bill Clinton as an opponent .
If his son had had Bill Clinton as his opponent , he would have lost last Tuesday .
SHIELDS : Boy .
NOVAK : Al is exactly right .
And Jack Kemp and Pat Buchanan were wrong .
George Bush betrayed Reaganism .
He raised taxes .
He fudged around on all kinds of legislation .
And he thought he could move to the left and be successful .
His son is a lot shrewder .
SHIELDS : Kate O'Beirne , you saw " Father Flanagan 's Boy 's Town " there before you and Margaret graced our panel .
O'BEIRNE : I am so nervous when I see how this show ages people .
( LAUGHTER )
O'BEIRNE : It makes me very nervous .
Look , the first President Bush tried to appease liberals in the Congress , and look where it got him .
And I 'm sure his son appreciates that .
CARLSON : Listen , George Bush did two things that were very right .
He raised taxes when he needed to , and he did n't go into Baghdad .
It would be so good if his son followed his example .
SHIELDS : Margaret Carlson gets the last word .
Next on CAPITAL GANG , " Beyond the Beltway " looks at what Yasser Arafat 's health means for the Middle East peace process .
CNN senior international correspondent Walt Rodgers joins the gang from London .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : Welcome back .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat clings to life today in a French hospital .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
NABIL ABU RUDEINEH , ARAFAT SPOKESMAN : I can assure you that the doctors till now could n't diagnose exactly what he is suffering from .
And this is the real problem .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei met today with rival factions in Gaza to talk for the first time about a post - Arafat era .
Immediately after President Bush 's reelection , British Prime Minister Tony Blair called for action in the region .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
TONY BLAIR , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : I have long argued that the need to revitalize the Middle East peace process is the single - most pressing political challenge in our world today .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : After false reports of Arafat 's death , President Bush was asked his reaction .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : My first reaction is god bless his soul .
And my second reaction is -- is that we will continue to work for a free Palestinian state that 's at peace with Israel .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SHIELDS : Joining us now from CNN's London bureau is Walt Rodgers , senior international correspondent .
Walt , will the departure of Arafat improve prospects for the roadmap to peace in the Middle East ?
WALTER RODGERS , CNN SR .
INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT :
If you had a perfect confluence of events , yes .
But remember , the Middle East is the one theater and arena in which no one ever lost a nickel by betting on the pessimistic side of the things .
The perfect confluence of events would be George Bush , newly - elected American president , reelected , would have to become fully engaged in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
To do that , he would have to probably pressure Israel .
If he pressures Israel , the president of the United States then alienates his core support in the United States , the evangelical Christians , who are 150 percent pro- Israel .
Ariel Sharon would have to come out for a Palestinian state to appease -- you know , to make this work .
The last thing he wants to talk about is a Palestinian state at this point .
I 've heard Sharon say he did n't want to talk about any of that for 25 years .
Then there 's the last thing .
The Palestinians would have to come together , and right now there will be a power struggle , if not a civil war , among fractious politicians once Arafat passes from the scene .
Not likely .
SHIELDS : Bob Novak .
NOVAK : Walt , is there a feeling there that -- of course the -- President Bush and his administration totally rolled off Arafat .
They will have nothing to do with him .
Is there a feeling there that whoever his successor is that the United States , President Bush will reach out to Arafat 's successor , which would at least be a step in the right direction ?
RODGERS : Well , I 'm not sure that 's -- I 'm not sure I can say this .
Perhaps that question should be better asked of the White House .
I think it would be the wise thing to do .
I think it would be a very , very good thing for a reelected George W. Bush to do .
Does he have the commitment and energy necessary to recommit ?
We also saw how hard Bill Clinton worked and how close he came at Camp David in -- I guess it was 2000 , to come up with an Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
And that fell flat on its face .
The difficulty in the Middle East is , just when you think you 're passed a corner , something comes back and slaps you on the back of the head .
Only George Bush can do it .
Let 's see if he has the political will .
SHIELDS : Margaret Carlson .
CARLSON : Well , if Arafat could speak , you 'd expect him to say , " Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated . "
Everything about his hospitalization has been mysterious .
And we do n't know -- his condition has gone back and forth , the hospital today said , " We 'll give you a diagnosis tomorrow . "
What 's up with that ?
RODGERS : Well , this is -- this is typical Palestinian -- Palestine Liberation Organization operations .
You have factions fighting for who becomes prominent there .
What you have is Suha Arafat , Arafat 's wife .
She 'll tell you one thing ; it will be contradicted by the official Palestinian spokesman .
The Palestinians closest to Arafat , the men , hate Suha .
Suha hates them .
You know , it 's like trying to juggle five balls in the air with two hands and never having done it before .
The Palestinians have a very difficult time getting their message across because of all the factional infighting between Mrs. Arafat and the aides closest to Yasser .
SHIELDS : Kate O'Beirne .
O'BEIRNE : Walt , when Yasser Arafat does go on to his eternal reward , where is he apt to be laid to rest ?
RODGERS : That 's a good question .
And they 're still talking about it .
Arafat , by his choice , would like to be buried in east Jerusalem , within site of the Al Aqsa Mosque .
The Israelis say flat no , they 're not going to do that .
The Egyptians are acting as intermediaries here .
The Egyptians have offered Egypt as a possible solution to the dilemma of where to bury Arafat .
Remember when the Shah of Iran died nobody wanted him .
I believe the Egyptians buried the Shah of Iran .
So they are an interlocutor .
They 're -- I think the -- the greatest probability is that Arafat would be buried in Gaza in the Khan Yones area .
But again , right now that 's not been publicly announced .
And we 're only -- we 're only speculating .
SHIELDS : Al Hunt .
HUNT : Walt Rodgers , whether Arafat goes today or tomorrow , it seems like something is reasonably imminent .
How different would his legacy have been if he had said " yes " four years ago rather than rejecting the Clinton - orchestrated effort , the Israel - Palestinian issue ?
RODGERS : Enormous , Al .
That 's a good question .
His legacy would have been extraordinarily different .
But Yasser Arafat could never cross the bridge , could never stop being a self - perceived revolutionary and freedom fighter and become a statesman .
He was incapable of it .
He did n't know how to do it , and that 's the worst part of his legacy .
He failed the Palestinian people .
He could have done so much more for them .
If he had accepted at Camp David , they would have had 97 -- Camp David , plus Taba , they would have had 97 percent of the West Bank , they would have had a piece of Jerusalem .
Arafat could have been buried in Jerusalem .
They would have had piece with Israel and a Palestinian state .
Arafat screwed up .
He just screwed up .
And he -- just by way of footnote , he 's an icon an , anachronism whose day has long since come and gone .
This is a guy who was friends with Andropov , friends with Leonid Brezhnev , friends with ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) , Eric Honecker .
He 's the -- this leaves only Fidel Castro in that old Cold War pantheon of the other side 's warriors .
SHIELDS : Hey , Walt Rodgers , you 've been terrific .
We thank you for being with us .
THE CAPITAL GANG will be back with our " Outrage of the Week . "
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SHIELDS : And now for the " Outrage of the Week . "
Frequently during this past campaign President Bush boasted about the coalition of troops from many nations supporting the U.S. and its occupation of Iraq .
That coalition is shrinking by the hour .
This week , Hungary became the latest coalition partner to announce withdrawal of its troops .
The following countries have withdrawn or announced a date certain to withdraw their troops : Spain , Portugal , Norway , New Zealand , Nicaragua , the Dominican Republic , the Philippines , Thailand , Singapore , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , and yes , Poland , too .
By the day , Mr. Bush 's multinational force in Iraq is becoming significantly less multi -- Bob Novak .
NOVAK : Kofi Annan , the United Nations secretary - general , has warned the U.S. - British - Iraqi coalition to stop the impending military offensive against the terrorist stronghold of Falluja .
Mr. Annan is removed from reality .
He must think John Kerry , not George W. Bush , won the election .
President Bush will not pay attention to the hypocritical leader of an organization drenched in corruption .
Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi makes the point that if the U.N. secretary - general could dissuade Falluja terrorists from murder and mayhem he should do so .
But that 's not on Kofi Annan 's agenda .
SHIELDS : Margaret Carlson .
CARLSON : Mark , President Bush won fair and square .
But that does n't mean our voting is fair and square , especially for the working class .
My voting place is well staffed .
Fifteen minutes there is a long wait .
But not so everywhere .
The longest recorded wait was 10 hours in Gambier , Ohio .
Four hours in urban precincts was not uncommon .
It 's a thrill to see so many people voting .
But we are not all equal when it comes to having our vote count if we can't vote in a more equitable amount of time .
SHIELDS : Kate O'Beirne .
O'BEIRNE : Our foreign allies ' reaction to their candidate 's loss is ugly and revealing .
A London " Daily Mirror " headline screeched " How can 59 million people be so dumb ? "
One of its columnists calls Americans " frightened , clueless , gun-toting , military - loving , non- passport - owning rednecks . "
The " International Herald Tribune " compared Bush voters to Muslims who vote for their clergy .
Britain's " Guardian " calls them " racists . "
One German newspaper wants President Bush at a war crimes tribunal .
Make no mistake , European elites do n't hate America because of Bush .
They hate Bush because they loathe Americans .
SHIELDS : Al Hunt .
HUNT : There were n't many silver linings .
So thank god for Alan Keyes .
Leaving his Maryland home to run for the Senate in Illinois , he got clobbered .
Then he refused to congratulate the winner , Barack Obama , who Mr. Keyes said represents " a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country . "
Over seven in 10 residents in Bob Novak 's native state embraced Senator - Elect Obama in this " culture of evil . "
Democrats gleefully await which state Alan Keyes picks next .
SHIELDS : This is Mark Shields saying goodnight for THE CAPITAL GANG .
Coming up next , " CNN PRESENTS : The Mission of George W. Bush . "
Then at 9:00 p.m. " LARRY KING LIVE " interviews first lady Laura Bush .
And at 10:00 p.m. " CNN SATURDAY NIGHT " assesses the pending offensive in Falluja with retired Marine General Terry Murphy -- Gary Murray -- excuse me .

The footnote
Racial prejudice was , as Jonathan and I wrote this morning , a footnote in yesterday 's result , quite possibly outweighed by the increase in black turnout and the excitement among many white voters at making history .
But Matthew Yglesias spots this map of counties where McCain outpolled Bush , and outside Alaska and Arizona , the trail of red south down the Appalachian mountains , and the fact that his sweeping victory did n't include the Democratic states of West Virginia and Arkansas , does suggest that race had some staying power .
( via Andrew Sullivan )
To raise awareness of breast reconstruction and to market it to patients , the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has adopted the vocabulary of the movement to support a woman ’s freedom to choose an abortion , adjusting it for women with breast cancer .
Although women “ do n’t choose their diagnosis , they can choose to go ahead with reconstruction or not , and with the aid of a knowledgeable plastic surgeon they can choose what their options might be , ” Dr. Linda G. Phillips , a plastic surgeon in Galveston , Tex. , said in a telephone news conference organized by the plastic surgery society to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October .
“ Then they have that much more power over their lives if they have that power to choose . ”
But for many patients , the options may be limited because their doctors are not proficient in the latest procedures .
Dr. Michael F. McGuire , the president - elect of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , said it is not unusual for surgeons to omit telling patients about operations they do not perform .
He compared the rise of more complex breast reconstruction to the advent in the late 1980s of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery of the gallbladder .
“ At the time , only a small percentage of surgeons were doing them and doing them well , ” said Dr. McGuire , who is chief of plastic surgery at St. Johns Hospital in Santa Monica , Calif .
“ If you were not familiar with laparoscopic gallbladder surgery , you were still doing it the traditional way with an open great big scar across the abdomen . ”
Uneven information about reconstructive options is a subset of a larger problem , said Dr. Amy K. Alderman , an assistant professor of plastic surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor .
Only one third of women undergoing operations for breast cancer said their general surgeons had discussed reconstruction at all , according to a study by Dr. Alderman of 1,844 women in Los Angeles and Detroit that was published in February in the journal Cancer .
“ In the big picture , it would be great if we could just get doctors to tell people they have an option of reconstruction , ” Dr. Alderman said .
Once patients are so informed , she added , plastic surgeons should tell them of options beyond implants .
“ The next hurdle would be letting them know that using their own tissue is an option , because my guess is that they are not even getting that far in the discussion , ” Dr. Alderman said .
About 66,000 women in the United States had mastectomies in 2006 , the latest figures available , according to the federal government .
And about 57,000 women had reconstructive breast surgery last year , according to estimates from the plastic surgery society .

Iteration Is Hard
Maybe you 'd mock a talking Barbie doll for making the outrageous assertion I 've titled this article with : Iteration Is Hard .
After all , it 's not hard at all , right ?
i = 0 ; while ( i < n ) { process ( i ) ; ++i ; }
or alternately
cur = head ; while ( cur != NULL ) { process ( cur ) ; cur = cur -> next ; }
Generic Iteration
I 've arranged the two sample iterators so it 's very obvious what they have in common .
The following pseudocode reveals the common underlying principles :
set iterator to refer to the first item in the collection while the iterator refers to a valid item process item update iterator to refer to the next item
These are both special cases of how one might structure an iterator , both leveraging certain simplifications and convenient code idioms .
While the above shows what they have in common , these two iterators are normally considered to be vastly different .
That 's because while both allow fast iteration , one of them requires storing links within the data structure itself , and the other requires packing the data in permanent storage in a particular way .
But in both cases , the iterator state is very simple .
In the first case , the iterator state is the index of the item within the data structure .
In the second case , it * is* the item within the data structure .
Here 's code for a " generic " iterator .
Iterator i = iteratorInit ( coll ) ; while ( !iteratorDone ( i ) ) { process ( iteratorItem ( i ) ) ; iteratorAdvance ( &i ) ; }
[ In practice , we should have an iteratorDone ( ) or iterator Free ( ) function as well , but the implementation of this function will be trivially obvious everywhere in this article - - simply free up all resources . ]
In theory , almost any iterator is going to fit the above code .
Here are the two iterators already considered :
struct Iterator { int index ; Array coll ; } ; Iterator iniIteratorForCollection ( Array coll ) { Iterator i = { 0 , coll } ; return i ; } boolean iteratorDone ( Iterator i ) { return i.index >= i.coll.size ; } Item * iteratorItem ( Iterator i ) { return &i.coll.array[ i.index ] ; } void iteratorAdvance ( Iterator * i ) { ++i-> index ; }
and
typedef Item * Iterator ; Iterator iteratorInit( Item * list ) { return list ; } boolean iteratorDone ( Iterator i ) { return i == NULL ; } Item * iteratorItem ( Iterator i ) { return i ; } void iteratorAdvance ( Iterator * i ) { * i = ( *i ) -> next ; }
With this in place , it 's possible to reuse the same iteration code everywhere .
It 's even plausible for a language to directly support this kind of iteration , by providing some sort of ' for x in y' function which automatically generates the right calls .
Talking about commonly used production languages , with C++ , one could introduce an iterator idiom with operator overloading so that one would always write this code , regardless of the iterator implementation :
for ( MyTypeIterator i( coll ) ; i ; ++i ) process ( * i ) ;
Is that good or bad ?
Well , it allows the implementation of the iterator ( and the collection ) to change without the code needing changing , while still using extremely concise code .
Standard caveats about maintainability of operator overloading applies , however .
Iteration Gets Harder
If that 's all there was to iteration , I 'd be hard pressed to argue that it was that difficult .
But you 've probably seen code like this :
cur = head ; while ( cur != NULL ) { next = cur -> next ; process ( cur ) ; cur = next ; }
What 's up with that ?
And how could I adjust the ' generic ' mechanism to allow for this case ?
What 's " up " with that is that the code is allowing for the case that the item ' cur ' is deleted or moved in the list during the call to process ( ) .
In other words , do n't assume the list is invariant during the course of iteration .
The most common place you may have seen such code is when freeing all the items in a linked list , but it gets more interesting when you consider that the above code works even if process ( ) sometimes deletes and sometimes does n't .
That does n't seem so bad , does it ?
How about the equivalent code for indices :
i = 0 ; while ( i < coll .n ) { result = process ( coll.array [ i ] ) ; if ( result != DELETION ) ++i ; // else , if deleted , then repeat item ' i ' again }
That code is n't very clear , since it 's intimately tied to not just the representation but the way deletion works .
( This is technically true of the previous code as well , although it simply seems more natural , as , for example , ' process ' could free up the memory referenced by ' cur ' as well , so the " early dereference " makes sense for that . )
Showing that the above loop terminates is complicated , since it depends on the fact that each iteration either increases i or decreases n ; this is more apparent in the following code :
i = 0 ; while ( i < n ) if ( process ( &array [ i ] ) array [ i ] = array [ -- n ] ; // delete i by moving n- 1th element over it else ++i ;
Ok , so that 's a little gross , but it works , it 's fast and efficient , it 's not that hard to understand .
So what 's the big deal ?
Iteration Is Hard
For a living , I write entertainment software ( i.e. computer games ) .
As games get larger and more complicated , modularity and robustness become more important .
Abstraction is always good , of course .
But as these games get larger and more complicated , the demands they put on the various systems get that much more unpredictable .
Our programs have become increasingly data - driven , where almost anything can happen if a non-programming developer sets data appropriately .
While our program does n't have to respond " perfectly " , it needs to at least not crash , and we would like a reasonably degree of consistency .
A typical application for an iterator is that I have a list of simulated objects which need processing in the current timeslice .
Some objects might decide to delete themselves during their processing ; I 've already shown how this case is often addressed .
What happens if an object decides to add another object to the list ?
It turns out that most iterators are well behaved in this case .
They vary as to whether the object will be iterated during this iteration or not ( for the linked list , if added at the head , no ; for the array , if added at the tail , yes -- although you can iterate backwards through the array to change this behavior ) .
But what if an object decides to delete some other object ?
Consider processing objects 0..9 with an index interator :
item 0 : item 1 : item 2 : delete 2 by copying 9 down onto 2 and repeat 2 item 2 : ( was 9 ) item 3 : delete 5 by copying 8 down onto 5 item 4 : item 5 : ( was 8 ) delete 1 by copying 7 down onto 1 item 6 :
It deleted 3 items , and processed 8 items - - 2 was processed before deleting itself , and 1 was processed before it was deleted by 8 .
So 5 was the only item deleted without processing -- but wait , it should 've processed 9 items !
Item 7 was never processed !
Clearly , there 's a bug with the ( never explicitly stated ) deletion algorithm above : if an item is deleted that 's earlier in the list than our current iterator , it needs to make sure it still processes that now - moved item .
You might try imagining a simple hack where in the iteration code it tracks whatever item has been moved , and make sure to make a special call to that one , but it fails if more than one item is deleted .
I 'll return to how one might implement this correctly later .
Suffice it to say , it 's hard .
( If it iterates backwards , to try to avoid processing just - inserted items , then deletion will move an already - visited item into the to - be - visited section of the array , which may cause it to process an item twice . )
At least the linked - list iterator does n't suffer from this problem .
Since it does n't move objects around on deletion , it can't accidentally skip them .
On the other hand , since the linked - list iterator keeps a direct pointer to an item , it can ' go wrong ' if that item is deleted from the list .
That was the reason why we grabbed the ' next ' pointer early in the modified linked - list code -- because ' cur ' could get removed , and its ' next ' field might become invalid .
But , wait -- now we 're squirreling away the ' next ' pointer .
Suppose the next item got deleted from the list ?
Then the next pointer we 've got points to an item no longer in the list , and its next pointer could be garbage , or could be being used by some other list !
In this context , at least , iteration is hard .
Workarounds
One way we 've worked around a host of these sorts of problems is by disallowing deletions .
More specifically , deletions are delayed until a special time , during which no iteration is allowed .
At this point , objects are deleted and removed from all lists .
This can cause some complications .
If an object is " going to be deleted " , then other objects need to realize it's no longer " really " alive , and not try to do things they should n't do ( such as introduce new dependencies on the object ) .
Furthermore , doing this in general would require putting not just object deletions , but deletions from lists in general on queues .
And then the query 'is this item in this list ' becomes more complicated -- should it check the queues as well ?
In practice , I do n't think this is a generally acceptable approach .
I do think that queueing object deletion ( and here , by object , I mean ' simulation objects ' -- objects that normally have a relatively long lifespan ) , or something similar , leads to fewer bugs .
Other code does have to be somewhat defensive , nonetheless .
Definitions of Robustness
Here are properties one would probably demand of any iterator :
never reports an item from the list more than once
never reports an item that was n't on the list at some point between the start and end of the iteration
always reports an item that was on the list for the entire time from the start to the end of the iteration
In some cases , the first property ( never more than once ) might be slippable , but most of the time it would be bad .
Most cases where it would be ok would be if our processing routine had no side - effects -- but that 's exactly the case when iterating is n't hard anyway .
Here are some different ways of resolving the ambiguous cases from the above definitions :
if an item has n't been reported at the time it is deleted , it will not be reported if an item is added to the list during iteration , whether it is reported depends on where in the list it is added relative to the iteration if an item is added to the list during iteration , it strictly is / is not reported at the end of the iteration , every item currently on the list was reported if an item was on the list at the beginning of the iteration , it is always reported , even if it has been removed by the time it is called the list of reported items is exactly the list of items that were in the list at the beginning of the iteration
Items 5 & 6 are problematic .
( 6 is a generalization of 5 , using the same rule for both insertion and deletion . )
They 're problematic because client code is likely to expect the invariant " at the time an item is reported , it is on the list " .
In fact , I would have put that property into the first " mandatory " list , except that I 've actually used this approach successfully , so it 's worth considering .
Items 1 & 2 are somewhat annoying , as they are n't very well - defined .
Well , that 's not totally true -- it depends on whether the collection is ordered or unordered .
For example , if the objects are processed in some sort of priority order , then the deletion rule becomes " if an object is deleted by a higher priority object , it is n't processed " , which makes some sense .
On the other hand , if they 're stored in alphabetical order , it does n't make much sense at all .
The question may become one of the " illusion of simultaneity " -- and it is in exactly this case in which " processing all items that were on the list at the beginning of the iteration " makes sense .
Implementing Robust , Efficient Iterators
In the previous section , I 've laid out some ideas about what makes an iterator robust .
What really makes it robust is that it does n't surprise the client .
To actually describe implementing them , I 'll need to particular some particular definition of robustness .
On the principle of least surprise , I will stick to the mandatory properties .
However , honing to the principle of least surprise beyond that does n't seem very valuable , so instead I 'll allow allow the details to vary depending on the data structure .
What about this ordering phenomenon ?
And what how do these things interact when data structures are designed to do more than just iterate ?
For the sake of these questions , I will consider the " associative array " or " dictionary " or " symbol table " data structure .
This data structure supports the following operations :
get ( Collection , Key )
insert ( Collection , Key , Value )
delete ( Collection , Key )
deleteItem ( Collection , Item ) ( item is what is returned by the iterator and get , and may be faster )
iteration ( via the functions iteratorInit , iteratorDone , iteratorItem , iteratorAdvance )
I will look at several implementations of this abstract data structure and consider the performance ramifactions .
Under this model , while the data structure may internally have some order , it is unlikely to be relevent in the sense of deletions reporting / not - reporting making sense .
( I.e. it 's more of an alphabetical order rather than a priority order . )
A Generic Robust Implementation
To start with , I want to show the complexity of simply achieving robustness .
To this end , assume there 's a working implementation of an associative array , and I want to wrap it in another layer which adds robustness to the iterator .
One easy solution is to save off the list of all the items on the list first , and then iterate through them .
For the sake of easy exposition , I 'll just put this into the client code :
int i,n ; Iterator iter ; Item * list ; // make space for the items allocArray ( list , numItems ( coll ) ) ; // copy out the items n = 0 ; iter = iteratorInit ( coll ) ; while ( !iteratorDone ( iter ) ) { list [ n++] = iteratorItem ( i ) ; iteratorAdvance ( &i ) ; } assert(n == numItems ( coll ) ) ; // now do a simple , safe iteration for ( i=0 ; i < n ; ++i ) process ( list [ i ] ) ;
As mentioned before , however , this definition is probably somewhat surprising to clients , as they expect the item to be on the list .
I can protect against that , however , by changing the final lines to the following :
// now do a simple , safe iteration for ( i=0 ; i < n ; ++i ) if ( get ( coll , list [ i ] -> key ) ) // check if it 's still in the list process ( list [ i ] ) ;
There it is .
A simple , robust iterator , which can be arranged into the exact same iterator interface , although I 'm not bothering with this case .
Except it 's not quite robust in one case -- if the underlying iterator produces items more than once , then the output list still has more than one of each , and if the underlying iterator fails to produce all items , so does this one .
Fortunately , all the real iterators I 'll consider have the property that if no other operations are performed during an iteration , items will never be reported twice .
( I 'll give details later . )
[ Ok , ok , it 's actually not robust in another way -- if items are deleted , the actual Item * storage may get freed .
The above code needs to actually store the content of the Items ( the Key , Value ) themselves , not just pointers to them .
But this is an easy fix that would make the code less clear for expository purposes . ]
So why do I claim it 's hard ?
Well , look back at the ' efficiency ' topic .
Now look at that ' get ' call .
Best case , there are now n O ( 1 ) hash table lookups in addition to the inherent processing .
Worst case , ' get ' takes O ( n ) time , normal iteration takes O ( n ) time for n items , and the above code takes O( n ^ 2 ) time .
In addition , we use an extra O( n ) space , and the memory management load could be noticeable .
( On the other hand , this space usage is actually unlikely to be significant , as many of the data structures we will consider are likely to use even more space to implement a doubly - linked list to provide a fast iterator in the first place . )
Attempts at Efficiency
Here 's a possible definition for efficiency :
Iteration should have the same O ( ) performance as long as the data structure is n't modified during the iteration .
Instead of implementing the above , I could provide two iterators to the client .
One would be robust , and one would be fast , and it would be up to the client to know whether its code might update the list .
However , this is exactly the sort of thing that leads to problems .
As a large program modularizes and decentralizes , things become less predictable .
For example , in some of our games , we allow any database change to be watched for by any system , which can then do anything in response , including calling into an extension language .
The " programmers " of that extension language do n't have the option to go figure out what iterator might be running when their code is called .
We just have to be robust all the time .
An example of this sort of efficiency would be the code I described to try to deal with the array index deletion -- tracking items that might otherwise get skipped .
Another definition for efficiency :
Iteration should have the same O ( ) performance as long as no ' crucial ' element is inserted or deleted .
( E.g. crucial might be ' the currently iterated item ' , or the next , or some limited subset of all the items . )
Another definition might be that the data structure should have equivalent performance amortized , or at least equivalent performance if a constrained number of random insertions and deletions are made during an iteration -- i.e. iteration across n items with no more than f( n ) insertions and deletions , where f( n ) might be n or lg( n ) or whatever .
An even stronger sense of efficiency is that we should get the same performance , not just the same O ( ) performance .
For example , if the non-robust data structure supports an operation in g(n ) time , we might like our robust one to run in g( n ) + O ( 1 ) time .
In practice , I 'm not going to stick to any strict definition of efficiency .
Instead , I 'll pursue ' as efficient as possible ' .
We can generally meet one of the above standards .
With linked lists , we can generally meet the last standard , and most other data structures can be augmented with linked lists , introducing an extra O ( n ) space to the data structure , and O ( 1 ) time per operation to update the linked list .
The basic idea for implementing this with the given abstraction for iterators is for the data structure itself to " know " about active iterators over that data structure , and then to update them as appropriate .
Thus , assuming iteration is cheaper than insertion / deletion , we pay the costs of maintaining robustness in the already - expensive insert / delete , not in the otherwise efficient iteration , avoiding the problem with n gets above .
However , I can't easily describe this for the abstract case , since the idea is to patch up flaws in a particular implementation .
So I will quickly sketch a single example , and then return to the generic abstract case .
Suppose I have a linked - list iterator , but I do n't squirrel away ' next ' in the loop .
Instead , I ' register ' the address of my iterator at init time .
Now , anytime I go to delete an item from this collection , I check for active iterators .
If an iterator is pointing to the item I 'm about to delete , I advance the iterator now .
This would look something like this :
void rawDelete ( item ) { // linked list deletion with sentinel item -> prev -> next = item -> next ; item -> next -> prev = item -> prev ; // item is a placeholder for the collection , so free it now free ( item ) ; } void delete ( coll , item ) { int i ; for ( i=0 ; i < coll.numIterators ; ++i ) if ( * coll.iterators [i ] == item ) * coll.iterators [i ] = item -> next ; rawDelete ( item ) ; }
As you can see , this introduces no overhead on iteration itself , except that every deletion during an iteration incurs an extra O ( 1 ) , or as is explicit in the code , with n active iterations , there 's an extra O ( n ) cost to delete .
Since most programs use an effectively constant number of iterations ( i.e. it 's normally controlled by code , not data ) , this is unlikely to be very expensive .
( A recursive routine could have a lot of active iterators , though . )
Note that this is n't quite correct , as it stands -- during processing , if the current item is deleted , the iterator is advanced , and then after processing the the item , the iteration loop advances again , skipping an item .
To use the above code correctly , the generic iteration loop must be revised to :
Iterator i = iteratorInit ( coll ) ; while ( !iteratorDone ( i ) ) { Item * item = iteratorItem ( i ) ; iteratorAdvance ( &i ) ; process ( item ) ; }
If the implementation implements insertion at the front only , the linked - list code combined with the above iteration loop actually produces a robust iterator .
I 'll return to this case some more when we return to specific implementations , not generic ones .
It 's possible to continue using the old , more clear and simpler to type iteration loop if the normal iteration functions are wrapped in a somewhat gross monstrosity that automatically advances when iteratorItem ( ) is caled .
To avoid changing reasonable semantics for the iterator , iteratorItem should cache the current item , advance , and set a flag .
If iteratorItem is called again and the flag is still set , it returns the cached item .
When iteratorAdvance is called by the client , it clears the flag .
( When delete does an iteratorAdvance , it should not clear the flag . )
For simplicity , I 'll just assume the client does the caching .
( The other way this code is sometimes written is that the data type itself includes the iteration code , and calls a callback with each item -- in which case using the variant loop code is definitely the simpler solution . )
The previous linked - list example suggests a generic solution as well to wrapping the iterator without the up - front copy :
void wrappedDelete( coll , item ) { int i ; // if an iterator is currently on this item , advance past it for ( i=0 ; i < coll.numIterators ; ++i ) if ( iteratorItem( coll.iterator [i ] ) == item ) iteratorAdvance(coll.iterator[i ] ) ; // now call the underlying delete delete ( coll , item ) ; }
This wrapper robustifies deletions , but it does not inherently produce a robust iterator , as it depends on other semantics of the underlying implementation :
If the underlying iterator produces an item more than once , so will the wrapped one .
If the underlying iterator fails to produce an item even though that item is always present , so does the wrapped one .
If an item is processed , deleted , and then re-inserted , it may be produced more than once , depending on what rule the underlying iterator uses for insertions , and this wrapper does nothing to prevent it .
( This is the reason for the comment about only inserting at the front in the linked - list case . )
Thus , if one wants to produce an efficient and robust iterator , one must respond to the above issues .
I am not personally aware of any generic way of dealing with the first problem that is reasonably efficient .
Basically , you just have to keep a list of which items you 've reported so far , and double - check that list .
This requires either a hash table or a bit on the object for O ( 1 ) performance -- although the latter does n't allow multiple iterators at once .
Alternately , a binary search tree or something similar would allow O( lg N ) verification , resulting in O ( N lg N ) iteration , which is hardly efficient .
In fact , it resolves down to something much like the original ' copy out the entire list ' in terms of storage and performance .
The latter case can be handled in the same way , but it is slightly more efficient .
For each iterator , maintain a " hit list " , that is , a list of items which might be at risk for being produced twice .
That list could be all the deleted items , or all the inserted items .
Then each time the iterator is advanced , the item is tested to see if it's on the hit list .
This time , however , the hit list is bounded by the number of insertions / deletions which have occurred , not by the length of the list .
So if insertions / deletions are rare compared to iterations , performance can be quite acceptable , even with a simple hit list structure .
Here is a sketch of the implementation :
void wrappedIteratorAdvance ( Iterator * iter ) { boolean allowed ; do { iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; if ( iteratorDone ( iter ) ) return ; allowed = ! itemInList ( iter -> hitList , iteratorItem ( iter ) ) ; } while ( allowed ) ; } void wrappedInsert ( Collection * coll , Item * item ) { addToHitList ( coll , item ) ; insert ( coll , item ) ; } void addToHitList ( Collection * coll , Item * item ) { int i ; for ( i=0 ; i < coll -> numIterators ; ++i ) { Iterator * iter = coll -> iterators [i ] ; if ( !itemInList ( iter -> hitList , item ) ) addToList ( iter -> hitList , item ) ; } }
Note that I avoid allowing repeated entries in the hit list , in case the same item is deleted and inserted thousands of times during a single iteration , which would cause significantly more overhead on the iteration .
( Although now there 's more overhead on the insertion . )
This also points out an alternative solution to the original " just make a copy of the list before processing " approach .
Before , to solve the ' what if an item is deleted ' , I paid significant iteration time overhead doing a get ( ) after every iteration step .
Instead , I can only pay that cost if there 's been a deletion since the iterator started , by simply recording all the iterators , and setting a flag on them if there 's a deletion , which causes them to start checking .
Moreover , I could keep a hitlist of all the items which have been deleted , and only get ( ) vs. that list .
( However , if an item is deleted and then reinserted , I would get different semantics , unless I also delete items from the hitlist on insertion .
Whew , complicated ! )
To return to the current generic non -upfront - copy iterator case , if one could find out when the underlying iterator is at risk for reporting items multiple times , then one could at that moment update all the iterator 's hit lists with all the items they 've output so far , robustifying that case .
But all of this is largely irrelevent .
The case where an item is never reported by the underlying iterator is impossible to fix in a wrapper ( except by using the ' collect all items initially ' , which actually is relying on the fact that it knows certain conditions in which underreporting does not occur ) .
Since that brings us to the end of the discussion of the generic case , it is probably worth describing some data structures that have this double - reporting and under - reporting behaviors in response to deletions or insertions :
A hash table that grows / shrinks by resizing the table and rehashing , when iterated over by hash number .
A hash table with internal chaining can doubly report an item if that item is reported , deleted , and then inserted , but between the deletion and insertion another item is placed in the old location , causing the reinserted item to be hashed somewhere past the current location of the iterator .
An array iterated by index value in the face of a deletion can fail to report an item , as described above , if the efficient unordered deletion algorithm is used ( swapping the last item down to the deleted location ) .
If all items after the deleted item are shifted down ( at O ( n ) cost ! ) , all iterators can be fixed up with O ( 1 ) cost each .
) cost ! ) , all iterators can be fixed up with O ( ) cost each .
Self - balancing data structure , e.g. AVL trees and red - black trees , could play havoc with certain iterators ( although , as is discussed later , it 's actually straightforward to get right if you know what problems to avoid ) .
In addition , certain data structures that adjust themselves on ' get ' can have similar problems :
Splay trees perform rotations during get
Data structures that use a linear search ( e.g. linked lists or unsorted arrays ) may use an algorithm that involves moving the accessed item forward in the list , to make it more likely to be accessed quickly later .
Non-Generic Robust , Efficient Iterators
I 've already described how to implement a relatively efficient linked - list iterator .
Since many of the above data structures ( hash tables and balanced trees , for example ) have problems with underreporting , threading a linked list in is a natural solution to lots of the problems .
Therefore , I want to write out very explicit , detailed code for the linked - list case .
Linked List Symbol Table with Robust , Efficient Iterator
Ok , I did n't want to mention it before , but here 's a trick you might think would work to avoid having to use the complex iterator loop .
Basically , if the current item gets deleted , just step the iterator backwards instead of forwards , thus maintaining the semantics that the iterator is pointing to right before the next item to report .
The reason I did n't do it this way before is because ( a ) it requires a doubly - linked list ( since you might need to step back any number of times ) , and because you run into problems if you step back onto the sentinel when the first item is deleted , since insertions occur after the sentinel .
You could try keeping the pointer one before the current item ( i.e. iteratorItem ( ) returns not the item pointed to by the iterator , but the next one after that ) , so that insertions work right , but this does n't actually fix insertions after deleting the first item either .
You could probably explicitly have insertions advance any iterator pointing to the beginning of the list .
Off the top of my head , this would avoid this class of problems , and I can't think of any new ones introduced .
However I 'll just accept having to use the slightly more complex iterator .
This is actual compileable code , and I have tested it with the test jig given in the appendix .

I 'm not going to write out longer descriptions for hash tables , since as stated , I do n't see any way of resolving the missed - item problem other than wrapping with the " build the list upfront " code , or augmenting with a linked list .
The latter uses a lot more storage ( 2 pointers per item for each collection , as opposed to the copy approach which requires one pointer per item for each iterator - - normally I have a lot more collections than iterators ) , but produces a better - behaved iterator .
Moreover , this will allow symbol tables which have the same performance for all operations except delete , which has an extra O( m ) overhead , with an O ( n ) iteration .
[ It 's also possible to make an efficient singly - linked list , of course , but it 's slightly more code to write out , and you 'll want the doubly - linked code for the above augmentations , since it allows you to delete without searching down the list for the item . ]
Linked List with Move - to - Front
The Move - To - Front algorithm can be characterized simply as " on a get ( ) , move the gotten item to the front of the list " .
This ends up making the list an LRU cache .
Unfortunately , Move - To - Front makes things complicated to do " right " .
Since an item not - yet - visited can be moved to the front , we need to make every get ( ) operation check for this case , and add the item to a pending queue for any iterators that would have missed it .
Then deletes need to remove things from the pending queue .
An easier solution is to disable move to front if any iterators are active .
Here is an implementation of get ( ) that keeps the iterator robust :
void get ( Collection * coll , Key * key ) {
Item * item ; // set up for sentinel based search coll -> head -> key = key ; item = coll - > head -> next ; while ( item - > key != key ) item = item -> next ; if ( item == coll - > head ) { // sentinel return NULL ; } // move to front if ( coll - > numIterators == 0 ) { unlinkItem ( item ) ; insertAfterItem ( item , coll - > head ) ; } return item ; }
This approach is simple and robust , but will not be very helpful if an iterator is generally active -- e.g. if all code is run in response to an iteration over the collection of ' active ' objects .
An alternative approach is to augment the linked list with another linked list , just like the binary tree / hash table solutions .
Where the main linked list has LRU ordering semantics , the secondary list is there simply for the iterator semantics ( e.g. insertions are always at the front ) .
The more obvious approach is to try to " remember " missed items .
However , it is expensive to determine if a given item being moved will be " missed " by an active iterator .
This is not the case for an array , instead of a linked list .
Unordered Array Symbol Table with Robust Efficient Iterator
The unordered array normally uses a " swap onto deleted item " strategy which can cause missed items .
There are several approaches we can use to avoid this behavior :
Build queues of " missed items " for each iterator
Defer deletion until there are no active iterators
Building ' missed item ' queues is complicated .
The second approach seems more palatable , as the items can actually by deleted from the list but replaced with a temporary placeholder .
On the other hand , it 's possible to imagine client code that runs two iterators over the same data structure , and every time one iterator ends , it is restarted -- so there 's always at least one active iterator .
This would cause this algorithm to never shrink the array , causing performance to suffer after a large number of insertions and deletions .
Of course , if insertions could fill in the placeholders for deleted items , that would bring it back down to a reasonable level .
Nonetheless , it would still potentially inflate the cost of operations on the symbol table , since instead of being O ( n ) they would be O(m ) where m is the largest size the table has been since there were no iterators active .
Finally , this approach will introduce problems if items are deleted and then reinserted , since we can't constrain our insertions to occur at a particular location .
Therefore , although ' missing item ' queues are complicated , they seem to be the only hope for achieving robustness and efficiency simultaneously .
Here is an implementation of an unordered array symbol table with a robust iterator using a missing - item queue .
Note that the iterator operates in two stages :
First , the iterator walks through the array , reporting the items it finds .
On average , 50 % of the deletions that occur during an iteration will put an item onto the missed - items queue .
Second , when the iterator has reached the end of the array , it serves items from the missed - items queue .
At this point , it is no longer possible for items to be " missed " , so no more items will be added to the missed - items queue .
It is possible for items to be deleted from it .
This can cause bugs if the item deleted is the item currently being reported by the iterator , so I simply suppress such deletions ( from the missed - items queue -- the item is still deleted from the data structure proper ) .
You might wonder why I go to so much work to implement the " efficient " delete , when the delete is O ( n ) anyway due to the need to search .
For one thing , the search is very fast , and the copying around ( i.e. moving all the items in an O ( n ) delete ) would not be .
Furthermore , as you will see , handling the delete this way provides most of the technology for the next two data structures as well .
This is not a complete , tested program .

Unordered Array Symbol Table with Move - to - Front
Much like a linked - list , an array collection can be modified to move items forward in response to get ( ) so as to cache them at the front .
However , to make the operation efficient , the array needs to swap two items .
This makes a literal LRU arrangement impossible to implement efficiently .
Obvious alternatives , such as " swap to the front " , or " swap one forward " , will fail to get any performance benefit if the item and the one it is swapping with are continually " gotten " .
I suspect , however , that there is a plausible approach which simply involves moving an item a random distance forward -- i.e. if it 's at location n , then swap it with a random item from 0 .. n - 1 . I do n't know for sure , but assuming there is some approach that works , all I need to do is to add in code that supports an arbitrary swap of two elements , instead of the above semi-swap on deletion .
If I swap items x and y , x<y , and an iterator is between x and y ( but y is not in the inserted - after - iteration - started area ) , then if no fixup occurs , the current algorithm will fail to report y , and doubly - report x .
Failing to report y can be directly handled by adding y to the extraItems list .
Unfortunately , there 's no good way to prevent the double - reporting of x-- except to add a hit list of ' items to avoid double reporting ' in addition to the ' additional items to report ' .
Then the algorithm has to check this list - of - items - to - avoid every time it considers reporting an item , which would incur an unreasonable amount of overhead .
An alternative approach would be to advance the iterator all the way up past y , and add all the intervening elements to the extraItems list .
However , this would arbitrarily bloat the extraItems list , e.g. if the first and last item are swapped , turning this into the " copy out the entire list " case .
The list of ' items to avoid double reporting ' is the only realistic option , but searching in that list may make iteration quite slow ; O( nlogm ) after m swaps .
More About Robustness and the Complex Iterator Loop
Several times
I 've made reference to the fact that the iterator I 'm providing requires a slightly oddball loop , one in which it is necessary to immediately do an iteratorAdvance before doing other operations on the data structure .
I want to describe more clearly what the semantics of this kind of iterator are , and how they stand in relation to a traditional iterator .
Ignoring start / end , the traditional iterator ( as I 've presented it ) has the following semantics :
iteratorItem returns the item currently selected by the iterator , and is invariant ( idempotent ) across multiple calls if iteratorAdvance is not called .
Calling it several times this way will produce duplicates , of course .
returns the item currently selected by the iterator , and is invariant ( idempotent ) across multiple calls if is not called .
Calling it several times this way will produce duplicates , of course .
iteratorAdvance changes the item reported by iteratorItem .
Calling iteratorAdvance multiple times with no intervening iteratorItem will result in underreporting of the skipped items .
changes the item reported by .
Calling multiple times with no intervening will result in underreporting of the skipped items .
iteratorDone returns whether the iterator has finished iterating through all of the items ; that is , if iteratorDone is true , no other functions should be called .
The above semantics are incomplete , however , as they cannot strictly apply in the presence of deletions .
The normal refinement I choose to make here is to modify the semantics of iteratorItem to simply state ' if the item that would currently be reported by iteratorItem is deleted , it is illegal to call iteratorItem without first calling iteratorAdvance '-- some of the subtlety of the phrasing is to allow for the possibility of advancing and deleting without ever calling iteratorItem .
Similarly , iteratorDone and iteratorAdvance must be tweaked to make it legal to advance even if the final about - to - be- reported item is deleted ; at this point iteratorDone should become true , but iteratorAdvance should be true to avoid code having to use the form :
while ( !iteratorDone ( iter ) ) { Item * i = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; maybeDeleteAnItem ( ) ; if ( !iteratorDone ( iter ) ) iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; }
which seems unnecessarily cumbersome .
Now , I 've stated several times that in the face of deletions , the natural semantics are hard to maintain without writing an explicit cache layer .
So I 've introduced an alternate semantics without ever really specifying it , and this might bother you .
In fact , there are several things here that might bother you :
just what are the semantics for the iterators that require the ' complex ' loop ?
the semantics for the iterators that require the ' complex ' loop ?
what does this really mean in practice ?
are those semantics useful , or do they just have to be used as they are in the ' complex ' loop ?
why do n't I just use a single function that combines all three steps into one , and avoids distinguishing between these two cases ?
Last question first .
An entirely plausible semantics for an iterator might be :
iteratorGetNext returns the next item or NULL if there are no more items
iteratorGetNext can be coded using my iterator functions as :
Item * iteratorGetNext ( Iterator * iter ) { Item * i ; if ( iteratorDone ( iter ) ) return NULL ; i = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; return i; }
Interestingly , this definition works for both the " traditional " iterator semantics , and the " new - fangled " iterator semantics that requires the more complex iteration .
( You can see that in the way iteratorItem and iteratorAdvance are paired just as in the suggested loop . )
What 's wrong with the above approach ?
Nothing .
Why have n't I used it here ?
Because it sweeps some of the interesting problems under the rug .
Consider code to iterate over two data structures e.g. to merge them .
Each iteration , one or the other will be advanced .
To do this with the above complex iterator would require explicitly caching them in code :
Iterator * x , *y ; Item * i , *j ; ... i = iteratorGetNext( x ) ; j = iteratorGetNext(y ) ; while ( i != NULL && j != NULL ) { if ( compare ( i , j ) ) { process ( i ) ; i = iteratorGetNext( x ) ; } else { process ( j ) ; j = iteratorGetNext(y ) ; } }
There 's nothing technically wrong with the above code ; in fact , the fact that one function call serves three purposes might make you expect it will produce less code .
However , that code is wrapped up in a slightly non-obvious caching system which also masks where side - effects are important and what the termination condition is , compared to explicit code using the three - function iterator :
Iterator * x , *y ; ... while ( !iteratorDone ( x ) && !iteratorDone(y ) ) { if ( compare ( iteratorItem ( x ) , iteratorItem ( y ) ) { process ( iteratorItem ( x ) ) ; iteratorAdvance( x ) ; } else { process ( iteratorItem (y ) ) ; iteratorAdvance(y ) ; } }
This code is wordier ( only because I use the nice short names ' i ' and ' j ' in the first sample ) , but slightly shorter , as it does n't need two copies of each of the iteratorGetNext .
Also , consider an iterator that is shared between several functions , each of which might advance it .
Rather than having to introduce a global or passed around variable with the cache , the iterator keeps the current item continually available .
In other words , the three - function iterator semantics I 've offered above are more flexible and yet allow the simple one - function iterator to be layered atop it trivially .
So that 's the iterator worth discussing .
Ideally , anyway .
So what are the semantics of the ' complex ' iterator ?
Let 's look at a sequence of actions on an iterator and its collection .
First , consider an iterator that actually implements the above semantics correctly ( which leaves out all the implementations that require the ' complex ' loop ) ; I 'll provide commentary on the operations from that perspective .
Assume that at every step , iteratorDone ( ) is false ( otherwise there 'd be a lot of pointless comments about the operations being illegal in that case ) .
iter = iteratorInit( coll ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; insert ( coll , key1 , val1 ) ; delete ( coll , key2 ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; // illegal if key2 was current item insert ( coll , key3 , val3 ) ; delete ( coll , key4 ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; insert ( coll , key5 , val5 ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; delete ( coll , item -> key ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; // illegal iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ;
As you can see , these semantics are relatively straightforward .
If you perform delete ( ) operations , it can be dangerous to call iteratorItem ( ) afterwards , without first advanceing .
Now , with the alternate semantics ( which I have n't yet defined explicitly ) , here are the dangers for the same code :
iter = iteratorInit( coll ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; insert ( coll , key1 , val1 ) ; delete ( coll , key2 ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; insert ( coll , key3 , val3 ) ; delete ( coll , key4 ) ; // if key4 is current item , next item iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; // will be skipped by these lines item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; insert ( coll , key5 , val5 ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; delete ( coll , item -> key ) ; item = iteratorItem ( iter ) ; // reports a different item ; technically iteratorAdvance ( iter ) ; // no items are skipped , but really ...
To clarify that final note : the final four lines of code produce two different items , but if we only count the first one ( considering the second one a bug ) , then the latter item will never be officially produced ( i.e. never produced by the first call to iterator Item after an advance ) .
What you can see from the above discussion is that both of the semantics have flaws .
One of them is a little more clearly defined , however - - do n't expect the iterator to " cache " an item that has been deleted .
( In fact , that iterator may do so , but since it 's no longer in the collection , it 's incorrect for it to report it -- so I just state that it 's illegal to call it in that context . )
The practical upshot is that the " obvious " semantics wants you to do insertions and deletions between calling iteratorItem and iteratorAdvance .
The " complex " loop semantics needs insertions and deletions to occur between calling iteratorAdvance and iteratorItem !
Thus , the " complex " loop semantics are more straightforward because if you obey that constraint , there 's never a case where it becomes illegal to call iteratorItem .
On the other hand , the semantics are less useful , because it 's normally in response to calling iteratorItem that one decides to delete or insert items , and this forces the user to cache the item into a variable -- shades of the single - function iterator .
Plausibly , the best thing to do is to go ahead and use the single - function iterator if you 're expecting insertions and deletions on the data structure .
What about the final of my three points -- just what are the semantics for the wacky " complex loop " iterator ?
iteratorItem returns the item currently referred to by the iterator .
It is " idempotent " between calls to iteratorAdvance ; however , it cannot be called multiple times without iteratorAdvance calls in the presence of delete ( ) s , as detailed below .
returns the item currently referred to by the iterator .
It is " idempotent " between calls to ; however , it can not be called multiple times without calls in the presence of delete ( ) s , as detailed below .
iteratorAdvance advances the iterator so that iteratorItem will report a new item .
It is illegal to delete the item last reported by iteratorItem before calling iteratorAdvance .
( In other words , immediately after calling iteratorAdvance but before calling iteratorItem , all deletions are safe ) .
It may or may not be illegal to delete other items or to make insertions .
advances the iterator so that will report a new item .
It is illegal to delete the item last reported by calling .
( In other words , immediately after calling but before calling , all deletions are safe ) .
It may or may not be illegal to delete other items or to make insertions .
iteratorDone returns whether the iterator is exhausted , that is , whether iteratorItem will report a valid item .
Efficient , Robust , Ordered Iterators
The symbol tables considered so far all have had O ( n ) get operations .
( Well , I did do some handwaving about binary search trees and hash tables . )
There are a number of " ordered " symbol tables which have significantly faster get performance , and which can directly support robust iteration without merely threading a linked - list into it .
Consider a balanced binary search tree .
By keeping a pointer to the " current " item based on an in - order traversal , there is a well - defined rule to advance to the successor .
Even if a rotation is performed on the tree , the same item must still be the successor .
Thus , the rotations themselves will not cause a problem .
Deletions can be dealt with in the same way as ever ( advancing the iterator before deleting an item currently pointed to by it ) .
The big problem with " ordered " data structures is that inserts can't be constrained to a fixed location , e.g. the beginning as in linked - lists or the end as in the unordered array .
Insertions occur whereever is appropriate to maintain the ordering .
On the other hand , since an insertion will only ever occur from the same location where the item was deleted , then if an item is deleted and re-inserted , there is no danger of double - reporting , if the code is managed carefully to avoid this case .
On the other hand , this will produce a robust iterator that sometimes produces just - inserted items , and sometimes does n't , depending on where the iterator was at the time the item was inserted .
If this inconsistency is unacceptable , a different strategy must be used , e.g. threading an iteration - oriented linked - list into the data structure .
( Because of the use of the cache - the - item - and - immediately - advance loop , the semantics for whether a just - inserted item is reported will not be straightforward as seen from the perspective of the cached item . )
Ordered Array with Robust Efficient Iterator
Binary search of an array is an extremely time - and - space efficient search mechanism , likely to be faster in practice than binary search trees ; however , an ordered cannot efficiently handle insertions and deletions , which require O ( n ) time each .
If insertions and deletions are rare , however , binary search of an ordered data structure may be the best thing to do .
The iterator state will consist of the index into the array which is the next item to report .
( Again , I rely on the " complex " loop , which does an iteratorAdvance ( ) immediately after iteratorItem ( ) . )
If an item before the iterator is deleted , the iterator index must be decremented .
If an item before the iterator is inserted , the iterator index must be incremented .
Items after the iterator will not affect it .
The special case that must be considered for ordered data structures is a deletion of the item currently referenced by the iterator ( and possibly several further deletions ) .
Suppose the items are letters in alphabetical order .
Having just produced ' C ' , the iterator advances to index 3 , referencing a ' E ' , and the following character is an ' F ' .
At this stage , so long as the next item produced is strictly later in the alphabet than ' C ' , the algorithm can be considered correct .
So , deleting the ' E ' can not step backwards to ' C ' ( index =2 ) , since the semantics of the iterator index is that whatever item is currently pointed to will be next reported ; ' C ' has been reported once and should not be reported again .
Thus , the index must be left at ' 3 ' , which is now ' F ' .
Inserting either an ' E ' or a ' D ' is acceptable , since these will be inserted at index 3 -- but should the iterator advance or not ?
It 's ok if the iterator points at ' D ' or ' E ' , but it 's also ok to advance it in this case .
The answer here is subtle , but simple .
Suppose we pick the semantics that inserting at the current location does not advance the iterator .
This apparently means " it 's acceptable to produce on iteration an item which is inserted between the last item produced , and the next item about to be produced . "
This sounds like legitimate semantics , but it's an incorrect statement of what happens .
Consider the array " ACEF " .
' A ' and ' C ' are produced ; index = 3 , referring to ' E ' ( using array indices that start with 1 for expository purposes ) .
' E ' is deleted ; index = 3 , referring to ' F ' in " ACF " .
' C ' is deleted ; since the deletion is to the left of the index , index is decremented ; " AF " with index = 2 . Now insert ' C ' .
Index must be incremented to avoid double - reporting C .
The logic is simple : insertions before the currently - pointed - to - item may have been previously produced , and therefore cannot be given the " opportunity " to be doubly - reported .
The previous - item - in - the - list is not necessarily the last item produced , as the last item produced may have been deleted .
A plausible alternative would be to track the last key reported .
This would allow more consistent semantics ( if ' D ' were inserted while processing ' C ' , it would be sure to be reported ) , but would slow the iterator down , requiring an O ( lg n ) search for the key in the interesting cases ( and potentially all the time ) .
Simply constraining behavior on insertion works adequately with no performance overhead on the iterator .
With the previous analysis in hand , the code is simple to write , and the same analysis informs all ordered data structures , such as binary search trees .
This program has been compiled and tested .

Balanced Binary Search Tree
As noted in the previous section , the analysis for how to update an ordered array applies to any data structure with a fixed order .
The incrementing and decrementing of the iterator indices in that case corresponded to keeping the iterators pointing at the same item .
The only other operation was to advance to the next element in the data structure .
In a tree structure , therefore , a robust iterator requires exactly the same changes as an unordered linked list :
On deletion , advance iterators that point to the current item .
On insertion , do nothing special .
This only works for an inorder traversal of the tree , of course , because it is the inorder properties that a balanced tree tries to maintain during deletions and rotations .
Note that on a deletion , an iterator may have to be advanced at a cost of O ( lg n ) to find the successor ; however , this does not lead to O ( m lg n ) for the advance .
One could try to charge it to the amortized iteration ( see discussion below ) , but it 's worth noticing the following simple consideration : at the moment , we 're paying O( m lg n ) , but the only case where we actually pay a lgn factor is when the iterator does point to the item being deleted , and we find its successor .
However , on a given deletion , there is only one item being deleted , and only one successor .
Thus , once we pay that O ( lg n ) successor cost once , we should n't pay it again finding the exact same successor !
Thus , we can keep deletion down to a cost of O( m + lg n ) .
It is worth noticing , however , that this algorithm may no longer yield an O ( n ) iteration .
( Then again , it might -- it depends on the nature of operations being done , and how often they 're done . )
Each iteration step involves finding the successor of a node .
To do this , if the current node N is a leaf , then we go up the tree .
If we ever go up " rightwards " ( such that the child we came up from is left - child ) , we stop and produce that internal node .
As long as we go up " leftwards " , we continue .
If the current node N is an internal node , then we go down and to the right , and then find the leftmost node -- go leftward until we reach a node with no left child , and report that .
From the above description , it 's clear that no single operation will do more than O ( lg n ) steps in a balanced tree [ one with height O( lg n ) ] .
However , normally iteration is not O( n lg n ) : each link is followed exactly once downwards , and once upwards , so the number of links followed is O ( n ) , and so is iteration .
However , as soon as we start allowing deletions which change the location of nodes in the tree , we lose our guarantee of only following each link twice .
However , it seems likely that we can only take one O ( lg n ) hit for every insertion / deletion -- that is , the cost of iteration is O( n + ( m lg n ) ) where m is the number of insertion / deletions .
Thus we can push this charge onto the insertions and deletions instead , yielding an overall set of costs :
Cost with n items in tree , and m iterators active at time of operation :
O( n ) iteration
) iteration O ( lg n )
get
) get O( lg n ) +
O( m lg n ) insertion , deletion
Note that this is a larger charge than on the other data structures ; however , I 'm not sure that this analysis is actually fair -- it may be not actually be possible to find worst cases that yield this performance .
Skip List
The skiplist is yet another ordered data structure .
Thus all of the above analysis applies again .
Furthermore , finding the successor is an O ( 1 ) operation ( there is a direct link to it ) .
Therefore , the skiplist provides a very efficient robust iterator , no questions asked .
( As noted above , the balanced binary search trees might be efficient , as I 'm not sure that my bounds are sufficiently tight . )
This does not mean skip lists should be recommended over tree - oriented ordered data structures , as the skip list has the three problems of : overhead of managing variably - sized data elements , performance overhead of generating random numbers , and the danger of processing data which exposes flaws in the random number generator .
Hash Table with External Chaining
As noted before , if a hash table shrinks and grows , iteration is problematic .
With internal chaining , if an item is deleted and re-inserted , it might be doubly reported .
However , if external chaining is used without any rehashing ( that is , without shrinking or growing the hash table ) , and if the external chaining is implemented using an unsorted linked - list , then the hash table has a simple robust iterator .
This is because the hash table simply consists of a collection of linked lists , each of which can be iterated , in turn , using the simple robust linked - list iterator .
Insertions must be made to the front of the linked lists .
If the iterator is currently on hash #x , and an item is inserted into hash #y , y > x , then the item so inserted will be visited during the iteration -- unlike the pure linked - list iterator , which never visits items inserted during iteration .
The hash table iterator relies on that property to make sure that an item deleted and reinserted is n't visited twice , by making sure that the list currently being traversed does n't have the delete - insert problem .
