Tampa , Fla . ( Apr. 23 , 2008 ) - Researchers seeking new and more abundant sources of stem cells for use in regenerative medicine have identified a potentially unlimited , noncontroversial , easily collectable , and inexpensive source - menstrual blood .
Stromal stem cells - cells that are present in connective tissues - have recently been identified in endometrial tissues of the uterus .
When the fresh growth of tissue and blood vessels is shed during each menstrual cycle , some cells with regenerative capabilities are present and collectable .
While collecting menstrual blood stromal cells ( MenSCs ) directly from tissue would be invasive , retrieving them during the menstrual cycle would not be .
" Stromal stem cells derived from menstrual blood exhibit stem cell properties , such as the capacity for self - renewal and multipotency , " said Amit N. Patel , MD , MS , Director of Cardiac Cell Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh 's McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine .
" Uterine stromal cells have similar multipotent markers found in bone marrow stem cells and originate in part from bone marrow . "
Published in the most recent issue of Cell Transplantation ( Volume 17 , issue 3 ) , the study examined to what degree MenSCs demonstrated an ability to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages .
Tests showed that MenSCs could differentiate into adipogenic , chondrogenic , osteogenic , ectodermal , mesodermal , cardiogenic , and neural cell lineages .
According to Patel , the sample MenSCs expanded rapidly and maintained greater than 50 percent of their telomerase activity when compared to human embryonic stem cells and better than bone marrow - derived stem cells .
" Studies have demonstrated that MenSCs are easily expandable to clinical relevance and express multipotent markers at both the molecular and cellular level , " concluded Patel .
Researchers emphasized the importance of the abundance and plasticity of MenSCs .
Based on the results of their studies , they noted the potential for MenSCs in regenerative transplantation therapies for many different organs and tissues .
" The need for regenerative therapies using cells with the ability to engraft and differentiate is vast , " said Patel .
" The ideal cell would also have the ability to be used in an allogenic manner from donors for optimal immunogenic compatibility .
Due to their ease of collection and isolation , MenSCs would be a great source of multipotent cells if they exhibit this property along with their ability to differentiate , " concluded Julie G. Allickson , Ph.D. , Vice President of Laboratory Operations and Research & Development , Cryo- Cell International , Inc. , the study - partner company that identified , extracted , and initially analyzed the cells .
" The preliminary results are extremely encouraging and support the importance of further study of these cells in several different areas including heart disease , diabetes and neurodegenerative disease . "
Dwaine Emerich , Ph.D. , a section editor for Cell Transplantation , believes that " These studies are a significant step forward in the development of transplantable stem cells for human diseases because they address major issues including routine and safe cell harvesting of renewable cells that maintain their differentiation capacity and can be scaled for widespread clinical use .

Oil at $ 110 a barrel .
Gasoline at $ 3.35 ( or more ) per gallon .
Diesel fuel at $ 4 per gallon .
Independent truckers forced off the road .
Home heating oil rising to unconscionable price levels .
Jet fuel so expensive that three low - cost airlines stopped flying in the past few weeks .
This is just a taste of the latest energy news , signaling a profound change in how all of us , in this country and around the world , are going to live -- trends that , so far as anyone can predict , will only become more pronounced as energy supplies dwindle and the global struggle over their allocation intensifies .
Energy of all sorts was once hugely abundant , making possible the worldwide economic expansion of the past six decades .
This expansion benefited the United States above all -- along with its “ First World ” allies in Europe and the Pacific .
Recently , however , a select group of former “ Third World ” countries -- China and India in particular -- have sought to participate in this energy bonanza by industrializing their economies and selling a wide range of goods to international markets .
This , in turn , has led to an unprecedented spurt in global energy consumption -- a 47 % rise in the past 20 years alone , according to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DoE ) .
An increase of this sort would not be a matter of deep anxiety if the world ’s primary energy suppliers were capable of producing the needed additional fuels .
Instead , we face a frightening reality : a marked slowdown in the expansion of global energy supplies just as demand rises precipitously .
These supplies are not exactly disappearing -- though that will occur sooner or later -- but they are not growing fast enough to satisfy soaring global demand .
The combination of rising demand , the emergence of powerful new energy consumers , and the contraction of the global energy supply is demolishing the energy - abundant world we are familiar with and creating in its place a new world order .
Think of it as : rising powers / shrinking planet .
This new world order will be characterized by fierce international competition for dwindling stocks of oil , natural gas , coal , and uranium , as well as by a tidal shift in power and wealth from energy - deficit states like China , Japan , and the United States to energy - surplus states like Russia , Saudi Arabia , and Venezuela .
In the process , the lives of everyone will be affected in one way or another -- with poor and middle - class consumers in the energy - deficit states experiencing the harshest effects .
That ’s most of us and our children , in case you had n’t quite taken it in .
Here , in a nutshell , are five key forces in this new world order which will change our planet :
1. Intense competition between older and newer economic powers for available supplies of energy : Until very recently , the mature industrial powers of Europe , Asia , and North America consumed the lion ’s share of energy and left the dregs for the developing world .
As recently as 1990 , the members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the club of the world ’s richest nations , consumed approximately 57 % of world energy ; the Soviet Union / Warsaw Pact bloc , 14 % percent ; and only 29 % was left to the developing world .
But that ratio is changing :
With strong economic growth in the developing countries , a greater proportion of the world ’s energy is being consumed by them .
By 2010 , the developing world ’s share of energy use is expected to reach 40 % and , if current trends persist , 47 % by 2030 .
China plays a critical role in all this .
The Chinese alone are projected to consume 17 % of world energy by 2015 , and 20 % by 2025 -- by which time , if trend lines continue , it will have overtaken the United States as the world ’s leading energy consumer .
India , which , in 2004 , accounted for 3.4 % of world energy use , is projected to reach 4.4 % percent by 2025 , while consumption in other rapidly industrializing nations like Brazil , Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , and Turkey is expected to grow as well .
These rising economic dynamos will have to compete with the mature economic powers for access to remaining untapped reserves of exportable energy -- in many cases , bought up long ago by the private energy firms of the mature powers like Exxon Mobil , Chevron , BP , Total of France , and Royal Dutch Shell .
Of necessity , the new contenders have developed a potent strategy for competing with the Western “ majors ” : they ’ve created state - owned companies of their own and fashioned strategic alliances with the national oil companies that now control oil and gas reserves in many of the major energy - producing nations .
China ’s Sinopec , for example , has established a strategic alliance with Saudi Aramco , the nationalized giant once owned by Chevron and Exxon Mobil , to explore for natural gas in Saudi Arabia and market Saudi crude oil in China .
Likewise , the China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) will collaborate with Gazprom , the massive state - controlled Russian natural gas monopoly , to build pipelines and deliver Russian gas to China .
Several of these state - owned firms , including CNPC and India ’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation , are now set to collaborate with Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. in developing the extra- heavy crude of the Orinoco belt once controlled by Chevron .
In this new stage of energy competition , the advantages long enjoyed by Western energy majors has been eroded by vigorous , state - backed upstarts from the developing world .
2 . The insufficiency of primary energy supplies :
The capacity of the global energy industry to satisfy demand is shrinking .
By all accounts , the global supply of oil will expand for perhaps another half - decade before reaching a peak and beginning to decline , while supplies of natural gas , coal , and uranium will probably grow for another decade or two before peaking and commencing their own inevitable declines .
In the meantime , global supplies of these existing fuels will prove incapable of reaching the elevated levels demanded .
Take oil .
The U.S. Department of Energy claims that world oil demand , expected to reach 117.6 million barrels per day in 2030 , will be matched by a supply that -- miracle of miracles -- will hit exactly 117.7 million barrels ( including petroleum liquids derived from allied substances like natural gas and Canadian tar sands ) at the same time .
Most energy professionals , however , consider this estimate highly unrealistic .
“ One hundred million barrels is now in my view an optimistic case , ” the CEO of Total , Christophe de Margerie , typically told a London oil conference in October 2007 .
“ It is not my view ; it is the industry view , or the view of those who like to speak clearly , honestly , and [ are ] not just trying to please people . ”
Similarly , the authors of the Medium - Term Oil Market Report , published in July 2007 by the International Energy Agency , an affiliate of the OECD , concluded that world oil output might hit 96 million barrels per day by 2012 , but was unlikely to go much beyond that as a dearth of new discoveries made future growth impossible .
Daily business - page headlines point to a vortex of clashing trends : worldwide demand will continue to grow as hundred of millions of newly - affluent Chinese and Indian consumers line up to purchase their first automobile ( some selling for as little as $ 2,500 ) ; key older “ elephant ” oil fields like Ghawar in Saudi Arabia and Canterell in Mexico are already in decline or expected to be so soon ; and the rate of new oil - field discoveries plunges year after year .
So expect global energy shortages and high prices to be a constant source of hardship .
3 . The painfully slow development of energy alternatives :
It has long been evident to policymakers that new sources of energy are desperately needed to compensate for the eventual disappearance of existing fuels as well as to slow the buildup of climate - changing “ greenhouse gases ” in the atmosphere .
In fact , wind and solar power have gained significant footholds in some parts of the world .
A number of other innovative energy solutions have already been developed and even tested out in university and corporate laboratories .
But these alternatives , which now contribute only a tiny percentage of the world ’s net fuel supply , are simply not being developed fast enough to avert the multifaceted global energy catastrophe that lies ahead .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , renewable fuels , including wind , solar , and hydropower ( along with “ traditional ” fuels like firewood and dung ) , supplied but 7.4 % of global energy in 2004 ; biofuels added another 0.3 % .
Meanwhile , fossil fuels -- oil , coal , and natural gas -- supplied 86 % percent of world energy , nuclear power another 6 % .
Based on current rates of development and investment , the DoE offers the following dismal projection :
In 2030 , fossil fuels will still account for exactly the same share of world energy as in 2004 .
The expected increase in renewables and biofuels is so slight -- a mere 8.1 % -- as to be virtually meaningless .
In global warming terms , the implications are nothing short of catastrophic : Rising reliance on coal ( especially in China , India , and the United States ) means that global emissions of carbon dioxide are projected to rise by 59 % over the next quarter - century , from 26.9 billion metric tons to 42.9 billion tons .
The meaning of this is simple .
If these figures hold , there is no hope of averting the worst effects of climate change .
When it comes to global energy supplies , the implications are nearly as dire .
To meet soaring energy demand , we would need a massive influx of alternative fuels , which would mean equally massive investment -- in the trillions of dollars -- to ensure that the newest possibilities move rapidly from laboratory to full - scale commercial production ; but that , sad to say , is not in the cards .
Instead , the major energy firms ( backed by lavish U.S. government subsidies and tax breaks ) are putting their mega - windfall profits from rising energy prices into vastly expensive ( and environmentally questionable ) schemes to extract oil and gas from Alaska and the Arctic , or to drill in the deep and difficult waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean .
The result ?
A few more barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas at exorbitant prices ( with accompanying ecological damage ) , while non-petroleum alternatives limp along pitifully .
4 . A steady migration of power and wealth from energy - deficit to energy - surplus nations :
There are few countries -- perhaps a dozen altogether -- with enough oil , gas , coal , and uranium ( or some combination thereof ) to meet their own energy needs and provide significant surpluses for export .
Not surprisingly , such states will be able to extract increasingly beneficial terms from the much wider pool of energy - deficit nations dependent on them for vital supplies of energy .
These terms , primarily of a financial nature , will result in growing mountains of petrodollars being accumulated by the leading oil producers , but will also include political and military concessions .
In the case of oil and natural gas , the major energy - surplus states can be counted on two hands .
Ten oil - rich states possess 82.2 % of the world ’s proven reserves .
In order of importance , they are : Saudi Arabia , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Venezuela , Russia , Libya , Kazakhstan , and Nigeria .
The possession of natural gas is even more concentrated .
Three countries -- Russia , Iran , and Qatar -- harbor an astonishing 55.8 % of the world supply .
All of these countries are in an enviable position to cash in on the dramatic rise in global energy prices and to extract from potential customers whatever political concessions they deem important .
The transfer of wealth alone is already mind - boggling .
The oil - exporting countries collected an estimated $ 970 billion from the importing countries in 2006 , and the take for 2007 , when finally calculated , is expected to be far higher .
A substantial fraction of these dollars , yen , and euros have been deposited in “ sovereign - wealth funds ” ( SWFs ) , giant investment accounts owned by the oil states and deployed for the acquisition of valuable assets around the world .
In recent months , the Persian Gulf SWFs have been taking advantage of the financial crisis in the United States to purchase large stakes in strategic sectors of its economy .
In November 2007 , for example , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) acquired a $ 7.5 billion stake in Citigroup , America ’s largest bank holding company ; in January , Citigroup sold an even larger share , worth $ 12.5 billion , to the Kuwait Investment Authority ( KIA ) and several other Middle Eastern investors , including Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia .
The managers of ADIA and KIA insist that they do not intend to use their newly - acquired stakes in Citigroup and other U.S. banks and corporations to influence U.S. economic or foreign policy , but it is hard to imagine that a financial shift of this magnitude , which can only gain momentum in the decades ahead , will not translate into some form of political leverage .
In the case of Russia , which has risen from the ashes of the Soviet Union as the world ’s first energy superpower , it already has .
Russia is now the world ’s leading supplier of natural gas , the second largest supplier of oil , and a major producer of coal and uranium .
Though many of these assets were briefly privatized during the reign of Boris Yeltsin , President Vladimir Putin has brought most of them back under state control -- in some cases , by exceedingly questionable legal means .
He then used these assets in campaigns to bribe or coerce former Soviet republics on Russia ’s periphery reliant on it for the bulk of their oil and gas supplies .
European Union countries have sometimes expressed dismay at Putin ’s tactics , but they , too , are dependent on Russian energy supplies , and so have learned to mute their protests to accommodate growing Russian power in Eurasia .
Consider Russia a model for the new energy world order .
5 . A growing risk of conflict : Throughout history , major shifts in power have normally been accompanied by violence -- in some cases , protracted violent upheavals .
Either states at the pinnacle of power have struggled to prevent the loss of their privileged status , or challengers have fought to topple those at the top of the heap .
Will that happen now ?
Will energy - deficit states launch campaigns to wrest the oil and gas reserves of surplus states from their control -- the Bush administration ’s war in Iraq might already be thought of as one such attempt -- or to eliminate competitors among their deficit - state rivals ?
The high costs and risks of modern warfare are well known and there is a widespread perception that energy problems can best be solved through economic means , not military ones .
Nevertheless , the major powers are employing military means in their efforts to gain advantage in the global struggle for energy , and no one should be deluded on the subject .
These endeavors could easily enough lead to unintended escalation and conflict .
One conspicuous use of military means in the pursuit of energy is obviously the regular transfer of arms and military - support services by the major energy - importing states to their principal suppliers .
Both the United States and China , for example , have stepped up their deliveries of arms and equipment to oil - producing states like Angola , Nigeria , and Sudan in Africa and , in the Caspian Sea basin , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgyzstan .
The United States has placed particular emphasis on suppressing the armed insurgency in the vital Niger Delta region of Nigeria , where most of the country ’s oil is produced ; Beijing has emphasized arms aid to Sudan , where Chinese - led oil operations are threatened by insurgencies in both the South and Darfur .
Russia is also using arms transfers as an instrument in its efforts to gain influence in the major oil - and gas - producing regions of the Caspian Sea basin and the Persian Gulf .
Its urge is not to procure energy for its own use , but to dominate the flow of energy to others .
In particular , Moscow seeks a monopoly on the transportation of Central Asian gas to Europe via Gazprom ’s vast pipeline network ; it also wants to tap into Iran ’s mammoth gas fields , further cementing Russia ’s control over the trade in natural gas .
The danger , of course , is that such endeavors , multiplied over time , will provoke regional arms races , exacerbate regional tensions , and increase the danger of great - power involvement in any local conflicts that erupt .
History has all too many examples of such miscalculations leading to wars that spiral out of control .
Think of the years leading up to World War I .
In fact , Central Asia and the Caspian today , with their multiple ethnic disorders and great - power rivalries , bear more than a glancing resemblance to the Balkans in the years leading up to 1914 .
What this adds up to is simple and sobering : the end of the world as you ’ve known it .
In the new , energy - centric world we have all now entered , the price of oil will dominate our lives and power will reside in the hands of those who control its global distribution .
In this new world order , energy will govern our lives in new ways and on a daily basis .
It will determine when , and for what purposes , we use our cars ; how high ( or low ) we turn our thermostats ; when , where , or even if , we travel ; increasingly , what foods we eat ( given that the price of producing and distributing many meats and vegetables is profoundly affected by the cost of oil or the allure of growing corn for ethanol ) ; for some of us , where to live ; for others , what businesses we engage in ; for all of us , when and under what circumstances we go to war or avoid foreign entanglements that could end in war .
This leads to a final observation :
The most pressing decision facing the next president and Congress may be how best to accelerate the transition from a fossil - fuel - based energy system to a system based on climate - friendly energy alternatives .

TOLEDO , Ohio – Barack Obama yesterday lashed out at political enemies who are spreading false rumors that he ’s a closet Muslim as he proclaimed , “ I pray to Jesus every night . ”
“ I am a devout Christian , ” he told voters in this key state .
“ I pray to Jesus every night and try to go to church as much as I can . ”
In some of his strongest comments to date , Obama , in response to a question about his religious beliefs , said he wanted to put an end to “ so much confusion [ that has been ] deliberately perpetrated . ”
Obama ’s bid to end the rumor - mongering came just days after his campaign accused Hillary Rodham Clinton of launching a deliberate smear after the Drudge Report Web site reported that one of her staffers had forwarded photos of him wearing a turban on a 2006 trip to Africa .
In addition , numerous e-mails have circulated for months saying falsely that Obama is a Muslim .
Obama ’s late father , who was from Kenya , was a Christian who converted to Islam , though he was not religious .
Obama himself was never a Muslim and has been a member of the same Christian church for the last 20 years .
On a recent visit to Cleveland , The Post conducted an informal survey of about a dozen people and found that most did n’t know Obama ’s faith – and many incorrectly assumed he was a Muslim .
Some Ohio Democrats even thought he had sworn the oath of office while holding the Koran – another false Internet rumor .
Trying to reassure voters yesterday , Obama told the audience in rural Nelsonville that they would feel right at home in his church in Chicago .
Meanwhile , Clinton and Obama were battling for an edge in Ohio – which holds its primary tomorrow – as polls showed her with a lead .
The Cleveland Plain Dealer put Clinton up by 4 points , 47 to 43 percent , while the Columbus Dispatch poll gave her a 16 - point lead , 56 to 40 percent .
Both campaigned in Westerville , Ohio , but missed each other by several hours .
Clinton continued to hammer Obama ’s experience , saying he , while eloquent in making promises , was short on results .
“ For some people , this election is about how you feel , it ’s about speeches , ” Clinton told a rally of about 2,000 people .
“ Well , that ’s not what it ’s about for me .
It ’s about solutions . ”
Clinton held rallies in Youngstown , Akron and Cleveland , and had another event on tap for today in Toledo before she flies for a nationwide town - hall meeting in Texas .
Obama hit back hard at Clinton , blasting a TV ad she released that called her the candidate better able to respond to a national crisis in the wee hours .
“ What precise foreign - policy experience is she claiming that makes her qualified to answer that telephone call at 3 a.m. in the morning ? ” Obama said at a town - hall meeting .
“ She did n’t give diplomacy a chance .
And to this day , she wo n’t even admit that her vote was a mistake – or even that it was a vote for war , ” he said .
“ When it came time to make the most important foreign - policy decision of our generation , the decision to invade Iraq , Sen. Clinton got it wrong . ”

GUANTANAMO BAY , CAMP X-RAY
" 053 , GET READY FOR THE ESCORT TEAM ! "
It was still dark .
The numbers of Erhan and Serkan and of the two Uzbeks were also called .
It was our turn .
We were gathered at a spot in front of the open hanger , led off one by one , and brought to a tent .
There they cut off our beards and shaved our heads .
At least they would no longer be able to drag me around by the hair , I thought .
We received new orange - colored overalls , and they chained us back up .
" We 're gonna put you now into the same cave with Osama bin Laden , " said the soldier who had shaved my head , " and then we 're gonna shoot you . "
They did n't put a sack over my head this time .
Instead they wrapped it up like a package with soundproof headphones , a gas mask , blinders , and watertight , thick black diving goggles .
The soldier tightened the handcuffs so that they immediately began to hurt .
It was hardly bearable .
" Too strong , " I murmured underneath the mask .
I was trying to tell the soldier that the handcuffs were too tight , but I did n't know the right word .
" Let me see , " I heard another soldier say , who must have been standing next to the first one .
I held out the cuffs in his direction , but he tightened them even more around my wrists .
You bastard , I thought .
He put something thick and stiff over my hands - gloves or maybe mittens .
Then he hit me in the face and kicked me in the genitals .
I fell .
They carried me out of the tent and threw me on the ground .
I was told to lie there on my side .
" You guys are going to get shot , " the soldier said .
That I understood .
And as I lay there for four , five , or maybe six hours in front of the hangar , I also understood the purpose of all of the get - up .
The g loves were n't meant t o warm my hands , and the headphones and mask were n't there to protect my ears and face .
They were there to ensure the soldiers ' safety , so we could n't bite , scratch , or spit at them .
We could n't cough any bacteria into their faces , spread any germs , or infect them with a disease .
They did n't care whether we suffocated under the masks .
I knew what awaited us : a first - class flight .
They chained us together and herded us onto the plane .
We were bound so tightly we could n't move a millimeter .
Again , I thought that they were taking us to an American military base in Turkey .
What else was I supposed to think ?
Sleep would have been the only consolation in such a situation .
But the soldiers kept hitting us to keep us awake .
I thought about the American movies I had seen in Bremen .
Action flicks and war movies .
I used to admire the Americans .
Now I was getting to know their true nature .
I say that without anger .
It 's simply the truth , as I saw and experienced it .
I do n't want to insult anyone , and I 'm not talking about all Americans .
But the ones I encountered are terrified of pain .
They 're afraid of every little scratch , bacteria , and illness .
They 're like little girls , I 'd say .
If you examine Americans closely , you realize this - no matter how big or powerful they are .
But in movies , they 're always the heroes .
The flight must have lasted twenty - seven hours .
Somewhere we made a stopover .
We were n't able to move throughout the entire flight .
They never loosened the restraints , not for a moment .
We did n't know where we had landed or where they were taking us .
We did n't even know if we were going to arrive alive .
I felt the heat immediately and could hear the barking of dogs in spite of the soundproof headphones .
Through the goggles , I could perceive the bright light of the sun .
On the runway , the first prisoners collapsed .
They took off our face masks .
The sunlight was blinding .
We were told to lie on the ground .
I kept my eyes closed .
I heard the clicking of cameras .
We were being photographed .
" Do n't move . "
I carefully opened my eyes , but all I could see were boots on the glittering concrete surface .
They put our masks back on - mine was a bit loose .
They herded us into a bus .
It was white .
It was dark inside the vehicle .
There were no seats in the bus , just hooks attached to the floor .
They chained us to the hooks so that we could neither sit nor stand properly .
They kept hitting us , and the dogs , which had been taken onto bus , bit us .
" Do n't sit like that ! "
A blow followed .
" Sit differently ! "
Another blow .
" Sit up straight ! "
It was unbelievably hot on the bus .
We must be in a country with warm winters , I thought .
Southern Turkey ?
It was February or March .
Maybe somewhere near the city of Adana .
Adana could have been this hot .
It was definitely above ninety degrees .
I felt the bus drive across a bridge or an on -ramp .
Then we stopped .
The bus began to sway .
We must be on a ship , I thought .
They were kicking us constantly , and the ship listed to one side .
Is there an American military base on an island off the coast of Adana , I asked myself .
Or are they taking us to Cyprus ?
Then we rolled back down the ramp and left the ship .
At some point - we could n't have driven more than a half - hour - the bus stopped .
" Get out !
Out ! "
We had to kneel and lower our heads to our chests .
There was a crunching sound .
From under my mask , I could see gravel .
I do n't know how long exactly we knelt there .
Several hours .
The heat was unbearable .
In Afghanistan and on the plane , it had been ice - cold .
The soldiers were constantly yelling and hitting us .
At last , I was allowed to stand up .
The soldiers pushed me forward , and I stumbled barefoot across the gravel .
The way was long , with lots of left and right turns .
They yelled at me the whole time .
" Terrorist ! "
" We 'll kill you ! "
" Motherfucker ! "
Then a soldier yelled , " Stop ! " Someone took the mask from my head .
I was standing in a tent .
I saw a name tag .
It was the first time I saw a soldier with his name on his chest .
I will never forget it .
Two other soldiers held my arms tight .
They took off the gloves .
" I speak German , " said the man with the name tag .
" We 're going to have a really great time together . "
A number of soldiers were busy doing things to me .
They pulled out hairs from my arms , put a swab in my mouth , and took my fingerprints .
Someone was always fiddling with me .
The procedure took quite a while .
I kept looking at the one soldier 's chest , at his name tag .
I was weighed , and they measured my height .
" Name ? " they asked .
Murat Kurnaz .
Spelling !
K -U-R-N- A-Z .
It was a wonder to me that I could still talk .
I had n't slept properly in weeks because of the noise from the planes , bombs , and electrical generators in Kandahar and because of the interrogations .
But at least I was standing up .
I was happy to be standing because we sat the whole time on the plane .
I did n't know how I was able to stand .
It was almost as though the name tag on the male soldier 's chest was keeping me upright .
I will call him Cecil Stewart .
They put an armband on me .
There was a new number on it : 061 .
It was green and made of plastic .
" This is a nice place , " said one of the soldiers who had taken hair and saliva samples .
" Lots of trees . "
Trees ?
Were they making fun of me ?
He pointed outside the tent .
The tent door was open .
I could n't see any trees .
I saw hills .
Hills and sand and cactus .
Big cactus .
There are n't any trees where cacti grow .
" Do you know why you 're here ? " I heard the man with the nametag ask .
" Do you know what the Germans did to the Jews ? " he said .
" That 's exactly what we 're going to do with you . "
Someone grabbed me by the shirt and pushed me out of the tent .
Outside I saw a number of tightly packed rows of chain - link fence .
It was like a labyrinth .
I saw another prisoner in his orange overalls being led through the fencing .
The soldiers immediately threw me to the ground .
I landed on the gravel .
" Lie there ! "
The man with the nametag pressed his knee into the back of my neck , pushing my face into the gravel , so that I could no longer see the other prisoner and the escort team .
Only when they were out of sight did we move on .
Where is the prison they 're taking me to ?
I asked myself .
We passed through a number of doors in the chain - link fence and arrived at a pen , also made of chain - link fence .
These were cages .
Prisoners in orange overalls were already sitting there , each in their own little cages .
One beside the other , all in a row , like tigers or lions in a zoo .
The labyrinth had to be pretty big if we were all going to fit in here .
Surely these strange cages were only an intermediate station .
But all I could see around me were hills and cactus .
Maybe the prison was over the crest of one of the hills .
The soldiers opened up a cage and pushed me inside .
I was told to kneel .
" You are Charlie - Charlie - 3 . Say it ! "
" Charlie - Charlie - 3 , " I said .
I had trouble understanding .
Why was my cage called Charlie - Charlie -3 ?
Then the soldier took off the chains and locked the door in the fence .
" Sit down ! " they ordered .
I sat down .
" Do n't move ! " they snarled .
I did n't move .
They yelled something else that I did n't understand , but I suspected it was about how they were going to kill me .
But surely they could have done that a lot more easily earlier .
The soldiers left .
I thought they would come back in a few minutes and get me .
I sat somewhat more comfortably Indian - style and collected myself .
I rubbed my wrists and ankles , which were swollen and bloody .
At least they had taken the cuffs off .
That felt better , and I calmed down a bit , even though I felt a stinging sensation , as if being poked by a thousand needles .
I need to distract myself so I looked around .
In the cage , there were two plastic buckets , the color of eggshells and semitransparent .
One contained some water that stank .
Perhaps for washing , I thought .
The other seemed to be the toilet .
There was a thin foam mattress , less than an inch thick , on the ground and a blanket on top .
Next to the blanket were a piece of soap , a towel , and a pair of flipflops .
We 'll be taking these new things with us , I thought .
We 're probably just waiting here while they prepare our cells .
The prisoners in the other cages greeted me .
Salam alaikum .
Alaikum salam .
One of the prisoners in a nearby cage looked like an Afghan Uzbek .
He , too , greeted me .
I asked him in Turkish how long he'd been here , but he did n't understand .
I tried to communicate with my hands .
You ?
Here ?
I counted on my fingers : one , two , three , four ...
The Uzbek answered in his native tongue and held up all his fingers twice : " Twenty . "
I took this to mean twenty minutes .
He 'd been in his cage twenty minutes longer than I had in mine .
I waited .
Someone would soon come and get us .
Still seated , I measured my cage with my hand .
I knew from my shipbuilder 's apprenticeship how long the span between my thumb and little finger was when my fingers were stretched out .
So I did n't need a measuring tape to figure out that the cage was six feet by seven .
It was around six feet high .
All told , it was less than fifteen square feet .
In Germany , there 's a law that kennels in the animal shelter have to be at least twenty square feet .
I knew that because I myself had been a dog owner .
I waited and looked around .
Not far from me , a prisoner was being led through the chain - link fences .
He was still wearing his mask and the soundproof headphones , and I heard the soldiers screaming at him .
They kept walking back and forth along the same passageway .
Now I understood how we had come here .
I thought that we had walked a long distance , but the spot where we had been forced to kneel for hours before they took the mask off was only a few yards away from my cage .
We had kneeled directly beside one another , but we did n't know that .
They led us around in circles until we thought that we were in a large camp or a prison .
But the whole time we had always been in the same place within the maze of chain - link fence pens .
I thought , if it 's March , my birthday is coming up .
What a surprise .
Suddenly I heard a quiet splashing .
A frog was swimming in the bucket of water .
I had only ever seen them on television - frogs do n't live on the Weser River in Bremen .
It must have been looking for water in this desert .
Where had it come from ?
I fished him out of the stinking water .
It sat on my hand and looked at me , breathing rapidly .
I tried to pat it gently , but it hopped to the ground and disappeared through the fence .
Hour upon hour I waited .
No one came .
No one was brought away and relocated .
In the end , guards came with something to eat .
On paper plates , as I saw from a distance , but it was something .
Until now we had only ever gotten Emaries .
I was looking forward to eating some real food .
Maybe everything would get better .
It could n't be any worse than in Kandahar .
That would prove to be a mistake ... in every respect .
As the guards approached my cage , all I saw on the plate were three spoonfuls of rice , a slice of dry bread , and a plastic spoon .
That was it .
They shoved the plates through a small square opening around knee - height within the fencing .
I thought there must be some sort of mistake .
Perhaps something had fallen off the plate .
Then I saw the rations given to the Uzbek .
It was the same miserably tiny pile of rice , or maybe even less .
I would have rather had an Emarie .
At least they contained crackers .
I ate the rice and looked at my armband .
The rice was cold and not fully cooked ; the kernels were as hard as sand .
But it was all I had to eat .
My armband read : " Kunn , Murat , male , Turkish , 5 - foot - 4 , 165 pounds . "
They had misspelled my name - after all the time they kept me in custody and despite having confiscated my travel papers .
I drank some water from the bucket .
I was exhausted .
The difference in climate between here and Kandahar was enormous .
Suddenly , within a matter of minutes , the sky grew dark .
The sun was gone , and harsh bright lights were switched on .
The light came from neon lamps affixed to the corrugated aluminum roof and a large number of spotlights that were mounted on sentry posts and the fences .
It reminded me of the soccer stadium in Bremen .
From loudspeakers that must have been hanging somewhere , there came some static and then a call to prayer .
The time for evening prayers was a while ago , I thought , but then suddenly the voice was drowned out by loud music .
It was the American national anthem .
I heard the other prisoners start to complain , but that did n't help .
At some point , I knelt , carried out the prayer ritual and said as well as I could in Arabic : " Praise be to Allah .
Allah hears all who praise him . "
I bowed thirty - three times .
Rock music was now blaring from the speakers , almost too loud to bear .
The volume was louder than in any Bremen disco I 'd ever experienced .
I had a sneaking suspicion that the Uzbek had n't been saying he'd been in his cage twenty minutes longer than me .
He had meant twenty days .
They were n't going to be taking us to prison today .
That was all right by me .
Despite the light and the noise , all I wanted to do was sleep .
But I could n't sleep .
Every few minutes , guards came and pounded the fence with their nightsticks .
Every few minutes someone , sometimes next to me and sometimes in front of me , killed something in his cage and threw it out - snakes , rats , and spiders .
The guards ' boots crunched on the gravel .
And then there were the 1,000 - watt spotlights .
The guards returned .
We all had to get up and " identify ourselves . "
We had to extend our hands through the opening in the cage where the food had been shoved through , so that they could read our armbands .
Later they pounded on the fencing of my cage because I had my hands under the blanket .
" Take your hands out ! "
Later still , they rattled the fencing because I was lying on my side .
" Lie on your back ! "
At some point , I feel asleep from sheer exhaustion .
Camp X - Ray had been built especially for us , and true to its name , it was supposed to be a prison camp in which everything was completely transparent .
This was something entirely new .
There were no cells where you could be alone .
There was no privacy , no protection from the watching eyes of the guards or the cameras , not even for a second .
The cages were so small that it drove you to desperation .
At the same time , nature - and freedom - were so tantalizingly close it could make you go crazy .
An animal has more space in its cage in a zoo and is given more to eat .
I can hardly put into words what that actually means .
The cellblocks all had a second roof of corrugated tin , but the cages were still somewhat in the wilderness .
The sun beat down , and there was no refuge in the shade unless the sun was shining directly on the tin roof , which hung about a foot above the chain - link fence roof proper of the cages .
The aluminium also heated up fast .
We were just as exposed to the rain since it always was driven in from the side .
You could n't escape it no matter which corner of the cage you crept into .
The camp contained six cell - blocks : Alpha , Bravo , Charlie , Delta , Echo , and Foxtrot .
The blocks were separated by narrow corridors through the chain - link fence pens .
Every block had six wings , also named from Alpha to Foxtrot .
A wing consisted of ten cages arranged at a right angle .
Every cage had a name : Alpha - Bravo 1 , Bravo - Charlie 5 , Delta - Alpha 9 . I was in Charlie - Charlie 3 .
There were high chain - link walls around the six blocks , interrupted by guard towers with sharpshooters .
The initial days in Camp X - Ray were n't easy .
I did n't know we were in Cuba .
I had no idea what rules applied here .
The rules were constantly changing anyway , and you 'd get punished for breaking them .
The first night I learned that I was only allowed to cover my legs , and nothing else , with the blanket , and that I was n't allowed to sleep on my side , only on my back .
In the days that followed , I learned that I was n't allowed to get up and walk around my cage .
During the day , we had to remain seated and at night we had to lie down .
If you lay down during the day , you were punished .
We were n't allowed to touch the fence or even lean our backs up against it .
We were n't allowed to talk .
We were n't to speak to or look at the guards .
We were n't allowed to draw in the sand or whistle or sing or smile .
Every time I unknowingly broke a rule or , because they had just invented a new one , did something I should n't have , the IRF team would come and beat me .
IRF stood for " Immediate Reaction Force " and consisted of five to eight soldiers with plastic shields , breastplates , hard - plastic knee - , elbow - , and shoulder - protectors , helmets with plastic visors , gloves with hard - plastic knuckles , heavy boots , and billy clubs .
I would say they were thugs .
Thugs whose entire bodies were protected by bullet - and knife - proof gear .
They did n't have weapons with them other than the billy clubs - probably because they were afraid of us getting our hands on them .
I often saw fear in their eyes as they stood in front of our cages and waited to be deployed , even though we did n't have shoes on and were already cowering on the ground .
They came with pepper spray in a kind of pressurized aerosol gun that they could aim precisely at a prisoner from ten feet away .
It contained oleoresin capisicum , which is made from chili peppers .
They sprayed the entire cage and waited until the prisoner was completely unable to resist .
Then they stormed in .
" Get up ! " " Hurry ! "
" Get up ! "
I heard loud rock music , and I heard their commands .
The pepper spray burned my nose , throat , and eyes .
I had to cough .
The burning was diabolical .
" Get up ! " they yelled .
" Get to the wall ! "
" Hands to the wall ! "
" Move ! Move ! " happening to me .
I heard them beating the fence with their billy clubs .
When the cage door was opened , I heard them yelling .
I felt a baton blow to my head .
I huddled , and they beat me .
They picked me up and threw me to the ground .
They kicked and punched me .
I curled up into a ball .
Then I got angry and tried to defend myself .
I jumped to my feet , blind , and started swinging my arms .
I got hold of someone 's helmet , but they forced me back down and grabbed me by the genitals .
They held my arms and legs to the ground , until I was lying there like an animal about to be drawn and quartered .
One of them pressed his shield on my chest , while another punched me in the face .
At some point , I could n't hear the music anymore .
I heard nothing .
I did n't get much sleep the night of my first visit from the IRF team .
I lay on my back - shaken by throbbing pain and the pounding bass from the music - and tried not to move .
I had learned that I was only allowed to cover my legs with the blanket and had to keep my hands in plain view on my stomach .
I heard the IRF team many times that night .
I prayed to Allah that they would n't return to my cage .
The next morning , my whole body hurt .
I sat up and looked around .
It was still dark outside the fences , but breakfast had already arrived : a hardboiled egg without its shell , a slice of dry bread , and a few peas .
I heard a couple of the prisoners calling to the guards .
It was always the same word :
" Tee - pee ! "
A short time later , the guards came and brought the prisoners a small piece of toilet paper .
They shoved through the square hole in the cage .
" TP ! " I called .
" TP ? "
I did n't get any toilet paper .
I had learned that toilet paper was a matter left entirely up to the guard .
If he felt like giving you some , you got some .
If not , you had to improvise .
A short time later , the escort team arrived .
They bound me , and we walked through the corridors in the chain - link fencing .
They pressed my head down so that I could n't look around .
At every door , the guard who did the unlocking read my armband and searched me for weapons .
We left Block Charlie , went through the corridor between Charlie and Bravo , walked along Bravo and arrived in the corridor between Bravo and Alpha .
All I could see was the gravel and the cages with other prisoners .
Suddenly someone called out in Turkish .
" Murat , Murat !
It 's me ! "
It was Nuri 's voice .
Nuri was a Turk I 'd met in Kandahar .
He sat next to me in front of the hangar while we were waiting to be loaded on to the plane .
He had looked terrible .
His eyes were swollen , his lips were split , his wrists and ankles bled from the cuffs , and some of his teeth had been knocked out .
I had asked him what his name was and where he came from .
He said he came from Izmir .
That was the city where my father was born .
Nuri was an electrician .
He was married and had two children .
We had heard the constant screaming of prisoners being tortured in the hangar .
Nuri had said : " Now we 're going back to where we came from . "
Allah , he said , had created us from earth , and the earth was where we would return .
" Do you think , " Nuri had asked , " that they 'll just let us go after all they 've done to us ? "
" In any case , it will be better than here , " I had answered , " whether or not they kill us . "
Nuri had laughed .
" You 're right .
But I 'm still worried about my children . "
So Nuri was here .
I heard him , but I was n't able to turn my head enough to see him .
I could n't answer .
" Try to get transferred to Block Alpha . "
How was I supposed to do that ?
" Ask the guards , " he said .
" Ask them to move you here . "
I heard him call the guards .
They stopped and let my head go .
Nuri glared at one of them and gestured for him to come closer .
He pointed to an insect crawling on his arm .
He pointed to the guard , as though saying :
You are this insect .
Then he squashed the bug with his hand .
We came to an open space .
There was an electric car like a golf cart .
We drove in it past a row of long , low buildings , made of chipboard .
They were arranged in blocks of four , raised on stilts about three feet off the ground .
Soldiers and an African American woman in uniform waited in front of the building where we stopped .
The soldiers frisked me , then the woman asked : " Do you have any weapons ? "
That was ridiculous .
Where was I supposed to get any weapons ?
I said , " Yes , I have . "
" Where ? " the woman asked and immediately took a step back .
I bared my teeth .
The woman ran away , calling out that I had tried to bite her .
Other soldiers hurried up and threw me on the ground .
" You want to bite the guards ? "
One spoke loudly and quickly .
I could hardly understand a word .
" No , no , " I said .
" No problem .
I do n't bite women . "
They pressed me to the ground and screamed at me .
They were nervous .
I had n't been counting on that .
I heard them call an IRF team .
" He wants to bite , " the officer said .
The IRF team hit me a couple of times .
Then they picked me up and brought me into one of the wooden buildings .
There were two rooms , fifteen to twenty square feet , obviously for interrogations .
The building had looked much bigger from the outside .
There was a chair in the middle of the room .
I was told to sit .
There was a massive ring in the floor , and they attached the chains between my feet to it with a padlock .
The chains around my feet were attached to another chain that ran around my stomach and was attached to my handcuffs .
I could n't stand up , raise my hands , or even move .
In front of me was a table and another chair .
That was all .
There were two doors but no windows .
All around me there was compressed wood .
Even the table was made of compressed wood .
I looked around the bare space .
I did n't see a camera or a mirror .
My interrogator would enter through the second door .
Behind it there had to be another room , the camera room .
But where were the cameras ?
A guard stood at my side .
My interrogator came out of the second door .
He was in his mid-forties .
" This is a great opportunity , " he said in German .
" I 'm looking forward to speaking German with you .
I do n't want to forget it . "
He spoke with an accent , but his German was fluent .
I was surprised .
At least I would have the chance to explain myself in German and prove my innocence .
But before I could say a word , he told me that he went to university for a few years in Germany .
I think he said in Frankfurt .
I waited for him to finish .
He lit a cigarette .

Great news for those who enjoyed GameDesign 's Dice Wars game and thought that it would be even better if it were multiplayer .
After building a successful and compelling online multiplayer Texas Hold 'em game , gpokr , Ryan Dewsbury of Toronto has been hard at work to bring multiplayer action to this beloved dice - based strategy game ( which , coincidentally , he discovered on this site ) .
And I am very pleased to announce that kdice has just launched !!
There are no written instructions , but the game is so simple you can hop right in and play .
Each of the seven players has a color and corresponding territory .
Stacked on each territory are a number of dice .
When your turn comes up , attack another player by clicking one of your territories followed by an adjacent piece of land .
The game rolls the dice and the higher number wins .
The goal is to take over and continue to occupy as much of the map as you can .
At the end of your turn you get a set number of dice added to your stacks ( at random ) based on the largest number of contiguous territories that you control .
The more areas you control , the bigger your dice army , but remember not to spread yourself too thin .
There 's no shortage of strategy in kdice , but there 's still plenty of room for blind luck .
Even if your stack of dice is larger than another you can still lose the roll .
Balance your offense and defense well and try to control territories in the safe corners of the map .
Just do n't play it too safe or you 'll find the enemy closing in from all sides with massive towers of dice ready to attack .
Analysis : kdice is essentially everything you would want in an online multiplayer casual game : ease of use , simple gameplay , and strategy tempered by blind luck .
The small chat box at the bottom of the screen is usually filled with people shouting strategies or trying to form alliances .
It 's very easy to lose an hour or more with just one sitting .
You just can't stop playing .
The only possible downside to kdice is that a table must have seven players sitting in before a game can begin .
You might have to wait a few minutes before playing , but as more and more people get hooked that wait will definitely decrease .
Until then , take a deep breath and enter the fray .
Play kdice ( multiplayer Dice Wars )
If you 're a Web technology geek you may be interested to know that like Ryan 's other multiplayer Web game , gpokr , this is an Ajax application that is built using the Google Web Toolkit and integrated with Flash .
What 's different about kdice is that it uses Jetty ( instead of Tomcat ) to take advantage of Jetty Continuations .
Jetty 's lead developer , Greg Wilkins , helped to scale kdice to more simultaneous players .
And from what I 've seen so far it 's handling the load of players very well .
Cheers to slgalt for the heads - up about Ryan 's latest multiplayer game .
The REAL Reason Bush and Cheney Will Not Be Impeached pstern [ at ] austin.rr.com )
Thursday Jan 3rd , 2008 6:06 PM by Dr. Peter Stern
Okay , folks , you can stop scratching your heads and wringing your hands in bewilderment .
Here 's the REAL reason there will be no impeachment proceedings against any of the administration :
Apparently , it 's more than the GOP who do not what their administration impeached .
It 's also the liberal " commie - pinkos " who do not want to pursue impeachment .
Those such as : House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , presidential candidates Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and others .
So , why is n't our government pursuing the impeachment process ?
Okay , enough of the ongoing dismay and consternation by most of the American people .
Exactly why is n't there more of a " push " for action against the current administration ?
I have been considering many logical reasons , but I continue to come back to the most reality - based issue .
The reason most of our Congress does NOT want to pursue any action against the president and administration is because it would create a deadly political and economic tsunami that would encircle many more individuals and organizations than merely Bush and Cheney .
" Fingering " the administration would also mean the public identification , humiliation and legal actions against many wealthy individuals , corporations and even governments throughout the world .
Look , let 's face it .
Our elected officials are NOT going to do anything that will impede the ongoing wealthy campaign contributions and perks they receive and going after Bush and his administration most assuredly would open more " war wounds " that are NOT in the best interests of our legislators .
Wealthy big business now manages and operates this nation .
Powerful corporations have bought the best government money can buy and they are n't going to lose their grip on the U.S. just because Bush and the administration have come " under the gun " for their criminal behavior .
Big business could care less about making the president accountable for his actions because business is the power that determined the administration 's objectives and actions .
Bush is only the " pawn " of wealthy special interests .
He is a means to the end .
Bush is expendable because he has done his job and his term is nearly completed .
Consequently , we can forget about our Democratic Representative Government , Constitution , any sort of justice , accountability and impeachment actions --- even if those actions are genuinely warranted --- which they are .

“ I wanted to come forward because I did n’t want it hanging over my head , ” Mr. Paterson said .
“ I did n’t want to be compromised , perhaps , by innuendo or some sort of message that you better not do something or we ’re going to out you about the infidelity in your marriage . ”
Mr. Paterson flatly denied that he had ever used any campaign money in connection with the affairs .
“ I would never use campaign funds for that purpose , ” he said .
Mr. Paterson did most of the talking during the news conference .
But twice Mrs. Paterson spoke in a hushed , soft voice .
“ There ’s no marriage that ’s perfect , ” she said at one point .
In response to a question , Mr. Paterson said he had had an affair with a state employee who was not under his supervision at the time .
He acknowledged that the employee still works for the state and “ we will try to accommodate that employee ’s wishes . ”
By midmorning , word of Mr. Paterson ’s admissions had filtered through the Capitol .
And once again , the state ’s top political leaders found themselves fielding questions about how the state could weather the personal crisis of a governor .
Senator Joseph L. Bruno , the majority leader , said the Patersons ’ marital problems were nobody ’s business but their own as he brushed off suggestions that the affair threatened to interfere with the state ’s business .
“ His personal life is his personal life and he has to share what he ’s comfortable sharing , ” Mr. Bruno told reporters this morning .
“ And as long as it does n’t interfere with how he ’s governing , its nobody ’s business .
David is able to handle himself .
He ’s always been a good friend and handled himself properly , and I expect he will continue to handle himself properly . ”
With my indifference toward publishing in dead trees , my academic career is in serious jeopardy .
So I tend to blindly obey suggestions from friends who are making it big time in the academic world .
One of these superstars suggested submitting my " Shame and War " paper to WebNet ' 96 .
I showed her the final draft .
" It looks pretty good , but you should reference this guy in Austria , " she said .
I could n't find anything relevant on his site so I did n't add any references .
The paper was rejected .
I checked the Austrian guy 's site more carefully .
He was the conference committee chairman .
A few days after dissing my paper , the conference folks asked me to teach a tutorial on building relational database - backed Web sites .
I said that I had enough people at MIT laughing at me without going to conferences where my paper had been rejected .
" We 've reconsidered your entry and have decided to accept it . "
Thus did I fly out to San Francisco to give one 15 - minute paper and one 3.5 - hour monologue .
" Relational databases and the World Wide Web : Automatic generation of hypertext based on reverse - engineered meta information . "
That sounded like it would be the best talk in the conference .
I settled into my plastic chair in the plastic Holiday Inn conference room with high hopes .
A young Austrian began to page through some Viewgraphs .
" Ve are dumping ze database catalog tables out of ze Oracle system into Microsoft Access .
Un dan , ve are using an AWK script to generate ze static files .
Ze big challenge is making ze 6 character file names for some operating systems as can't have ze long file names . "
A man raised his hand .
I figured he was going to say " Why did n't you install Oracle WebServer and then get a 10 - year - old to write three PL / SQL functions to extract the data from the RDBMS on the fly ? " but instead he asked " Why did you use AWK instead of perl ? "
The Austrian responded " AWK is the only language that I know . "
The questioning titans of academic computer science in the audience were not to be pushed aside easily .
Another man stood up .
" But AWK only allows 30 - character fields . "
" Ve are using ze GNU AWK . "
Come discuss how GNU software is making leading edge CS research possible around the world at this week 's

What is art ?
While its essence and boundaries are hard to encompass , Webster 's defines it as " Stuff made with paint and clay and shit .
Sometimes it 's dancing around too or doing something kinda queer . "
This vagueness has allowed for all manners of oddities to be stamped as art and sold at exorbitant prices .
Beauty , after all , is in the eye of the gullible schmuck with too much cash .
However , this flexibility has allowed far too many " artists " to abandon enriching the zeitgeist in favor of being a smartass at art 's expense .

6 Marcel DuChamp's " Fountain " Continue Reading Below Advertisement What the Hell is That ?
You are in the presence of greatness .
In 2004 , 500 British art world professionals , all clad in berets , selected Fountain as the most influential artwork of the 20th century .
It was emblematic of the entire Dada movement and has since inspired independent thinkers everywhere to buy matching uniforms at Hot Topic and brag online about how O.G. their atheism is .
The masterwork that sparked all of this is a urinal rotated 90 degrees from its functional position and signed with the pseudonym " R. Mutt . "
Why We 're Calling ' Shenanigans '
We get that the Dada folks loved the anti-rational , but everybody knows the fundamental underpinning of any work of art is a firm understanding of plumbing .
Even with adequate water flow restored to this appliance , it would merely pool , leech up residual mystery crusts , and drain into the back .
It would in no way function as a fountain .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Okay , so maybe that 's the point , that they 're calling it " Fountain " and it 's not one .
Of course that overlooks the fact that most everything in the known universe that does n't have a urinal cake in it is also not a fountain .
A brick or a wad of tissue would have actually been more poignant entitled " Fountain " respectively .
Hell , you can stick that title on that video of a monkey peeing into its own mouth and you 'd have ramped up the irony to award - winning levels .
Regardless , Duchamp , awash in the heady daze of knowing he could sell anything with his dazzling French accent , tipped over the nearest slab of porcelain and called it Le Art .
More specifically , shenanigart .

10 Tips for After You Install or Upgrade Ubuntu April 25 , 2008
Ubuntu is becoming more and more complete and easy to configure .
However , like any operating system there ’s work to be done after the installation .
Here ’s a list of 10 tips that you can use after installing or upgrading Ubuntu .
1. Install software faster
As a commenter on Slashdot said :
I felt a great disturbance in the force , as if thousands of apt - get repositories had cried out in pain , and were suddenly silenced .
The Ubuntu software repositories can get really slow , and even stop responding completely around the time of a major Ubuntu release .
Without a repository mirror , you ca n’t install software .
The Synaptic package manager can help you find a faster mirror .
2. Install restricted extras ( and enable the multiverse repository )
Install support for playback of many types of audio and video , web fonts , Java , Flash , and DVD playback all in one go .
Ubuntu restricted extras allow you to easy install everything that Ubuntu can’t include by default for legal reasons .
Open Applications -> Add / Remove .
In the Show drop down box , select All available applications .
This will enable the multiverse software repository , and give you access to the restricted extras and non-free software .
Start typing restricted extras into the search box and check the box beside Ubuntu restricted extras when it appears in the results .
Click Appy Changes to begin installing .
3 . Silence the internal speaker beep
Some Ubuntu applications make heavy use of that annoying speaker inside your PC ’s case , such as Firefox when you are searching in a page .
It ’s not difficult permanently or temporarily disable .
4. Clear partition icons off the desktop
I like to keep my desktop clean and free of icons .
Ubuntu does n’t , and will drop icons for other disk partitions on the desktop that you likely rarely or never need .
You can change a setting using gconf - editor to fix this .
5. Remove old configuration files
If you ’ve upgraded your Ubuntu installation , or use a separate home partition , all of your settings will be carried over to the new Ubuntu installation .
Your desktop could look exactly the same as before !
This can cause problems when newer software is loading older configuration files .
To start fresh , you can remove the old configuration .
Open your home folder in the file browser , and select View -> Show Hidden Files .
Files and folders beginning with a dot are for configuration .
Back these up first , and them remove them from your home folder .
The next time you log in , you will see a pristine default Ubuntu desktop .
6. Remove old kernels
This is a tip for those of you who have upgraded from a previous version of Ubuntu or installed during development .
Is your boot menu full of options for booting Ubuntu with older kernels ?
Mine was too .
You can safely remove the ones you do n’t need .
7. Give Ubuntu a cool new look
The default Ubuntu theme has n’t changed , except for the wallpaper , in years .
Why not find a new theme ?
Give Blubuntu a try , it ’s an easily installable and complete blue alternative to the brown Human theme .
8. Run Windows applications with the latest WINE
New WINE releases arrive every two weeks ; the version in Ubuntu 8.04 ’s repository is already out - of - date .
To be able to run Windows applications as well as possible , you should stay with the latest WINE releases .
Open System -> Administration ->Software Sources , and select the Third Party Software tab .
Click Add and paste in the official WINE Ubuntu repository :
deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt hardy main

Two dogs that are NOT amused
Posted by Pete Berg on Tuesday , March 25th , 2008 at 8:54 pm
At this point , these two dogs have pretty much given up on life .
Enough is enough .
It ’s just not worth it anymore .
Note :
The “ mommy ” that the owner refers to in this video is his actual mommy , and he still lives in her basement .
Maybe you thought this was just going to be a two part rant , but this time around I have some real , practical advice on combating software piracy .
But first :
I am always grateful when publishers remain steadfast in their support for the untamed , savage jungle that is the PC .
Twenty years of Darwinian attrition has made it clear that this is not the platform for the meek .
If you ’re not sucked dry by warez leeches , you ’ll most likely be devoured by something far larger and higher up on the foodchain .
If you manage to avoid being consumed , there is always the chance that your efforts will be found wanting , and natural selection will cull your team in favor of something that is smarter , lives longer , or is better at replicating itself .
It is also true that at any moment you may simply exit the jungle and take up residence in the greener pastures named Nintendo , Sony , and ( strangely enough ) Microsoft .
Places where there is enough for everyone and you earn a living by farming money .
So if you stick with the PC , you have my thanks .
But if you ’re set on staying in the PC realm then you need to be at peace with the idea that anyone who wants to play your game without paying you is going to be able to do so .
In PC gaming , there has never been an unbreakable DRM scheme .
Not once , ever .
Most DRM systems have a lifespan measured in days .
A small handful might live a fortnight .
No matter how convoluted the system you devise , it just takes one guy to wedge it open and let everyone else through .
Michael Fitch can rant against the people who rip off his company , and he ’s justified in doing so .
While people argue about the degree to which damage has been done , the fact that damage has been incurred is manifest .
But as I said last time , piracy is a social problem , not a technological one .
The solution is therefore going to be social in nature , not a new DRM scheme .
You ca n’t convert all of the pirates into customers , but – as Fitch noted – you do n’t need to :
So , if 90 % of your audience is stealing your game , even if you got a little bit more , say 10 % of that audience to change their ways and pony up , what ’s the difference in income ?
Just about double .
That ’s right , double .
That ’s easily the difference between commercial failure and success .
That ’s definitely the difference between doing okay and founding a lasting franchise .
Even if you cut that down to 1 % – 1 out of every hundred people who are pirating the game – who would actually buy the game , that ’s still a 10 % increase in revenue .
Again , that ’s big enough to make the difference between breaking even and making a profit .
So the goal here should not be eliminating piracy , which is absurd and impossible .
Instead , work on converting as many of those pirates into customers .
Here are five ways to get people to pay for your stuff .
Again , these are social changes – this has nothing to do with building a better DRM system .
As a bonus , a lot of these things are free .
( Note that I ’m going to offer advice for Developers and Publishers interchangeably .
I know they are n’t .
I trust everyone is smart enough to see how this advice applies to their part of the process without becoming confused .
At any rate , publishers wield most of the power in the Dev / Pub relationship , so the process needs to begin with them . )
This one is obvious , which makes it even more infuriating that most publishers are incapable of grasping it .
Your wonderful DRM scheme for which you paid so much money is going to be outlived by the average Drosophilidae .
Your ( legit ) users are going to be faced with online activation , CD checks , and typing in serial numbers the size of nuclear launch codes .
A pirate is going to click “ install ” and get on with the gaming , already .
I realize what a profound bore it is to hammer away at this appallingly obvious fact , but it ’s less of a bore than that thrice - cursed dialog that gets in my face telling me to type in a huge string of mixed letters and numbers like some kind of king - hell CAPTCHA before I ’m allowed to play .
Knock it off already .
My antipathy towards 2 k Games should be appallingly apparent to anyone who has read this site for more than a few days .
They are crooks and liars , which deprives them of any high ground they might have against the pirates .
The two deserve each other .
When people leave comments about how they pirated BioShock , I react in the same way I might towards a guy who mugs spammers .
I ’m certainly not going to have any empathy for the supposed victim .
But if someone told me they were going to pirate Frayed Knights , I ’d be damned angry .
Jay Barnson is a great guy and I ’ve followed his site since before he even began work on the game .
I ’m emotionally invested in his efforts , and I ’d like to see him succeed .
( He ’s also never treated me like a thief . )
Sure , it would be nice if everyone freely embraced a strict moral code ; a planet of courteous and genteel paladins operating on the honor system with unwavering certainty .
You can sit in your cubicle and imagine that bright shining fantasy world , or you can operate on this plane of existence and realize that the only way people are going to care about piracy is if they care about you .
You need your audience to stop viewing you as a company and start seeing you as enthusiastic gamers with a passion for what you do .
Have a development blog .
( Or just a personal one . )
Give personal interviews , not just to the big publishers but to the podcasters and bloggers .
Put your face where gamers can see it , so they will know who they ’re stealing from if they choose to go that route .
Get in the forums and interact with your customers .
( Forums should always be a conduit between your developers and them , not a layer of insulation . )
Whenever you need someone to interact with the public , use developers instead of marketing guys so that fans can feel a personal connection with the people who made the game .
You want them to walk away from the exchange excited .
A fan is likely to brag to her friends , “ I met the guy who designed Alyx in Half - Life 2 ! ”
If they meet with the Senior Vice - Executive Marketing Consultant Advisor from division 4 ?
Not so much .
Companies are always so worried that their people will say something that makes them look like a jackass , and thus they prefer to tell everyone to keep quiet .
But this just means that your enterprise is seen not as a collection of individuals , but as a whole .
A huge , emotionless corporate monolith , a gestalt entity that communicates in doublespeak and frequently acts – ironically enough – like a jackass .
Every team has a couple of people who love to talk about what they do and get reactions to their work .
You just need to give them license to speak without clearing everything through marketing and legal first .
The individual mistakes they make in these interactions will be more than offset by the giant mistakes you ’re not making on the corporate level .
( Ignore this advice if you employ John Romero . )
People might steal from strangers without regrets , but only a sociopath would steal from a friend .
Be their friend , and they will line up buy your game .
Some will even flame and shun the pirates on your behalf .
These people want to love you .
Stop treating them like lepers .
Given the capricious nature of PC software , lots of gamers want to make sure a game is going to run on their particular setup before sinking $ 60 of non-recoverable money into it .
I see lots of people who pirate a game “ just to try it out ” .
We all know how that ’s going to go .
They get into the game , hours become days , and pretty soon they ’ve had a blast , beaten the game , but never got around to buying it .
Do n’t turn curious customers into pirates by denying them a way to try the game before putting their money at risk .
Do n’t give them an excuse to download a BitTorrent client and figure out how it all works .
Make sure that the only people who turn to that stuff are people who are intent on stealing .
Remember that P2P file sharing feeds on itself .
The more people doing it , the easier it is to find files and the faster they download .
The more people you can turn legit , the fewer seeds there will be , the harder files will be to find , and the slower they will download .
Get the inertia going in the right direction .
Game crackers seem to be quite competitive and release - driven .
They brag about having the best games first .
They pride themselves on “ delivering ” hot titles everyone is anxious to play .
They ’re also not real big on hanging around and “ supporting ” their crack for a months - old game when there are newer , hotter titles demanding their particular brand of mischievous attention .
Improve the game over time .
If you make it so that registered users can just get the goods via an easy 1 - click update , and pirates have to wade around for the right BitTorrent for the right language / release version , you ’ve gone a long way towards rewarding customers and punishing pirates , instead of the other way around .
Where are all of these pre-release versions coming from ?
When a game shows up on BitTorrent days or weeks before hitting the shelves , you ca n’t blame the internet .
These people are pirates , not ninjas .
They ’re not sneaking in and swiping your gold master from amidst the laser tripwires , robotic sentry guns , and teams of heavily - armed roaming guards you no doubt have protecting the thing .
Someone who works for you or with whom you have a business relationship is out there putting your goods on the internet .
How is it you ’re willing to make your customers bend over backwards to use your product via invasive DRM , but you ca n’t seem to take a few basic steps to find the person or organization who is stabbing you in the back ?
There are a lot of ways of dealing with this sort of thing , and I hardly need to belabor them here .
Just ( secretly ) marking various releases with a few identifying numbers will let you know where the executable came from once you see it in the wild , which will go a long way to plugging those leaks .
If the review copy you sent to GamePunkz Magazine shows up on the net , you at least have enough information to act .
Maybe not enough to drag them into court , but maybe next time they will have to wait until after release day to get their copy .
You should at least be able to make it so that the hackers have to buy one copy of your game before they can put it on the net .
Once again , this means paying customers get it first , and pirates get it second .
Changing the way you interact with customers is not easy , but it has to be better than pursuing the epic failure of SecuROM and its many cousins .
The very worst that could happen is that it wo n’t work , which would make these ideas every bit as effective as current anti-piracy measures – with the added benefit that they ’re probably a lot cheaper .
If the suggested numbers behind piracy are even half true , then a little progress should go a long way to boosting profits and making PC development a less dicey proposition .
Recently on the misc@ mailing list , a user asked about ways to popularize OpenBSD with PHB types in business .
Is there any way I could convince these people to make the move to OpenBSD ?
Suggestions , tips and tricks along with real life examples would be much appreciated .
I 've been trying ( rather unsuccessfully ) to convince various clients and employers to adopt OpenBSD .
Most people , I find , are resistent to change and would not use anything they are not familiar with ...
A friendly reply came from " Matt " , giving his own list of tips for convincing management to pursue OpenBSD solutions .
Read on for his entertaining and useful experiences .
Many others have given great pro-OpenBSD examples .
I can only give you the " tricks " I have succesfully used in the past .
These are based on selling solutions - not on convincing people how great OpenBSD is .
There is a big difference from my perspective , but our goals are the same .
Meetings work far better than writing to get your points across .
They allow you to change your direction on the fly if needed , while writing just gets / dev/nulled .
TRICK 1 : Expensive beats free
First of all - forget it is free .
Forget the whole licensing , forget anything open source software related .
That sounds weird and perhaps unethical towards those that fight for this but it helps getting what you want .
OpenBSD will eventually benefit - so we 're in the clear here .
Management does not trust anything free .
Free implicates ' no guarantees ' .
Whenever you say ' free ' management pictures a photograph of you and Richard Stallman , holding hands under a rainbow while a unicorn flies by .
If , and only if , the price question pops up you say " implementation will probably cost us around < some figure that will be acceptable and will give OpenBSD a nice donation > . "
If the guy is wearing a suit worth more than your monthly salary multiply the amount by 10 .
TRICK 2 : Fear beats complacency
Talk about the changing internet / network .
How it is increasingly becoming more and more hostile .
They will be aware of this .
through both the press and those Nigerian relatives that keep mailing them .
Tell them about the recent creditcard thefts , about the impact these things have on a company .
This can be on a moderate level or on a oh my god the plane is crashing and we are all going to die !
level .
Depends on your party and your ethics .
Mention the amount of attacks on a webserver can go down by 40 % just because the bad guys see it is running OpenBSD , or that common cracking techniques that work on other systems simply are impossible on OpenBSD because of it's design .
Show nice little graphs of security exploits on all the systems they know and place OpenBSDs track record next to it .
Do this only for basic issues and you 'll have pretty dramatic stats .
If you can ( without loosing your job or crossing your co-workers ) , present a list of unpatched / unsolved issues with the current servers .
Do n't talk tech .
Talk solutions .
We have a problem here and I am offering you the solution .
World leaders have gotten ( and are getting ) away with incredible stuff , solely by addressing people 's fear .
It is by far the most powerful emotion .
And before you judge me on this - you do have insurance , do n't you ?
Exactly .
TRICK 3 : Trustworthy beats unknown
Tell them who else is using it ; which big companies ( they know ) already have put their trust in it .
Knowing some company they respect is using OpenBSD proves to them it's a reliable choice .
These companies have understood the need for solutions for the problems presented earlier in trick 2 .
Choose companies that deal with important stuff .
Hospitals and banks are great examples .
Yes , it might just be a single router among the ninety Windows boxes but who cares ?
If they mention seeing Windows in their hospital tell them this is why you and your family never go to that hospital .
TRICK 4 : Being cool beats missing the boat
Present OpenBSD as " up and coming " , give them the idea they are jumping in right on time .
That it is a fresh , new and hip approach to operating systems .
OpenBSD is lean , mean - it 's sexy .
" Actually , you are a pretty lame bunch considering you 're not running it yet . "
That approach , no matter how stupid , might work better in some cases than actual arguments .
Especially if most of the people in the room are carrying an iPhone .
TRICK 5 : Action beats promise
Emphasize on the low costs of running OpenBSD .
The low maintenance , the fact it performs great without cutting - edge hardware .
Do not say it runs great on " old " hardware .
Old is bad , old will break .
Low system requirements , now that sounds like we can save some cash .
Convince them of the low learning curve in maintaining , upgrading and installing systems .
Anybody can do it .
Propose to teach Janet , the hot secretary from upstairs , to upgrade a system within a day - just to prove your point .
This is a proposition I have yet to see be declined .
The idea of Janet being stuck with you in the server room for a full day is usually hilarious enough to give it a try .
TRICK 6 : Having toys beats " not interesting "
Give them toys .
Management loves toys .
So give them plenty .
And give them toys to talk and brag about .
Show them how many spammers / attackers THEY have blocked by presenting them some nice graphic GUI tool .
Preferably on a webpage behind a login- something where they can mess about a bit , click some stuff to see dumbed down data .
Not Cacti or the like , that is way too intimidating and complicated .
We want to show understandable stuff along with pretty colored charts .
If it moves it 's even better .
Fake it with animated gifs , I do n't care .
But make it shine .
Hey Jim , how are things ?
Yeah ?
Good .
Listen , we just dropped 500 packets on our firewall - how many did you drop today ?
Aha .. you sucker !
You should run what we run , open - whatever ... open- eehhmm ..
Hey Janet , what was that thing you can upgrade called again ?
What kind of stimulus package is needed that would help working families ?
One that creates good jobs and ensures workers and their neighbors can pay their house or car note , buy groceries , fill up their gas tanks or make college tuition payments ?
On Capital Hill , with unemployment jumping to 5 percent in December , and other indicators of major economic illness , lawmakers are starting to consider stimulus ideas .
President Bush and fellow Republicans want to pump $ 150 billion into tax cuts and government spending geared to big business interests and the wealthy .
But labor and other progressive groups say the key is putting money into the hands of working people .
It 's working people who are the nation 's consumers .
They can spur the economy if they have the income to buy what they need .

The Ariane climbed rapidly through the rain clouds
Ariane 5 launch
The Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) is the biggest and most complex spacecraft Europe has ever tried to put in orbit .
The 20 - tonne unmanned freighter left the Kourou spaceport at 0403 GMT , riding atop an Ariane 5 rocket .
The spectacular night launch in the South American jungle was declared a success once the ATV had separated from its booster 66 minutes after lift - off .
The news was cheered by a huge crowd of VIPs , space agency officials and representatives of the industrial teams that have worked on the development of the ship for past 11 years .
Ground staff and astronauts will monitor the final approach
More details
" With the launch of the ATV , we are embarking on an extraordinary voyage , " reflected European Space Agency chief , Jean Jacques Dordain .
" As of today , Europe is an essential partner of the International Space Station ( ISS ) . "
The ATV is the largest , completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS .
When it attaches to the platform on 3 April , it will do so without any human assistance .
The vessel will provide the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the ISS ; and it is the only vehicle on the current timeline that will be able to de-orbit the $ 100 bn platform when it is retired sometime towards the end of the next decade .
Red button
The launch was a significant event for Ariane , too .
The European rocket had never before lifted so big a " passenger " .
Its normal payload is a pair of commercial telecommunications satellites that weigh together less than 10 tonnes .
' JULES VERNE ' STATISTICS Mission Guide : Jules Verne Total cargo : 4,860kg 1,340kg - ' dry ' supplies 20kg - air ( oxygen / nitrogen ) 280kg - drinking water 860kg - propellant for ISS 2,360kg - reboost propellant
The ship itself has 3,490kg of propellant for rendezvous , re-boost and de-orbit manoeuvres
In graphics : Space Station
The rocket had to be specially strengthened to carry the ATV aloft .
Its upper - stage was also programmed to perform extra burns - the first to put the freighter in the correct 260 km - high orbit , the second to take itself out of the sky and into the Pacific Ocean .
The ATV has been dubbed " Jules Verne " for its maiden flight and is even carrying a first - edition hardback of the 19th - Century French author 's book From the Earth to the Moon .
It will return on a space shuttle at a later date .
The ATV will now essentially be parked in space .
It must wait until the US space shuttle Endeavour has completed its forthcoming mission to the ISS before moving in to make a docking .
The ship 's own computers will be in charge of the approach , employing an advanced form of GPS and , in the latter stages , optical sensors to guide itself into the correct position on the end of the Russian Zvezda module .
Astronauts on the station will only intervene - by pressing a red button on a panel - if they sense danger .
Future applications
" Now we have a number of operations to do , " said Robert Laine , the technical and research director at EADS Astrium , which is the prime contractor on the ATV .
" First , we have to deploy the solar panels , antennas , and check out everything .
Then there will be a major operation in the next few days when we will test out what is known as the ' escape procedure ' , " he told BBC News .
" It will be as if the red button has been pressed , which tells the ATV everything is lost and it must get out of the way .
This is a major milestone insisted on by the US space agency to prove the emergency systems work . "
The ATV is the way Europe will pay for its membership of the ISS project .
Four vehicles will follow this initial flight .
But the European Space Agency hopes its new ship will be more than just a high - flying heavy goods lorry .
The sophisticated automated systems onboard are expected to be transferred into many more spacecraft - especially those that require automatic rendezvous and docking .
This would include any mission that went to Mars to try to retrieve rocks to bring back to Earth laboratories .
The hardware that is used to lift the samples off the surface of the Red Planet would need to meet up in orbit with the propulsion unit which would carry it home .
The technology for this in - orbit assembly might be derived from ATV know - how .
And there may even be a grander application - one not lost on the Nasa chief Mike Griffin .
" It occurs to me that it 's a fairly short step to go from the ATV to something which can carry crew , " he has observed .
" It needs an entry system to allow it to come back safely and crew accommodations instead of cargo payload .
But it seems to me that having a very fine launcher with the Ariane 5 and a very fine space vehicle with the ATV that it 's only a step from there to an independent , European manned - spaceflight capability ; and I for one would like to see it . "
Cost : Total bill was 1.3bn euros ( at least 4 more ATVs will be built )
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission is flying lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters
Fly with the ATV on a mission to the space station

In looking back at that history , you wish that a candidate had responded not only with , “ No , I do n’t have any black ancestor , ” but also with , “ So what if I did ? ”
Likewise , with countless people today spreading scurrilous rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim , the most appropriate response is a denial followed by :
And so what if he were ?
Granted , that ’s not politically realistic as a comeback .
A 2007 Gallup poll found that 94 percent of Americans said they would vote for a black candidate for president and 88 percent for a woman .
In contrast , a Los Angeles Times poll in 2006 found that only 34 percent of respondents said they could vote for a Muslim for president .
Even if a prejudice is directed to a matter of choice , like religion or long hair , it ’s still prejudice .
It ’s possible to believe that Catholics have every right to be president while opposing a particular Catholic candidate who would ban contraception ; likewise , it ’s possible to believe that Muslims have every right to hold office without necessarily embracing the candidacy of particular Muslims who advocate enveloping all women in burkas .
To his credit , Mr. Obama has spoken respectfully of Islam ( he told me last year , on the record , that the Muslim call to prayer is “ one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset ” ) .
If he were to go further  “ and so what if I were Muslim ? ”  many Americans would see that as confirmation that he is a Sunni terrorist agent of Al Qaeda who is part of a 9/11 backup plan :
If you ca n’t reach the White House with a hijacked plane , then storm the Oval Office through the ballot box .
This is a case where Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain should take the initiative and denounce the fear - mongering about Mr. Obama as hate speech .
The wink - wink references to “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and lies about his going to a madrassa are the religious equivalent of racial slurs , and Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton should denounce them in the strongest terms .
This is their chance to show leadership .
When Mrs. Clinton was asked in a television interview a week ago whether Mr. Obama is a Muslim , she denied it firmly  but then added , most unfortunately , “ as far as I know . ”
To his credit , Mr. McCain scolded a radio host who repeatedly referred to “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and later called him a Manchurian candidate .
Martin Luther was n’t a model of tolerance but even he took the position that , “ I ’d rather be ruled by a wise Turk than a foolish Christian . ”
In this presidential campaign , we should at least aspire to be as open - minded as 16th - century Germans .

It is a remarkable outcome
The discovery is a vital piece of data for reconstructing the evolution of our cosmic neighbourhood .
Nasa 's Genesis spacecraft spent more than two years collecting oxygen from the outermost layers of the Sun .
These layers reflect the composition of the gas and dust cloud , known as the solar nebula , from which the Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago .
The results were presented here at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
Researchers had feared their data would be lost when Genesis ' sample - return capsule crashed in the Utah desert in 2004 .
But scientists have been working hard to recover the precious information held in the capsule 's collector arrays .
Key task
The researchers found that the Sun was enriched in the most common form , or isotope , of oxygen - oxygen - 16 - relative to the Earth and to meteorites .
" We have a very clear signal , " said Genesis team member Kevin McKeegan , from the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) .
One would not normally characterise the Genesis mission as being lucky , but in this case we were
Kevin McKeegan , UCLA
" It 's still early days and these data are not very old ; but the experiment has worked . "
The Earth , Moon and meteorites have widely differing proportions of the three oxygen isotopes : oxygen - 16 , oxygen - 17 , and oxygen - 18 .
But the cause of these variations in different parts of the Solar System is unknown .
Measuring this primordial oxygen composition establishes an important baseline for understanding how the planets later evolved their different compositions of oxygen .
" This was the highest priority science objective for Genesis , " said Professor McKeegan .
The $ 264 m ( £ 151 m ) mission spent more than two years gathering ions , or charged atoms , flung out from the Sun .
This material is known as the solar wind .
Deep storage
It captured these charged atoms from the solar wind on five collecting plates hung outside the spacecraft for more than 800 days in a region of space about 1.5 million km from Earth .
The collector arrays were then stowed in a sample - return capsule , and the spacecraft re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on 8 September 2004 .
Scientists have worked hard to recover the Genesis samples
Once it had deployed its parachute , the capsule was meant to be caught by a 5 m - long hook , wielded by a man in a helicopter .
But when its parachute failed , the capsule thudded into the Utah desert , leaving it a mangled mess .
But an instrument known as the concentrator had helped protect the sample .
The concentrator was an electrostatic mirror designed to focus solar wind particles on to a special target .
Its job was to enhance the density of heavy ions , particularly oxygen , that were to be collected .
Clean up
The device gave the atoms an extra energy kick , helping implant them more deeply in the target - away from the contamination which poured in after the crash .
The way the device was engineered also helped protect the samples from the impact .
Genesis collected solar wind particles for more than two years
" One would not normally characterise the Genesis mission as being lucky , but in this case we were , " Professor McKeegan explained .
The researchers " cleaned " the top 20 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) of the sample with a beam of caesium ions to remove terrestrial contamination .
They then measured the composition of the Sun 's oxygen in a vacuum .
The measurement will be vital for understanding what caused the differences in oxygen composition between the different bodies in our Solar System .

Show me your left hand .
No , your other left hand .
A lot of us have had those moments when we can't quickly tell left from right , but a new study suggests our brain is hard - wired to tell the difference , down to the level of the cells .
The left and right sides of the brain differ in many animal species .
This is thought to influence cognitive performance and social behavior .
For instance , in humans , the left half of the brain is concerned with language processing whereas the right side is better at comprehending musical melody .
Now , Stephen Wilson and his colleagues at the University College London have pinpointed for the first time how the left and right sides of our brains are wired at the level of individual cells .
The results are detailed in the journal Neural Development .
Wilson looked at left - and right - sided neurons ( nerve cells that manage information in the mind ) in a part of the brain called the habenula .
He isolated these neurons in zebrafish .
For this part of the brain , zebrafish are thought to be a good model for human brains .
By causing habenular neurons to produce a bright green fluorescent protein , Wilson 's team saw that the neurons form remarkable " spiral - shaped " axons , the long nerve fibers that act as the nervous system 's transmission lines .
" It 's clear that the left and right halves of the brain process different types of information , but almost nothing is known about the differences in the brain 's circuitry which achieve this , " Wilson said .
" One possibility is that totally different types of neuron might be found on the left and right .
Alternatively , both sides could contain the same building blocks but put them together in different ways . "
The researchers saw that there are two types of habenular neuron , and both types can be found on both left and right sides .
However , while most left - sided cells have spiral axons shaped into a domed crown , such neurons are not very common on the right .
Instead , most right - sided cells form flat , shallow spirals , and these are formed only occasionally on the left .
" In the same way that an engineer can make different electronic circuits from the same set of electronic components , so the left and right halves of the brain use the same types of neuron but in different combinations , " said Wilson 's colleague Isaac Bianco , a UCL student who did this work as part of his Ph.D. research .
The left and right habenular circuits both connect to the same part of the brain , and the researchers found that this target can either combine signals from the left and right or handle them independently .
" Even though language is processed largely on the left side of the human brain , people do n't speak with only one half of their mouth .
The brain must contain circuits which take information from the left or right and then send it on to targets on both sides of the body , " Wilson said .
Britain agreed to bankroll controversial drilling for oil and gas off Russia ’s Sakhalin island , despite a warning from its own officials of the “ potentially devastating effects ” on a critically endangered species of whale .
The decision to flout their own experts ’ advice is revealed in deeply embarrassing documents the British Government fought for three years to keep secret .
They reveal that drilling could cause the extinction of one of the world ’s most vulnerable populations of the marine mammals , the grey whale .
Nevertheless , the Government ’s powerful export credits and guarantees department ( ECGD ) , which provides support to the exports industry , agreed to help back the $ 20 bn ( £ 10 bn ) project by Sakhalin Energy Investment Company , in which Shell has a major share .
This flew in the face of warnings from both the British Foreign Office and the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .
One documents from Defra flagged “ substantial concerns about this project ” .
It said it had “ significant worries about the possible impacts ” on the endangered species , and that “ any losses are likely to be significant to its future ” , adding it was “ also concerned about the longer - term impacts on this population of disturbances caused by mining and explosions , or of oil spills ” .
You can see the civil servants making up their mind : “ What ’s the extinction of one species of whale , if we secure British jobs and investment ? ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street ’s so - called “ vulture ” debt investors are n’t exactly racing to buy billions of dollars of complex U.S. mortgage - related bonds that have sunk in value amid the troubles in global financial markets .
That ’s a bad omen for banks and other holders of dicey mortgage investments since it shows even the market ’s riskier players see no bottom to the downward spiral of mortgage defaults , bond rating downgrades , bank losses and stingier lending that is sapping the strength of the U.S. economy .
While mainstream investors might be expected to take flight whenever prices stop making sense and newspaper headlines scream of losses , distressed or “ vulture ” investors tend to eventually pick over assets more carefully , helping balance markets by providing a floor for thinly - traded bonds .
But despite plummeting prices and a regular drumbeat of fire sales by mortgage vehicles called collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , many vultures are n’t touching subprime mortgage securities with a ten - foot pole .
“ The CDO space is in a state of distress beyond repair , ” says Stuart Goldberg , a managing director at $ 10.7 billion hedge fund Marathon Asset Management in New York .
“ It ’s a melting ice cube , ” Goldberg says .
“ The CDO of ( asset - backed securities ) is a very different animal than the typical generic distressed marketplace .
There are literally deals and many assets within the ABS CDO space that have no value . ”
For years , Wall Street banks and money managers fueled a boom in mortgage lending by bundling risky mortgages into complex debt pools called CDOs that were sliced into different layers of risk and sold to global investors .
With borrowers now defaulting on their loans and falling into foreclosure , hundreds of billions of dollars of subprime mortgage bonds have been downgraded and more are likely to come .
A key problem for any players who are hoping to buy such assets is that they ca n’t predict the full extent of U.S. home price deterioration , mortgage defaults and foreclosures .
Without more certainty on that data , the outlook for credit - rating downgrades on mortgage bonds and losses is a mystery .
“ Money , by and large , still sits on the sidelines , ” David Peress , managing director at Crystal Capital , a private investment firm in Boston , told a conference of distressed debt players in New York last week .
“ One recurring theme you hear is , ‘ I do n’t want to be the guy that catches the falling knife ’ , ” he said .
Smaller hedge funds and asset managers , meanwhile , may be too strapped for cash themselves to chase opportunities .
And it ’s also simply hard to raise cash for a distressed fund , with many smaller managers of CDOs failing in attempts to start such funds , sources said .
“ There are a lot of people trying to do that , and I do n’t think they ’re being very successful , ” said Jeffrey Gundlach , chief investment officer for TCW Group in Los Angeles , one of the largest CDO managers .
LOOK WHO’S BUYING
Of course , there are some investment firms like Los Angeles - based Metropolitan West Asset Management that have been raising cash to buy distressed subprime mortgage bonds .
“ There ’s well over $ 10 billion of opportunity money that ’s already been raised and beginning to be put to work , ” said Bryan Whalen , portfolio manager at Metropolitan West , who adds that this figure is likely to increase .
Other players are buying entire portfolios of liquidated CDO assets from Wall Street banks .
And some investors like Insight Investment , part of the HBOS Group HBOS.L , may be starting to dip their toes in some types of CDOs .
For details , see < ID : nL05656399 >.
After all , the riskiest ABX indexes that track subprime mortgages have fallen almost as low as they can go , with the “ BBB - minus ” rated slice of the 2007 - 1 index down to 10.64 from the high 90’s in January of 2007 , according to Markit Intraday .
Whalen also said it makes sense for “ vulture ” buyers to deploy their cash only gradually , and quietly , and that in any case buyers are n’t likely to swoop in until traditional investors have given up all hope of their assets being bought .
But it ’s not all strategic : “ To date , the selling pressure has been far too great and overwhelming even for the opportunistic money , ” he said .
In the end , it may still be too early for these buyers to jump in with both feet .
“ People should n’t be too eager , ” said Mark Adelson , a consultant at Adelson & Jacob Consulting in New York .
“ If they ’ve allocated a certain amount of dollars to this , do n’t shoot it all before springtime . ”

Scientology ’s Google Ads
Scientology seems to be heavily advertising with Google these days .
I spotted the below ad on YouTube :
And just now at a blog , I saw the following animated Flash AdSense ad – which was not disclosed as an ad , which is partly to blame on Google ( Google would fare better either disclosing all ads as such or none , as the latter would easier allow webmaster to always attach their own disclosure ) :
These ads link to Scientology.org , like this target page .
Just like Google stays out of guarding over specific organic search result , they likely generally stay out of monitoring ads or enforcing their own beliefs , except for what they say they disallow via their AdWords policy ... which does not explicitly seem to mention any rule against the kind of ads shown by Scientology .
Such a stance may allow Google to act more neutral overall .
Sometimes , Google is also actively reaching out to advertisers .
The following bit posted by Lauren Turner on one of Google ’s ad promotion blogs last year was more revealing than Google might have wished for in retrospect ( and Google ended that particular blog not long thereafter ) :
[ C] ompanies come to us hoping we can help them better manage their reputations through “ Get the Facts ” or issue management campaigns .
Your brand or corporate site may already have these informational assets , but can users easily find them ?
We can place text ads , video ads , and rich media ads in paid search results or in relevant websites within our ever - expanding content network .
Whatever the problem , Google can act as a platform for educating the public and promoting your message .
Scientology on the other hand may well have found this advertising opportunity on their own , as they know Google well .
Some years ago , they managed to get certain Scientology - critical pages on the domain Xenu .
net kicked out of Google ’s results by filing a copyright infringement notice with Google ( do a search for site : xenu. net and scroll down to see Google ’s notice ) .
Many people at the time reportedly reacted by googlebombing Xenu up into a good spot – even today it ’s in the top 10 for a search for scientology .
Not all reputation issues can be managed with budgets alone .

Scientists have reconstructed changes in Earth ’s ancient ocean chemistry from about 2.5 to 0.5 billion years ago and say that a deficiency of oxygen and the heavy metal molybdenum in the ancient deep ocean may have delayed the evolution of animal life on Earth for nearly 2 billion years .
This research was motivated by a review article published in Science in 2002 by Ariel Anbar , one of the authors of the study and an associate professor at Arizona State University with joint appointments in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Andy Knoll , a colleague at Harvard University .
Knoll was perplexed by the fact that eukaryotes did n’t dominate the world until around 0.7 billion years ago , even though they seemed to have evolved before 2.7 billion years ago .
Together , Anbar and Knoll postulated that molybdenum deficiency was the key , arguing that the metal should have been scarce in ancient oceans because there was so little oxygen in the atmosphere in those times .
In today ’s high - oxygen world , molybdenum is the most abundant transition metal in the oceans .
That is because the primary source of molybdenum to the ocean is the reaction of oxygen with molybdenum - bearing minerals in rocks .
So the hypotheses rode on the idea that the amount of molybdenum in the oceans should track the amount of oxygen .
Molybdenum is of interest to Anbar and others because it is used by some bacteria to convert the element nitrogen from a gas in the atmosphere to a form useful for living things – a process known as “ nitrogen fixation . ”
Bacteria cannot fix nitrogen efficiently when they are deprived of molybdenum .
And if bacteria ca n’t fix nitrogen fast enough then eukaryotes – a kind of organism that includes plants , pachyderms and people – are in trouble because eukaryotes cannot fix nitrogen themselves at all .
“ If molybdenum was scarce , bacteria would have had the upper hand , ” continues Anbar .
“ Eukaryotes depend on bacteria having an easy enough time fixing nitrogen that there ’s enough to go around .
So if bacteria were struggling to get enough molybdenum , there probably would n’t have been enough fixed nitrogen for eukaryotes to flourish . ”
“ These molybdenum depletions may have retarded the development of complex life such as animals for almost two billion years of Earth history , ” says Lyons .
“ The amount of molybdenum in the ocean probably played a major role in the development of early life . ”
To test that idea , Scott , Lyons and Anbar examined rock samples from ancient seafloors by dissolving them in a cocktail of acids and analyzing the rock for molybdenum content using a mass spectrometer .
Many of these analyses were carried out using state - of - the art instrumentation in the W. M. Keck Foundation Laboratory for Environmental Biogeochemistry at Arizona State University .
The scientists found significant evidence for a molybdenum - depleted ocean relative to the high levels measured in modern , oxygen - rich seawater .
By studying Earth ’s ancient oceans , atmosphere and biology we can test how well we understand the modern environment , according to Anbar .
“ Our molybdenum hypothesis was inspired by the theory that biology in the oceans today is often starved for a different metal – iron – and that the lack of iron in parts of the oceans affects the transfer of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean ” he says .
“ The idea that metal deficiency in the oceans can affect the entire planet is very powerful .
Here , we are exploring the limits of that idea by seeing if it can solve ancient puzzles .
These new findings strengthen our confidence that it can . ”
The study was led by Clint Scott , a graduate student at University of California Riverside .
Scott works with Timothy Lyons , a professor of biogeochemistry at UCR who is a long - time collaborator of Anbar ’s and also an author of the paper .
“ Clint ’s data are an important new piece in a puzzle we ’ve been trying to solve for many years , ” says Anbar .
“ Tim and I have suspected for a while that if the oceans at that time were oxygen deficient they should also have been deficient in molybdenum .
We ’ve found evidence of that deficiency before , at a couple of particular points in time .
The new data are important because they confirm that those points were typical for their era . ”
The research was supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences and the NASA Astrobiology Program .

I f you think that some of the Bush administration 's conservative politics – and Orwellian moves – in the U.S. can't affect Canada , then you have some research to do .
Ten days ago at the University of California in San Francisco , librarian Gloria Won was running through POPLINE ( POPulation information onLINE ) , billed as " the world 's largest database on reproductive health . "
Maintained by Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University , and freely available to medical schools , health organizations and the public , it is funded by the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
Won was stymied .
Entering the keyword " abortion , " she kept getting the message " No records found . "
Odd , because she had done a similar search in January and found thousands of scholarly and peer - reviewed articles on the subject .
When she emailed POPLINE , database manager Debra Dickson replied : " We recently made all abortion terms stop words . "
Which means that , just like " the " and " and " and other words databases and browsers such as Google ignore , POPLINE would not recognize " abortion . "
Because ?
" As a federally funded project , we decided this was best for now , " explained Dickson , who suggested that Won search with " fertility control " or " postconception " instead .
George Orwell would have called this a " thoughtcrime . "
That 's because , on his very first full day as U.S. president in 2001 , George W. Bush resurrected the " global gag rule , " which makes nongovernmental organizations certify that they " will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning " if they want USAID funding .
First enacted under Ronald Regan and briefly rescinded by Bill Clinton , it 's estimated that this restriction has cost the lives of some 70,000 women who have sought out back - alley abortions .
By late last week , censorship was the talk of the librarian community .
And no wonder .
This is the kind of thing China does when you search " Tiananmen Square . "
That 's when University of Waterloo library associate Sara Perkins tipped me .
" I mean , research being censored at the university level ?
I really did n't think the U.S. could surprise me anymore , " Perkins emailed , echoing the views of David Dillard , a medical librarian at Temple University in Philadelphia .
It was on one of his librarian web - lists that the outrage spread , as researchers across North America speculated how much more information the administration will quash .
The record is stunning .
So far , the Bush administration has closed Environmental Protection Agency libraries .
It has also dismantled PubSCIENCE , another publicly available scholarly database , because it competed with private sector services .
And it severely weakened ERIC ( Educational Resources Information Center ) , a storehouse of studies on education .
" There 's been so much suppressed information , " Dillard told me .
Even Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health 's dean was aghast when he discovered what had happened .
" I could not disagree more strongly with this decision , and I have directed that the POPLINE administrators restore `abortion ' as a search term immediately , " said Dr. Michael Klag in a statement last Friday , adding that his school is " dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and not its restriction . "
Yesterday Klag announced POPLINE was not ordered by USAID to drop " abortion . "
Turns out that , in February , the government agency discovered two articles that did not fit its abortion " criteria . "
When POPLINE staff found five more offending articles , they killed the keyword until some 25,000 more containing " abortion " could be checked .
Such is Bush 's America where you have to watch what you say – and where women have to watch what they do .
And so , rather than risk losing its funding , an organization dedicated to health research and medical information would send " abortion " down the memory hole .
But there 's more than a word at stake here – it's an indicator of how , both in Canada and the U.S. , women 's reproductive choices , are also threatened with erasure .

ACLU Calls For Immediate Release Of Withheld Legal Memo
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 519-7829 or ( 646 ) 785-1894 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – A newly disclosed secret memo authored by the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) in March 2003 that asserts President Bush has unlimited power to order brutal interrogations of detainees also reveals a radical interpretation of the Constitution 's Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure .
The memo , declassified yesterday as the result of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit , cites a still - secret DOJ memo from 2001 that found that the " Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . "
The October 2001 memo was almost certainly meant to provide a legal basis for the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program , which President Bush launched the same month the memo was issued .
As a component of the Department of Defense , the NSA is a military agency .
" The recent disclosures underscore the Bush administration 's extraordinarily sweeping conception of executive power , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project .
" The administration 's lawyers believe the president should be permitted to violate statutory law , to violate international treaties , and even to violate the Fourth Amendment inside the U.S.
They believe that the president should be above the law . "
The Bush administration has never argued publicly that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to military operations within the nation 's borders .
The memo released yesterday publicizes this argument for the first time .
The ACLU has been aware of the Justice Department 's October 2001 memo since last year , but until now , its contents were unknown .
The Justice Department informed the ACLU of the memo's existence as a result of a FOIA lawsuit seeking information concerning the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The Justice Department acknowledged the existence of " a 37 - page memorandum , dated October 23 , 2001 , from a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in OLC , and a Special Counsel , OLC , to the Counsel to the President , prepared in response to a request from the White House for OLC 's views concerning the legality of potential responses to terrorist activity . "
Until now , however , almost nothing was known about the memo 's contents – except that it was related to a request for information about the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The ACLU has challenged the withholding of the October 2001 memo and the issue is pending before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
The memo released to the ACLU yesterday cites the October 2001 memo but takes its argument even further .
Relying on the earlier memo , the March 2003 memo argues that the president has authority as Commander - in - Chief to bypass not only the Fourth Amendment but the central due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment as well .
" This memo makes a mockery of the Constitution and the rule of law , " said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU .
" That it was issued by the Justice Department , whose job it is to uphold the law , makes it even more unconscionable . "
The March 2003 memo was declassified in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU , the New York Civil Liberties Union , and other organizations in June 2004 to enforce Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
The ACLU has been fighting for the release of the March 2003
Yoo memo since filing the lawsuit .
A few weeks ago , after the court ordered additional briefing on whether the Defense Department could continue to withhold the memo , the government reluctantly agreed to conduct a declassification review by March 31 .
The Defense Department released this memo after conducting the review .
The 2003 Department of Justice memo can be found online at :
www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/34745res20030314.html
Documents relating to the ACLU 's NSA FOIA lawsuit are available online at :
www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/30022res20060207.html
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit related the abuse of prisoner in U.S. custody abroad .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Silicon cells have been the mainstay of the solar photovoltaic industry , but advances in competing technologies could give those manufacturers a toehold in the rapidly growing renewable power market .
Last week , researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory said they had achieved a new efficiency record for one of those promising technologies , putting it within reach of the silicon cell mark .
The new technology uses copper indium gallium selenide , or CIGS , to turn sunlight into electricity inside a thin - film solar cell that is generally less expensive than versions relying on polysilicon .
CIGS technology converts 19.9 percent of the sunlight hitting the cell into power , beating the previous mark of 19.5 percent and nearing the multicrystaline silicon cell record of 20.3 percent .
Although the increase in efficiency looks modest , it would represent a 3 percent rise in production capacity for a company putting out one megawatt of electricity per year , said Ingrid Repins , a researcher on the NREL team .
One megawatt can power about 850 homes .
Silicon - based solar cells held 94 percent of the global market in 2006 , according NREL data , with the remaining 6 percent split among thin - film companies , including CIGS makers .
But that thin - film market share appears to be growing rapidly , helped by the opening of plants by companies such as First Solar , which uses different materials to construct its cells .
Just a few years ago , CIGS cells ’ efficiency stood near 15 percent , Repins said , and the technology is probably capable of reaching 23 percent in coming years .
Global Solar , a privately held company that licenses CIGS technology from the NREL , last month opened an Arizona plant that will be capable of producing 40 MW of thin - film solar cells per year , and it plans to open another in Germany later this year .
Other companies using CIGS technology include NanoSolar , which sparked market interest last year with its promise to make low - cost cells , as well as Ascent Solar Technologies , Miasole , International Solar Electric Technology Inc , SoloPower Inc and Solyndra .
Analysts do not expect many public offerings from the sector in the near - term because of market turmoil that has caused shares of even the largest solar companies to swing wildly .
Daystar , one of the only publicly listed CIGS makers , has seen its stock sink by about half this year to around $ 3.40 as it moves toward putting its production plant on line .
LAB TO FACTORY FLOOR
Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Mark Manley said the CIGS producers still needed to prove they could turn technological advances into viable products .
“ What you can do in the lab is one thing , but what you do in commercial production is another , ” he said .
“ What matters ultimately in solar from the economic standpoint is how many kilowatt hours you can produce for your dollar . ”
Global Solar cells ’ efficiency is about 10 percent , or half the level NREL achieved on a small scale in the lab .
The company ’s long - range goal is to mass - produce cells with 15 percent efficiency , said Chief Technology Officer Jeff Britt .
“ We have to develop manufacturing processes that are much faster ... and we have to coat many square meters ( with the CIGS semiconducting material ) , ” he said .
Under their nonexclusive pact , the NREL provides Global Solar with updates on its technological advances .
“ In many cases , we ’re able to emulate the changes that they made in our own production , ” Britt said .
“ It ’s very helpful . ”

Dr Leonid Ponomarenko shows off a device with the transistor embedded Researchers have built the world 's smallest transistor - one atom thick and 10 atoms wide - out of a material that could one day replace silicon .
The transistor , essentially an on / off switch , has been made using graphene , a two - dimensional material first discovered only four years ago .
Graphene is a single layer of graphite , which is found in the humble pencil .
The transistor is the key building block of microchips and the basis for almost all electronics .
Dr Kostya Novoselov and Professor Andre Geim from
The School of Physics and Astronomy at The University of Manchester have been leading research into the potential application of graphene in electronics and were the first to separate a sheet of the material from graphite Super material Graphene has been hailed as a super material because it has many potential applications .
It is a flat molecule , with only the thickness of an atom , and both very stable and robust .
The researchers are also looking at its use in display technology - because it is transparent .
The Manchester - based scientists have shown that graphene can be carved into tiny electronic circuits with individual transistors not much larger than a molecule .
Dr Novoselov told BBC
News that graphene had many advantages over silicon because it could conduct electricity faster and further .
Silicon will be replaced by graphene
Dr Kostya Novoselov
" These transistors will work and work at ambient , room temperature conditions - just what is required for modern electronics , " he said .
Dr Novoselov said graphene was a " wonderful conductor " , making it a perfect material for chip applications .
" It is already superior to silicon by an order of magnitude and comparable to the best samples of other materials .
" We believe we can increase this mobility of electron flow 10 - fold . "
Graphene is a hot topic among semiconductor researchers at the moment because it is an excellent conductor of electricity .
Unlike silicon graphene transistors perform better the smaller they become .
Leak electricity
The global semiconductor business is currently built on sand ; stamping out microchips from large silicon wafers .
Companies like Intel have a roadmap to reduce the size of circuits on the silicon wafer , down to about 10 nanometres - 10,000 times smaller than the width of a single human hair .
Many researchers believe that producing circuits smaller than 10 nanometres in silicon will be too difficult because they start to leak electricity at that size .
That current silicon roadmap is expected to end in 2020 , making the race to find alternative materials potentially very lucrative .
Producing graphene sheets big enough to be used as wafers for chip production remained the biggest hurdle , said Dr Novoselov .
" We can control the cut down to 20 nanometres .
And then when we have to scale down to one nanometre we use a bit of luck .
" The yield of the working devices is about 50 % . "
Many researchers around the world are working on creating large wafers of graphene .
In order to produce microchips wafers would need to be at least 10 centimetres across .
The biggest wafer produced so far is 100 microns across , just a tenth of a millimetre .
Short and narrow constrictions in graphene can act as high - quality transistors " I do believe we will find the technology to do this .
And when we do silicon will be replaced by graphene , " said Dr Novoselov .
Professor Bob Westervelt , in an assessment of the material and its future application in the journal Science , wrote : " Graphene is an exciting new material with unusual properties that are promising for nanoelectronics .
" The future should be very interesting . "
Dr Novoselov added : " Given the material was first obtained by us four years ago , we are making good progress . "
He said the process of using graphene to build circuits was very compatible with silicon technology .
" At the moment we use all the same steps to make a transistor as is done by the silicon industry .
So once we have large wafers of graphene it should be straightforward to use the same process . "
But it might be another 10 years before the first integrated circuits on graphene chips appear , he said .
Shorter term
In the shorter term graphene could be used in LCD displays to replace materials used to create transparent conductive coatings .
" The computer screen relies on good transparent conductors .
But current materials are expensive and hard to produce .
" Graphene is only one atom thin so is absolutely transparent - it's a really wonderful conductor .
" We propose to use it as a transparent conductor , using small interconnecting graphene sheets all together . "
The material is also being touted for use in solar panels , transparent window coatings and also for sensing technologies .
Dr Kostya Novoselov and Professor Andre Geim from The School of Physics and Astronomy at The University of Manchester presented their findings in the 17 April issue of Science .

What are these ?
Last year , a couple of fellas at Northeastern University with a bit of spare time on their hands proved that any configuration of a Rubik ’s cube could be solved in a maximum of 26 moves .
Now Tomas Rokicki , a Stanford - trained mathematician , has gone one better .
He ’s shown that there are no configurations that can be solved in 26 moves , thereby lowering the limit to 25 .
Rokicki’s proof is a neat piece of computer science .
He ’s used the symmetry of the cube to study transformations of the cube in sets , rather than as individual moves .
This allows him to separate the “ cube space ” into 2 billion sets each containing 20 billion elements .
He then shows that a large number of these sets are essentially equivalent to other sets and so can be ignored .
Even then , to crunch through the remaining sets , he needed a workstation with 8GB of memory and around 1500 hours of time on a Q6600 CPU running at 1.6GHz .
But Rokicki is n’t finished there .
He is already number - crunching his way to a new bound of 24 moves , a task he thinks will take several CPU months .
And presumably after that , 23 beckons .
Where is this likely to finish ?
A number of configurations are known that can be solved in 20 moves but it ’s also known that there are no configurations that can be solved in 21 moves .
So 20 looks like a good number to aim at although that will still be an upper limit .
No news yet on whether 20 might also be the lower limit , which would give the answer a satisfying symmetry .
What this problem is crying out for is a kindly set theorist who can prove exactly what the upper and lower limits should be without recourse to a few years of CPU time ( although it may take a few years of brain time ) .
Any takers ?
Ref : arxiv.org/abs/0803.3435 : Twenty - Five Moves Suffice for Rubik ’s Cube
Japanese Senator , Yukihisa Fujita , a member of the main opposition party in Japan , gained world renown through non-US media and in the US via youtube , for his assertion on national Japanese television that 9/11 was an inside job .
He recently spoke several times about the importance of www.PatriotsQuestion911.org in waking him up to the lies of 9/11 .
He stated that the architects , engineers and physicists like Professor Jones have made the case of controlled demolition well , and now it is time for politicians to be organized , and connect internationally and make joint petitions to the US Government or Congress , and to request the United Nations have independent investigations of 9/11 .
However , speaking at the 911 Truth Conference in Australia last week , he was adamant that , in order to create the public pressure to make that happen , now it is time for the 9/11 truth movement to move beyond the internet circles , and into the main public arena .
It is time to bring 9/11 truth to the more common people ’s world , he asserted .
New York Times best selling author , Steve Alten , has been living the call of the Japanese Senator in recent weeks , speaking on National CBS Radio thru nearly 200 radio stations on WTC 7 , the 9/11 War Games , the illegal destruction of WTC forensic evidence and other pressing 9/11 truth questions .
Last week Alten launched into 9/11 questions at a major book fair in Florida , when on a panel with horror author Steven King ’s son , novelist Joe Hill .
He stunned over 200 attendees who ’d come to hear tips on writing .
Steve Alten offers the current , best hope , for 9/11 truth issues to explode into mainstream media .
For his efforts major 9/11 truth leadership embraced his efforts . . . however , in the blogosphere too many 9/11 truth activists have urged others not to support Alten .
This is terribly damaging to 9/11 truth efforts , because if the movement rallied around Alten ’s new 9/11 truth telling historic - novel “ The Shell Game , ” and drove it into the top 10 of the New York Times list . . . 9/11 truth would find its way throughout mainstream media through Alten ’s relentlessly courageous voice .
Beyond that , independent publishers , one of which published Alten ’s book when major publishing houses ( who ’d published his previous non-controversial books eagerly ) turned their back on the controversial issues in the 9/11 truth telling “ The Shell Game , ” . . . are watching what happens with it .
IF they see it succeed they will be emboldened to publish more .
If the movement watches corporate media effectively sabatoge this powerful 9/11 truth issue raising tool . . . and just shrugs and goes " oops , we did the best we could , we mentioned the book a couple o' times " then the publishing industry will see that book 's demise .
It may well be the last one we see , whereas its success could usher in a host of truth telling works .
The 9/11 truth movement can do the same , for a work of hard facts !
Why is it that only fascist lunatics can relentlessly and enthusiastically support their authors , and the truth movement can't .
Of course , we can if we choose to .
However , it is not too late .
A major 9/11 truth effort to drive “ The Shell Game , ” to the top 10 , can still occur .
All we have to do is make it happen , to talk about it , write about it , call into mainstream talk shows about it , post on not just 9/11 blogs , but on all progressive movement blogs about it .
And to keep discussing it on 9/11 truth boards , blogs , in newsletters , radio programs and emails , again and again and again .
Those strange so - called 9/11 truth seekers who have scorned Alten ’s courageous efforts , have said “ The Shell Game ” should get there on its own without our help .
Given that Alten ’s works have reached the NY Times best seller list several times over . . . it would , since “ The Shell Game ” is his best work .
HOWEVER , corporate media that aided his other non-controversial works . . . has of course , turned their back on the explosive 9/11 truth telling “ The Shell Game . ”
Therefore , if the 9/11 truth movement wants to get the benefits of 9/11 truth access to mainstream corporate media , as Japanese Senator Fujita is urging us to do . . . we must help “ The Shell Game ” in every way possible .
We are closer to 9/11 truth breaking out than we may think , Senator Fujita explained in Australia .
Fujita spoke to former UK minister , Michael Meacher while at the European Parliament 9/11 Truth Conference recently .
You may remember that years before , Michael Meacher , UK Minister of the Environment in the Blair government had gained international attention when he had stated facts in national media that pointed to 9/11 being an inside job , and was forced to resign from the Blair government for his courageous statement of facts .
Japanese Senator , Yukihisa Fujita , speaking at the Australian Oz 2008 911 Truth Conference this week , said that Meacher now says that there are twenty or more members of the Labor Party in Parliament who also now believe 9/11 was an inside job .
Futhermore , he was told that there were over twenty other Parliament Ministers , from other parties , who would support a viable effort to push for a new 9/11 investigation .
Senator Fujita also said that former national minister , Meacher , told him that as Bush steps down and Blair steps down “ our time is coming . ”
Right now today , the 9/11 truth movement has the opportunity to break the truth out into lightspeed using the courage of best selling author Steve Alten , and the position his new historic - novel puts him in .
Alten is desperate to get as much 9/11 truth issues into the mainstream as quickly as possible , his fear being that the subject of his book of a neocon false flag attack on America , to fool us all into war with Iran and possible even to subvert the US Presidential election . . . may be coming true .
He sites Paul Craig Roberts warnings of just such a coming event , and Bush and Chertoff ’s ongoing “ threats ” of a coming attack on America that will dwarf the 9/11 attacks .
He sites the recent resignation ( firing ) of Admiral Fallon , the highest ranking officer in the military to resist an attack on Iran by this administration .
Gore for same - sex marriage
Not sure what prompted this , but Al Gore has quietly released a video with a forceful endorsement of equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians .
It pushes the Democratic establishment that much closer to a position he now shares with Eliot Spitzer and some other leading Dems , and is prompting a bit of grumbling in gay political circles that this batch of candidates are n't quite there .
" Gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women -- to make contracts , to have hospital visiting rights , to join together in marriage , and I do n't understand why it is considered by some people to be a threat to heterosexual marriage , " he says on the video , which appears on his Current TV network .
" Should n't we be promoting the kind of faithfulness and loyalty to ones partner regardless of sexual orientation ? "
Gore 's words come after the leading presidential candidates have tiptoed up to , but not crossed , the line of support for same - sex marriage .
All three support equal substantive rights for gay and lesbians couples , and they 've sought to woo gay voters in other ways : Elizabeth Edwards has voiced her support for same - sex marriage , for instance , and Barack Obama recently scolded the black church for homophobia , in a speech to an African - American congregation .

One method that I ’ve been wanting for quite a while now was a simple way to format old JavaScript dates in a “ pretty ” way .
For example “ 2008-01-28T20:24:17 Z ” becomes “ 2 hours ago ” .
Here ’s some more examples :
prettyDate ( " 2008-01-28T20:24:17 Z " ) // => " 2 hours ago " pretty Date ( " 2008-01-27T22:24:17 Z " ) // => " Yesterday " prettyDate ( " 2008-01-26T22:24:17 Z " ) // => " 2 days ago " prettyDate ( " 2008-01-14T22:24:17 Z " ) // => " 2 weeks ago " pretty Date ( " 2007-12-15T22:24:17 Z " ) // => undefined
Note that I only care about dates in the past ( by far the most common use case ) and only dates within the past month ( anything beyond a month becomes fuzzy and impractical ) .
JavaScript Pretty Date
pretty.js ( Also include a .prettyDate ( ) j Query plugin , for convenience . )
( Also include a .prettyDate ( ) j Query plugin , for convenience . )
Demo ( Some examples of date conversion using basic DOM manipulation . )
Example Usage
In the following examples I make all the anchors on the site , that have a title with a date in it , have a pretty date as their inner text .
Additionally , I continue to update the links every 5 seconds after the page has loaded .
With plain DOM :
function prettyLinks ( ) {
var links = document.getElementsByTagName ( “ a ” ) ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i < links .
length ; i++ ) if ( links [ i] . title ) { var date = pretty Date ( links [ i]. title ) ; if ( date ) links[i].innerHTML
= date ; } } prettyLinks ( ) ; setInterval ( prettyLinks , 5000 ) ; [ / js ]
With jQuery : [ js ] $ ( " a " ) .prettyDate ( ) ; setInterval ( function ( ) { $ ( " a " ).prettyDate( ) ; } , 5000 ) ; [ / js ]
About
There ’s a variety of these functions around , in various languages , but I wanted one in JavaScript for a couple reasons :
Microformats – Microformats specify a scheme for passing ISO dates to the client ( precise date / time value ) while providing the user with a “ casual ” date representation .
I wanted to be able to generate a pretty version of the date , from a Microformat , easily and painlessly .
Auto - update – Secondly , I wanted to have these Microformat dates update automatically , as the page remained loaded .
This way , if a user left a page open for 15 minutes , and came back , the pretty dates would be silently updated to their current times .
This may seem nitpick -y but Twitter fails to do this and it drives me absolutely insane .
Write once , use everywhere – If I wanted to have these dates be constantly updated I would have these options :
Only generate these dates on the server – re-querying new results via an Ajax request , generate the results on the server and on the client , or generate the results exclusively on the client .
Client makes the most sense as it would result in the least amount of code duplication and general overhead .
I hope this will be useful to some , I know it ’s helped me out a bunch .
By the way – let ’s say this piece of code was from a – theoretical – larger project that was attempting to create an easy - to - use , Open Source , Twitter clone – would anyone be interested in using it ?
See how much of the following sequences of letters and numbers you can memorize in the next 20 seconds :
T , E , X , A , S , O , H , I , O , V , E , R , M , O , N , T , R , H , O , D , E , I , S , L , A , N , D
2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 , 37 , 41
Done yet ?
Now , imagine that you were blindfolded and asked to recite them to someone else .
How well do you think you would do ?
You ’d probably be in one of these six groups :
]
Group 1 would get perfect recall without too much effort while Group 6 would really struggle to get a measly 20 % recall .
An interesting observation is that this wide range in results would n’t be largely affected by the general memory abilities of the person .
That is , the results are not based on innate or raw talent .
What ’s happened ?
People in Group 1 did n’t read the first sequence letter by letter .
Somehow the words “ TEXAS ” , “ OHIO ” , “ VERMONT ” , and “ RHODE ISLAND ” just jumped out to them because they recognized them as states in the USA .
Then in the next flash of insight , they might have noticed the states are listed from largest to smallest in terms of area .
Some might have even picked out that these are the states involved in the upcoming presidential primaries on Tuesday .
When approached with the number sequence , they might have read the first few numbers and then realized it was a list of prime numbers up to 41 .
When asked to memorize it , they stored something like this in their mind :
SELECT [ LettersInWord ] FROM [ StatesInUpcoming Primary ]
ORDER BY [ StateSize ] which has 3 “ chunks ” to remember .
The second might have been stored as
SELECT [ Number ] FROM [ PrimeNumbers ] WHERE [ Number ] <= 41 which also has about 3 “ chunks . ”
All told , people in Group 1 had to consciously remember about 6 “ chunks ” of information .
That ’s less numbers than a typical telephone number contains and it ’s what led to the perfect recall .
People in Group 6 probably took a much different approach .
They might have just seen the sequences as a random collection of letters and numbers .
Maybe they live in a country far away from the USA ; maybe their native language is Chinese .
To them , every letter and number was its own “ chunk . ”
When asked to remember the sequences , they might have been able to successfully recall 7 - 8 of these small “ chunks . ”
That is , the people who remembered less overall information actually remembered more “ chunks ! ”
So in terms of “ raw memory talent , ” Group 6 won even though they remembered only 20 % of what Group 1 perfectly recalled .
Essentially Group 1 had a more efficient “ chunking ” algorithm .
Chunking
When talking about the mind of a chess grandmaster , Philip Ross writes :
“ When confronted with a difficult position , a weaker player may calculate for half an hour , often looking many moves ahead , yet miss the right continuation , whereas a grandmaster sees the move immediately , without consciously analyzing anything at all .
By measuring the time it takes to commit a new chunk to memory and the number of hours a player must study chess before reaching grandmaster strength , Simon estimated that a typical grandmaster has access to roughly 50,000 to 100,000 chunks of chess information .
A grandmaster can retrieve any of these chunks from memory simply by looking at a chess position , in the same way that most native English speakers can recite the poem ‘ Mary had a little lamb ’ after hearing just the first few words
The one thing that all expertise theorists agree on is that it takes enormous effort to build these structures in the mind .
Simon coined a psychological law of his own , the 10 - year rule , which states that it takes approximately a decade of heavy labor to master any field .
Even child prodigies , such as Gauss in mathematics , Mozart in music and Bobby Fischer in chess , must have made an equivalent effort , perhaps by starting earlier and working harder than others .
Thus the first thing we learn about mastery is that it takes a lot of “ chunks ” ( approximately 50,000 - 100,000 ) to get there .
Rating Systems
The next advantage that other fields have is a generally accepted rating system .
Chess students can look at FIDE ELO chess ratings to see which people to study :
]
Golf has its “ Official World Golf Rankings : ”
]
But what about developers ?
What would be the inputs into the rating algorithm ?
It ’s hard to make good comparisons in our industry , especially when we like to hide our failures .
Still , there are some reasonable categories to look at .
Sonnentag , Niessen , and Volmer give a reasonable first approximation of what the input categories might be along with some interesting observations :
1. ) Requirements Analysis and Design Tasks
“ A common assumption is that the decomposition process is guided by a knowledge representation , which is built up with experience and stored in long - term memory .
When such a knowledge representation is not available , experts develop plans through a bottom up , backward strategy
…
When software designers were asked about strategies they would recommend to an inexperienced programmer working on the same design problem , high performers reported twice as many strategies as moderate performers … experienced programmers did not necessarily have more plans available , but focused on the most salient parts of the plan and flexibly switched between plans .
In contrast , novices preferred a strategy with which plans are implemented in a more linear fashion ”
2. ) Programming and Program Comprehension
” … poorer performers exclusively focused on program terms or on domain terms without building connections between the two ‘ worlds . ’
Thus , it seems that connecting various domains and relating them to each other is a crucial for arriving at a comprehensive understanding of the program and the underlying problem . “
3. ) Testing and Debugging
“ A thinking - aloud study showed that high performers needed less time for debugging , made fewer errors , searched more intensively for problems , and showed more information evaluation activity .
Thus , it seems that high performers have a better representation of the program and potential problems , which helps them to actively search for problems and to evaluate information .
4. ) Knowledge Representation and Recall
“ Professional programmers ’ metacognitive knowledge was much more detailed and more comprehensive than students ’ knowledge .
For example , a professional programmer provided a comment such as ‘ The main program is not very well divided ; the logic has been scattered over different parts of the program ; the updating paragraph has too much in it .
The control function of the program should be implemented in one paragraph ; now the program has much depth in itself and scanning is difficult ” , whereas the students ’ comments were more general and diffuse . ”
5. ) Communication and Cooperation
”… exceptional software designers showed superior communication skills .
In fact , much of the exceptional designers ’ design work was accomplished while interacting with other team members .
High performers spent a lot of time educating other team members about the application domain and its mapping into computational structures …
They found that individual performance of software developers is facilitated significantly by a 15 - minute talk with a senior designer about their task .
These results hold for complex tasks , not just for simple ones , indicating that high task complexity makes it more necessary and more valuable for the programmer to communicate with a more senior person . ”
I do n’t know how all of this would boil down to a mathematical formula to give a decent numeric rating .
But this deficiency does n’t matter too much .
Just thinking about how to improve in each of the 5 areas mentioned above could probably go a long way .
Effects on Code
Is all of this discussion putting us into a mental ivory tower ?
Does it offer help to a developer whose boss is frustrated and fervently asking “ Why is n’t someone coding yet ( WISCY ) ? ” I think there is great potential .
It all depends on how efficient you make your chunking algorithm .
Moreover , you have to be careful .
Spolsky writes :
A very senior Microsoft developer who moved to Google told me that Google works and thinks at a higher level of abstraction than Microsoft .
“ Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the if statement , ” he said .
A foolish application of this statement would be to believe that you could exclusively live at the higher levels without understanding the lower levels .
Chunking works effectively via hierarchical storage .
Chunks stand on the shoulders of other chunks .
I can guarantee you that star Googlers understand “ if ” statements and almost everything below that level very well .
In a world of leaky abstractions , you typically have no choice , as Anders says , but to “ add another level of abstraction . ”
Early on , I thought it was always possible to “ raise the level of abstraction . ”
I was wrong .
Abstraction is important to effective chunking , but it still requires that you have solid lower level chunks to build on top of do well .
This is especially true when problems arise and you have to debug .
Another technique is giving meaningful names to chunks will often yield good results .
For example , chess grandmasters Bobby Fischer and Gary Kasparov both won important tournament games using the “ King ’s Indian Attack ” opening move .
Developers can copy this tactic .
You might chunk this :
]
as the “ SyncRoot Variation with CompareExchange Cheap Locking . ”
Chunking this :
]
could be as simple as “ One Line Singleton ” which is much easier to chunk than the roughly equivalent “ Thread - safe Lazy Loading Singleton : ”
]
Instead of “ Array Sum via Classic For Loop Iteration : ”
]
you could have “ Array Sum Using LINQ ” :
]
The latter is in line with Anders ’ recent statement that future versions of C# will be about getting the programmer to declare “ more of the what , and less of the how ” with respect to how a result gets computed .
A side effect of this is that your “ chunks ” tend to be more efficient for the runtime , and more importantly , your brain .
The code examples so far have been fairly straightforward given their names .
Some people might be saying that “ you ’re just calling ‘ chunks ’ what are called ‘ design patterns ’ or even ‘ micropatterns ’ . ”
To this , I would respond “ not exactly . ”
For example , even though I had heard of the principle of least privilege , it was n’t until I saw a code snippet from Jeremy Miler that I realized you could be extra precise when defining an immutable class :
]
Reading Jeremy ’s code effectively enriched my definition of an “ immutable class ” chunk to have even more attributes of “ least privilege . ”
I did n’t see this a year ago .
I have a long way to go , but I think that one aspect of being able to quickly churn out great code is by having a huge reservoir of chunks like I mentioned above .
The good news is that you do n’t have to remember the syntax .
You can quickly recreate it from the idea or name .
I think the benefit you get is nearly the same as chess students get from specifically named moves .
Effects on Hiring
One interesting playground for chunking is interviewing people .
Developer interviews should always include some sort of “ chunking ” test at the FizzBuzz level or higher .
Simple chunks like conditional statements , loops , pointers , and recursion should be almost as effortless as breathing .
As Spolsky wrote :
“ If the basic concepts are n’t so easy that you do n’t even have to think about them , you ’re not going to get the big concepts …
You see , if you ca n’t whiz through the easy stuff at 100 m.p.h. , you ’re never gonna get the advanced stuff . ”
Any modern business program is inherently complicated on its own .
Since a typical person can only keep “ 7 plus or minus 2 ” chunks in their head at once , it ’s imperative that they are good sized chunks in order to get things done .
Instead of looking for “ years of experience , ” it ’d be nice if there was something better like “ years actively pursuing developer grandmaster status , ” but that ’s a bit of a stretch to ask for .
Four Stages of Chunk Competence
Each one of the 50,000 + chunks on the way mastery will probably go through the four stages of competence .
Here ’s a concrete example :
Unconscious incompetence - 10 years ago , I never even thought about software running in Turkey , let alone any issues that might come up there .
Conscious incompetence - 5 years ago , I finally came to understand the basics about Unicode and internationalization and realized that my code would n’t work quite right , but I did n’t know how to best handle it .
Conscious competence - 2 years ago , with the help of FxCop , I learned how to correctly handle character comparison in .net , but only recently learned how to correctly handle parsing and formatting locale specific information .
Unconscious competence - I ’m not there yet , but I would n’t be surprised if I produce some painful facial expression when I see a zero parameter “ . ToLower ( ) ” call in code due to the potentially bad side effects I ’ve experienced from its use .
The progression above is what led me to devise “ The Turkey Test . ”
It was a long process .
That is probably typical for any reasonable sized chunk .
I ’m assuming that chunk acquisition has the following learning curve :
]
The good news is that it ’s relatively easy to make fast initial improvements if you ’re “ deliberately focused ” which requires a high conscious effort .
The bad news is that mastering the chunk takes a long time .
Even worse , you might never even start if you stick to only the things you already know .
Reading good blogs , books , or papers can help .
But the best resource by far is an environment where coworkers can safely rocket you through the above learning curve .
This is why I really value intense code reviews by my peers at work .
Good critiques have let me accelerate my learning process as a result and get slightly better .
It ’s just simply way more efficient that way .
It ’d sort of be like the young Gary Kasparov playing a game with Bobby Fischer and getting beaten badly .
It ’d hurt the pride initially , but it would probably help him learn much faster than reading books ( as long as he kept good notes of the game ) .
Is There Hope ?
You want to hit the high notes and be a level 5 expert developer .
These are actually reasonable goals .
But you need to be realistic .
If the 50,000 + chunk number is required to be an expert , it takes a lot of time .
Realize that even after a decade of being a focused programmer , you ’re still just a teenager .
Like a large number of you , I started “ dabbling with computers ” when I was a kid .
If you count my first Applesoft BASIC program as experience , then I have 17 years of experience .
But I have a long way to go .
Do n’t get me wrong , I agree that raw “ years of experience ” is a myth .
My problem is that I have n’t been as focused as I could have been .
I only realized that after diving into “ chunking . ”
John Cloud summarizes things well :
“ Ericsson ’s primary finding is that rather than mere experience or even raw talent , it is dedicated , slogging , generally solitary exertion — repeatedly practicing the most difficult physical tasks for an athlete , repeatedly performing new and highly intricate computations for a mathematician — that leads to first - rate performance .
And it should never get easier ; if it does , you are coasting , not improving .
Ericsson calls this exertion “ deliberate practice , ” by which he means the kind of practice we hate , the kind that leads to failure and hair - pulling and fist - pounding .

Take figure - skating .
For the 2003 book Expert Performance in Sports , researchers Janice Deakin and Stephen Cobley observed 24 figure skaters as they practiced .
Deakin and Cobley asked the skaters to complete diaries about their practice habits .
The researchers found that elite skaters spent 68 % of their sessions practicing jumps — one of the riskiest and most demanding parts of figure - skating routines .
Skaters in a second tier , who were just as experienced in terms of years , spent only 48 % of their time on jumps , and they rested more often .
As Deakin and her colleagues write in the Cambridge Handbook , “ All skaters spent considerably more time practicing jumps that already existed in their repertoire and less time on jumps they were attempting to learn . ”
In other words , we like to practice what we know , stretching out in the warm bath of familiarity rather than stretching our skills .
Those who overcome that tendency are the real high performers . ” ( Emphasis added )
That ’s probably one of the most truthful statements about improving that exists .
The only thing I would clarify is that your conscious chunks should n’t be getting easier ; the chunks that were foggy in your conscious mind should probably get easier as they drift to your unconscious mind .
However , you must refuse to coast .
It ’s about picking chunks “ not because they are easy , but because they are hard . ”
The way to the top is filled with things getting harder .
There are no shortcuts .
Sorry .
I wish that this was n’t the truth .
It would be nice if you could achieve grandmaster status by learning only 101 simple tweet - sized messages in a month , a year , or even 5 years .
But it ’s just not true .
There is some mixed hope however .
One benefit from improving is that it becomes clearer where to find better information .
That is , more signal in a noisy world .
You get more of a “ gut feel ” of the feeds that should make the top tier in your reader and more importantly , which ones should n’t .
The downside , however , is that even if you only read the “ good stuff , ” it will not be easy .
If it ’s easy , you ’re not pushing hard enough .
Right now , I know I ’m fairly weak on designing great classes that are easily testable .
Through researching , I ’ve found that Rebecca Wirfs - Brock has done some great work in this area with her idea of “ responsibility driven design . ”
But sometimes it ’s hard to understand what she has written .
She tends to write in more highbrow places like IEEE Software that are reasonably good sources of software design information .
Unfortunately , these types of peer - reviewed journals are almost treated as if they have “ cooties ” by most of the blogging world , so it ’s harder to find posts on the ideas they contain .
Last month , with the generous support of my employer , I joined the ACM and subscribed to their fantastic Digital Library .
One thing I like about the library and academic papers is that they force me to get out of my comfort zone .
Almost none of the articles I ’ve been reading have covered code in C # or even .
net at all ( even though I really like it and think it ’s a good platform ) .
But this is a good thing ; it ’s not about being an expert in other languages and platforms , just rather knowing that they exist and what they do well .
A Sustainable Road to Grandmaster Status
Is there a path towards grandmaster status that still allows for a social life and avoids 80 + hour work weeks ?
Is there a path that lets you invest the considerable time and energy into your kids and treat them as the gifts that they are ?
Is there a road that lets you stop and smell the roses ?
It is possible , but you need realistic expectations .
Stay focused , but realize that it might take 25 - 30 years , especially if , like me , you have n’t been deliberate in training .
Anything worth doing takes practice and persistence .
As Fred Brooks observed on a New Orleans restaurant menu :
Good cooking takes time .
If you are made to wait , it is to serve you better , and to please you .
Come to grips with the fact that even a great book might only yield 6 - 7 good , lasting chunks .
Make use of the great human resources around you , especially if they have similar focus .
If you hear that they read a good book , ask them what surprised them the most compared to what they expected the book to cover .
Odds are there are only a few chunks .
The question evokes more efficient learning .
Keep reading yourself and share with others that care .
Look for passion , especially in others that are n’t like you at all .
Do you know someone that always raves about Python , Ruby , or Scala ?
Ask them about what ’s painful to do in those languages and seek hard to understand those points .
You ’ll probably learn something interesting .
For the same reason , find problems with your favorite language and be able to articulate them in a professional manner .
You ’ll probably be a better developer as a result .
Do n’t be alarmed if junior programmers do n’t understand what you mean when you use your “ code defensively ” chunk on them .
If it took you 15 years worth of war stories in the trenches to get it , it ’ll probably take the best ones at least 5 , even with your guidance .
Help them anyway .
By doing so , you ’ll begin to repay the huge debt you took out when learning the profession .
When you see a great design or piece of code created by someone else , ask them how long it took to produce .
You might be suprised that it took several rewrites and refactorizations to get there .
This gives you hope that things are possible .
When people , especially junior people , ask you how long it you to create something , do n’t try to hide the fact if it took several iterations and false starts to get there .
This will also help you solidify the chunks that got you there and perhaps help you store a more efficient path for the future .
Branch out into unfamiliar territory that looks interesting on a regular basis , even if it ’s just for 15 minutes a day .
If your employer encourages this , you ’ll probably grow faster .
When faced with a decision of choosing what to invest time into learning , do n’t overlook practicing the ones that “ [ you ] hate , the kind that [ lead ] to failure and hair - pulling and fist - pounding . ”
You ’re likely to improve faster that way .
Once you made the decision , always make your studies “ deliberate ” and “ effortful . ”
Philip Ross expands on this :
Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but “ effortful study , ” which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one ’s competence .
That is why it is possible for enthusiasts to spend tens of thousands of hours playing chess or golf or a musical instrument without ever advancing beyond the amateur level and why a properly trained student can overtake them in a relatively short time .
It is interesting to note that time spent playing chess , even in tournaments , appears to contribute less than such study to a player ’s progress ; the main training value of such games is to point up weaknesses for future study .
Even the novice engages in effortful study at first , which is why beginners so often improve rapidly in playing golf , say , or in driving a car .
But having reached an acceptable performance –for instance , keeping up with one ’s golf buddies or passing a driver ’s exam–most people relax .
Their performance then becomes automatic and therefore impervious to further improvement .
In contrast , experts - in - training keep the lid of their mind ’s box open all the time , so that they can inspect , criticize and augment its contents and thereby approach the standard set by leaders in their fields .
Good software takes at least 10 years to develop because it takes programmers at least 10 years to develop good proficiency in programming and the problem domain .
Do n’t forget that all of this presupposes that you enjoy software development .
I ’m privileged to have a “ hobby ” that also pays the bills .
But , if you do n’t honestly enjoy the field , you probably wo n’t care about wanting to go down this road in the first place .
As Daniel Goleman alludes to , a key driver that lends itself towards efficient chunking is passion :
“ The most contentious claim made by Dr. Ericsson is that practice alone , not natural talent , makes for a record - breaking performance .
‘ Innate capacities have very little to do with becoming a champion , ’ said his colleague , Dr. Charness .
‘ What ’s key is motivation and temperament , not a skill specific to performance .
It ’s unlikely you can get just any child to apply themselves this rigorously for so long . ’” ( Emphasis added )
It will take lots of time , but do n’t forget to have fun and take plenty of breaks .
Your body needs it :
“ When we train Olympic weight lifters , we find we often have to throttle back the total time they work out , ” said Dr. Mahoney .
“ Otherwise you find a tremendous drop in mood , and a jump in irritability , fatigue and apathy . ”
All of the above was to just convey that “ Software Grandmaster ” status can only occur after at least 10 years of very deliberate focus on areas that stretch you .
Maybe this post might have qualified as a 1/50,000th to 1/100,000 of the way towards getting you there .
Then again … maybe not .
It ’s your move .
Let me know through comments .
Most of your essentials are already distributed by vending machines : condoms , electronics , luscious 1 - calorie Tab ...
But now , you can finally get what you really need : medical marijuana , from Anytime Vending Machines .
AVMs are 24/7 machines housed in standalone rooms , abutting two dispensaries and protected by round - the - clock security guards -- like ATMs for people combating psychological withdrawal with a physical one .
After cinching up your doctor 's consultation , hit an AVM location to get your prescription approved , fingerprint taken , and a prepaid credit card loaded with your profile : dosage ( 3.5 or 7 grams , up to 1 oz a week ) and strain preference ( choice of five , including OG Cush and Granddaddy Purple , the mildly hallucinogenic forebear to Prince ) .
Then day or night , all you do is hit a machine and walk away with enough vacuum - sealed , plastic - encapsulated cheeba to adequately treat your illness , and guarantee your car never smells like new leather again .
The AVMs are already in place at their respective dispensaries and will be fully - operational by Monday , though their vestibules are still under construction ; future plans include machine - vended pharmaceuticals like Vicodin , Viagra , and Propecia -- for when the excessive chemicals in Tab have wracked you with pain , limpness , and baldness .

I 've been acting on the assumption that WordPress 2.3.3 was a " safe " release .
I certainly had n't spotted any hacked blogs using 2.3.3 but poking around , I find these reports of compromised 2.3.3 blogs :
WTF ?
I 'm going to continue assuming that 2.3.3 is secure and there was something else going on in those cases -- I 'm expecting the WordPress developers to weigh in with a definitive statement on this ( hello , anybody home ? ) .
Now , according to Blog Herald , the safe versions are 2.5 , 2.3.3 , 2.1.3 , and 2.0.11 -- if that 's the case , I 'll incorporate that into another update to Technorati's crawler ( though to date , 2.1.3 and 2.0.11 have so far been statistically insignificant ) .
Folks need to keep getting the word out : friends do n't let friends run vulnerable installations of WordPress .
In the meantime , here 's latest snapshot of the trailing 90 days of WordPress updates handled by Technorati :
Version Count ( in thousands ) Change 2.3.3 238 - 2 2.3.1 152 -1 2.3.2 144 +2 2.5 93 +7 2.2.2 76 +1 2.2.3 70 +3 2.0.1 59 0 2.1.2 36 - 1 2.2.1 35 0 2.2 30 - 2
It 's encouraging to see the numbers for 2.5 going up strongly : 7000 more WordPress 2.5 blogs updated since yesterday 's trailing 90 days .
Seems like the small flaps for the other versions are a wash .

When I was comparing notes with Kevin Burton , it looks like we each independently found the same A - lister ( who shall remain nameless here ) that had fallen victim to the WordPress vulnerability on a secondary blog .
I think we each independently had passed a " heads - up " , I know I was in touch with this blogger a few times in the last two weeks about it .
The blog has since been taken down ( the URL redirects to a different blog and that redirect target is not vulnerable ) .
This phenomenon is hitting blogs up and down the blogosphere 's power curve -- it 's neither the A - listers nor the Z - listers who are targetted .
Any old vulnerable WordPress installation will do .
And as can be seen in the metrics I 've posted recently , the number of potential targets is vast .
Bokardo had fallen into the link - spam hole in Technorati 's system because of spam defacement ( I 've since corrected the flagging , we 're indexing Bokardo again ) .
Ironically , the same day that Bokardo posted about being zapped in the Google index , the Google Webmaster Central Blog posted
My site 's been hacked - now what ?
which details the process of getting out of their purgatory .
Unlike the aforementioned A - lister 's silence on the matter , Bokardo author Joshua Porter posted about it , to which I say , " Yay , brother ! "
His case clearly illustrated the basic point : if you have n't upgraded your vulnerable WordPress installation , you 're operating an insecure wiki -- any jackass with the exploit can re-write your pages ( and worse ) .
And they will .
Shift gears .
I 've been participating in online community on The WeLL for almost 14 years ( yea , I 'm paleolithic but I 'm young at heart ) .
One of the central ethical underpinnings on the WeLL is YOYOW : You Own Your Own Words .
Other people can't quote / repost your words outside of the system without your permission and you need to be responsible for the things you say .
In that spirit , I suggest that quality open source projects should adopt a collective You Own Your Own Code ethic .
If you release code for other people to do great things with , mazel tov !
But take pride in your products by keeping that usage fulfilling and secure .
Where are the WordPress folks in getting the word out about the hack pandemic ?
Why is n't there a Big Red Banner on wordpress.org alerting people to the hazards of not upgrading ?
Waxing on about all of the groovy features in v2.5 is fine but really , they should be shouting : URGENT !
YOUR INSTALLATION WILL BE HACKED UNLESS YOU UPGRADE TO ONE OF THIS FIXED RELEASES OR APPLY A PATCH .
It 's not like they do n't know , both Kevin and I have talked to WordPress developers and posted very publicly about what 's going .
Perhaps if Bokardo or the aforementioned A - lister migrated to Movable Type or some other platform and trumpetted about it , WordPress - land would hear the message .
Instead of urging people to upgrade , maybe we should be urging them to migrate .

LOS ANGELES
WHEN Josh Blue won NBC’s “ Last Comic Standing ” last season , he did so with riffs like this :
“ My right arm does a lot of crazy stuff .
Like the other day , I thought someone had stolen my wallet . ”
It ’s funny only if you know that Mr. Blue has cerebral palsy .
The public image of people with disabilities has often hinged on the heroic or the tragic .
But Mr. Blue , 28 , represents the broader portrait of disability now infusing television and film .
This new , sometimes confrontational stance reflects the higher expectations among many members of the disabled population that they be treated as people who happen to have a disability , rather than as people defined by disability .
“ What we ’re seeing is less ‘ overcoming ’ and more ‘ just being , ’ ” said Lawrence Carter - Long , the director of advocacy for the Disabilities Network of New York City , which last year started a film series , “ disTHIS : Disability Through a Whole New Lens , ” celebrating unconventional portrayals of the disabled .
“ More people are saying , ‘ This is who I am .
If you have a problem with it , that ’s your problem , ’ ” he said .
Activity in the US service sector unexpectedly tumbled sharply last month for the first time in almost five years , a leading survey showed today .
The figures suggest that the Federal Reserve may have to continue to cut interest rates aggressively to stop the US falling into the worst recession since 2001 .
The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen over 300 points to 12,325.37 by 7 pm GMT while the FTSE 100 index in London closed down more than 2.5 % to 5868.0 .
The Institute for Supply Management reported its index of service sector business activity declined to 41.9 in January from 54.4 in December .
Wall Street had forecast a slight slowdown but had still expected the sector to record some growth .
However , the reading below the 50 mark , which separates expansion from contraction , was the first time activity in the service sector has shrunk since March 2003 .
The headline index plunged from 53.2 in December to only 44.6 in January - the lowest since October 2001 , just after 9/11 .
" ( The ) non-manufacturing ISM suggests the wheels have fallen off the economy , " said Julian Jessop , economist at Capital Economics .
New orders also contracted into recession territory , sliding back to 43.5 from 53.9 while the backlog of orders and inventories slipped lower - another sign of weakening activity in the sector .
The employment index also lurched down to 43.9 from 51.8 .
Analysts said the services sector was taking a harder hit than manufacturing , which has been supported by overseas demand and helped by the dollar weakness compared with the more domestically reliant services sector .
However , there are signs that manufacturing is also struggling after the ISM index fell below 50 in December , before bouncing back to just above 50 in January .
Economists said the service survey suggested that current spending by US households has weakened substantially , hinting that retail sales figure next week will be very poor .
" It is also worth bearing in mind that in terms of employment and output , the non-manufacturing sector dwarfs the manufacturing sector , so is a more worrying development that more than offsets last week 's good manufacturing news , " said Rob Carnell at ING .
" The Federal Reserve might want to move rates in smaller steps at future meetings , but if the macro economy is deteriorating as fast and as far as this survey suggests , then markets may not allow them that luxury . "
The audience at American University roared .
It was mostly young people , and to them , the Clintons are as old as the Trumans were in 1960 .
And in the students ’ rapture for Kennedy ’s message , you began to see the folding over of generations , the service generation of John and Robert Kennedy united with the service generation of the One Campaign .
The grandparents and children united against the parents .
How could the septuagenarian Kennedy cast the younger Clintons into the past ?
He could do it because he evoked the New Frontier , which again seems fresh .
He could do it because he himself has come to live a life of service .
After his callow youth , Kennedy came to realize that life would not give him the chance to be president .
But life did ask him to be a senator , and he has embraced that role and served that institution with more distinction than anyone else now living  as any of his colleagues , Republican or Democrat , will tell you .
And he could do it because culture really does have rhythms .
The respect for institutions that was prevalent during the early ’60s is prevalent with the young again today .
The earnest industriousness that was common then is back today .
The awareness that we are not self - made individualists , free to be you and me , but emerge as parts of networks , webs and communities ; that awareness is back again today .
Sept. 11th really did leave a residue  an unconsummated desire for sacrifice and service .
The old Clintonian style of politics clashes with that desire .
When Sidney Blumenthal expresses the Clinton creed by telling George Packer of The New Yorker , “ It ’s not a question of transcending partisanship .
It ’s a question of fulfilling it , ” that clashes with the desire as well .
It ’s not clear how far this altered public mood will carry Obama in this election .
But there was something important and memorable about the way the 75 - year - old Kennedy communed and bonded with a rapturous crowd half a century his junior .
The old guy stole the show .
FOR most of her life , Ana Silva was illiterate , even though she completed primary school .
Then she joined Misión Robinson , a literacy programme organised by Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez .
Once a hospital cleaner , she is now a nursing auxiliary and hopes to study social work in Cuba .
Her colleagues at work no longer have to help her decipher her payslip .
“ We live better , ” she says .
“ We live like people . ”
Mr Chávez 's supporters would like the world to believe that Ms Silva 's story is typical of the way their hero has revolutionised the lives of his country 's poor .
Sadly , there is growing evidence that in fact it is exceptional .
The literacy scheme was one of a clutch of social “ missions ” organised by Mr Chávez in 2003 , when he faced possible defeat in a recall referendum on his presidency .
The government claims that by October 2005 it had all but eliminated illiteracy .
That claim has become a centrepiece of the international propaganda effort on behalf of Mr Chávez 's “ revolution ” .
But there is no data to support it .
Many educationalists doubt it .
Even the government itself has retreated from its initial figure of “ less than 1 % illiteracy ” to a figure of around 4 % , though it is not clear whether this refers just to adults or to the total population .
It is notoriously difficult to obtain precise literacy figures from census data , which rely on self - assessment .
But Francisco Rodríguez of Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Daniel Ortega of IESA , a Caracas business school , have used household surveys from the national statistical institute to assess the programme .
In an article in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs , Mr Rodríguez says that they found “ little evidence ” of any “ statistically distinguishable effect on Venezuelan illiteracy ” .
Where the government says it taught 1.5 m , the study found that only 1.1 m were illiterate to begin with , and that the fall over the 2003 - 05 period was less than 100,000 .
Even this improvement could largely be explained by a long - term demographic trend ( many illiterate adults are elderly and die off ) .
Adán Chávez , who is the education minister as well as the president 's brother , has complained of statistical “ manipulation ” by the government 's foes .
But Mr Rodríguez , for one , is no reactionary ; he was the chief economist of Venezuela 's National Assembly in 2000 - 04 , and was once a chavista sympathiser .
Last year the statistics institute launched its own study on the impact of the social missions .
This was supposed to be ready by January .
But delays in buying equipment mean it has yet to start , according to Irene Gurrea , the economist in charge .
Asked if there were any reliable statistics on the impact of Misión Robinson , Ms Gurrea said : “ As far as we know , no — that 's why we 're doing the study . ”
Staff of an older literacy programme run by Fe y Alegría , a Catholic charity , say they continue to enroll students .
In Machiques , near the Colombian border , 100 joined in the past semester .
They say that up to 40 % of the Warao Indians in the Orinoco delta are illiterate .
In 2005 Mr Chávez told local officials to declare their towns officially “ illiteracy free ” .
Knowing this to be untrue , the mayor of Machiques resisted , but gave in to pressure , according to Jesús Vilorio , who works for Fe y Alegría .
It is not hard to find individuals like Ms Silva who say their lives were changed by Misión Robinson .
But the missions have gone hand - in - hand with neglect of schools and hospitals .
Mr Rodríguez estimates that Robinson spent $ 1,000 for each of its literate graduates , compared with around $ 60 for other literacy schemes in Latin America .
At the least , that money could have been better spent .
Nazi Albatross
What to Do with Hitler 's Submarine Bunker ?
The submarine bunker is gigantic -- and expensive .
A World War II - era military facility is slowly succumbing to the elements , and nobody seems willing to pay for its upkeep .
In fact , the German armed forces has offered it up for sale .
For a guy who just lost a primary , ’08 Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama sounds like he won .
Highlights and remarks follow the video below …
The Illinois senator gave yet another stirring speech , his knack for which is far superior to the rest of the field on either side .
“ A few weeks ago , no one imagined that we ’d have accomplished what we did here tonight , ” began Obama , just after congratulating winner Sen. Hillary Clinton .
“ For most of this campaign , we were far behind , and we always knew our climb would be steep .
But in record numbers , you came out and spoke up for change .
And with your voices and your votes , you made it clear that at this moment â€ “ in this election â€ “ there is something happening in America . ”
Obama reiterated this election season ’s common theme of “ change , ” but did it with an inspired finesse and a commanding cadence that recalled Dr. Martin Luther King ’s gifted oratory : “ There is something happening when people vote not just for the party they belong to but the hopes they hold in common â€ “ that whether we are rich or poor ; black or white ; Latino or Asian ; whether we hail from Iowa or New Hampshire , Nevada or South Carolina , we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction .
That is what ’s happening in America right now .
Change is what ’s happening in America . ”
Shades of John F. Kennedy were self - evident as Obama declared , “ We can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists ; citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return .
And when I am President , we will end this war in Iraq and bring our troops home ; we will finish the job against al - Qaeda in Afghanistan ; we will care for our veterans ; we will restore our moral standing in the world … ”
Obama then said , in a punishing Larry Holmes - like jab to the failed Bush administration and desperate GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani , among others , “ We will never use 9/11 as a way to scare up votes , because it is not a tactic to win an election , it is a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the twenty - first century : terrorism and nuclear weapons ; climate change and poverty ; genocide and disease . ”
His speech built up to a crescendo as he exclaimed , “ In the unlikely story that is America , there has never been anything false about hope .
For when we have faced down impossible odds ; when we ’ve been told that we ’re not ready , or that we should n’t try , or that we can ’t , generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people :
Yes we can ! ”
“ Yes We Can ” then became the stirring chant of the frenzied crowd ; they shouted it often and loudly , in perfect unison .
Obama was n’t finished .
In the best part of his speech , he underscored his mantra and touched on numerous milestones of American history .
“ It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation .
Yes we can .
It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail toward freedom through the darkest of nights .
Yes we can .
It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness .
Yes we can .
“ It was the call of workers who organized ; women who reached for the ballot ; a President who chose the moon as our new frontier ; and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the Promised Land .
“ Yes we can to justice and equality .
Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity .
Yes we can heal this nation .
Yes we can repair this world .
Yes we can ! ”
Tremendous .
After seven years of darkness in America , forgive this blogger for feeling a bit giddy about the future , even if it ’s perhaps the illusory after - effects of a heady political sermon .

Integrated graphics need not apply
AT&T has opened up a private beta of its new , hyper-visual web browser named Pogo .
Yes , you read that right — AT&T is diving into the web browser market with a new creation of its own , based on Mozilla and 3D technology from Vizible , a Canada - based company that AT&T has invested in .
The goal is to create a web browsing experience that is more robust than the crufty old browsers that we have all grown accustomed to .
The software is not yet open to the public , but we had an opportunity to test out Pogo and see what it was all about .
First off , Pogo is Windows - only , and AT&T makes no indication that it will be available for the Mac anytime soon ( or ever ) .
It requires Windows XP SP2 or later or Windows Vista , and its minimum hardware are surprisingly steep : a 1.6GHz processor , 2GB of RAM , and a video card with at least 256MB of VRAM .
Seem like a bit much for a web browser ?
It is , and as we found out , these requirements posed some major challenges for us during our testing .
Installation
Upon installation , Pogo warns you if you 're attempting to install it on a machine with less than 256MB of VRAM but allows you to press ahead if you wish .
If you do n't have 256MB of VRAM though , we do n't recommend that you take your chances — you 'll find yourself wishing you had a time machine so you could go back in time to before you loaded it up , and beat yourself unconscious .
Emulation ?
Forget about it .
We attempted to play with Pogo in a Parallels virtual machine running Windows XP on a Core 2 Duo iMac 2.16GHz with 2GB of RAM , but quickly found that the iMac 's integrated graphics ( running in a VM , no less ) were not doing Pogo any favors .
While the main portion of the application that displays web pages functioned ( mostly ) fine , anything that was even remotely " pretty " about Pogo would not display at all .
This included parts of the UI and all of its functionality relating to bookmarks , history , springboards , and anything else .
Since that 's how you use the browser , we realized that this was not going to work .
Moving on , we tested Pogo on a dual - processor , dual - core AMD Opteron 2210 with 1.80 GHz CPUs , 2GB of RAM , and a NVIDIA Quadro FX 560 video card with 128MB of VRAM running Windows XP .
On this machine , the remainder of Pogo 's features actually displayed , but did not do much else .
We found that with even minor use , the browser slowed to a crawl , animations built into the UI were laggy , and at some times , unusable .
Performance was extremely poor when even trying to perform basic functions like clicking UI elements .
We decided once again to step it up and run Pogo on a dual - processor Opteron 256 with two 3GHz CPUs , 4GB of RAM , and an NVIDIA 8800 GT video card with 512MB of VRAM .
From here , we were finally able to use Pogo enough to actually find out how well it works — for the most part , anyway .
An all - new UI
Pogo 's UI is very different than most other web browsers — so different , in fact , that several of us found it difficult to figure out exactly how to do typical web - browsery things on it .
It 's not very intuitive compared to other browsers , and uses different terminology for many things because they are displayed differently than in other browsers .
For example , Pogo uses " cells " instead of tabs , although they function just like tabs .
Cells are thumbnail - sized icons of the pages you have open that sit in a little dock bar underneath your current web page .
The dock is the row of icons along the bottom , with snapshot " cells " functioning as tabs
This looks pretty , and certainly gives you an instantaneous , visual representation of the tabs you have open ( reminiscent to OmniWeb ) .
But looks are about all the dock and cells can offer — it 's stuck at the bottom of the screen , so for those of us who like having tabs at the top , we 're out of luck .
Keeping a handful of cells open means you are going to take major performance hits and have your resources gobbled up too — on our Opteron 256 machine , Pogo began to slow down with just three cells open , and with more than that , it became stuttery and annoying to use .
You ’ve had a small number of career defining moments .
These are the select few moments in time when the trajectory of your career changed instantly and drastically .
I have two buckets of these : ones I expected and ones that completely blindsided me .
While the surprise and subsequent scrambling involved in being blindsided are chock full of delicious adrenaline , I highly recommend the moments you can predict .
One such predictable moment is the first glimpse of the offer letter for your new gig .
This is the culmination of hours of resume tweakage , a series of phone screen gymnastics , and two grueling days of in - person interviews .
This is the moment where you can answer the question , “ How much do they think I ’m worth ? ”
Fact is , you should already know .
You ’re the business .
Pre-Game
The offer letter negotiation process starts earlier than you think .
Think back to your first phone screen .
The recruiter was asking you warm - up feeler questions like , “ Why do you want to leave your current gig ? ” and “ What ’s your ideal job ? ” , when they slide in a casual , “ So , what are you making now ? ”
You stop .
You sense that this seemingly off - the - cuff question is important .
Your inner dialog goes something like , “ I ’m making 64 k , buUUut , I ’m going to round up to 70 k because , well , I ’m worth it . ”
Yes , you are , but it ’s a lie and it ’s not a very good lie .
You also broke the number one rule in negotiation : be informed .
You do n’t make 70 k ; you do n’t make 64 k , either .
You make closer to 90 k .
HOLY RAISE RANDS .
I ’ll explain where this magical raise comes from as well as the other rules in a bit , but first let ’s understand how to answer the question “ What are you making now ? ”
Your answer : “ I ’m full - time and I ’m making 64 k .
I ’m getting a review in October , and my last raise was 4 % plus a 2 k bonus .
I ’d be walking away from 500 unvested options with a strike price currently 12 bucks under market , and all of which are going to be totally vested in 12 months . ”
Expect an uncomfortable pause on the other end of the phone .
That ’s the sound of the recruiter furiously scribbling “ Candidate knows their compensation shit ” on the top of your resume .
What you ’re saying with this lengthy informed answer is complex , yet simple .
You ’re saying , “ There are many ways to be compensated .
I ’m aware of all of them and , when the time is right , I ’m ready to negotiate . ”
How I ’m Doing ?
Whether you ’re expecting an offer letter imminently or simply wondering how I ’m going to make the offer negotiation process entertaining , I have an exercise for you .
Let ’s figure out what you actually make .
Like frequent resume updates , this career maintenance exercise is designed as a professional checkpoint , which answers the simple question , “ How am I doing ? ”
First , I ’ll explain how I calculated your hypothetical yearly compensation above :
Base salary : 64 k
Benefits : 25 % of 64 k = 16
k
Bonus : 2 k
Stock : 6 k
Total : 88 k
There are two fuzzy areas in this calculation .
First , if you have n’t worked for yourself , you probably have n’t considered benefits as part of your compensation before .
That 25 % is an educated swag that most companies use to account for health and life insurance and 401k .
You spend a lot of time ignoring this 25 % because it involves things like retirement and health benefits and — duh — you ’re immortal .
There will , however , be a time , probably sooner than you ’d like , that you ’ll fully appreciate this portion of your compensation .
The other fuzzy area is stock .
This example assumes you got 2000 options when you were hired and these options vest at 25 % each year .
I ’m making an optimistic wild - ass leap and saying that you ’re grossing 6 k a year using the idea that you are making 12 dollars per option per year .
Congrats .
Now , grab a piece of paper and figure out what you make .
Do n’t sweat perfection .
You just need to be close .
The Swag
Fast forward .
You ’ve just finished the second round of interviews .
Traditionally in high - tech , the recruiter is the last interview of the day and their job is to get inside your head and see what you think about the gig .
They might throw in some compensation questions regarding your current gig as well .
My advice is simple : the more they know you want the gig , the less they need to offer you .
And they have n’t offered you a thing yet .
There ’s a time and place for negotiation , and it ’s not at the end of six hours of interviews on a Friday when you do n’t even know if you ’re getting an offer letter .
So you wait .
You send off a set of references , sit in bed replaying interviews in your head , and send thank you e-mails to the interview team .
All professional karma - aligning activities , but what you really need to do is build your own offer letter .
Let ’s swag it :
Salary
The business model everyone loves is a business built on recurring revenue streams .
This is why you can get a good cell phone for absolutely nothing .
You ’re going to pay for that phone many times over with your monthly subscription of $ 39.95 .
You ’re still happy paying $ 40 a month because that feels like a deal , but carriers do n’t see $ 40 ; they see the $ 1500 you ’re going to spend over that three - year contract .
Your base salary is your recurring revenue stream .
It ’s your financial life blood and we ’re going to spend a lot of time figuring out how to get it as high as possible because a 1 % increase does n’t affect just this year , it affects every year after it .
For the swag , you need to figure out what you want to be paid in the new gig , and my first question is , “ For someone doing exactly the same job as you , how much are they being paid ? ”
For a question that everyone wants to know the answer to , the Internet is surprisingly useless here .
In preparation for this article I spent a solid day researching various salary information sites and could n’t find a single site that contained a job description that remotely described my current gig .
Go ahead and check out those salary info sites and confuse yourself a bit , but I ’ve got two pieces of advice for your swag .
First , talk to friends with similar jobs .
Remember that salaries for similar jobs vary greatly depending on the industry , geographic location , and specific company .
Second , take your current salary and add 10 % — that ’s your salary swag .
Title
Titles , like salaries , vary from company to company , but what you ’re looking for in a new job is a sign that you are growing .
Associate software engineer now ?
Ok , drop that associate title from your business cards .
Stuck as a software engineer for three years ?
I ’d be looking for that senior prefix when I jumped ship .
Think of your new title like this : what title needs to be added to your resume for this new job to demonstrate that you ’re actively growing in your career ?
Sign -on Bonus
It ’s difficult to swag a sign - on bonus because this type of incentive is often used to augment weak parts of an offer , and you do n’t have an offer letter yet .
If a recruiter knows you ’re keen on stock and that you ’ll be disappointed with a low - ball stock offer , they might dazzle you with a large sign - on bonus .
Sign - on bonuses are one - time cash windfalls that may never show up again .
For now , all you need to know is that they ’re often a band - aid , and the question will be : what are they hiding ?
Stock
While representing the largest potential for unexpected financial gain , stock and stock options are also the hardest to swag .
Rather than focusing on a hard number here , the question you should first ask is , “ How much do I believe in this company ? ”
If your answer is , “ I like the company , but I do n’t see a lot of growth ” then focus your negotiation energy on base salary .
If your answer is , “ I love this start - up ; it ’s the next Google ” then stock grants are clearly going to play a major role in your negotiation .
In terms of valuing the stock , whether we ’re talking about a start - up or an established public company , you ’re speculating .
For a publicly traded company , take a look at the past 5 years .
What ’s the average stock price ?
For the start - up , well , my rule of thumb for stock is no different than a venture capitalist ’s success rate .
A VC ’s expectation is that one out of every ten of their companies is going to hit it big and that will cover the investment for the other nine .
My expectation is that one out of every ten jobs will result in a stock windfall .
This should depress you .
Any value you place on stock or options is a wild - ass guess , but it ’s still an important piece of data .
The value you put on stock is a measure of your belief in the company .
The Offer
“… and the team is really excited to have you onboard and we have an offer letter for you . ”
And then it lands .
Before we digest what the recruiter is saying , I want to reset your head .
Yes , you ’ve made it this far .
Yes , you want the job .
Yes , you love the company .
But here ’s the reality :
You are the business .
If you take this gig , I think you should pour your heart into it , but I want you to remember that you ’re going to have another five to ten other jobs in your lifetime just like this one .
This means that for each moment you spend being pumped about the new gig , you ’ll have an equal and opposite moment at the end of the gig where you ca n’t wait to get the hell out .
Amongst these five to ten jobs that you ’ll have there is one constant : you .
You ’re the one who has to pay rent , ride the subway , buy a condo , get married , have some kids , and build your dream house .
Your welfare is not your employer ’s first priority .
It takes one layoff to figure that out .
You are the business and the one consistent metric business is measured by is growth .
A new gig represents a rare opportunity where you can drastically change the trajectory of that growth .
The Counter - Offer
As a hiring manager who has been involved in many offer negotiations , the safest way to get me to ignore any counter - offer is to make it without data .
Recruiter : “ The candidate wants a higher base . ”
Me : “ Really ?
Why ? ”
Recruiter : “ He just does . ”
Me : “ Grrrrrrr . ”
Negotiation is a discussion of facts .
Any counter - offer needs to be constructed with the impression that it ’s based on data .
“ I want a 10 % raise because , based on my research , that represents the average salary for this gig elsewhere in the industry . ”
Sure , it ’s still a swag , but your swag demonstrates effort / research / desire and in an interrupt - driven industry full of bright people racing around doing nothing in particular , I ’m a fan of research .
It demonstrates that you care about your career and that ’s someone I want to work with .
The real problem is …
This Offer Blows
There ’s some portion of the offer that is disappointing to you , and everyone involved , including your future employer , would prefer that you did n’t walk in the door disappointed .
Let ’s fix that .
As I do n’t know what your problem is with your particular offer , I ca n’t advise what you need to say , but here are some common frustrations and a plan of attack .
Lower Base Salary :
If you ’re staying in your industry and you ’re staying at an established company , I ca n’t see how a pay decrease is ever a positive sign .
Yes , if you ’re moving to a start - up , you ’re going to trade salary for stock .
You need to figure out if you ’re cool with that .
You wanted a 10 % increase and they came back with 5 % ?
Why ?
Sure , your 10 % was a pie in the sky swag , but how is the recruiter justifying this base salary ?
They ’re probably saying something about comparable salaries across the company and how you ’d be making more than 90 % of the people in your grade .
That ’s a warm fuzzy , but I call bullshit : you ’re in the wrong grade .
But It ’s Ok , Here ’s a Bonus :
If the recruiter is pitching this bonus as a fix for your low base , I call bullshit again .
A sign - on bonus , like a bonus plan , is a finicky thing that has a habit of vanishing when the sky falls .
You ca n’t count on them .
There ’s nothing like an instant pile of money to distract you from the fact that , over the long term , you ’re bringing less money home .
Even Better , Here ’s a Pile of Stock : How do you value this stock ?
Sure , for the public company , you have a stock price , but you ’re not going to see a penny of that stock for a year .
And what about that start - up ?
Well , did you know they have a stock price , too ?
They have to in order to give it some sort of value .
This is how a start - up values itself when it goes to a VC .
They say , “ We ’ve issued x amount of shares and we believe they ’re worth y per share .
How much would you like ? ”
You can ask about this internal stock price .
You can ask about how big their pool of outstanding fully diluted shares is and that will give you some data about how much of the pie you ’re getting .
But here ’s the rub : I assume start - up options have zero financial value , but this does n’t mean they have zero absolute value .
Again , your measure of the stock is merely the measure of your faith .
And This is Our Final Offer :
If some part of the offer blows and there ’s absolutely no way to fix it , you have two options : walk away or find another way to ease the blow .
If you ca n’t walk away , have you thought about :
Asking for additional vacation hours right out of the gate ?
Getting a start date a month later than they ’re asking ?
There ’s nothing like 30 days of work - free bliss to adjust your perspective .
What their work - at - home policy is ?
Perhaps Fridays working at home will remove that “ I ’m not getting a raise ” taste in your mouth .
Perhaps my favorite “ This offer blows ” move is to negotiate a six - month performance review .
You know you rock , but they do n’t… yet .
Meh
My single worst gig was one where I got everything I wanted out of the offer letter , but in my exuberance for being highly valued , I totally forgot that my first read on the gig was “ meh ” .
90 days later , I could n’t care less that I got a 15 % raise and a sign - on bonus .
I could n’t stand the mundanity of the daily work and I happily resigned a few months later , taking both a pay cut and returning my sign - on bonus for the opportunity to work at Netscape .
All of this discussion of compensation ignores a simple question you need to be able to answer : “ How much might I love this gig ? ”
For any new job , you should be able to quickly explain to anyone why the new job is bigger than the last and why you might love it .
Whether they believe you or not is irrelevant .
You ’ve got to believe it because you ’re the business .
Apple and Sony have decided to settle at least one lawsuit stemming from the whole lithium - ion battery debacle of ' 06 .
And who can blame them at these bargain basement prices .
The two companies are jointly paying a Japanese couple a total of about 1.3 million yen ( that 's $ 12,903 ) for damages to their home and burns the man sustained while trying to remove his flaming Apple computer from the house .
The couple argued this fire was caused by a defective Sony lithium - ion battery .
To date , Sony has recalled 9.6 million of these occasionally unstable batteries with the help of some major laptop manufacturers , including Apple , Toshiba , Lenovo and Acer .
Apple , while accepting liability in the case , insisted it would not settle the dispute out of court because the couple had demanded excessive compensation ( they were asking for 2 million yen ) .
Despite agreeing to pay its share of the settlement , Sony still maintains there was no link between the fire and the battery .

Legal Notice
Maybe you forgot ( do n’t worry , I wo n’t tell ) .
Maybe you ’ve been busy .
And then there ’s that darn job getting in the way again .
Whatever the reason for your lack of Earth Day preparedness , not to worry : here are 13 last - minute ways to start making a green statement today .
No planning necessary .
1 . Do n’t take a shower .
That ’s right , I said it .
I direct a fashionable establishment and I ’m not advocating forgoing hygiene for the crunchy side of the green fence .
But unless you worked out yesterday or feasted on raw garlic , you have my permission to skip the shower .
Wash your face and brush your teeth and enjoy that extra half - hour of free time by reading up on the latest in green living – right here , of course .
2. Eat raw .
Save time and energy by eating raw food today .
It ’s so much healthier for you , anyway .
Enjoy fruit , crisp veggies , and a fresh salad instead of baking up a big meal or ordering take - out .
Easy !
3 . At the Office ?
Turn off as many lights as possible without disturbing your colleagues or your eyesight , bring a sack lunch , and avoid single - use beverages today ( my personal Achilles ’ heel ) .
Bonus : these habits are easy to develop into a permanent green routine .
Now may also be a good day to talk to your boss about telecommuting one day a week to save gas and fuel your creativity .
4. Green Your Laptop .
Set your computer to sleep after 5 minutes , and shut it off when it ’s not in use ( this is the most eco- friendly option ) .
If it ’s not inappropriate , get your office mates to do likewise .
5. Edit Your Life .
Now ’s as good a time as any to pare down your possessions .
If you ’ve got old cell phones and gadgets , e-cycle them today instead of tossing them into the landfill - bound trash bin .
Use Freecycle or Craigslist to trade or give away items you do n’t need or want anymore .
6 . Call the pols .
The single best thing you can do is to wake up those politicians with a phone call .
It ’ll only take a minute !
Call 202-224-2131 and tell Congress to take real action against global warming .
7. Pick Up the Litter …
on your street .
Even the nicest neighborhoods manage to get trashed .
Do n’t wait for someone else to do it ( or an animal to suffer ) .
Put on some gloves , grab a bag and get to it .
You can clean your street in 30 minutes .
8. Take an Eco-Inventory of Your House .
With your favorite notebook in hand , go from room to room and note anything that can be improved .
For example , simply displaying your books instead of keeping them in the closet adds energy - saving insulation to your living room or study walls ( and makes you look smarter ) .
Are your light bulbs energy - efficient ?
Are drafts sealed ?
Do you have your electronics plugged into a surge strip which you can easily unplug on your way out the door to work ?
Do you have a ceiling fan and a thermostat timer ?
Start jotting !
9. 5 Minute Tire Fix .
It ’s best to avoid driving needlessly today ( or any day ) , but a quick trip down to the gas station to ensure your tires are properly inflated is a simple , sensible way to save gas every day .
10 . Plan Your Garden .
If you have n’t yet planted your vegetables and herbs , take today to plan .
Read Michael Pollan ’s New York Times piece , " Why Bother ? " to learn why planting a small backyard garden is perhaps the most important change you can make for the planet .
11 . Hang a Clothes Line .
Drying clothes with a little help from the sun is both fun and eco-friendly .
Today ’s the day to get started !
12 . Say " No Thanks " to Meat .
A vegetarian diet is n’t for everyone , but if you can skip meat at least one day a week – starting today – you can help
the planet .
13 . One Month to Green !

Things You Can Do
Image : coed
Well , today they ’re not , they seem to be plummeting .
Still they have been rising rapidly for years .
Paul Krugman surveys some views , click through to the Frankel post as well .
Yes I do think high and rising commodity prices have been a bubble — but not just a bubble — and no I do n’t think that low real interest rates are much of a factor .
( Recall Cowen ’s Third Law : " All propositions about real interest rates are wrong . " )
My basic explanation for rising commodity prices is simple .
Most commodities are produced under conditions of short - run rising costs , often quite steeply rising short - run costs .
Furthermore many production processes cannot do without these commodities in the short run .
Coal , copper , and the like are not always easily substitutable for a factory within the medium run .
( Furthermore until you are sure that the price increase is permanent , why re-gear at all ?
Why switch from copper plumbing to plastic plumbing , when price of copper might fall again ? )
Now China has become wealthy quite fast but the country did n’t become wealthy by producing more commodities .
That ’s Albert Hirschman ’s " unbalanced growth . "
So demand for most commodities has outstripped the supply , production can’t make up the difference in the short run , and commodity prices can rise sharply .
Do n’t forget that logistics and transport are a big part of the production process and so infrastructure often constrains the flow of supply .
In the long run price will adjust ( even if you believe we are near " peak oil " this is true for most commodities . )
People will substitute or find new sources of the commodity or find new ways of producing the commodity more efficiently .
Infrastructure improves .
But yes those adjustments can take ten years or more .
And in the meantime we have a commodity price boom and on top of that a bubble to make these items look even more expensive .
One final kicker : lots of commodities are produced by governments and / or their production is heavily controlled by governments , most of all oil .
Then supply adjustments will be especially slow and cumbersome .
Read this article about coal :
… 94 percent of India ’s coal mining is in the hands of government - owned companies .
The biggest , Coal India , produces four - fifths of the country ’s coal .
Because the government is worried about social unrest , the prices for coal and electricity are kept low .
See the problem ?
The bottom line :
The best long - run bet is still that there is nothing special about risk - adjusted rates of return on commodities .
That probably means falling real prices and falling real costs over time .
The Chinese demand aberration is a temporary blip superimposed on very consistent longer - run trends .
Raising taxes on the richest one percent appears to increase tax revenues without lowering economic growth .
Here 's Lane Kenworthy with the details ( this continues the discussion here and here ; there is also a graph showing effective versus actual taxes in the discussion of fairness that does not appear below ) :
Taxes at the Top , by Lane Kenworthy on Taxes :
For many progressives it is an article of faith that tax rates on the richest Americans should be higher than they currently are .
Why ?
One reason is that it would be fairer .
...
Some opponents of higher tax rates for the rich argue that fairness in taxation requires that everyone ’s income be taxed at the same rate .
Taxation should be proportional rather than progressive .
Not many people seem to share this view , however .
Most feel that because they can afford to , the richest should pay not only more dollars but also a larger share of their income .
A second rationale for higher taxes on the most well - to - do is that it would increase government revenues , which could be used to help improve opportunity and outcomes for those less fortunate .
Health care for all , a more generous Earned Income Tax Credit , and subsidized preschool and child care are among the many good ideas currently on the table .
The taxes paid by those at the top matter a great deal for government finances .
As of 2005 the top 1 % accounted for 28 % of federal government tax revenues .
That is n’t because they are taxed at an outlandish rate ; an effective tax rate of 30 - 40 % is hardly confiscatory .
Instead , it ’s because they get a very large share of the country ’s income — 18 % as of 2005 .
The following chart shows federal government tax revenues as a share of GDP by the effective tax rate on the top 1 % .
The data points represent each year for which data are available .
Although the correlation is far from perfect , tax rates on the richest are positively associated with the portion of GDP collected in taxes .
This is as we would expect .
It suggests that steeper tax rates at the top are likely to bring in more revenue .
Obscure and Ugly Perlisms in Ruby
Posted by Nick Sieger
So , it ’s well known that Ruby owes a debt to its predecessor Perl , although some ( maybe many ) question whether we should repay that debt or even go so far as to put Perl on trial and excise those elements which somehow haphazardly survived the generation gap .
It turns out the evidence is mixed .
Update : I use the word “ obscure ” in the title because , in my experience , they are obscure .
“ Ugly ” is pure opinion , but this is my blog , after all .
Exhibit A : BEGIN /END
Update : Yes , yes , this is an awk - ism , not a perlism , strictly speaking .
And I do n’t deny its usefulness for pure scripting tasks .
I just do n’t see its utility in a larger application .
END { puts " Bye ! " } puts " Processing ... " BEGIN { puts " One moment while I start your program " }
Output :
One moment while I start your program Processing ...
Bye !
Why would any sane Ruby programmer do this ?
Have you ever seen a use for BEGIN that is n’t met by simply executing code at the top level of the main program ?
Geez , BEGIN even has its own node in the AST !
And how about END ?
If you really need to hook into interpreter shutdown , just use Kernel#at_exit .
( In fact , Rubinius currently uses END simply as an alias for at_exit . )
Exhibit B : <> ( ARGF )
Thank goodness we did n’t get the diamond operator in Ruby , but we did get ARGF as a replacement .
Though obscure , it actually turns out to be useful .
Consider this program , which prepends copyright headers in - place ( thanks to another perlism , - i ) to every file mentioned on the command - line .
Any other creative uses of ARGF out there ?
Header = DATA . read ARGF .
each_line do | e | puts Header if ARGF .
pos - e . length == 0 puts e end
Exhibit C : The Flip - flop
This is a weird beast .
I did n’t even know of its existence until Charlie was complaining about having to compile it properly .
Apparently we have Perl to thank for this nonsense as well ( and , indirectly , sed ) .
With the exception of the sed -ism , I ’m not convinced it adds any value -- in fact the code usually ends up looking more verbose .
This program , when run with itself as an argument , prints out everything between BEGIN and END .
ARGF .
each_line do | line | if ( line =~ / ^# BEGIN /)..( line =~ / ^# END /) puts line end end
This snippet is a long - hand way to do 5.upto ( 10 ) { |i| puts i} .
i = 5 while ( i == 5 ) ...( i == 10 ) do puts i i += 1 end
Exhibit D : Output from defined ?
Not sure if this came from Perl .
The basic need for defined ? in a dynamic language is unquestionable .
Instead , I meant to highlight the fact that defined ?
returns a string value here , which is strange .
Constant = " Constant " @ivar = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] integer = 10 puts " const : #{defined ?( Constant ) } " puts " ivar : # {defined ?( @ivar ) } " puts " global : # {defined ? ( $ 0 ) } " puts " local : #{defined ?( integer ) } " puts " expr : #{defined ?( Constant + integer ) } "
Running this code produces :
const : constant ivar : instance - variable global : global - variable local : local - variable expr : method
Perl at least is sane enough to return true or false for its own defined operator .
But method ?
Looking at the source , I see also expression , local - variable ( in - block ) , assignment , class variable , true , false , and self .
But why would this output be useful ?
As if it is n’t already plainly obvious what is defined ? .
Any other obscure features in Ruby that you love to hate ?
The gunman entered the school 's dining room and opened fire
Attack scene
Witnesses said the gunman went into the library at the Mercaz Harav seminary in the city 's Kiryat Moshe quarter and opened fire .
The assailant , who Israeli police said was a resident of East Jerusalem , was shot dead by an Israeli army officer .
The attack is the worst of its kind in Israel for a number of years .
The White House has led international condemnation but the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called the attack " heroic " while not claiming responsibility .
When we got in ... we saw young , 15 - , 16 - year - old guys lying on the floor with their Bibles in their hands - all dead on the floor
Witness
In pictures : Seminary attack Witnesses describe carnage World reaction in quotes
However , the 15 - strong UN Security Council failed to agree on a resolution condemning the attack because of reservations from temporary member Libya , which sought to link it to Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip .
A previously unknown group called the " Jalil Freedom Battalions - the Martyrs of Imad Mughniyeh and Gaza " claims to have carried it out , according to Lebanese Hezbollah media .
The fact that the school is at the heart of the settler movement in the occupied West Bank may have been the reason why it was targeted , BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports .
Many of its students are on special courses that combine religious study with service in combat units in the Israeli army , he notes .
There will be an Israeli response to this attack , our Middle East editor adds - the question is how severe it will be .
' Horrific '
The gunman entered the library at the Mercaz Harav seminary on Thursday evening , where about 80 students were gathered , and fired an AK - 47 rifle for several minutes , witnesses say .
MERCAZ HARAV SEMINARY
Founded in 1924 by influential Rabbi Avraham Hacohen Kook Some 500 students enrolled in Talmudic study Students mainly high - school age and young adults Graduates serve as rabbis and rabbinical judges in Israel and Jewish settlements School has played a major role in ideology and theology of Israeli religious settlement movement Key figures linked to the school were strongly opposed to Israeli pull - out from Gaza
One of the students , Yitzhak Dadon , reportedly shot the gunman twice before he was finally killed by an off - duty Israeli army officer , who had gone to the school after hearing gunfire .
" I shot him twice in the head , " he told the Reuters news agency .
" He started to sway and then someone else with a rifle fired at him , and he died . "
Another man told the BBC that there had been " terrible scenes " inside the building afterwards .
" When we got in ... we saw young , 15 - , 16 - year - old guys lying on the floor with their Bibles in their hands - all dead ... " he said .
Jerusalem police commander Aharon Franco confirmed there had been only one gunman and said he had hidden his weapon in a cardboard box .
Imad Mughniyeh , a senior Hezbollah leader and military commander , was killed in a car bomb in Damascus on 12 February .
' Aimed at the heart '
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said that " terrorists [ were ] trying to destroy the chances of peace " but peace talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would continue .
DEADLY ATTACKS IN ISRAEL 4 Feb 2008 : One dies , Dimona suicide bombing 29 Apr 2007 : Three die , Eilat suicide bombing 17 Apr 2006 : Nine die , 40 wounded , suicide bombing near old bus station in Tel Aviv 30 Mar 2006 : Four die , Kedumim suicide bombing 29 Dec 2005 :
Thee die , suicide bombing near Tulkarm 5 Dec 2005 : Five die , Netanya suicide bombing 26 Oct 2005 : Six die , Hadera market suicide bombing 12 July 2005 : Two die , Netanya suicide bombing 25 Feb 2005 : Five die , 50 hurt , suicide bombing outside Tel Aviv nightclub 13 Jan 2005 : Six die , suicide bombing at Karni crossing
Mr Abbas condemned the attack in a statement saying he " condemns all attacks that target civilians , whether they are Palestinian or Israeli " .
US President George W Bush condemned the attack " in the strongest possible terms " and UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said news of the killings was " shocking " .
" They are an arrow aimed at the heart of the peace process so recently revived , " Mr Miliband added .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also criticised the " deliberate killing and injuring of civilians " in what he called a " savage attack " .
Hamas praise
In the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip , gunmen fired into the air after news broke about the attack .
This heroic attack in Jerusalem is a normal response to the crimes of the occupier and its murder of civilians
Sami Abu Zuhri
Hamas spokesman
A loudspeaker in Gaza City reportedly broadcast the message : " This is God 's vengeance "
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the group " blesses the heroic operation in Jerusalem " calling it as a " natural reaction " to Israeli attacks .
Last week , Israeli forces launched a raid into northern Gaza in which more than 120 Palestinians - including many civilians - were killed .
Shortly after the Jerusalem shooting , the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said four of its fighters had been killed in an Israeli air strike in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis .
Israel says the recent military offensive has been designed to stamp out frequent rocket fire by Palestinian militants .
Rocket attacks have hit deeper into southern Israel , reaching Ashkelon , the closest large city to the Gaza Strip .
Dr. Wafa Sultan has been forced to go into hiding with her family following a fatwa ( religious edict ) from an Islamic scholar , according to Omedia .
Sultan faces the fatwa following a recent debate on Al - Jazeera in which she challenged Egyptian Islamist Talat Rheim over Dutch cartoons of Mohammed , who Muslims revere as a prophet .
Sultan argued that Denmark had the right to print the cartoons .
Sultan joins a growing list of public critics of radical Islam facing death threats .
Her supporters have asked the American public to join them in writing to the embassy of Qatar , the country which sponsors Al - Jazeera , as well as to United States President George Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , asking them to defend Sultan ’s right to free speech and personal safety .
La hausse des prix à la consommation a accéléré au mois de mars , atteignant 3,2 % en glissement annuel ( par rapport à mars 2007 ) pour la première fois depuis le printemps 1992 .
Cette forte hausse , annoncée mardi 15 avril par l'Insee , va déclencher une augmentation du smic de 2,3 % au 1er mai .
Le gouvernement , qui avait retenu , dans le projet de loi de finances pour 2008 , une inflation de 1,6 % en moyenne annuelle , l'a révisée à 2,2 % .
Sensible dans l'ensemble de l'Union européenne ( UE ) , le regain d'inflation devrait relancer les polémiques sur l'érosion du pouvoir d'achat des ménages .
" Ne nous y trompons pas : ce débat ne doit pas détourner l'attention de l'opinion publique des vraies conséquences de l'accélération de l'inflation et de la redistribution à l'œuvre aujourd ' hui , plaide Mathilde Lemoine , directrice des études économiques et de la stratégie marchés d'HSBC France , à rebours des discours convenus sur les prix .
" En tant que telle , l'inflation n'est pas une mauvaise chose .
Elle met de l'huile dans les rouages .
Elle va permettre d'alléger le fardeau de la dette et du déficit publics en 2008 , d'entraîner les salaires , donc de redonner un certain pouvoir de négociation aux salariés et de transférer la richesse des épargnants vers les emprunteurs , des vieux vers les jeunes . "
L'économiste fait le point pour Le Monde sur les gagnants et les perdants de l'inflation .
A court terme , en 2008 , ce qu'elle appelle la " surprise d'inflation " ( +0,6 point ) n'est pas catastrophique pour le pouvoir d'achat des ménages et va permettre à l'État de réduire ses déficits et sa dette .
A long terme , la hausse des prix est nocive pour les consommateurs , l'épargne et l'investissement .
L'Etat soulagé à court terme .
Que serait la présidence française de l'UE sans l'inflation !
Grâce à elle , le gouvernement devrait tenir ses engagements de déficit public ( 2,5 % du produit intérieur brut ) .
Le produit de la TVA , assise sur les prix , va augmenter mécaniquement .
Or l'Etat tire près de la moitié de ses recettes fiscales de la TVA .
De ce fait , selon MmeLemoine , le surcroît d'inflation prévu par le gouvernement ( 0,6 point ) " pourrait permettre d'afficher une réduction de 0,1 point de PIB du déficit public et d'améliorer de 0,2 point de PIB la dette " .
Cet allégement du fardeau de la dette est temporaire .
A long terme , l'inflation s'accompagne sur les marchés financiers d'une hausse des taux d'intérêt , renchérissant pour l'Etat le coût du financement du déficit public .
Les salariés qui rient , les consommateurs qui pleurent .
L'inflation va tirer en 2008 les salaires vers le haut , procurant pendant quelques mois une bouffée d'air éphémère .
La loi prévoit une revalorisation automatique du smic en cours d'année si l'indice des prix à la consommation hors tabac dépasse 2 % .
Les salariés payés au smic vont bénéficier d'une augmentation de 2,3 % au 1er mai , une première depuis avril 1996 .
Or , selon la Dares , la direction statistique du ministère de l'emploi , " à l'horizon d'une année , une hausse du smic de 1 % se répercuterait quasi intégralement sur les salaires de base entre 1 et 1,1 smic et à hauteur de 0,5 % pour ceux situés entre 1,4 et 1,5 smic " .
Entre ces effets et la possible multiplication des revendications salariales , l'économiste d'HSBC France conclut à une " corrélation positive " de l'inflation sur les salaires .

WASHINGTON --
The Bush administration has given up its push for an international ban on sales of uranium - enrichment technology to nonnuclear states , a move that will complicate its nuclear diplomacy toward both Iran and India , and could open the way for a wave of new entrants into the enrichment club .
The concession was made under heavy pressure from Canada , which wants the right to build uranium - enrichment plants to export the lucrative enriched fuel for nuclear - power plants .
It marks an about - face for President Bush , who ...

Paramount Pictures has released the first two photos of Ray Park as Snake Eyes in the Stephen Sommers - directed G.I. Joe , coming to theaters on August 7 , 2009 .
“ He ’s the world ’s greatest ninja , but he ’s also next - generation .
He ’s not afraid to use a sword one second , and a split - second later he ’s pulling out his Glock , ” Sommers told USA Today .
“ His chief nemesis is arguably the world ’s other great ninja , Storm Shadow .
The two grew up together , were blood brothers and now are mortal enemies . ”
Sommers stressed that the movie is an origins story , so his challenge is to explain why the bad guy wears a metal mask , why Snake Eyes does n’t talk and other strange things kids took for granted .
“ For people who know nothing about it , it ’ll make sense , ” Sommers said .
“ And to people who love this stuff , it ’ll show where they all came from . ”
Adapted by Stuart Beattie , the action - adventure also stars Dennis Quaid , Channing Tatum , Sienna Miller , Rachel Nichols , Adewale Akinnuoye - Agbaje , Said Taghmaoui , Marlon Wayans , Joseph Gordon - Levitt , Arnold Vosloo and Christopher Eccleston .
From urban buildering to building jumping , Parkour and free running have increasingly hit the big time , being featured in action - packed mainstream movies and prime - time commercial spots .
Still , it ’s important to remember that these amazing arts of urban building jumping , climbing and running originated in offbeat locations and abandoned buildings .
These videos feature some of the more raw and original free runners who made this extreme urban sport what it is today .
Scroll to the end for some awesome medleys and remixes !
This Latvian Parkour video features a truly great rough - and - ragged multi-story abandonment .
It is well - scripted and timed – each sequence was clearly planned out in advance .
The camera pans cleanly to follow the action as this free runner braves precarious building edges and makes amazing jumps .
As the video progresses and the music changes the focus shifts from daring to stylish about midway through .
This Russian free runner would do Spider - Man proud .
He brings an excellent blend of power , speed and style and pulls off some amazing tricks .
Best of all : he makes it look easy , starting off with a mind - blowing flip - spin .
Sometimes the camera has a hard time keeping up and you get the feeling you ’re missing some of the best parts .
All the same this is one free running video definitely worth watching .
These Toronto free runners are almost like urban ninjas complete with flying kicks off of various urban furniture .
One of the nifty aspects of this particular video is that they do a lot of tricks in close sequence leaving the viewer wondering what would happen if one guy screwed up a jump in front of another .
All in all the splicing is a bit too forced but there are certainly some good tricks in here .
There are some rather ‘ cute ’ tricks too like jumping and floating back down with an umbrella .
While there are definitely a few extreme building - to - building jumps the emphasis in the above Parkour video is definitely style above all else .
There are a number of simple mid-air tricks that do n’t even involve buildings as well as some high leaps to the ground involving awesome twists and spins .
However , there are some good buildering and free climbing shots here as well .
If the video prior to the one above focuses on style then the above one is definitely about height , distance and control .
There is a lot to be learned here about landing and rolling out of a jump correctly in order to avoid serious pain and possible personal injury .
Some free runners find wonderful out - of - the - way parks , playgrounds and deserted buildings but this guy takes on the urban environment head on from statues and cars to bus stops .
The onlookers are clearly a bit shocked to see him running and climbing around but largely do n’t mind .
Parkour is traditionally a fairly male - dominated sport but there are some female free runners out there including this one .
Her tricks are n’t particularly outstanding but she has a good grasp on the basics and is worth including in this collection simply for the novelty and gender variety .
This video has a lot of stardard Parkour tricks caught on a conventional and shaky hand - held camera .
Still , there is one in particular that is worth watching for : a hand - hop across a picnic table .
One has to wonder : is this guy completely unafraid of getting the world ’s deepest worst sliver ?
The above Parkour medley video splices together some great scenes from a variety of free running videos from around the world ( including a few shown above ) .
By editing the speed and splicing in repeated frames you get a good taste of the range of styles out there in a few short minutes .
This medley really spans the spectrum of free running and Parkour approaches , styles and moves .
There is some distance jumping , some complex tricking and a lot of high - up on - building action .
Some scenes are slowed down , others are sped up and they range from individuals to sizable jumper groups .
" Believe it or not , I think we 're blessed , " she says .
" Trust me , no one wants to be in our shoes , and lots of people are just a sick husband away from where we are .
Introduction Ajaan Fuang Jotiko , my teacher , was born in 1915 to a small farming family in the province of Chanthaburi , near the Cambodian border of southeastern Thailand .
Orphaned at the age of eleven , he was raised in a series of monasteries and received ordination as a monk when he turned twenty .
As he began to study the monastic discipline , though , he realized that the monks of his monastery were not really serious about practicing the Buddha 's teachings , and he longed to find a teacher who would give him a training more in line with what he had read .
His chance came during his second year as a monk , when Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo , a member of the forest ascetic tradition founded by Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto , came to set up a meditation monastery in an old cemetery just outside of Chanthaburi .
Taken with Ajaan Lee 's teachings , Ajaan Fuang reordained in the sect to which Ajaan Lee belonged and joined him at his new monastery .
From that point onward , with few exceptions , he spent every Rains Retreat under Ajaan Lee 's guidance until the latter 's death in 1961 .
One of the exceptions was a five - year period he spent during World War II , meditating alone in the forests of northern Thailand .
Another was a six - year period in the early fifties when Ajaan Lee left Ajaan Fuang in charge of the Chanthaburi monastery and wandered about various parts of Thailand in preparation for finding a place to settle down near Bangkok .
When in 1957 Ajaan Lee founded Wat Asokaram , his new monastery near Bangkok , Ajaan Fuang joined him there , to help in what was to be the last major project of Ajaan Lee 's life .
After Ajaan Lee 's death , Ajaan Fuang was generally expected to become abbot at Wat Asokaram .
The monastery by that time , though , had grown into such a large , unwieldy community that he did not want the position .
So in 1965 , when the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand , in residence at Wat Makut Kasatriyaram ( The Temple of the King 's Crown ) in Bangkok , asked him to spend the Rains Retreat at his temple , to teach meditation to him and to any of the other monks at the temple who were interested , Ajaan Fuang jumped at the chance .
He spent a total of three Rains Retreats at Wat Makut , wandering about the countryside looking for solitude during the dry seasons .
Although he had immense respect for the Supreme Patriarch as an individual , he grew tired of the politicking he saw at the higher ecclesiastical levels and so began looking for a way out .
It came in 1968 , when a woman named Khun Nai Sombuun Ryangrit donated land to the Patriarch for a small monastery in a mountainous region near the coast of Rayong province , not far from Chanthaburi .
Ajaan Fuang volunteered to spend time at the new monastery , Wat Dhammasathit , until a permanent abbot could be found .
The monastery , though , was in a very poor area where the local people were not enthusiastic about the idea of a strict meditation monastery in their midst , so no one could be found to take on the position of abbot .
Thus , shortly before the Supreme Patriarch 's death in a car accident in 1971 , Ajaan Fuang accepted the position of abbot at Wat Dhammasathit himself .
It was soon after this that I first met him , in April of 1974 .
Wat Dhammasathit had the look of a summer camp down on its luck : three monks living in three small huts , a lean - to where they would eat their meals , a kitchen with room for a couple of nuns , and a small wooden structure on top of the hill — where I stayed — which had a view of the sea off to the south .
The land had been donated shortly after a fire had stripped it of all its vegetation , and the hillsides were covered mostly with cogon grass .
Yearly fires still swept through the area , preventing trees from taking hold , although the area on the mountain above the monastery was covered with a thick , malarial forest .
In spite of the poor conditions , Ajaan Fuang seemed to have a clear - eyed , down - to - earth wisdom that allowed him to transcend his surroundings — an inner peace , happiness , and stability that I envied and admired .
After spending a few months practicing meditation under his guidance , I returned to America and then found my way back to Thailand in the fall of 1976 to be ordained as a monk and to begin training under him in earnest .
In my absence , he had begun to develop a small but devoted following of lay meditators .
In early 1976 the new abbot of Wat Makut had invited him back to teach there on a regular basis , and for the rest of his life — until his death in 1986 — he split his time evenly between Bangkok and Rayong .
Most of his students came from the professional classes of Bangkok , people who were turning to meditation for spiritual strength and solace in the face of the fast - changing pressures of modern Thai urban society .
During my first years back in Rayong , the monastery was an incredibly quiet and secluded place , with only a handful of monks and almost no visitors .
Fire lanes had begun to hold the fires in check , and a new forest was developing .
The quiet atmosphere began to change , though , in the fall of 1979 , when construction began on a chedi at the top of the hill .
Because the chedi was being built almost entirely with volunteer labor , everyone was involved — monks , laypeople from Bangkok , and local villagers .
At first I resented the disruption of the monastery 's quiet routine , but I began to notice something interesting : People who never would have thought of meditating were happy to help with the weekend construction brigades ; during breaks in the work , when the regulars would go practice meditation with Ajaan Fuang , the newcomers would join in and soon they too would become regular meditators as well .
In the meantime , I began learning the important lesson of how to meditate in the midst of less than ideal conditions .
Ajaan Fuang himself told me that although he personally disliked construction work , there were people he had to help , and this was the only way he could get to them .
Soon after the chedi was finished in 1982 , work began on a large Buddha image that was to have an ordination hall in its base , and again , as work progressed on the image , more and more people who came to help with the work were drawn to meditation .
Ajaan Fuang 's health deteriorated steadily in his later years .
A mild skin condition he had developed during his stay at Wat Makut grew into a full - blown case of psoriasis , and no medicine — Western , Thai , or Chinese — could offer a cure .
Still , he maintained an exhausting teaching schedule , although he rarely gave sermons to large groups of people .
Instead , he preferred to teach on an individual basis .
His favorite way of getting people started in meditation was to meditate together with them , guiding them through the initial rough spots , and then have them meditate more and more on their own , making way for new beginners .
Even during his worst attacks of psoriasis , he would have time to instruct people on a personal basis .
As a result , his following — though relatively small compared to that of Ajaan Lee and other famous meditation teachers — was intensely loyal .
In May , 1986 , a few days after the Buddha image was completed , but before the ordination hall in its base was finished , Ajaan Fuang flew to Hong Kong to visit a student who had set up a meditation center there .
Suddenly , on the morning of May 14 , while he was sitting in meditation , he suffered a heart attack .
The student called an ambulance as soon as he realized what had happened , but Ajaan Fuang was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital .
Because he had requested a few years earlier that his body not be cremated , plans began immediately to build him a mausoleum .
I was given the task of assembling his biography and any tape - recorded talks that might be transcribed and published as a commemorative volume .
I found , to my amazement , that I knew more about his life than anyone else .
The people with whom he had lived when he was younger had either died or grown so old that their memories were failing them .
All of a sudden the anecdotes he had told me during my first years back with him — of his youth and his years with Ajaan Lee — became the substance of his biography .
How much I probably missed , given the fact that my abilities in Thai and familiarity with Thai culture were still developing , was disconcerting to think about .
Even more disconcerting was to discover how little of his teachings were left for posterity .
Ordinarily , he refused to let people tape - record his instructions , as he maintained that his teachings were intended for the people listening to put into practice right then and there , and might be wrong for other people at other stages in their practice .
The few tapes that were made came from simple , introductory talks that he gave to first - time visitors who had come to give a group donation to the monastery , or to people who were just getting started in meditation .
Nothing of a more advanced nature was on tape .
So after we printed the commemorative volume , I started a project of my own , writing down what I could remember of his teachings and interviewing his other students for similar material .
The interviewing took more than two years and involved a fair amount of editing to extract teachings that would be helpful for people in general and would work in a written format .
The result was a small book entitled , The Language of the Heart .
Then , shortly before I returned to the States to help start a monastery in California , another Ajaan Fuang tape was found , a sermon in which he was giving more advanced instructions to one of his students .
I transcribed it and arranged to have it printed as a small booklet named , Transcendent Discernment .
The book you are holding in your hand is drawn from these three books .
Most of the material comes from The Language of the Heart , although parts of that book had to be cut either because they referred to incidents peculiar to Thai culture , or because the puns and wordplay made them untranslatable .
Ajaan Fuang loved playing with language — his sense of humor was one of the first things that attracted me to him — and many of his memorable sayings were memorable for just that reason .
Unfortunately , most of these passages lose their impact on translation , and the explanations they would require might quickly become tedious , so I have omitted nearly all of them , leaving in a few — such as the " litter " story — to give a taste of his way with words .
In addition to the passages from The Language of the Heart , I have included almost all of Transcendent Discernment along with highlights from the commemorative volume .
Not everything is a straight translation from these books , for in some cases I have had to retell the anecdotes to make them more accessible to a Western reader .
I have been careful throughout , though , to translate the message of Ajaan Fuang 's own words as exactly as possible .
In putting this book together , I have had the opportunity to reflect on the student / teacher relationship as it exists in Thailand , and in Ajaan Fuang 's dealings with his disciples , both lay and ordained .
He provided an atmosphere of warmth and respect in which his students could discuss with him the particular problems of their lives and minds without being made to feel like patients or clients , but simply as fellow human beings to whom he was offering a solid reference point for their lives .
Since coming to the West , I find that this sort of relationship is sadly lacking among us and I hope that as Buddhism becomes established here , this sort of relationship will become established as well , for the sake of the mental and spiritual health of our society as a whole .
A group of Thai people once asked me what was the most amazing thing I had ever encountered in Ajaan Fuang , hoping that I would mention his mind - reading abilities or other supernatural powers .
Although there were those — his knowledge of my mind seemed uncanny —
I told them that what I found most amazing was his kindness and humanity :
In all our years together , he had never made me feel that I was a Westerner or that he was a Thai .
Our communication was always on a direct , person - to - person level that bypassed cultural differences .
I know that many of his other students , although they would not have phrased the issue quite this way , sensed the same quality in him .
I offer this book as a way of sharing some of what I learned from Ajaan Fuang , and dedicate it , with deepest respect , to his memory .
He once told me that if it had n't been for Ajaan Lee , he would never have known the brightness of life .
I owe the same debt to him .

Mind What You Say § Normally , Ajaan Fuang was a man of few words who spoke in response to circumstances :
If the circumstances warranted it , he could give long , detailed explanations .
If not , he 'd say only a word or two — or sometimes nothing at all .
He held by Ajaan Lee 's dictum : " If you 're going to teach the Dhamma to people , but they 're not intent on listening , or not ready for what you have to say , then no matter how fantastic the Dhamma you 're trying to teach , it still counts as idle chatter , because it does n't serve any purpose . " §
I was constantly amazed at his willingness — sometimes eagerness — to teach meditation even when he was ill .
He explained to me once , " If people are really intent on listening , I find that I 'm intent on teaching , and no matter how much I have to say , it does n't tire me out .
In fact , I usually end up with more energy than when I started .
But if they 're not intent on listening , then I get worn out after the second or third word . " §
" Before you say anything , ask yourself whether it 's necessary or not .
If it 's not , do n't say it .
This is the first step in training the mind — for if you can't have any control over your mouth , how can you expect to have any control over your mind ? " §
Sometimes his way of being kind was to be cross — although he had his own way of doing it .
He never raised his voice or used harsh language , but still his words could burn right into the heart .
Once I commented on this fact , and asked him , " Why is it that when your words hurt , they go right to the heart ? "
He answered , " That 's so you 'll remember .
If words do n't hit home with the person listening , they do n't hit home with the person speaking , either . " §
In being cross with his students , he'd take his cue from how earnest the student was .
The more earnest , the more critical he'd be , with the thought that this sort of student would use his words to best effect .
Once a lay student of his — who did n't understand this point — was helping to look after him when he was ill in Bangkok .
Even though she tried her best to attend to his needs , he was constantly criticizing her , to the point where she was thinking of leaving him .
It so happened , though , that another lay student came to visit , and Ajaan Fuang said in a passing remark to him , " When a teacher criticizes his students , it 's for one of two reasons : either to make them stay or to make them go . "
The first student , on overhearing this , suddenly understood , and so decided to stay .
§
A story that Ajaan Fuang liked to tell — with his own twist — was the Jataka tale of the turtle and the swans .
Once there were two swans who liked to stop by a certain pond every day for a drink of water .
As time passed , they struck up a friendship with a turtle who lived in the pond , and they started telling him about some of the many things they saw while flying around up in the air .
The turtle was fascinated with their stories , but after a while began to feel very depressed , because he knew he'd never have a chance to see the great wide world the way the swans did .
When he mentioned this to them , they said , " Why , that 's no problem at all .
We 'll find a way to take you up with us . "
So they got a stick .
The male swan took one end of the stick in his mouth , the female took the other end in hers , and they had the turtle hold on with its mouth to the middle .
When everything was ready , they took off .
As they flew up into the sky , the turtle got to see many , many things he had never dreamed about on the earth below , and was having the time of his life .
When they flew over a village , though , some children playing below saw them , and started shouting , " Look !
Swans carrying a turtle !
Swans carrying a turtle ! "
This spoiled everything for the turtle , until he thought of a smart retort : " No .
The turtle 's carrying the swans ! "
But as soon as he opened his mouth to say it , he fell straight to his death below .
The moral of the story : " Watch out for your mouth when you enter high places . " § " Litter " is Thai slang for idle chatter , and once Ajaan Fuang used the term to dramatic effect .
It happened one evening when he was teaching in Bangkok .
Three young women who were long - time friends happened to show up together at the building where he was teaching , but instead of joining the group that was already meditating , they found themselves an out - of - the - way corner to catch up on the latest gossip .
As they were busy talking , they did n't notice that Ajaan Fuang had gotten up to stretch his legs and was walking right past them , with an unlit cigarette in his mouth and a box of matches in his hand .
He stopped for a second , lit a match , and instead of lighting his cigarette , tossed the lit match into the middle of their group .
Immediately they jumped up , and one of them said , " Than Phaw !
Why did you do that ?
You just barely missed me ! "
" I saw a pile of litter there , " he answered , " and felt I should set fire to it . " §
One day Ajaan Fuang overheard two students talking , one of them asking a question and the other starting his answer with , " Well , it seems to me ... "
Immediately Ajaan Fuang cut him off : " If you do n't really know , say you do n't know , and leave it at that .
Why go spreading your ignorance around ? " §
" We each have two ears and one mouth — which shows that we should give more time to listening , and less to speaking . " §
" Whatever happens in the course of your meditation , do n't tell it to anyone except your teacher .
If you go telling other people , it 's bragging .
And is n't that a defilement ? " §
" When people advertise how good they are , they 're really advertising how stupid they are . " §
" If something 's really good , you do n't have to advertise . " §
Thailand has a number of monk magazines , somewhat like movie - star magazines , which print the life stories and teachings of famous and not - so - famous monks , nuns , and lay meditation teachers .
The life stories tend to be so heavily embellished with supernatural and miraculous events , though , that they are hard to take seriously .
From the occasional contact he had with the editors and reporters responsible for these magazines , Ajaan Fuang felt that , by and large , their primary aims were mercenary .
As he put it , " The great meditation teachers went into the wilds and put their lives on the line in order to find the Dhamma .
When they found it , they offered it free of charge on their return .
But these people sit in their air - conditioned offices , write down whatever comes into their heads , and then put it up for sale . "
As a result , he never cooperated with them when they tried to put him in their magazines .
Once a group of reporters from a magazine named People Beyond the World came to visit him , armed with cameras and tape recorders .
After paying their respects , they asked for his prawat , or personal history .
Now it so happens that the Thai word prawat can also mean police record , so Ajaan Fuang responded that he did n't have one , as he had never done anything wrong .
But the reporters were not easily discouraged .
If he did n't want to give his life story , they said , could he please at least teach them some Dhamma .
This is a request no monk can refuse , so Ajaan Fuang told them to close their eyes and meditate on the word buddho — awake .
They turned on their tape recorders and then sat in meditation , waiting for a Dhamma talk , and this was what they heard : " That 's today 's Dhamma : two words — bud - and dho .
Now if you can't keep these two words in mind , it would be a waste of time to teach you anything else . "
End of sermon .
When they realized that that was all , the reporters — looking very exasperated — gathered their cameras and tape recorders and left , never to bother him again .
Mind What You Eat §
" We human beings have long tongues , you know .
You sit around and suddenly your tongue flicks out to sea :
You want to eat seafood .
Then it flicks around the world :
You want to eat foreign cuisine .
You have to train your tongue and shrink it down to size . " §
" When you eat , keep your mind on your breath , and contemplate why you 're eating .
If you 're eating simply for the taste of the food , then what you eat can harm you . " §
After his trip to America , one of his students asked him if he had had a chance to eat pizza while he was there .
He mentioned that he had , and that it was very good .
This surprised one of his students who had gone along on the trip .
" You ate only two bites , " he said .
" We thought you did n't like it . "
" Two bites were enough to fill me up , " he answered .
" Why would you want me to eat more ? " §
Once a woman who had been studying with him for only a short while decided to prepare some food to donate to him .
Wanting to make sure it would be something he liked , she asked him straight out , " What kind of food do you like , Than Phaw ? "
His answer : " Food that 's within reach . "
§ It was a Friday evening , and a group of Ajaan Fuang 's students were riding in the back of a pickup truck on their way from Bangkok to Wat Dhammasathit .
Another student had sent a bushel of oranges along with them to donate to the monks at the wat , and after a while on the road one of the students decided that the oranges looked awfully good .
So he came up with the following argument : " We 're Than Phaw 's children , right ?
And he would n't want us to go hungry , right ?
So anyone who does n't have an orange is n't a child of Than Phaw . "
Some of the group were observing the eight precepts , which forbid eating food after noon , so they were able to slip through the net .
Everyone else , though , helped him or herself to the oranges , even though a few of them felt bad about eating food intended for the monks .
When they arrived at the wat , they told Ajaan Fuang what had happened , and he immediately lit into them , saying that anyone who takes food intended for monks and eats it before it has been given to the monks is going to be reborn as a hungry ghost in the next life .
This scared one woman in the group , who immediately responded , " But I only ate one section ! " Ajaan Fuang replied , " Well , if you 're going to be a hungry ghost , you might as well eat enough to fill yourself up while you can . "
§
During the Rains Retreat in 1977 a couple from the town of Rayong came out to the wat almost every evening to practice meditation .
The strange thing about them was that whatever happened in the course of their meditation would tend to happen to both of them at the same time .
On one occasion they both found that they could n't eat , because they were overcome by a sense of the filthiness of food .
This lasted for three or four days without their getting weak or hungry , so they began to wonder what stage they had reached in their meditation .
When they mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang on their next visit to the wat , he had them sit in meditation , and then told them .
" Okay , contemplate food to see what it 's made of .
Elements , right ?
And what 's your body made of ?
The very same elements .
The elements in your body need the elements in food in order to keep going .
So why get all worked up about the filthiness of food ?
Your body is even filthier .
When the Buddha teaches us to contemplate the filthiness of food , it 's so that we can get over our delusions about it — not so that we wo n't be able to eat . "
That ended their inability to eat food .
People Practicing the Dhamma §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students — a seamstress — was criticized by a customer : " You practice the Dhamma , do n't you ?
Then why are you so greedy , charging such high prices ?
People practicing the Dhamma should take only enough profit just to get by . "
Although she knew her prices were fair , she could n't think of a good answer , so the next time she saw Ajaan Fuang she told him what had happened .
He replied , " The next time they say that , tell them — ' Look , I 'm not practicing the Dhamma to be stupid . ' " §
When I first went to stay at Wat Dhammasathit , the B - 52's from Utapao Air Force Base could sometimes be heard high overhead in the wee hours of the morning , flying on their bombing missions into Cambodia .
Each time I heard them , I began to wonder what business I had meditating when there were so many injustices in the world that needed to be fought .
When I mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang , he said , " If you try to straighten out the world without really straightening yourself out first , your own inner goodness will eventually break down , and then where will you be ?
You wo n't be able to do anybody — yourself or anyone else — any good at all . " §
" As soon as we 're born , we 're sentenced to death — just that we do n't know when our turn will come .
So you can't be complacent .
Start right in and develop all your good qualities to the full while you still have the chance . " §
" If you want to be a good person , make sure you know where true goodness really lies .
Do n't just go through the motions of being good . " §
" We all want happiness , but for the most part we are n't interested in building the causes for happiness .
All we want are the results .
But if we do n't take an interest in the causes , how are the results going to come our way ? " §
When I first went to practice meditation with Ajaan Fuang , I asked him if people really were reborn after death .
He answered , " When you start out practicing , the Buddha asks you to believe in only one thing : karma .
As for things aside from that , whether or not you believe them is n't really important . " §
One year , shortly before the Rains Retreat — a time when people traditionally make resolutions to step up their practice of the Dhamma — one of Ajaan Fuang 's students approached him and said that she was thinking of observing the eight precepts during the Rains , but was afraid that going without the evening meal would leave her hungry .
He retorted : " The Buddha fasted until he did n't have any flesh at all — just skin and bones — so that he could discover the Dhamma to teach us , but here we can't even stand going without one single meal .
It 's because of this that we 're still swimming around in the cycle of birth and death . "
As a result , she resolved that she'd have to observe the eight precepts on each Buddhist sabbath — the full moon , the new moon , and the half - moon days — during the three months of the Rains .
And so she did .
At the end of the Rains she felt really proud of herself for having kept to her resolution , but on her next visit to Ajaan Fuang , before she was able to broach the topic at all , he commented , " You 're lucky , you know .
Your Rains Retreat has only twelve days .
Everyone else 's is three months . "
On hearing this she felt so embarrassed that she has observed the eight precepts every day throughout each Rains Retreat ever since .
§
Another student was meditating in Ajaan Fuang 's presence when — in a spasm of mindlessness — she slapped a mosquito that was biting her arm .
Ajaan Fuang commented : " You charge a high price for your blood , do n't you ?
The mosquito asks for a drop , and you take its life in exchange . " §
A young man was discussing the precepts with Ajaan Fuang and came to number five , against taking intoxicants : " The Buddha forbade alcohol because most people lose their mindfulness when they drink it , right ?
But if you drink mindfully it 's okay , is n't it , Than Phaw ? "
" If you were really mindful , " he answered , " you would n't drink it in the first place . " §
There seem to be more excuses for breaking the fifth precept than for any other .
One evening another student was conversing with Ajaan Fuang at the same time that a group of people were sitting around them in meditation .
" I ca n't observe the fifth precept , " he said , " because I 'm under a lot of group pressure .
When we have social occasions at work , and everyone else in the group is drinking , I have to drink along with them . "
Ajaan Fuang pointed to the people sitting around them and asked , " This group is n't asking you to drink .
Why do n't you give in to their group pressure instead ? " §
The seamstress saw her friends observing the eight precepts at Wat Dhammasathit , and so decided to try it herself .
But in the middle of the afternoon , as she was walking through the monastery , she passed a guava tree .
The guavas looked inviting , so she picked one and took a bite .
Ajaan Fuang happened to be standing not far away , and so he remarked , " Hey .
I thought you were going to observe the eight precepts .
What 's that in your mouth ? "
The seamstress realized in a jolt that she had broken her precepts , but Ajaan Fuang consoled her , " It 's not all that necessary to observe the eight precepts , but make sure you observe the one precept , okay ?
Do you know what the one precept is ? "
" No , Than Phaw .
What is it ? "
" Not doing any evil .
I want you to hold onto this one for life . " §
A woman came to Wat Dhammasathit to observe the precepts and meditate for a week , but by the end of the second day she told Ajaan Fuang that she had to return home , because she was afraid her family could n't get along without her .
He taught her to cut through her worries by saying , " When you come here , tell yourself that you 've died .
One way or another , your family will have to learn to fend for themselves . " §
On his first visit to Wat Dhammasathit , a middle - aged man was surprised to see an American monk .
He asked Ajaan Fuang , " How is it that Westerners can ordain ? " Ajaan Fuang 's answer : " Do n't Westerners have hearts ? " §
A Bangkok magazine once carried the serialized autobiography of a lay meditator who used his powers of concentration to treat diseases .
One installment mentioned how he had visited Ajaan Fuang , who had certified that he ( the layman ) had attained jhana .
This did n't sound like Ajaan Fuang 's style , but soon after the magazine came out , unusual numbers of people came to the wat under the impression that Ajaan Fuang , like the author of the autobiography , could treat illnesses through meditation .
One woman asked him if he treated kidney diseases , and he answered , " I treat only one kind of disease : diseases of the mind . " §
A student asked permission to keep a notebook of Ajaan Fuang 's teachings , but he refused , saying , " Is that the sort of person you are ? — always carrying food around in your pocket for fear there 'll be nothing to eat ? "
Then he explained : " If you jot everything down , you 'll feel it 's okay to forget what you 've written , because it 's all there in your notebook .
The end result is that all the Dhamma will be in your notebook , and none in your heart . " §
" The texts say that if you listen well , you 'll gain wisdom .
To listen well , your heart has to be quiet and still .
You listen with your heart , not just with your ears .
Once you 've listened , you have to put what you 've heard into practice right then and there .
That 's when you 'll reap the benefits .
If you do n't put it into practice , what you 've heard will never become real inside you . " §
Once , while the chedi at Wat Dhammasathit was being built , some of the students working on the chedi got into a serious argument .
One of them became so upset that she went to tell Ajaan Fuang , who was staying in Bangkok at the time .
When she finished her report , he asked her , " Do you know what gravel is ? "
Taken aback , she answered , " Yes . "
" Do you know what diamonds are ? " " Yes . "
" Then why do n't you gather the diamonds ?
What good do you get out of gathering gravel ? " §
Even in a Buddhist country like Thailand , some young people who practice the Dhamma find that their parents are against it , and feel that they should be spending their time in more practical ways .
Once the parents of the seamstress tried to put a stop to her visits to Wat Makut , and this got her very angry .
But when she told her feelings to Ajaan Fuang , he warned her , " You owe a huge debt to your parents , you know .
If you get angry with them , or yell at them , you 're stoking the fires of hell on your head , so watch out .
And remind yourself :
If you wanted parents who would encourage your practice , why did n't you choose to be born from somebody else ?
The fact that they 're your parents shows that you 've made past karma with them .
So just use up your old karma debts as they come .
There 's no need to create any more karma by getting into arguments . "
§
Channeling spirits has long been popular in Thailand , and even some people who practice the Dhamma also like to attend seances .
But Ajaan Fuang once said , " If you want results from your practice , you have to make up your mind that the Buddha is your one and only refuge .
Do n't go taking refuge in anything else . " §
" If you practice the Dhamma , you do n't have to be amazed by anyone else 's powers or abilities .
Whatever you do , say or think , let your heart take its stand on the principles of reason . " §
" The truth lies within you .
If you 're true in what you do , you 'll meet with the truth .
If you 're not , you 'll meet only with things that are fake and imitation . "
Merit §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students reports that the first time she met him , he asked her , " Where do you usually go to make merit ? "
She answered that she had helped sponsor a Buddha image at that temple and contributed to a crematorium at this temple , etc .
So he asked further : " Why have n't you made merit at your heart ? " §
Once Ajaan
Fuang had one of his students cut away some of the grass and weeds that were threatening to overgrow the monastery .
She did n't really want to do the work , though , and all the while as she was cutting away she kept asking herself , " What kind of karma did I do that I have to work so hard like this ? "
When she had finished , he told her , " Well , you got some merit , but not very much . "
" What ?
After all that work , I still did n't get very much ? "
" If you want your full measure of merit , the merit has to go all the way to your heart . " §
There 's another story involving grass .
One day Ajaan Fuang pointed out the overgrown grass near his hut and asked the same woman , " Do n't you want the grass at the corral gate ? "
" What do you mean , grass at the corral gate ? "
" The opportunity to make merit right nearby that everyone else overlooks .
That 's called ' grass at the corral gate . ' " §
Another time , Ajaan Fuang took some of his Bangkok students up the hill to clean the area around the chedi .
They found a large pile of trash that someone had thrown away up there , and one of the group complained , " How could anyone be so disrespectful as to do something like this ? "
But Ajaan Fuang told her , " Do n't criticize whoever did it .
If they had n't thrown the trash here , we would n't have the opportunity to earn the merit that comes from cleaning it up . " §
One day , after Ajaan Fuang 's name had appeared in a magazine article , a group of three men from Bangkok took a day off from work to drive to Rayong and pay their respects to him .
After bowing down and then chatting for a while , one of them said , " Our country still has monks who practice rightly and well so that we can ask to have a share of their paramis , is n't that true , Than Phaw ? "
" It 's true , " he answered , " but if we keep asking for a share of their paramis without developing any of our own , they 'll see that we 're simply beggars and they wo n't want to share with us any more . " §
A woman in the town of Samut Prakaan , just outside of Bangkok , sent word through one of Ajaan Fuang 's students that she 'd like to donate a large sum of money to help build the Buddha image at Wat Dhammasathit , but she wanted him to come to her home to give a blessing as she handed over the check .
He refused to go , saying , " If people want merit , they have to go looking for it .
They can't expect the merit to come looking for them . " §
Another woman once telephoned the main office at Wat Makut , saying that she was going to provide a meal for monks at her house and wanted to invite Ajaan Fuang to the meal because she had heard that he was a Noble Disciple .
When the invitation was conveyed to him , he refused it , saying , " Is her rice so special that only Noble Disciples can get to eat it ? " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students told him that she 'd like to do something special to make merit on her birthday .
He replied , " Why does it have to be on your birthday ?
Do you get less merit if you do it any other day ?
If you want to make merit , go ahead and do it on the day the thought occurs to you .
Do n't wait for your birthday , because your deathday may get to you first . " §
Referring to people who did n't like to meditate but were happy to help with the construction work at the wat , Ajaan Fuang once said , " Light merit does n't register with them , so you have to find some really heavy merit for them to make .
That 's the only way to keep them satisfied . " §
Shortly after the chedi was finished , a group of Ajaan Fuang 's students were sitting and admiring it , taking joy in all the merit in store for them because they had had a hand in building it .
Ajaan Fuang happened to walk by and overhear what they were saying , and so he commented , as if to no one in particular , " Do n't get attached to material things .
When you make merit , do n't get attached to the merit .
If you let yourself get carried away , thinking ' I built this chedi with my own hands , ' watch out .
If you happened to die right now , all you'd be able to think would be , ' This chedi is mine , it 's mine . '
Instead of being reborn in heaven with everyone else , you'd be reborn as a hungry ghost to guard over the chedi for a week or so because your heart was fixated on material things . " §
" If , when you do good , you get stuck on your goodness , you 'll never get free .
Wherever you 're stuck , that 's where there 's becoming and birth . " §
There is an old tradition in Buddhism — based on the Apadana tales — that whenever you make a gift to the religion or perform some other meritorious deed , you should dedicate the merit of the deed to a particular goal .
There were times when Ajaan Fuang would tell his students to make similar dedications every time they meditated , although the dedication he 'd recommend would depend on the individual .
Sometimes he 'd recommend the dedication King Asoka made at the end of his life : " In my future lives may I have sovereignty over the mind . "
Other times he 'd say , " There 's no need to make any long , drawn - out dedications .
Tell yourself :
If I have to be reborn , may I always encounter the Buddha 's teachings . "
But it was n't always the case that he would recommend such dedications .
Once a woman told him that when she made merit she could n't think of any particular goal to dedicate the merit towards .
He told her , " If the mind is full , there 's no need to make any dedication if you do n't want to .
It 's like eating .
Whether or not you express a wish to get full , if you keep on eating , there 's no way you can help but get full . "
Student / Teacher §
" Whatever you do , always think of your teacher .
If you forget your teacher , you 're cutting yourself off at the root . " §
" A person who goes from teacher to teacher does n't really have any teachers at all . " §
On occasion people would present Ajaan Fuang with amulets , and he would hand them out among his students — but only rarely among those who were especially close to him .
One day a monk who had lived several years with him could n't help but complain , " Why is it that when you get good amulets , you never give any to me , and always to everybody else ? "
Ajaan Fuang replied , " I 've already given you lots of things better than that .
Why do n't you accept them ? " §
" Meditators who live close to their teacher , but who do n't understand him , are like a spoon in a pot of curry :
It 'll never know how sweet , sour , salty , rich or hot the curry is . " § Ajaan Fuang 's analogy for students who always have to ask their teachers for advice on how to handle even minor problems in everyday life : " They 're just like baby puppies .
As soon as they defecate they have to run to their mother to have her lick them off .
They 'll never grow up on their own . " §
" Students who get stuck on their teachers are like gnats .
No matter how much you chase them away , they keep coming back and wo n't leave you alone . " §
" If a teacher praises a student to his face , it 's a sign that that 's as far as the student will go — he probably wo n't be able to practice to any greater heights in this lifetime .
The reason the teacher praises him is so that he 'll be able to take pride in the fact that at least he 's made it this far .
His heart will have something good to hold on to when he needs it at death . " §
Many of Ajaan Fuang 's students were convinced that he was able to read their minds , because time after time he would broach topics that happened to be going through their heads or weighing down their hearts at the moment .
I myself had many experiences like this , and many were reported to me while I was compiling this book .
In most cases of this sort , though , what he had to say had special meaning only for those directly involved , and so I 'll ask to pass over them here .
But there are two cases I 'd like to mention , since they strike me as being useful for all who practice the Dhamma .
Once , one of his students — a young man — took the bus from Bangkok to Rayong to help work on the chedi .
He got off at the mouth of the road leading to the wat , but did n't feel like walking the six kilometers it would take to get there , so he sat at the noodle stand by the intersection and said to himself — as a challenge to Ajaan Fuang —
" If Than Phaw is really something special , may a car come by and give me a lift to the wat . "
One hour passed , two , three , and not a single car or truck turned into the road , so he finally had to walk the distance on foot .
When he arrived at the wat , he went to Ajaan Fuang 's hut to pay his respects , but as soon as Ajaan Fuang saw him approach , he got up , entered his room and closed the door .
This shook the student a little , but still he bowed down in front of the closed door .
The moment he finished , Ajaan Fuang opened the door a crack and said , " Look .
I did n't ask for you to come here .
You came of your own free will . "
Another time , after the chedi was finished , the same young man was sitting in meditation at the chedi , in hopes that a voice would whisper the winning number of the next lottery in his ear .
What he heard , though , was the sound of Ajaan Fuang actually walking past and saying , as if to no one in particular , " Exactly what are you taking as your refuge ? "
Living in the World § " Ajaan Mun once said , ' People are all alike , but not at all alike , but in the final analysis , all alike . '
You have to think about this for a good while before you can understand what he was getting at . " §
" If you want to judge other people , judge them by their intentions . " §
" When you want to teach other people to be good , you have to see how far their goodness can go .
If you try to make them better than they can be , you 're the one who 's being stupid . " §
" Nothing comes from focusing on the faults of others .
You can get more done by looking at your own faults instead . " §
" How good or bad other people are is their own business .
Focus on your own business instead . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students complained to him about all the problems she was facing at work .
She wanted to quit and live quietly by herself , but circumstances would n't allow it , because she had to provide for her mother .
Ajaan Fuang told her , " If you have to live with these things , then find out how to live in a way that rises above them .
That 's the only way you 'll be able to survive . " §
Advice for a student who was letting the pressure at work get her down : " When you do a job , do n't let the job do you . " §
Another one of Ajaan Fuang 's students was having serious problems , both at home and in her work , so he appealed to her fighting spirit : " Anyone who 's a real , live person will have to meet up with real , live problems in life . " §
" When you meet with obstacles , you have to put up a fight .
If you give up easily , you 'll end up giving up all your life long . " §
" Tell yourself you 're made out of heartwood , and not out of sapwood . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students — a young nurse — had to put up with being the brunt of a lot of gossip at work .
At first she tried to ignore it , but as it happened more and more often , her patience began to wear thin .
One day , when the gossip was really getting to her , she went to meditate with Ajaan Fuang at Wat Makut .
While meditating , she saw a vision of herself repeating back , back , back to infinity , as if she were caught between two parallel mirrors .
The thought occurred to her that in her many previous lives she had probably had to endure an untold amount of the same sort of gossip , and this made her even more fed up with her situation .
So when she left meditation she told Ajaan Fuang of how tired she was of being gossiped about .
He tried to console her , saying , " This sort of thing is part and parcel of the world , you know .
Where there 's praise , there also has to be criticism and gossip .
When you know this , why let yourself get involved ? "
Her mood was so strong , though , that she argued with him , " I 'm not getting involved with them , Than Phaw .
They come and get involved with me ! "
So he turned the tables on her : " Then why do n't you ask yourself — who asked you to butt in and be born here in the first place ? " §
" If they say you 're no good , remind yourself that their words go only as far as their lips .
They 've never reached out and touched you at all . " §
" Other people criticize us and then forget all about it , but we take it and keep thinking about it .
It 's as if they spit out some food and we pick it up and eat it .
When that 's the case , who 's being stupid ? " §
" Pretend you have stones weighing down your ears , so that you do n't get blown away by everything you hear said . " §
One day Ajaan Fuang asked , as if out of the blue , " If your clothing fell down into a cesspool , would you pick it back up again ? "
The woman he asked had no idea what he was getting at , but knew that if she was n't careful about answering his questions , she 'd come out looking like a fool , so she hedged her answer : " It depends .
If it was my only set of clothing , I 'd have to pick it up .
But if I had other sets , I 'd probably let it go .
What are you getting at , Than Phaw ? "
" If you like to hear bad things about other people , then even though you have no part in the bad karma of their acts , you still pick up some of the stench . " §
If any of his students were bearing a grudge about something , he would tell them : " You can't even sacrifice something as minor as this ?
Think of it as making a gift .
Remember how many valuable things the Buddha sacrificed during his life as Prince Vessantara , and then ask yourself , ' This anger of mine has no value at all .
Why can't I sacrifice it , too ? ' " §
" Think first before you act .
Do n't be the sort of person who acts first and then has to think about it afterwards . " §
" Beware of fall - in - the - well kindness : the cases where you want to help other people , but instead of your pulling them up , they pull you down . " §
" When people say something is good , it 's their idea of good .
But is it always what 's really good for you ? " §
" If people hate you , that 's when you 're let off the hook .
You can come and go as you like without having to worry about whether or not they 'll miss you or get upset at your going .
And you do n't have to bring any presents for them when you come back .
You 're free to do as you like . " §
" Trying to win out over other people brings nothing but animosity and bad karma .
It 's better to win out over yourself . " §
" Whatever you lose , let it be lost , but do n't ever lose heart . " §
" If they take what 's yours , tell yourself that you 're making it a gift .
Otherwise there will be no end to the animosity . " §
" Their taking what 's yours is better than your taking what 's theirs . " §
" If it 's really yours , it 'll have to stay with you , no matter what .
If it 's not really yours , why get all worked up about it ? " §
" There 's nothing wrong with being poor on the outside , but make sure you 're not poor on the inside .
Make yourself rich in generosity , virtue , and meditation — the treasures of the mind . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students complained to him , " I look at other people , and they seem to have such an easy life .
Why is life so hard on me ? "
His answer : " Your ' hard life ' is ten , twenty times ' the good life ' for a lot of people .
Why do n't you look at the people who have a harder time than you do ? " §
Sometimes when any of his students were facing hardships in life , Ajaan Fuang would teach them to remind themselves : " How can I blame anyone else ?
Nobody ever hired me to be born .
I came of my own free will . " §
" Everything that happens has its lifespan .
It wo n't last forever .
When its lifespan is up , it 'll go away on its own . " §
" To have a partner in life is to suffer .
To have a good partner is really to suffer , because of all the attachment . " §
" Sensual pleasure is like a drug :
One taste and you get addicted .
They say that with heroin it's hard to break the habit , but this is even worse .
It goes deep , right into the bone .
It 's what made us get born in the first place , and has kept us circling through birth and death for aeons and aeons .
There 's no medicine you can take to break the habit , to wash it out of your system , aside from the medicine of the Buddha 's teachings . " §
" When we see Hindus worshiping Siva lingas it looks strange to us , but actually everyone in the world worships the Siva linga — i.e. , they worship sex , simply that the Hindus are the only ones who are open about it .
Sex is the creator of the world .
The reason we 're all born is because we worship the Siva linga in our hearts . " §
Once , when one of Ajaan Fuang 's students was being pressured by her parents to look for a husband so that she could settle down and have children , she asked him , " Is it true what they say , that a woman gains a lot of merit in having a child , in that she gives someone else the chance to be born ? "
" If that were true , " he answered her , " then dogs would get gobs of merit , because they give birth to whole litters at a time . " §
He also told her , " Getting married is no way to escape suffering .
Actually , all you do is pile more suffering on yourself .
The Buddha taught that the five khandhas are a heavy burden , but if you get married , all of a sudden you have ten to worry about , and then fifteen , and then twenty ... " §
" You have to be your own refuge .
If you 're the sort that has to take refuge in other people , then you 'll have to see things the same way they do , which means you have to be stupid the same way they are .
So pull yourself out of all that , and take a good look at yourself until things are clear within you . " §
" You may think , 'my child , my child , ' but is it really yours ?
Even your own body is n't really yours . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students , when she was suffering a serious liver disease , dreamed that she had died and gone to heaven .
She took this as a bad omen and so went to Wat Makut to tell her dream to Ajaan Fuang .
He tried to console her , saying that it was really a good omen in disguise .
If she survived the disease , she 'd probably get a promotion at work .
If she did n't , she'd be reborn in good circumstances .
As soon as he said this , though , she got very upset : " But I 'm not ready to die ! " " Look , " he told her , " when the time comes to go , you have to be willing to go .
Life is n't a rubber band you can stretch out or shrink as you like . " §
" If there are any sensual pleasures you really hunger for , it 's a sign you enjoyed them before in a previous life .
That 's why you miss them so much this time around .
If you think about this long enough , it should be enough to make you dispassionate and dismayed . "
The Celibate Life § " Some people say that monks do n't do any work , but actually the work of abandoning your defilements is the most difficult work in the world .
The work of the everyday world has its days off , but our work does n't have any time off at all .
It 's something you have to do 24 hours a day .
Sometimes you may feel you 're not up to it , but still you have to do it .
If you do n't , who 's going to do it for you ?
It 's your duty , and nobody else 's .
If you do n't do it , what are you living off the donations of other people for ? " §
" Whatever work you 're doing , keep an eye on your mind .
If you see that it 's going off the path , stop whatever you 're doing and focus all your attention on it .
The work of looking after your mind should always come first . " §
" The Buddha 's Dhamma is akaliko — timeless .
The reason we have n't reached it yet is because we have lots of times : time for this , time for that , time to work , time to rest , time to eat , time to sleep ...
Our whole life turns into times , and as a result they do n't give us a chance to see the truth clearly within ourselves .
So we have to make our practice timeless .
That 's when the truth will appear in our hearts . "
§
Ajaan Fuang was very meticulous about keeping things clean and in their place , and taught his students to be meticulous too , for that was the way he was taught by his teachers , and he knew that he had benefitted from it .
In his words , " If you can't master obvious things like this , how are you going to master the subtle things , like the mind ? " §
The monk who attended to his needs — cleaning his hut , boiling the water for his bath , looking after him when he was sick , etc. — had to be very observant , for Ajaan Fuang used the teacher - student relationship as an opportunity to teach by example .
Instead of explaining where things should be placed or when certain duties should be done , he left it up to the student to observe for himself .
If he caught on , Ajaan Fuang would n't say anything .
If he did n't , Ajaan Fuang would give him a dressing down — but still would n't explain what was wrong .
It was up to the student to figure things out for himself .
As Ajaan Fuang said , " If it gets to the point where I have to tell you , it shows that we 're still strangers . " §
One evening , one of the monks at Wat Dhammasathit saw Ajaan Fuang working alone , picking up scraps of lumber around the chedi construction site and putting them in order .
The monk ran down to help him , and after a while asked him , " Than Phaw , this sort of work is n't something you should be doing alone .
There are lots of other people .
Why do n't you get them to help ? "
" I am getting other people to help , " Ajaan Fuang answered as he continued to pick up pieces of wood .
" Who ? " the monk asked as he looked around and saw no one else .
" You . " §
When I returned to Thailand in 1976 to be ordained , Ajaan Fuang gave me two warnings : 1 ) " Being a meditator is n't simply a matter of sitting with your eyes closed .
You have to be sharp at everything you do . "
2 ) " If you want to learn , you have to think like a thief and figure out how to steal your knowledge .
What this means is that you can't just wait for the teacher to explain everything .
You have to notice for yourself what he does , and why — for everything he does has its reason . " §
The relationship of a monk to his supporters is something of a balancing act .
One of Ajaan Fuang 's favorite reminders to his monk disciples was , " Remember , nobody 's hired you to become a monk .
You have n't ordained to become anybody 's servant . "
But if a monk complained that the monastery attendants were n't doing as they were told , he 'd say , " Did you ordain to have other people wait on you ? " §
" Our life depends on the support of others , so do n't do anything that would weigh them down . " §
" Monks who eat the food that other people donate , but then do n't practice , can expect to be reborn as water buffaloes next time around , to till the fields and work off their debts . " §
" Do n't think that the small disciplinary rules are n't important .
As Ajaan Mun once said , logs have never gotten into people 's eyes , but fine sawdust can — and it can blind you . "
§
Western women are often upset when they learn that monks are n't allowed to touch them , and they usually take it as a sign that Buddhism discriminates against women .
But as Ajaan Fuang explained it , " The reason the Buddha did n't allow monks to touch women is not that there 's anything wrong with women .
It 's because there 's something wrong with the monks :
They still have mental defilements , which is why they have to be kept under control . " §
For anyone who tries to follow the celibate life , the opposite sex is the biggest temptation to leave the path .
If Ajaan Fuang was teaching monks , he 'd say , " Women are like vines .
At first they seem so weak and soft , but if you let them grow on you , they curl up around you until they have you all tied up and finally bring you down . "
When teaching nuns , he 'd warn them about men .
Once a nun was thinking of disrobing and returning home , knowing that her father would arrange a marriage for her .
She asked Ajaan Fuang for advice , and he told her , " Ask yourself .
Do you want to live inside the noose or out ? "
As a result , she decided she 'd rather stay out . §
" If you find yourself thinking about sex , run your hand over your head to remind yourself of who you are . " § Ajaan Fuang had many stories to tell about his times with Ajaan Lee .
One of my favorites was of the time a large group of Ajaan Lee 's Bangkok students arranged to go with him on a meditation trip into the forest .
They agreed to meet at Hua Lampong , the main train station in Bangkok , and take the train north to Lopburi .
When the group assembled at the station , though , it turned out that many of them had each brought along at least two large suitcases of " necessities " for the trip , and even many of the monks from Bangkok monasteries had brought along large loads .
On seeing this , Ajaan Lee said nothing , but simply set out walking north along the railroad tracks .
Since he was walking , everyone had to walk , although it was n't long before the members of the group most burdened down began complaining , " Than Phaw , why are you making us walk ?
We 've got so much heavy stuff to carry ! "
At first Ajaan Lee said nothing , but finally told them , as he kept on walking , " If it 's heavy , then why burden yourself with it ? "
It took a few moments for his message to sink in , but soon the different members of the group had stopped to open their bags and throw everything unessential into the lotus ponds that lined either side of the railroad tracks .
When they reached the next train station , Ajaan Lee saw that they had trimmed down their belongings enough that he could let them take the next train north .

" When you live in a monastery , pretend that you 're living alone :
What this means is that once you 've finished with the group activities — the meal , the chanting , the chores , and so on — you do n't have to get involved with anyone .
Go back to your hut and meditate .
" When you live alone , pretend that you 're in a monastery : Set up a schedule and stick to it . " §
When I went to Wat Asokaram — a very large monastery — for my first Rains Retreat , Ajaan Fuang told me , " If they ask you questions in Thai , answer in English .
If they ask in English , answer in Thai .
After a while they 'll get tired to talking to you , and will leave you alone to meditate . " §
" It 's good to live in a monastery where not everyone is serious about the practice , because it teaches you to depend on yourself .
If you lived only with people who were serious meditators , you 'd get so that you would n't be able to survive anywhere else . " §
" We keep disagreeable people around the monastery as a way of testing to see if our defilements really are all gone . " §
" The purpose of adhering to the ascetic practices is to wear down your defilements .
If you adhere to them with the thought of impressing other people , you 'd do better not to adhere to them at all . " §
On fasting as an aid to meditation : " For some people it works well , for others it works just the opposite — the more they fast , the stronger their defilements get .
It 's not the case that when you starve the body you starve the defilements , because defilements do n't come from the body .
They come from the mind . " §
" There 's a passage where the Buddha asks , ' Days and nights pass by , pass by .
What are you doing right now ? '
So what answer do you have for him ? " §
" If you go teaching others before your own practice is up to standard , you do more harm than good . " §
" Training a meditator is like training a boxer :
You pull your punches and do n't hit him any harder than he can take .
But when he comes back at you , he gives it everything he 's got . " §
The first time I was going to give a sermon , Ajaan Fuang told me : " Pretend you have a sword in your hand .
If any people in the audience think critical thoughts of you , cut off their heads . " §
When I first went to Wat Dhammasathit , the trip from Bangkok was an all - day affair , since the roads were much worse and more roundabout than now .
One evening a woman rented a cab and traveled all the way from Bangkok to get Ajaan Fuang 's advice on the problems she was having in her family , and after a couple of hours of consultation she took the cab all the way back .
After she left , he said to me , " There 's one good thing about living way out here :
If we were living near Bangkok , people with a lot of free time on their hands and no idea of how to spend it would come and waste our time chatting all day .
But here , when people make the effort to come out , it shows that they really want our help .
And no matter how many hours it takes to talk things over with them , it 's no waste of time at all . " §
" When people come to see me , I have them sit and meditate first so that they know how to make their minds quiet .
Only then will I let them bring up any other problems they may want to talk about .
If you try discussing things with them when their minds are n't quiet , there 's no way they 'll understand . " §
" If people get it into their heads that they 're enlightened when they are n't , then you should n't waste any breath on trying to straighten them out .
If they do n't have faith in you 100 % , then the more you try to reason with them , the more they 'll get set in their opinions .
If they do have faith in you , then all it takes is one sentence or two and they 'll come to their senses . " §
Once the father of one of the monks living with Ajaan Fuang wrote his son a letter asking him to disrobe , return home , continue his studies , get a job , start a family , and have a normal , happy life like everyone else in the world .
The monk mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang , who said , " He says his kind of happiness is something special , but look at it — what kind of happiness is it , really ?
Just the same old smelly stuff you left when you ordained .
Is n't there any happiness better than that ? "
Meditation §
Many were the times when people would tell Ajaan Fuang that — with all the work and responsibilities in their lives — they had no time to meditate .
And many were the times he 'd respond , " And you think you 'll have time after you 're dead ? " §
" All you have to study is the meditation - word , buddho .
As for any other fields you might study , they never come to an end , and can't take you beyond suffering .
But once you 're come to the end of buddho , that 's when you 'll come to true happiness . " §
" When the mind 's not quiet — that 's when its poor and burdened with difficulties .
It takes molehills and turns them into mountains .
But when the mind is quiet , there 's no suffering , because there 's nothing at all .
No mountains at all .
When there 's a lot to the mind , it 's simply a lot of defilement , making it suffer . " §
" If you 're single - minded about whatever you think of doing , you 're sure to succeed . " §
" When you 're thinking buddho you do n't have to wonder about whether or not you 'll do well in your meditation .
If you put your mind to it , you 're sure to do well .
The things that come to disturb you are simply the forces of temptation , come to put on a play .
Whatever the play , all you have to do is watch — you do n't have to get on stage with them . " §
" What 's really essential is that you bring your views in line with the truth .
Once your views are right , the mind will immediately come to rest .
If your views are wrong , everything is immediately wrong .
All the things you need for the practice — the breath , the mind — are already there .
So try to bring your views in line with the breath , and you wo n't have to use a lot of force in your meditation .
The mind will settle down and come to rest right away . " §
" The mind is like a king .
Its moods are like his ministers .
Do n't be a king who 's easily swayed by his court . " §
A group of laypeople who had studied the Abhidhamma together came to Ajaan Fuang to try out his version of mental training , but when he told them to sit , close their eyes , and focus on the breath , they immediately backed off , saying that they did n't want to practice concentration , for fear that they'd get stuck on jhana and end up being reborn in the Brahma worlds .
He responded , " What 's there to be afraid of ?
Even non-returners are reborn in the Brahma worlds .
At any rate , being reborn in the Brahma worlds is better than being reborn as a dog . " §
When Ajaan Fuang taught meditation , he did n't like to map things out in advance .
As soon as he had explained the beginning steps , he'd have the student start sitting right in his presence , and then take the steps back home to work on there .
If anything came up in the course of the practice , he 'd explain how to deal with it and then go on to the next step .
Once a layman who had known more than his share of meditation teachers came to discuss the Dhamma with Ajaan Fuang , asking him many questions of an advanced nature as a way of testing his level of attainment .
Ajaan Fuang asked him in return , " Have you had these experiences in your own meditation yet ? "
" No , not yet . "
" Then in that case I 'd rather not discuss them , because if we discuss them when they 're not yet a reality for you , they 'll just be theories , and not the real Dhamma . " §
One meditator noticed that his practice under Ajaan Fuang was making quick progress , and so he asked what the next step would be .
" I 'm not going to tell you , " Ajaan Fuang said .
" Otherwise you 'll become the sort of amazing marvel who knows everything before he meets with it , and masters everything before he 's tried his hand .
Just keep practicing and you 'll find out on your own . " §
" You can't plan the way your practice is going to go .
The mind has its own steps and stages , and you have to let the practice follow in line with them .
That 's the only way you 'll get genuine results .
Otherwise you 'll turn into a half - baked arahant . " §
" Do n't make a journal of your meditation experiences .
If you do , you 'll start meditating in order to have this or that thing happen , so that you can write it down in your journal .
And as a result , you 'll end up with nothing but the things you 've fabricated . " §
Some people are afraid to meditate too seriously , for fear that they 'll go crazy , but as Ajaan Fuang once said , " You have to be crazy about meditation if you want to meditate well .
And as for whatever problems come up , there are always ways to solve them .
What 's really scary is if you do n't meditate enough for the problems to come out in the open in the first place . " §
" Other people can teach you only the outer skin , but as for what lies deeper inside , only you can lay down the law for yourself .
You have to draw the line , being mindful , keeping track of what you do at all times .
It 's like having a teacher following you around , in public and in private , keeping watch over you , telling you what to do and what not to do , making sure that you stay in line .
If you do n't have this sort of teacher inside you , the mind is bound to stray off the path and get into mischief , shoplifting all over town . " §
" Persistence comes from conviction , discernment from being mindful . " §
" Persistence in the practice is a matter of the mind , and not of your posture .
In other words , whatever you do , keep your mindfulness constant and do n't let it lapse .
No matter what your activity , make sure the mind sticks with its meditation work . " §
" When you start out sitting in meditation , it takes a long time for the mind to settle down , but as soon as the session is over you get right up and throw it away .
It 's like climbing a ladder slowly , step by step , to the second floor , and then jumping out the window . " §
A woman army officer sat in meditation with Ajaan Fuang at Wat Makut until it seemed that her mind was especially blissful and bright .
But when she returned home , instead of trying to maintain that state of mind , she sat around listening to a friend 's woes until she herself started feeling depressed , too .
A few days later she returned to Wat Makut and told Ajaan Fuang what had happened .
He responded , " You took gold and traded it in for excrement . " §
Another student disappeared for several months , and on her return told Ajaan Fuang , " The reason I did n't show up is that my boss sent me to night school for a semester , so I did n't have any time to meditate at all .
But now that the course is over , I do n't want to do anything but meditate — no work , no study , just let the mind be still . "
She thought he'd be pleased to hear how intent she still was on meditating , but he disappointed her .
" So you do n't want to work — that 's a defilement , is n't it ?
Whoever said that people can't work and meditate at the same time ? " §
" Meditating is n't a matter of making the mind empty , you know .
The mind has to have work to do .
If you make it empty , then anything — good or bad — can pop into it .
It 's like leaving the front door to your home open .
Anything at all can come strolling right in . " §
A young nurse practiced meditation with Ajaan Fuang several days running , and finally asked him one day , " Why was n't today 's session as good as yesterday's ? "
He answered : " Meditating is like wearing clothes .
Today you wear white , tomorrow red , yellow , blue , whatever .
You have to keep changing .
You can't wear the same set of clothes all the time .
So whatever color you 're wearing , just be aware of it .
Do n't get depressed or excited about it . " §
A few months later the same nurse was sitting in meditation when a sense of peace and clarity in her mind became so intense that she felt she would never have a bad mood infiltrate her mind again .
But sure enough , bad moods eventually came back as before .
When she mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang , he said , " Looking after the mind is like raising a child .
There will have to be bad days along with the good .
If you want only the good , you 're in for trouble .
So you have to play neutral : Do n't fall in with the good or the bad . " §
" When the meditation goes well , do n't get excited .
When it does n't go well , do n't get depressed .
Simply be observant to see why it 's good , why it 's bad .
If you can be observant like this , it wo n't be long before your meditation becomes a skill . " §
" Everything depends on your powers of observation .
If they 're crude and sloppy , you 'll get nothing but crude and sloppy results .
And your meditation will have no hope of making progress . " §
One day a young woman was sitting in meditation with Ajaan Fuang and everything seemed to go well .
Her mind was clear and relaxed , and she could contemplate the elements in her body as he told her , step by step , with no problem at all .
But the next day , nothing went right .
After the session was over , he asked her , " How did it go today ? "
She answered , " Yesterday I felt as if I were smart , today I feel like I 'm stupid . "
So he asked her further , " Are the smart person and the stupid person the same person or not ? " §
A student came to complain to Ajaan Fuang that she had been meditating for years , and still had n't gotten anything out of it .
His immediate response : " You do n't meditate to ' get ' anything .
You meditate to let go . " §
The seamstress , after practicing meditation with Ajaan Fuang for several months , told him that her mind seemed more of a mess than it was before she began meditating .
" Of course it does , " he told her .
" It 's like your house .
If you polish the floor every day , you wo n't be able to stand the least little bit of dust on it .
The cleaner the house , the more easily you 'll see the dirt .
If you do n't keep polishing the mind , you can let it go out and sleep in the mud without any qualms at all .
But once you get it to sleep on a polished floor , then if there 's even a speck of dust , you 'll have to sweep it away .
You wo n't be able to stand the mess . " §
" If you get excited by other people 's experiences in meditation , it 's like getting excited by other people 's wealth .
And what do you gain from that ?
Pay attention to developing your own wealth instead . " §
" Good will and compassion , if they are n't backed up by equanimity , can cause you to suffer .
That 's why you need the equanimity of jhana to perfect them . " §
" Your concentration has to be Right Concentration : just right , on an even keel , all the time .
Whatever you do — sitting , standing , walking , lying down — do n't let it have any ups and downs . " §
" Concentration :
You have to learn how to do it , how to maintain it , and how to put it to use . " §
" Once you catch hold of the mind , it 'll stay in the present , without slipping off to the past or future .
That 's when you 'll be able to make it do whatever you want . " §
" When you get so that you catch on to the meditation , it 's like a kite that finally catches the wind .
It wo n't want to come down . " §
One evening , after a work party at Wat Dhammasathit , Ajaan Fuang took his lay students up to the chedi to meditate .
One woman in the group felt completely exhausted from all the work , but joined in the meditation anyway , out of deference to him .
As she sat there , her awareness got weaker and weaker , smaller and smaller , to the point where she thought she was going to die .
Ajaan Fuang happened to walk past and said , " There 's no need to be afraid of death .
You die with every in and out breath . "
This gave her the strength to fight off her exhaustion , and to continue meditating .
§
" To meditate is to practice dying , so that you 'll be able to do it right . "
Breathing §
When my father came for a visit to Wat Dhammasathit , I got him to sit and meditate with Ajaan Fuang , while I acted as interpreter .
Before starting , my father asked if his being a Christian would be an obstacle to the meditation .
Ajaan Fuang assured him that it would n't : " We 're going to focus on the breath .
The breath does n't belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone else .
It 's common property all over the world , and everyone has the right to look at it .
So try looking at the breath until you can see your own mind and know your own mind .
Then the question of what religion you belong to wo n't be an issue , because we can talk about the mind instead of discussing religions .
This way we can understand each other . " §
" When you do anything in meditation , relate it to the breath , for that 's the basis of the entire skill we 're developing . " §
" Catching the mind is like catching eels .
If you simply jump down into the mud and try to grab hold of them , they 'll slip off every which way .
You have to find something they like — as when people take a dead dog , put it in a big clay jar and then bury it in the mud .
In no time at all the eels come swimming into the jar of their own free will to feed off the dog , and then all you have to do it put your hand over the mouth of the jar and there you are :
You 've got your eels .
" It 's the same with the mind .
You have to find something it likes , so make the breath as comfortable as you can , to the point where it feels good throughout the whole body .
The mind likes comfort , so it 'll come of its own free will , and then it 's easy to catch hold of it . " §
" You have to know the breath at all times , and then happiness will be yours .
The human state , the heavenly state , and nibbana are all here in the breath .
If you get carried away with other things , happiness will slip through your fingers , so you have to learn how to observe the in - and - out breath at all times .
Pay attention to how it 's getting along — do n't leave it to fend for itself .
When you know its way of life — sitting , standing , walking , everything — then you can get what you want from it .
The body will be light , the mind at ease , happy at all times . " §
" The breath can take you all the way to nibbana , you know . " §
" The first step is simply to look at the breath as it is .
You do n't have to go fiddling around with it a lot .
Just think bud - with the in - breath , and dho with the out .
Bud - in , dho out .
Do n't force the breath , or force the mind into a trance .
Simply hold the mind carefully right there with each breath . " §
" How do you use your powers of observation to get acquainted with the breath ?
Ask yourself :
Do you know the breath ?
Is the breath there ?
If you can't see whether the breath is for real , look further in until it 's clearly there .
There 's no great mystery to it .
It 's always real , right there .
The important thing is whether or not you 're for real .
If you are , then simply keep at it .
That 's all there is to it .
Simply keep being real , being true in what you do , and your meditation will make progress .
It 'll gradually grow stronger , and the mind will grow calm .
Just be clear about what you 're doing .
Do n't have any doubts .
If you can doubt even your own breath , then there are no two ways about it :
You 'll doubt everything .
No matter what happens , you 'll be uncertain about it .
So be straightforward and true in whatever you do , for everything comes down to whether or not you 're true . " §
" Once the mind stays with the breath , you do n't have to repeat buddho in the mind .
It 's like calling your water buffalo .
Once it comes , why keep calling its name ? " §
" Make the mind and the breath one and the same .
Do n't let them be two . " §
" Do n't be a post planted in the mud .
Have you ever seen a post planted in the mud ?
It sways back and forth and can never stand firm .
Whatever you do , be firm and single - minded about it .
Like when you focus on the breath :
Make the mind one with it , like a post planted firmly in solid rock . " §
" Hold onto the breath the way a red ant bites : Even if you pull its body so that it separates from the head , the head will keep on biting and wo n't let go . " §
When I first heard Ajaan Fuang talk about " catching hold " of the breath , I did n't understand him .
I 'd sit tensing up my body to catch hold of it , but this simply made me feel tired and ill at ease .
Then one day , as I was riding the bus to Wat Makut , I sat in concentration and found that if I let the breath follow its natural course , it felt a lot more comfortable , and the mind would n't run away from it .
When I reached Wat Makut , being a typical Westerner , I took him to task , " Why do you say to catch the breath ?
The more you catch it , the more uncomfortable it is .
You have to let it go to flow naturally . "
He laughed and said , " That is n't what I meant .
To ' catch it ' means to stick with it , to follow it and to make sure you do n't wander away from it .
You do n't have to squeeze or force or control it .
Whatever it's like , just keep on watching it . " §
" Get so that you really know the breath , not just that you 're simply aware of it . " §
" Observing the breath is the cause , the pleasure that arises is the result .
Focus as much as you can on the cause .
If you ignore the cause and get carried away with the result , it 'll run out and you 'll end up with nothing at all . " §
" When you focus on the breath , measure things by how much pleasure you feel .
If both the breath and the mind feel pleasant , you 're doing okay .
If either the breath or the mind feels uncomfortable , that 's when you have to make adjustments . " §
" The main thing when you meditate is to be observant .
If you feel ill at ease , change the breath until you feel better .
If the body feels heavy , think of spreading the breath so that it feels light .
Tell yourself that the breath can come in and out every pore of your skin . " §
" When the book says to focus on the breath sensations in the different parts of the body , it means to focus on whatever feelings are already there in the body . " §
" The breath can be a resting place for the mind , or it can be what the mind actively contemplates .
When the mind is n't willing to settle down and be still , it 's a sign that it wants exercise .
So we give it work to do .
We make it scan the body and contemplate the breath sensations in the different parts to see how they 're related to the in - and - out breath , to see where the energy flows smoothly and where it 's blocked .
But make sure that your mind does n't wander outside of the body .
Keep it circling around inside and do n't let it stop until it gets tired .
Once it 's tired you can find a place for it to rest , and it'll stay there without your having to force it . " §
" Make the breath viscous and then think of it exploding to fill the whole body . " §
Ajaan Fuang once told a student who liked to keep in shape with yoga and aerobic exercises every day : " Use the breath to keep in shape instead .
Sit in meditation and spread the breath throughout the body , to every part .
The mind will get trained and the body will be strong with no need to tie it into knots or make it jump around . " §
A nun who practiced meditation with Ajaan Fuang had had poor health since she was a child , and was always coming down with one disease or another .
Ajaan Fuang told her : " Every morning when you wake up , sit and meditate to give yourself a physical examination , to see where the aches and pains are , and then use your breathing to treat them .
The heavy pains will grow lighter ; the light ones will disappear .
But do n't make a big deal out of whether or not they disappear .
Keep on examining the body and dealing with the breath no matter what happens , because the important point is that you 're training your mindfulness to stay with the body , to the point where it 's strong enough to go above and beyond pain . " §
" Adjust the breath until it 's perfectly even .
If you see a white light , bring it into the body and let it explode out to every pore .
The mind will be still ; the body weightless .
You 'll feel white and bright all over , and your heart will be at ease . " §
" When the breath fills the body , it 's like water filling a jar to the brim .
Even though you may try to pour more into it , that 's all it can take .
It 's just right , in and of itself . " §
" Meditation needs rapture — a feeling of fullness in body and mind — as its lubricant .
Otherwise it gets too dry . " §
" When you meditate you have to let go in stages .
Like when they go into outer space :
The space capsule has to let go of the booster rockets before it can reach the moon . " §
" When the mind is really in place you can let go of the breath , and it wo n't wander off anywhere .
It 's like pouring cement :
If the cement has n't set , you can't remove the plywood forms , but once it 's set , it 'll stay where it is without any need for the forms at all . " §
" Spread the breath until the body and mind are so light that there 's no sense of body at all — just awareness itself .
The mind will be clear like crystal clean water .
You can look down into the water and see your own face .
You 'll be able to see what 's going on in your mind . " §
" When the breath is full and still , you let go of it .
Then you think of each of the other elements in the body — fire , water , and earth — one by one .
When they 're all clear you put them together , i.e. , balance them so that the body is n't too hot , too cold , too heavy too light : just right in every way .
Now you let go of that and stay with the space element — a feeling of emptiness .
When you 're skilled at staying with space , look at what 's saying " space " .
This is where you turn to look at awareness itself , the element of consciousness .
Once the mind has become one like this , you can then let go of the oneness , and see what 's left .
" After you can do this , you practice going in and out of the various stages until you 're skilled at it , and you can notice the various modes of the mind as you do it .
That 's where discernment will begin to appear . " §
" In contemplating yourself , the six elements have to come first .
You take them apart and put them back together again , as when you learn your ABC's and how to make them into words .
After a while you can make any word you want . " §
" Take your time to make sure that this foundation is solid .
Once it 's solid , then no matter how many storeys you want to build on top of it , they 'll go up quickly and stay in place . " §
" If you were to say it 's easy , well yes , it 's easy .
If you were to say it 's hard , it 's hard .
It all depends on you . " §
" The basic steps of breath meditation that Ajaan Lee describes in his Method 2 are just the main outline of the practice .
As for the details , you have to use your own ingenuity to work variations on his outline so that it fits your experiences .
That 's when you 'll get results . " §
" If you 're having any problems in your concentration , check what you 're doing against the seven steps in Method 2 .
I 've found that if anyone comes to me with problems in their concentration , all I have to do is apply one of the seven steps .
They 're basic to all meditation . " §
" The texts say that breath meditation is right for everyone , but that 's not really the case .
Only if you 're meticulous can you get results from focusing on the breath . " §
" A famous meditation teacher once criticized Ajaan Lee : ' Why do you teach people to look at the breath ?
What is there to look at ?
There 's just in and out .
How are they going to gain discernment from looking at just that ? '
He answered , ' If that 's all they see , that 's all they 'll get . '
This is a question that comes from not knowing how to look . " §
" People of discernment can take anything at all and put it to good use . "
Visions & Signs §
One year — when Ajaan Fuang was seeing a Chinese doctor in Bangkok for his skin disease and staying at Wat Asokaram — a group of nuns and laypeople came to practice meditation with him every night .
Some members of the group would report having this or that vision in the course of their meditation , and finally one of the nuns complained : " I know that my mind is n't slipping off anywhere ; it 's staying right with the breath all the time , so why are n't I having any visions like everyone else ? "
Ajaan Fuang answered her , " Do you know how lucky you are ?
With people who have visions , this , that , and the other thing is always coming in to interfere .
But you do n't have any old karma to get in the way of your meditation , so you can focus directly on the mind without having to get involved with any outside things at all . " §
" Do n't be amazed by people with visions .
Visions are nothing else but dreams .
There are true ones and false ones .
You can't really trust them . " §
A Bangkok housewife who was practicing meditation with Ajaan Fuang heard some of his other students say that meditation without visions was the straight path .
It so happened that she had frequent visions in her meditation , and so hearing this made her wonder why her path was so winding and convoluted .
When she asked Ajaan Fuang about this , he told her : " Having visions in your meditation is like having lots of lush wild greens growing along the side of your path .
You can gather them as you go along , so that you 'll have something to eat along the way , and you 'll reach the end of the path just like everyone else .
As for other people , they might see the greens without gathering them , or may not even see them at all — because their path goes through arid land . " §
" People who practice concentration fall into two groups : those who have signs via the eyes when their minds settle down , and those who have signs via the body .
People in the first group are the ones who see visions of people , animals , whatever .
Those in the second group do n't have visions , but when their minds settle down , their bodies will feel unusually heavy or light , large or small , etc .
When these people focus on the elements in their body , they 'll notice them as feelings : warmth , coolness , heaviness , spaciousness , and so forth .
" If I 'm teaching people like this how to meditate , I do n't have to worry about them too much , because there are n't many dangers in their path — aside from the danger of their getting discouraged because they do n't see anything happening in their meditation .
The ones I worry about are those in the first group , because they have lots of dangers .
Their visions can lead them to jump to all sorts of false conclusions .
If they do n't learn the right way to deal with their visions , they 'll get stuck on them and never be able to reach any higher level than that . " §
" Visions — or whatever things appear in the course of your meditation :
It 's not the case that you should n't pay any attention to them , for some kinds of visions have important messages .
So when things like this appear , you have to look into how they 're appearing , why they 're appearing , and for what purpose . " §
" People who have visions have a double - edged sword in their hands , so they have to be careful .
The things that appear have their uses and their dangers .
So learn how to squeeze out their uses and leave the dangers behind . " §
Usually if any of Ajaan Fuang 's students saw a vision of their own body in meditation , he'd have them divide it up in the vision into the four elements — earth , water , wind , and fire — or into its 32 basic parts , and then set fire to it until it was nothing but ashes .
If the same vision reappeared , he'd have them deal with it the same way again until they were quick at it .
One of his students , a nun , was practicing this sort of meditation every day , but as soon as she had divided the body into its 32 parts and was getting ready to set fire to it , another image of her body would appear right next to the first .
As soon as she was getting ready to cremate the second one , another one would appear right next to it , and then another , and another , like fish lined up on a platter waiting to be grilled .
As she looked at them she felt fed up with the idea of continuing , but when she mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang , he told her , " The whole purpose in doing this is to get fed up , but not fed up with the doing . " §
Another technique Ajaan Fuang taught for dealing with an image of one 's own body would be to focus on what it looked like the first week in the womb , the second week , the third , and so on to the day of birth ; then the first month after that , the second month , the first year , the second year , and so on up until old age and death .
One woman was trying this technique , but it seemed too slow to her , so she focused on five - and ten - year intervals instead .
When Ajaan Fuang found out , he told her , " You 're skipping over all the important parts , " and then made up a new set of rules : " Think of your head and then think of pulling out one hair at a time and placing it in the palm of your hand .
See how much you can pull out , and then replant it one hair at a time .
If you have n't finished , do n't leave your meditation until you do .
If you want to pull it out in bunches , okay , but you have to replant it one hair at a time .
You have to go into the details like this if you want to gain anything good from it . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students asked him , " Why is it that the intuitions I get from my concentration come in such short flashes , without letting me catch the whole picture ? "
He answered , " When they put a record on a record player , the needle has to keep bearing down continually if you 're going to hear the whole story .
If you do n't keep bearing down , how can you expect to know anything ? " §
Another student was sitting in meditation with Ajaan Fuang when she saw an image of a dead person in her concentration , asking for a share of some of the merit from her practice .
This made her feel creepy , so she told Ajaan Fuang , " There 's a ghost in front of me , Than Phaw . "
" That 's not a ghost , " he responded .
" That 's a person . "
" No , it 's really a ghost , " she insisted .
" If that 's a ghost , " he said , " then you 're a ghost .
If you see it as a person , then you can be a person , too . " §
After that he told her to spread thoughts of goodwill if she saw anything like that again , and the image would go away .
So from that point on , that 's what she 'd do , at the drop of a hat , the minute she saw an image of a dead person in her meditation .
When Ajaan Fuang found out about this , he taught her , " Wait a minute .
Do n't be in such a hurry to get rid of them .
First look at what condition they 're in and then ask them what karma they did to become that way .
If you do this , you 'll begin to gain some insight into the Dhamma . " §
Several weeks later she had a vision of an emaciated woman holding a tiny child .
The woman was wearing nothing but dirty rags , and the child was crying without stop .
The student asked the woman in her vision what she had done to be so miserable , and the answer was that she had tried to have an abortion , but both she and the child had died as a result .
Hearing this , the student could n't help feeling sorry for them , but no matter how much she spread thoughts of goodwill to them , it did n't seem to help them at all , because their karma was so heavy .
This had her upset , so she told Ajaan Fuang .
He replied , " Whether or not they can receive your help is their business , and none of yours .
Different people have different karma , and some are beyond help for the time being .
You give what you can , but you do n't have to go back and make an official inquiry into how things turned out .
Do your duty and leave it at that .
They ask for help , you give them what you can .
They appear for you to see so that you 'll learn more about the results of karma .
That 's enough .
Once you 're finished , go back to the breath . " §
She kept following Ajaan Fuang 's instructions until one day it occurred to her , " If I keep giving , giving , giving like this , will I have anything left for myself ? "
When she told her doubts to Ajaan Fuang , he gave her a blank look for a second and then said , " Boy , you really can be narrow - hearted when you want to be , ca n't you ? "
Then he explained : " Goodwill is n't a thing , like money , that the more you give , the less you have .
It 's more like having a lit candle in your hand .
This person asks to light his candle from yours , that person asks to light hers .
The more candles you light , the brighter it is for everyone — including you . " §
Time passed and one day she had a vision of a dead man asking her to tell his children and grandchildren to make merit in such and such a way and to dedicate it to him .
When she left meditation , she asked permission to go inform the dead man 's children , but Ajaan Fuang said , " What for ?
You 're not a mailman .
Even if you were , he does n't have any money to pay your wages .
What kind of proof are you going to give them that what you say is true ?
If they believe you , you 're going to get carried away and think that you 're some special kind of psychic .
Everywhere you go , you 'll keep smiling this little smile to yourself .
And if they do n't believe you , you know what they 'll say , do n't you ? "
" What , Than Phaw ? "
" They 'll say you 're crazy . " §
" There are true visions and false visions .
So whenever you see one , just sit still and watch it .
Do n't get pulled into following it . " §
" You should watch visions the same way you watch TV : Just watch it , without getting pulled inside the tube . " §
Some of Ajaan Fuang 's students would have visions of themselves or their friends in previous lifetimes and get all excited about what they saw .
When they 'd report their visions to Ajaan Fuang , he 'd warn them , " You are n't still wrapped up in the past , are you ?
You 're foolish if you are .
You 've been born and died countless aeons .
If you took the bones of all your past bodies and piled them up , they'd be taller than Mount Sumeru .
The water in all the oceans is less than the water of the tears you 've shed over all the sufferings , big and small , you 've been through .
If you reflect on this with real discernment , you 'll feel disenchanted with states of being , and no longer take pleasure in birth .
Your mind will aim straight for nibbana . " §
In 1976 Ajaan Fuang gained large numbers of new students .
One of them wondered why this was the case , and so asked herself about it in her meditation .
The answer came to her that Ajaan Fuang had had many children in a previous lifetime , and now they had been reborn as his students .
When she left meditation , she asked him why this was so , figuring that he'd tell her that he had once been a king with a large harem , but instead he said , " I was probably a fish in the sea , laying who knows how many eggs at a time . " §
One evening a school teacher was meditating at home and began remembering her previous lives all the way back to the time of King Asoka .
In her vision she saw King Asoka beating her father mercilessly over a trivial infraction of palace etiquette .
The next morning she went to tell Ajaan Fuang about her vision , and it was obvious that she was still furious with King Asoka for what she had seen him do .
Ajaan Fuang did n't affirm or deny the truth of her vision .
Instead , he spoke to her anger in the present , " Here you 've been carrying this grudge for over 2,000 years , and where is it getting you ?
Go ask forgiveness of him in your mind and have done with it . " §
" It 's good that most people can't remember their previous lives .
Otherwise things would be a lot more complicated than they already are . " §
One woman , who at that point was n't yet a student of Ajaan Fuang , was practicing meditation at home on her own when she had a vision of a sentence — somewhat like Pali , but not quite — appearing in her meditation .
So she copied it down and went from wat to wat , asking various monks to translate it for her .
No one could until she met one monk who told her that it was in arahant language , and only an arahant could understand what it said .
Then he had the gall to translate it for her , after which he told her to bring him any other sentences she got from her visions , and he 'd translate them , too .
She was n't completely convinced of what he had said , and happened to mention it to Ajaan Fuang when she first met him .
His response : " What ?
Arahant language ?
The minds of arahants are above and beyond conventions .
What kind of language would a mind like that have ? " §
" People for the most part do n't like the truth .
They prefer make - believe instead . " §
There were occasions when some of Ajaan Fuang 's students would gain knowledge of one sort or another in their visions , get carried away with it , and yet he would n't take them to task .
One day the seamstress asked him why he did n't warn such people that their practice was going off course , and he told her , " You have to look at how mature they are .
If they 're really adults , you can tell them straight out .
If their minds are still infants , you have to let them play for a while , like a child with a new toy .
If you 're too harsh with them , they might get discouraged and give up completely .
As they begin to mature they 're sure to start seeing for themselves what 's proper and what 's not . " §
" Do n't have anything to do with the past or the future .
Just stay with the present — that 's enough .
And even though that 's where you 're supposed to stay , you 're not supposed to latch onto it .
So why do think you should latch on to things where you 're not even supposed to stay ? " §
" You know that you should n't believe even your own visions , so why go believing the visions of others ? " §
" If you ca n't let go of your visions , you 'll never gain release . " §
One of Ajaan Fuang 's students asked him , " When you see something in a vision , how can you know whether it 's true or false ? "
His answer : " Even when it 's true , it 's true only in terms of convention .
You have to get your mind beyond both true and false . " §
" The purpose of the practice is to make the heart pure .
All these other thing
When it comes to the most expected new installments in a game series , Grand Theft Auto 6 surely takes the cake .
Even though Grand Theft Auto 5 is still very much alive and kicking , fans are already heavily speculating on how the sixth installment in the beloved open world franchise will look like .
Many new features are expected to be brought to the game , along with brand new cities to explore and wreak havoc in .
Let ’s take a look at the possible cities of Grand Theft Auto 6 .
Rome
In the gaming world , Rome is generally the setting for historical battles and the likes of that , not the modern - day gangsters of GTA .
However , today ’s Rome is ripe with amazing street culture combined with ancient ruins , making for a truly unique feel .
If you think about it , street fights in the Colosseum would be a pretty neat thing to do in the game , right ?
Not to mention wreaking havoc around town on Vespas , like any respectable Italian would .
Tokyo
Very much in the spirit of Sega ’s Yakuza series .
Tokyo would be an amazing option for a new city in Grand Theft Auto 6 .
Just imagine the amazing visuals powered by the revolutionary improved graphics the game will come with , along with getting down and dirty in the streets of the Japanese capital .
We ’re betting it would be an awesome experience .
Let ’s hope Rockstar hears us out .
Sao Paulo
As you may well remember , Rockstar has already explored bits of Sao Paulo through Max Payne , another one of its beloved games .
However , GTA ’s open world format would be spectacular for a re-exploration of the largest city in Brazil .
Also , the favelas that surround the city would potentially be an interesting location for various nefarious deeds .

The last fuelling procedure begins on Friday morning
The Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) will be lofted in the 22 February to 8 - 9 March timeframe , European Space Agency ( Esa ) officials say .
The 20 - tonne vessel will then attach itself to the international outpost during one of two windows ; in early March , or in late March to early April .
ATV is the biggest , most sophisticated spacecraft Europe has attempted to fly .
Its preparation at the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana is very nearly complete .
This Friday , engineers will start the final stage of fuelling , adding 2.7 tonnes of oxidiser to the ship 's propellant system .
Once this is done , and major headway has been made on the final 200 or so items on an " open work list " , the ATV will be moved out of Kourou 's giant S5 integration halls and taken to the Baf ( Final Assembly Building ) where it will be mated with its Ariane 5 launcher .
SPACE STATION CARGO TRUCKS Mission Guide : Jules Verne ATV ( l ) will resupply the ISS with up to 7,500kg of cargo Capacity is three times that of the Russian Progress craft ( r ) Deliveries will include science equipment , food and clothing Large tanks can transport vital air , water and fuel supplies ATV project 's estimated cost is about 1.3 bn euros ( £ 0.9 bn )
At least four craft will follow the maiden ATV - Jules Verne Named after the author who wrote about fantastic journeys
ATV flight animation
" Since October , we have lost just three days in the planning .
We have some 200 actions still to do , but these are normal ; I do n't see major issues , " he told BBC News .
Last week , at a general designers ' review in Moscow , the Russians ( one of the major partners in the space station project ) gave their formal approval for the mission to proceed .
A similar meeting will be held in the US this week at which the Americans are also expected to sign off ATV .
A gathering of space agency officials on 6 February will then begin the process of narrowing the launch window to a specific date .
Much will depend on what happens to the shuttle Atlantis .
It is scheduled to fly to the International Space Station on 7 February .
If it is held on the ground because of bad weather or further technical problems , the ATV launch date may start to creep to the back of its window .
But when ATV lifts off is probably not so important as when it arrives .
It can not dock when the shuttle is present or in flight - not least because the two vehicles both make use of the US Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System .
" We have built ATV to be almost independent of a lot of the other operations , " explained John Ellwood , Esa 's ATV mission manager .
There are about 200 - mostly simple - tasks still to perform
" We then go to the space station and we have the option of immediately docking if conditions are right or we could loiter .
We have a strategy where we go to a point 2,000 km in front of the space station and just wait there . "
The best times to dock are 15 - 19 March and 30 March to 5 April .
These are periods when the station 's alignment to the Sun will give astronauts a clear view of the ATV 's approach ; cameras will not be blinded by bright light .
Once attached , the ATV - dubbed Jules Verne for its first flight - will stay on - station until August , after which it will be commanded to undock and ditch itself in the Pacific .
Preparation work on the second ATV , likely to fly in 2010 , has already begun .

Foye savors the bitter flavor and floral aromas that emanate from a well - crafted beer .
Lately , the San Pedro resident has experienced an unexpected sensation when he reaches for a brew -- the unpleasant taste of rising prices .
A worldwide shortage of hops -- a key ingredient for the pale ales Foye likes so much -- and rising prices for malted barley have pushed up the cost of imbibing a tall cold one .
These days , he ’s paying $ 9.99 a six - pack , about 40 % more than a year ago , for such California - crafted favorites as Union Jack India Pale Ale brewed by Firestone Walker Brewing Co. of Paso Robles and Racer 5 made by Bear Republic Brewing Co. of Cloverdale .
Add beer to the growing list of what many people consider basic foods -- like bread , coffee and pizza -- that are costing more .
The cost of groceries has risen at an annual rate of about 5 % in each of the last six months , the fastest food inflation since 1990 .

“ It is a big hit , ” Foye said as he leaned over a microbrew at the bar of Beachwood BBQ on Main Street in Seal Beach this week .
He does n’t drink enough beer to make higher prices a “ budget buster , ” yet Foye still finds it “ irksome .
. . .
It ’s like gas prices , what are you going to do about it ? ”
After barely budging for several years , beer prices started to inch up in the second half of last year and are now rising at about a 4 % annual rate , according to government statistics .
It ’s showing up in what brewers and distributors are charging for both domestic and imported beer , said Ken Hollingswood , owner of Hollingswood Delicatessen , a popular hangout for hopheads in Orange .
He ’s had to raise the price of better domestic brews by about 15 % and European beer by 20 % .
“ Those are big increases , and I do n’t think we have seen the end of it yet , ” Hollingswood said .

Prices for microbrews are rising faster than the mass - produced beers .
That ’s because they come from small brewers less likely to hedge expenses with advance purchases of barley and hops than Anheuser - Busch and the other giants that control most of the market .
But even the big brewers are n’t totally immune .
“ Like all brewers , we are experiencing cost increases due to the rising prices of brewing ingredients , ” said Maureen Roth , spokeswoman for Anheuser - Busch , the nation ’s largest brewer .
She declined to comment on how that was affecting the company ’s prices , except to say that Busch has “ aggressive cost - savings programs in place throughout the company designed to partially offset rising commodity costs . ”
Two ingredients -- hops and malted barley -- are behind much of the price increases .

Hops produce the chemicals that give beer its distinct flavor .
Some varieties are used to bitter the drink .
Others impart its floral aromas .
Most commercially grown domestic hops come from Washington , Oregon and Idaho .
After water , malted barely is the next - biggest ingredient in beer .
It provides the sugars that turns into alcohol when the beer is fermented .
Barley prices have risen because of worldwide demand for grains , including wheat , corn and rice .
Philip Sutton , owner of Skyscraper Brewing Co. , a small brewery in El Monte , said the price of a 50 - pound bag of malted barley had jumped to $ 22 , or 57 % higher than a year ago .
Hops prices are soaring even more .
Sutton paid $ 3.40 to $ 4.70 a pound for hops a year ago .
The least expensive hops he has found this year were $ 12.63 a pound , and he ’s paid all the way up to $ 22.45 .
But that ’s only if he can find them .
Advertisement
“ The hops that we like to use just are n’t available , ” Sutton said .
That has forced him to substitute other hops in some of his beer recipes “ and that makes a different beer .
It ’s still good but is n’t what we would ideally have , ” said Sutton , who has raised his prices 20 % to 30 % .
For many years , farmers did n’t make much money selling hops .
Back in 1996 , hop farming peaked at an estimated 44,000 acres .
All that acreage , combined with the planting of higher - yielding varieties , created a giant surplus .
That was made worse because the beer - making ingredients that come from hops can be easily stored for years .
That drove prices down and pushed farmers out of the business , said Ann George of the Washington Hop Commission .
By 2004 , acreage had fallen to a low of 27,742 but has grown slowly since , hitting almost 31,000 in 2007 .
That was n’t enough to stave off a hops shortage this year that is expected to last into next year .
George estimates that farmers will plant 6,000 to 8,000 new acres this year .

The hops shortage is hitting the small , fast - growing craft brewers that have become the most dynamic part of the American beer market .
That segment accounts for less than 4 % of U.S. beer production but uses almost 10 % of the hops , according to industry statistics .
Microbrews are where most beer innovation is taking place , said Gabriel Gordon , owner of Beachwood BBQ .
Gordon has built his eatery around beer .
He typically has 23 brews on tap and another 45 in bottles .
Brewers are charging Gordon 20 % to 40 % more for their beer , and that ’s forced him to raise prices about 50 cents a glass to $ 6 or $ 6.50 , depending on the beer .

“ I am not looking to get rich , ” Gordon said .
He would rather limit his price increases and “ have my repeat customers walk away satisfied rather than feel like they were gouged . ”

It was November 20th , 2003 .
I was driving out of the East Alton , Illinois McDonalds drive - thru in the morning , McGriddle in hand , and I noticed a sign that did n't make much sense .
It was across the parking lot and directly in front of anyone waiting for their food at the drive - thru window .
It said , " OUR TEAM IS EMPOWERED TO GUARANTEE YOUR SATISFACTION .
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING McDONALDS . "
What a strangely - worded sign .
Then I notice the way that the sign is built on the stand - it'd be easy to replace the entire thing with my own creation .
So at lunch , me and a friend quickly drive through McDonald 's parking lot on our way to Subway and take a few pictures of the sign .
I also get out and measure the sign - it 's 35 1/4 " wide and 22 " down .
My plan is to cut a piece of plywood to that size , write something new on it and use drywall screws to attach it on top of the existing sign .
But I need some ideas on what to make the new sign say .
So I turn to the users of Cal 's Forums and ask for ideas .
Here are all of the suggestions made by Cal 's Forum users .
The signs pictured below are obviously photoshop jobs , made for suggestions by Cal 's users .
Some of them are great , some of them suck .
You be the judge !
I would keep it very similar to what 's up there .
Maybe something like " Our Team is Empowered with the Dark Side of the force .
Thank you for choosing McVader's "
If nothing else , all the star wars freaks and fan sites would be hosting it and talking about it .
- judasiscariot
well an obvious edit would be to include the word sex so it 's " Our team is empowered to guarantee your sexual satifaction " but that 's not very original - jedibebop
How about " IF YOU DON'T TURN LEFT RIGHT NOW , YOU WILL RUN OVER THIS SIGN .
- THE MANAGEMENT " -rbcp
I think what would be funny is " Our team is empowered to guarantee your gratifaction .
Thank you for choosing McDonalds "
Its just changed enough that it would stay up for a long time and people would be wondering .... gratifaction ?
Is that even a word ?
- Moose - Alini
I 'd say something like " Least polluted fast food place , 1999 - 2001 2001 - 2002 " - Big - E
" Our team would like to thank our lawyer for winning our food poisoning court battle " - jedibebop
" Our team wants to let you know , Do n't eat the chicken nuggets ! " - judasiscariot
How about " Our team is guarenteed to enhance your stratification . "
And then put " Please ask for an application . "
Even without that last sentence , it would still be kinda funny .
Especially with the whole " McJob " dictionary defination making the news .
- sarah601
" DID YOU REALLY NEED ANOTHER CHEESEBURGER , FATTY ? " - tacojon
How about " You did n't really think that was hamburger did you ? "
- LethalDosage
'we now use real chicken in our mcnuggets !'
- mr_doc
'we are not responsible for your obesity .
Please eat responsibly ' - mr_doc
' we 've gone 4 months without a class action lawsuit ! '
- mr_doc
' gerbil deliveries : please use rear door ' - mr_doc
' breakfast now served until 12:00 pm ' - mr_doc
' now hiring : fry cooks and floor moppers see team leader roy for details ' - mr_doc
Put a heading across the top that says " MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE MEMORIAL WALL " .
Underneath that , attach a photo of a person in a McDonald 's uniform .
Label it with a name ( let 's use " Ramon " for this example ) , his birth and death dates ( i.e. 1979 - 2003 ) , and the caption " LOST IN TRAGIC FRYER ACCIDENT . "
Beneath that , add the words " CHECK YOUR SANDWICH FOR OUR FALLEN COMRADES " in bold red letters .
- tacojon
How about " Our team is endowed to guarantee your satisfaction " .
Subtle sexual double - meanings make me giggle .
- Mithrandir_t00
" You have water , come to my house .
Thank you for choosing McDonalds " - Liife
Due to constant complaints , we are now asking all patrons to please check your cheeseburgers for rat feces .
We apolgize for the inconvience .
- Mrpeanut
Our team is emploding , please get help !
Thank you for saving lives .
- Mrpeanut
" All your money are belong to us " - hellview
You could put something up there that says " Warning ! " and put everything below it in Polish , Czech , or even Gaelic .
- hellview
You could do a good deed and tell people to be careful not to spill coffee on their pee pee .
- Nelsonmandela
CAUTION : SIGN -RTFirefly
how about " our staff is empowered to gun you down in the event of shoplifting a happy meal " - PuRewiReZ
Happy Meals now with 50 % less happiness due to bad economy .
- Murd0c
here we go " If we team up with Walmart we will own all of you ! " - 14D
Try to make it look like a heart doctor sponsored the sign .
That way you could fuck with McDonalds AND a local cardiologist .
The sign could say something like " Thanks for Choosing McDonald 's -- We Lubricate Your Arteries !
Brought to you by Dr. Wilhem Maosos , Cardiologist , St. Emmanual Hospital " - Spessa
We apologize , but cows and chickens have become extinct due to our harvesting techniques .
- tk
Fresh food made from people just like you !
- Somebody
I do n't want to use any of the ideas that defame the quality of McDonald 's food or falsely advertise their products .
My intent is mostly to amuse people , not piss them off .
I finally decide to pick Mithrandir_t00 's suggestion of " Our team is endowed to guarantee your satisfaction " but I change his wording slightly to read , " Our team is well - endowed to guarantee your pleasure ! "
Even if this is false advertising , I do n't think the employees are going to say , " Hey , that 's not true because our weeners are n't that big ! "
The next day I begin construction of the sign .
I start out by Googling for the McDonald 's logo and placing it in Microsoft Word along with our new slogan .
I print it all up on transparency paper .
I have plenty of plywood in my basement to work with .
I use a sheet of 1/4 " plywood and cut it to the correct demensions .
Then I paint it white .
Next I place the transparent sheets on my overhead projector and shine them onto my sheet of plywood , which I 've nailed to the wall , and trace the letters onto the board with pencil .
Now it 's time to paint !
I have all the colors I need already except for red .
So I go out and buy a quart of red paint and a package of Crayola watercolor brushes .
My paints end up being a combination of water - based and oil - based paints .
I 'm not sure if any of it is meant for outdoor use but I do n't expect the sign to last too long so I figure that wo n't be a problem .
A friend of mine suggests coating the entire thing with polyurethane to help it last longer .
The first day I went to install the sign , I tried it by myself .
It was about 1:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon and it was snowing .
The drive - thru was packed so I was sure that nobody would notice me .
I grabbed the sign , my cordless power drill and a bunch of screws .
I pulled up to the sign , putting my car between the sign and the drive - thru window so they would have a harder time noticing what I was doing .
I calmly got out of the car , took the sign out of the passenger side and started to put it up .
This is when I discovered that it was too big to fit !
The height ended up being about 1/8 " too much .
So I threw it back in the car and took it home to cut it .
I guess my measuring and arithmatic skills could stand a little improvement .
Several days later I went out to try again .
This time it was about 9:00 pm .
McDonalds was dead and as I drove through the parking lot , 2 employees sat at the window and stared at me as I drove by .
I decided that it would be a bad night to try this .
I threw the sign in my trunk and it sat there for a couple of weeks .
I decided that I needed to have a friend drive me there during a busy lunch period so they could pull up and I could just lean out the window and quickly install it while they keep a lookout .
Unfortunately I do n't have any friends .
But my lucky break was when Tami and her boyfriend ( Tami helped us create the Drive - thru Shenanigans prank video ) brought their computer to my house for me to fix .
And it just happened to be noon !
So I asked if they could give me a ride out to McDonalds and they did .
Here is the sign , finally put up after 2 or 3 weeks :
I was n't able to lean out of the window like I 'd hoped so I just had her stop the car and I got out and installed it .
My sign fit into the opening perfectly , although not quite as tightly as I 'd hoped .
I drove one single drywall screw through the middle of the sign to hold it in place and I hope gravity takes care of the rest .
I should have used more screws but I did n't want to ruin my white paint job with black drywall screws .
The whole event took me maybe 20 seconds .
An interesting coincidence was that there were several huge trucks parked right next to the sign and they were for some kind of sign company !
We assumed that they were just inside having some lunch .
But when we came back about 20 minutes later , they were actually doing some work on the big McDonalds sign .
It 's a good thing they were n't working on the big sign when we came there the first time or I probably would have chickened out .
Hopefully they do n't decide to replace my sign when they 're done .
12-13-2003 : The sign has disappeared !
I went there for breakfast today and it was gone .
It only lasted there 3 days .
How disappointing .
But this is where it gets kind of strange ... I called McDonalds and pretended to be some regional manager guy responding to a complaint about a sign on their property .
I spoke with the McManager there ( the head McManager , not just any ole McManager ) and she had no idea what I was talking about .
She did n't even know what sign in the parking lot I was talking about .
So what happened to it then ?
Did a customer decide to steal it ?
Did an employee steal it and not tell anyone ?
Should I call the police about this theft ?
Maybe the manager from the day before took it down and just did n't get around to telling anyone about it .
Maybe the owner of that McDonalds took it and just has n't told the store about it yet .
We may never know .
But my guess is that a customer saw it and stole it .
I never intended to make another sign and do this again .
But I was just so disappointed that my previous sign disappeared so quickly that I just can't let it end like this .
I was seriously hoping my " well - endowed " sign would last for the entire winter .
So here we go again ...
The first sign warns drivers to turn left or they will run into the sign .
The second uses tacojon 's idea of , " Did you really need another cheeseburger , fatty ? ? "
But I 've also added an idea of Cal's - " Try our new atkins - approved menu ! "
This time I 'm going to do it with a slight twist .
The " Turn left " sign was made with plywood , just like the original sign .
But the " Fatty " sign was done on posterboard .
I 'm going to use thumbtacks to tack the posterboard sign on top of the wooden sign .
My hope is that the employee or manager will see my sign tacked there and think , " Oh , I 'll just take these tacks off and throw this sign away ! " and they wo n't even notice the real sign underneath .
Will my " sign on a sign " trick work ?
I seriously doubt it .
But never underestimate a McDonald 's employee !
To help divert attention away from the fake sign underneath I 've hand written a sloppy note on the back of the posterboard .
It reads , " Hey !
Do n't be mad about this sign .
It was just a joke . "
I purposely wrote this message sloppy and in smaller letters near the end .
I even messed up the word " joke " and wrote over it and I wrote on top of the part where the lettering from the other side bled through the posterboard .
My hope is that the McDonald 's employee will be so occupied with trying to read my message on the back that they wo n't have time to notice the " Please Turn Left . " sign that they 've uncovered .
After leaving the sign sitting in my kitchen for months , we finally get around to putting the new signs up .
We drive there at 9:00 pm in a minivan and as we pull up to the sign , I throw open the sliding side door and jump out with a sign in one hand and a power drill in the other .
Blarring from the van 's stereo was the theme to The A - Team .
Well okay , not really .
Anyway , I get the sign into place in just a few seconds .
I jump back into the van and we speed off past the employee sweeping the parking lot .
It 's okay , he did n't see us .
We swung around the parking lot one more time to snap a picture of the sign , and then went home .
Early the next morning , we went back for some breakfast and to make sure the sign was still there - it was .
Once again , we snapped a picture and went home .
Here are the pictures .
Throughout the morning , I got hourly reports from various people that the sign was still up .
A friend on his way to work stopped by and checked on it and reported to me .
EvilCal and his girlfriend stopped by there for breakfast and reported that it was still there .
I got reports up until 11:00 am .
And that 's when it disappeared .
Not just the posterboard part of it , but the sign underneath too .
My evil plan to trick McDonald 's failed !
But it 's okay , because the sign lasted about 14 hours and the entire breakfast crowd got to see it .
I knew a sign that called the customers fat would n't last long and I 'm surprised it lasted all morning .
It 's too bad nobody got to see the sign underneath , though .
Sometime during the evening , things turned a little bizarre .
A neighbor returning from work stopped by to check on the sign for me .
He called me up to tell me the sign was gone and I told him I already knew .
He says , " No , the WHOLE SIGN is gone .
It 's just 2 posts sticking out of the ground now ! "
So I raced to McDonald 's to get a picture of it .
Sure enough , the top board and the sign itself were completely missing .
I figure they 're either taking the sign down because it 's just more trouble than it 's worth or they 've shipped the sign off to the crime lab to dust it for fingerprints so they can put me away for life .
The half - sign stayed there for 2 days .
Then the entire thing was gone .
It was looking pretty ratty , so I guess they decided to just get rid of it .
I walked over to where it once stood and noticed that they just sawed off the posts at the ground .
So here 's the new plan : I feel bad that they had to take down their sign so I 'm going to build a completely new one for them .
The front will read QUIT TAKING DOWN MY FUNNY SIGNS , YOU DAMN EMPLOYEES !
It will be constructed out of 4x4 posts and a sheet of plywood .
Okay , I 'm kidding .
The McDonald 's sign prank at this location is now officially over .
It was fun while it lasted but I think it 's time to leave these people alone .
But in closing , we decided to make a quick phone call to McDonald 's to ask them what they thought of the prank .
Here 's the call in mp3 format :
The call starts out with us being a little deceptive just to get some information .
But when we come clean , the McManager does n't talk to us for very long before hanging up on us .
She wo n't even admit that she thought the joke was funny .
We 're quite sure she laughed after she hung up though .
Right before she dialed * 57 .
Thanks for reading this page , we hope you 've enjoyed it !
There 's no doubt that the positive impact of this event shall be felt for years to come .
When trainees ask , " Why are there wooden stumps in the ground here ? " the manager will reply , " Oh those .
Well , it 's a long story .
Why do n't I tell you over a Big Mac ... "
This is the final update on this page .
On November 19th , 2004 , I was at the drive - thru getting my McGriddle breakfast when I noticed that McDonald 's had put up a brand new sign .
This one is much more hip looking than the dirty old wooden sign .
I stopped , rolled down my window and snapped a picture of it .
Here it is :
Maybe someday when I 'm really bored I 'll get out and measure the circumference of this sign , then head to Wal - mart for some yellow posterboard ...
Actually , I 've recently moved a few thousand miles away from this particular McDonald 's so there 's no chance of me changing this new sign .
It was a fun prank , but it 's over now and we 've moved on to more sinister things , which you can read about on the rest of phonelosers.org .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Saddam Hussein's intelligence agency footed the bill for a U.S. congressional delegation 's trip during a buildup to the Iraq war , according to a federal indictment unsealed Wednesday in the case of an Iraqi - born U.S. citizen charged with spying for the Iraqi government .
From left , Reps. Mike Thompson , Jim McDermott , David Bonior in Baghdad in a September 27 , 2002 , photo .
Muthanna al - Hanooti , a former official with an Islamic charity in Detroit , Michigan , was taken into custody Tuesday night .
Hussein 's spy agency secretly paid al - Hanooti 2 million barrels of oil , during the time the U.N. Oil for Food program was in place , for services rendered , the indictment states .
Those services included providing the Iraqi government with the names of U.S. members of Congress believed to favor the lifting of sanctions against Iraq , arranging for delegations of those members to visit Iraq and traveling with those delegations , the indictment states .
Dean Boyd , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said no member of Congress was aware of al - Hanooti's alleged activities .
" None of the congressional representatives are accused of any wrongdoing , and we have no information whatsoever that any of them were aware of the involvement of the Iraqi Intelligence Service , " he said .
According to the indictment , the Iraqi Intelligence Service paid $ 34,000 through an intermediary to Life for Relief and Development , the charity that employed al - Hanooti , to pay the delegation 's travel expenses .
In September 2002 , al - Hanooti traveled to Iraq with three members of Congress whom he believed to be sympathetic to lifting the economic sanctions against Iraq .
The U.S. led an invasion into Iraq , starting the war , in March 2003 .
The indictment did not name the lawmakers , but Democratic Reps. Jim McDermott of Washington , David Bonior of Michigan and Mike Thompson of California made a trip to Iraq at that time .
Watch report about Hussein believing the lawmakers would be sympathetic to lifting sanctions against Iraq »
McDermott spokesman Mike DeCesare said the congressman knew nothing about al - Hanooti .
McDermott was asked to make the trip to discuss children 's health issues because he is a physician , DeCesare said .
Thompson said in a written statement that he made the trip " to learn as much as I could before voting on whether or not to commit U.S. troops to war . "
" The trip was approved by the U.S. State Department , " he said .
" The organization sponsoring the trip was licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets of the Department of Treasury and the United Nations .
Obviously , had there been any question at all regarding the sponsor of the trip or the funding , I would not have participated . "
In his statement , Thompson did not say his trip was connected with the charity .
News reports at the time , including CNN's , said McDermott , Thompson and Bonior traveled to Iraq together , however .
The three came under strong criticism from the Bush administration for arguing the White House was " laying the pretext or the path for war " before U.N. weapons inspectors had begun their work .
Members of Congress are required to file disclosures for any trips they take that are paid for by the government or by private organizations .
McDermott filed a disclosure reporting a trip he took from September 25 to October 1 , 2002 , paid for by the charity named in the indictment .
The disclosure said the trip included stops in Baghdad and Basra in Iraq and in Amman , Jordan , and that its purpose was " fact - finding . "
The cost of McDermott 's portion of the trip , according to the records , was $ 5,510 : $ 5,040 for travel ; $ 320 for lodging ; $ 100 for meals ; $ 50 for " other . "
Neither Bonior nor Thompson are mentioned in McDermott 's filing .
Al - Hanooti appeared in court in Detroit Wednesday .
He was charged with one count of being an unregistered agent for Hussein 's government , one count of violating economic sanctions on Iraq and three counts of lying to U.S. investigators .
He was released on $ 100,000 bond and his passport was confiscated .

Many would say that the Church of Scientology is unsustainable in more ways than one , but few have stopped to consider how that applies to the natural environment .
While Scientologists overtly organize to protect nature and profess to protect the planet many of their practices seem to contradict their statements .
The overall effect seems to be alarmism couple with inaction : all of the theoretical zest of GreenPeace with all of the inaction of President Bush .
Here are some of the ways in which Scientology seems to skew environmental issues and play on public opinion without a correspondingly set of proactive strategies .
This side of Scientology seems to have been lost in the scandalous shuffle of recent news but Scientology ’s mixed messages and actions on the environment are also important .
Strange Science : Putting aside questions of science versus pseudoscience , dsagree or agree with climate change , the infamous Hubbard Electrometer is purported to measure mysterious “ environmental toxins ” in one ’s bloodstream .
This “ technology ” is misleading at best as well as a waste of resources , from the mechanical components in these myriad devices to the endless pages of paper wasted while producing “ diagnoses ” of individuals .
Perhaps worst of all this strange emphasis on mysterious environmental factors distracts from actual environmental issues .
Global Apocalypse : Still , the E - Meter is n’t their only environmental concern – Scientology is also worried about the future of the planet .
Still , if Scientologists are truly concerned with saving the Earth , which in their words may “ no longer support life [ within our ] lifetime , ” then why focus on graffiti removal and other short - term city beautification projects ?
Were this global apocalypse truly a concern for them it would seem that their priorities do n’t align with their concerns about the world .
Why worry the small things if the entire planet is at stake ?
Mixed Recycling : Recycling is in fact an overt priority for Scientology in theory which appears to go unfulfilled in actuality .
One of their own organizational loci , the Flag Service Organization , completely fails to recycle even basic soda cans .
Moreover , the Church of Scientology prints its pamphlets , magazines and fliers on glossy , heavy , non-environmentally friendly paper before sending them around the world to likely wind up littering streets and tossed into garbage cans .
No , they are n’t evil for failing to recycle , but it seems incongruent to publicly advocate recycling and clean living but not to recycle in - house .
What Does it All Mean ?
Sure , the Church of Scientology puts on a great show for the public .
They are active in local settings picking up trash , cleaning up parks and removing graffiti – all things that others outside the organization can see , appreciate and identify with .
But one has to wonder if that ’s not precisely the point : are they perhaps just focusing on the most obvious sustainable actions for the purposes of improving public perception of the organization and recruiting new individuals to it ?
Environmentally speaking they are perhaps at best stuck in a previous generation ’s thought patterns , when it was believed that little things made the big differences in the end , or at worst just putting on a good show .
SportsCenter 's " Greatest Highlight " bracket culminates with the 1980 U.S. hockey team 's Miracle on Ice going up against Boise State 's Statue of Liberty play from the 2007 Fiesta Bowl .

20 . Rodney McCray goes through the outfield wall
We begin our video journey with a classic minor league baseball clip .
Vancouver Canadians outfielder Rodney McCray crashed through the wall at Portland 's Civic Stadium in pursuit of a deep fly on May 27 , 1991 , providing Jumbotron blooper fodder in perpetuity .
Fifteen years later , the Portland Beavers paid tribute to McCray with a bobblehead of him crashing through the fence .
19 . Rod Allen charges the mound
If you live in Michigan or have the MLB Extra Innings package , you probably know Rod Allen as the analyst for Tigers TV broadcasts .
He also played three seasons in Japan ( 1989 - 1991 ) and put a memorable scare into a pitcher over there .
18 . Greg Paulus : Hall of Fame flopper
Give Paulus credit for never giving up .
As Duke was headed for a first - round upset loss to Virginia Commonwealth in the 2007 NCAA Tournament , he tried to draw a charge .
Instead , Paulus might be guilty of the worst flop ever .
17 . Unbelievable high school football ending
In the 1994 Texas high school playoffs , Plano East turned a late 24 - point deficit into a three - point lead thanks to three consecutive onside kick recoveries .
It gets even better after that .
Make sure to watch the entire clip for a surprise ending and riveting commentary .

For the first time , researchers have developed a way to view stem cells in the brains of living animals , including humans — a finding that allows scientists to follow the process neurogenesis ( the birth of neurons ) .
The discovery comes just months after scientists confirmed that such cells are generated in adult as well as developing brains .
" I was looking for a method that would enable us to study these cells through [ out a ] life span , " says Mirjana Maletic - Savatic , an assistant professor of neurology at Stony Brook University in New York State , who specializes in neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy that premature and low - weight babies are at greater risk of developing .
She says the new technique will enable her to track children at risk by monitoring the quantity and behavior of these so - called progenitor cells in their brains .
The key ingredient in this process is a substance unique to immature cells that is neither found in mature neurons nor in glia , the brain 's nonneuronal support cells .
Maletic - Savatic and her colleagues collected samples of each of the three cell types from rat brains ( stem cells from embryonic animals , the others from adults ) and cultured the varieties separately in the lab .
They were able to determine the chemical makeup of each variety — and isolate the compound unique to stem cells — with nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy .
( NMR helps to determine a molecule 's structure by measuring the magnetic properties of its subatomic particles . )
Although the NMR could identify the biomarker , but not its makeup , Maletic - Savatic speculates it is a blend of fatty acids in a lipid ( fat ) or lipid protein .
After pinpointing their marker , the team ran two tests to determine the method 's sensitivity and accuracy : First , they injected a bevy of stem cells into a rat 's cerebral cortex , an outer brain layer where neurogenesis does not normally occur .
They then passed an electric current through the animals ' brains ; electric currents induce neurogenesis in the hippocampus , a forebrain structure that is one of two sites ( the other being the subventricular zone ) where new neurons are believed to arise .
After performing each procedure , the team used NMR spectroscopy to capture images of the living rats ' brains .
There was , however , too much visual interference on the scans to find their biomarker .
The researchers called upon Stony Brook electrical engineering professor Petar Djurić to help them come up with an algorithm to cut through the clutter and glean a clear picture of their target compound .
With the analytical method helping to decode their scans , they could clearly see increased biomarker levels in the cortex after a neural stem cell injection .
Similarly , after the animals were given electric shocks , levels of the compound clearly went up in the hippocampus .
The team next turned its attention to humans , enlisting 11 healthy volunteers , ranging in age from eight to 35 , who each spent 45 minutes in an NMR scanner .
Hippocampal scans turned up more of the marker than the cortical images .
In addition , the older subjects showed lower levels of the biomarker than younger ones ( a finding consistent with earlier studies ) .
" This is the first technique that allows detection of these cells in the living human brain , " says Maletic - Savatic .
Fred Gage , a genetics professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , Calif. , and co-author a 1998 report in Nature Medicine that announced the discovery of neurogenesis in the adult human brain , praises the new approach .
" It seems that they are measuring proliferation rather then maturation based on their results , " he says .
" It will be important for them to knock down neurogenesis in a mouse and show that [ this ] signal disappears to confirm the causal link with neurogenesis . "
If the new work is replicated and confirmed , it may allow for faster diagnosis and tracking of myriad psychiatric and neurological conditions .
Among them : chronic depression .
Study co-author Grigori Enikolopov , an associate professor of molecular biology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island , N.Y. , showed last year that antidepressants lead to new nervous system cells , raising questions about the role these cells play in the causation of the ailment .
" Although we are only just beginning to test applications , it is clear that this biomarker may have promise in identifying cell proliferation in the brain , which can be a sign of cancer , " Enikolopov says .
" In other patients , it could show us how neurogenesis is related to the course of diseases such as depression , bipolar disorder , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , MS , and post - traumatic stress disorder . "
Even the “ oldest profession ” that figured so prominently in Mr. Spitzer ’s demise is old news .
Nonhuman beings have been shown to pay for sex , too .
Reporting in the journal Animal Behaviour , researchers from Adam Mickiewicz University and the University of South Bohemia described transactions among great grey shrikes , elegant raptorlike birds with silver capes , white bellies and black tails that , like 90 percent of bird species , form pair bonds to breed .
A male shrike provisions his mate with so - called nuptial gifts : rodents , lizards , small birds or large insects that he impales on sticks .
But when the male shrike hankers after extracurricular sex , he will offer a would - be mistress an even bigger kebab than the ones he gives to his wife  for the richer the offering , the researchers found , the greater the chance that the female will agree to a fly - by - night fling .
In another recent report from the lubricious annals of Animal Behaviour entitled “ Payment for sex in a macaque mating market , ” Michael D. Gumert of Hiram College described his two - year study of a group of longtailed macaques that live near the Rimba ecotourist lodge in the Tanjung Puting National Park of Indonesia .
Dr. Gumert determined that male macaques pay for sex with that all - important , multipurpose primate currency , grooming .
He saw that , whereas females groomed males and other females for social and political reasons  to affirm a friendship or make nice to a dominant  and mothers groomed their young to soothe and clean them , when an adult male spent time picking parasites from an adult female ’s hide , he expected compensation in the form of copulation , or at the very least a close genital inspection .
About 89 percent of the male - grooming - female episodes observed , Dr. Gumert said in an interview from Singapore , where he is on the faculty of Nanyang Technological University , “ were directed toward sexually active females ” with whom the males had a chance of mating .
Significantly , males adjust their grooming behavior in a distinctly economic fashion , paying a higher or lower price depending on the availability and quality of the merchandise and competition from other buyers .
“ What led me to think of grooming as a form of payment was seeing how it changed across different market conditions , ” Dr. Gumert said .
“ When there were fewer females around , the male would groom longer , and when there were lots of females , the grooming times went down . ”
Males also groomed females of high rank considerably longer than they did low - status females with nary a diamond to their page .
Commonplace though adultery may be , and as avidly as animals engage in it when given the opportunity , nobody seems to approve of it in others , and humans are hardly the only species that will rise up in outrage against wantonness real or perceived .
Most female baboons have lost half an ear here , a swatch of pelt there , to the jealous fury of their much larger and toothier mates .
Among scarab beetles , males and females generally pair up to start a family , jointly gathering dung and rolling and patting it into the rich brood balls in which the female deposits her fertilized eggs .
The male may on occasion try to attract an extra female or two  but he does so at his peril .
In one experiment with postmatrimonial scarabs , the female beetle was kept tethered in the vicinity of her mate , who quickly seized the opportunity to pheromonally broadcast for fresh faces .
Upon being released from bondage , the female dashed over and knocked the male flat on his back .
“ She ’d roll him right into the ball of dung , ” Dr. Barash said , “ which seemed altogether appropriate . ”
In the case of the territorial red - backed salamander , males and females alike are inclined to zealous partner policing and will punish partners they believe to have strayed : with threat displays , mouth nips and throat bites , and most coldblooded of all , a withdrawal of affection , a refusal to engage .
Be warned , you big lounge lizard : it could happen to you .
Zane Mohammed , a gangly 19 - year - old with an earnest face , watched with curiosity as the first Islamists in his Baghdad neighborhood came to barbershops , tea parlors and carpentry stores before taking over the mosques .
They were neither uneducated nor poor , he said , though they focused on those who were .
Then , one morning while waiting for a bus to school , he watched a man walk up to a neighbor , a college professor whose sect Mr. Mohammed did not know , shoot the neighbor at point blank range three times , and walk back to his car as calmly “ as if he was leaving a grocery store . ”
“ Nobody is thinking , ” Mr. Mohammed said in an interview in October .
“ We use our minds just to know what to eat .
This is something I am very sad about .
We hear things and just believe them . ”

By 2006 , even those who had initially taken part in the violence were growing weary .
Haidar , a grade - school dropout , was proud to tell his family he was following a Shiite cleric in a fight against American soldiers in the summer of 2004 .
Two years later , however , he found himself in the company of gangsters .
Young militia members were abusing drugs .
Gift mopeds had become gift guns .
In three years , Haidar saw five killings , mostly of Sunnis , including that of a Sunni cab driver shot for his car .
It was just as bad , if not worse , for young Sunnis .
Rubbed raw by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , a homegrown Sunni insurgent group that American intelligence says is led by foreigners , they found themselves stranded in neighborhoods that were governed by seventh - century rules .
During an interview with a dozen Sunni teenage boys in a Baghdad detention facility on several sticky days in September , several of them expressed relief at being in jail , so they could wear shorts , a form of dress they would have been punished for in their neighborhoods .

EXPLOSIVE TRUTH ABOUT PEARL HARBOR : THE STORY THE REST OF THE MEDIA WON'T TELL
REPORT BY JOSEPH LEIB
What you 're about to read will amaze and astound you .
More than 40 years after Japan 's cowardly sneak attack on Pearl Harbor , HUSTLER has uncovered unquestionable factual evidence that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt knew almost to the hour when the Japanese assault would begin - and deliberately did nothing to prevent it .
In fact , he had been working on his celebrated " Date Which Will Live in Infamy " speech several days before swarms of Jap bombers and fighter planes demolished the U.S. fleet and killed in excess of 2,400 American citizens .
Now , for the first time , HUSTLER reveals the incredibly sordid story of how our 32nd President sold his country down the river .
There was an eerie calm over Hawaii that morning .
Perhaps it was a silent warning of what was to come .
On every prior Sunday , for nearly two months , U.S. Navy carrier - based fliers posing as enemy aviators had conducted mock bombing raids while Army antiaircraft batteries directed simulated fire in defense of the island .
Just a week earlier the sky over Oahu has resembled a three - ring circus as Navy planes circled , dove and buzzed the decks of the mighty Pacific Fleet 's warships lying in anchor at Pearl Harbor .
But Sunday , December 7 , 1941 , was different .
With just a few exceptions nearly all the Navy 's and the Army 's aircraft were on the ground .
No army gunners were ready at their posts .
Not a single Navy reconnaissance plane was in the air .
Instead , the fighters , bombers , patrol planes , transports and trainers were carefully lined up on runway aprons - wing to wing , tip to tip , in perfect target position .
The sailors of the fleet were also unaware that the clear blue sky above would soon begin raining death and destruction on their gently lolling ships .
Except for the carriers Enterprise and Lexington - which were at sea along with a few heavy cruisers and destroyers - virtually the entire Pacific Fleet was in the harbor .
Curiously , though the USS Ward reported sinking a submarine in the prohibited area off Pearl at 6:45 a.m. , no alert was sounded .
Instead , each vessel 's crew routinely prepared for Sunday religious services .
Aboard the battlewagon USS Arizona the members of the band were excused from performing at morning muster since they had won second place in a contest the night before .
They snoozed contentedly , little knowing that their bunks would soon become their eternal resting place and the ship their tomb .
At 7:50 a.m. swarms of Japanese planes swept over the island .
From the north , bombers roared over the Army 's Schofield Barracks and past Wheeler Field toward the fleet .
Another force came from the east , attacking Kaneohe Field , then Bellows Field and on to the harbor .
From the south a third group of planes pock - marked Hickam Air Field with bomb craters and ignited a chain of exploding U.S. planes before continuing toward the helplessly moored warships .
In rapid succession the battleship USS Utah and the light cruiser USS Raleigh were struck by torpedoes from the diving Japanese planes .
A single torpedo crippled both the Oglala and the Helena .
Moments later an 1,800 - pound bomb penetrated the Arizona 's deck and ignited fuel and ammunition caches below , sending more than a thousand sailors and Marines aboard her to a watery grave .
Wave after wave of Japanese planes descended on the harbor , bombing , strafing and torpedoing their targets .
By 11 a.m. the attack was over ; only the flotsam and jetsam of a once - mighty fleet was left bobbing in its wake .
A terrible price in lives and equipment had been paid .
More than 2,400 men were killed outright or died of their wounds soon after .
Another 1,178 were wounded .
A total of 18 vessels - eight battleships , three light cruisers , three destroyers and four auxiliary ships - were either sunk or knocked out of commission .
Eighty - seven naval aircraft were also destroyed along with 77 Army planes .
Equally devastating , the pride of the U.S. Navy also sank that morning .
By contrast , the Japanese lost only 29 planes , one attack submarine and five midget subs in their daring raid .
As news about the attack flashed across the nation , Americans reacted with shock , fear and then rage and anger .
Yet , as emotions calmed , the inevitable questions were raised .
How could the Japanese fleet sail across the Pacific without detection ?
Where did Japan obtain the detailed information about the deployment of U.S. forces on Oahu ?
Why were our ships and planes lined up so neatly together , inviting attack ?
How could our fighting forces be caught so off - guard ?
How could they be taken so totally by surprise ?
Today , more than four decades later , some of those questions can now be answered .
Most of the players in the tragic drama staged at Pearl Harbor are dead now , their terrible secrets taken with them to the grave .
There is little owed to them .
A far greater debt must be paid to historical truth .
Within hours of the attack on Pearl Harbor , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was hand - correcting a speech he planned to deliver the next evening before a joint session of Congress .
That draft is among my most prized possessions .
In faded pencil , is the unmistakable scrawl of Roosevelt , inserting a word there , a phrase there .
The next day , the third - term President gave one of his best - remembered addresses .
In his lilting , sing - song cadence , Roosevelt called the grieving nation to arms .
He labeled December 7 , 1941 , as " a date which will live in infamy . "
His words were so carefully crafted and eloquent , it was difficult to believe he had managed to compose them in the haste and confusion following the attack .
In fact , the treachery of our nation 's leader rivaled that of the Japanese .
Roosevelt had labored on the speech for days .
He knew well in advance that the Japanese were planning a sneak attack .
He knew to the day , almost to the hour , when the assault on Pearl Harbor would begin .
December 7 , 1941 , held no surprises for Roosevelt , nor for me .
A full week earlier , on November 29 , I learned about the impending attack from an unlikely source - Cordell Hull , Roosevelt 's own secretary of state .
To put the matter into proper perspective , I should explain how and why Hull came to entrust me with the terrible secret of Pearl Harbor .
I arrived in Washington , D.C. , on the same train that carried President - elect Roosevelt in March 1933 .
Though I was only 22 at the time , I moved comfortably within the ranks of movers and shakers who were soon to inherit the reins of government .
My credentials among the Roosevelt crowd were impeccable .
I had organized the first Roosevelt for President Club three years earlier in my hometown of South Bend , Indiana , while FDR himself was still running for reelection as governor of New York .
By the end of 1930 I was directing active clubs in 21 states .
Prior to the Democratic National Convention of 1932 I convinced House Speaker John Nance Garner to issue public statements that he was not a candidate for the Presidency , and helped head off the " Stop Roosevelt " bloc within the party .
As sort of a thank - you , Democratic National Committee Chairman Jim Farley arranged a brief visit with Roosevelt at the governor 's mansion in Albany .
At a private meeting with FDR following his victorious election he suggested I select a post in his administration and submit my application directly to him after the Inaugural on March 4 , 1933 .
Though I had proven my political savvy during the long Roosevelt Presidential campaign , I knew little about the machinery of the government itself .
I was caught on the horns of a dilemma .
Here I was , presented with an opportunity to pick nearly any job in the administration I desired short of a Cabinet post , and I could n't decide .
I wanted a job where I could meet people and rub shoulders with the power - brokers , something in public relations .
Finally , a few weeks after he formally took office , I wrote to Roosevelt and asked for an appointment as chief of the passport division under the jurisdiction of the newly appointed secretary of state , Tennessee Senator Cordell Hull .
By March 27 , Louie Howe , Roosevelt 's closest confidant , had forwarded my request to the State Department , and within a few days Hull himself telephoned to suggest I drop by his office .
Tall and distinguished , with thick - tufted brows poised above kindly eyes , Cordell Hull cut an imposing figure .
He had the carriage and bearing of a king ; yet he never forgot his Tennessee hill - country origins .
With a sincere twinge of sorrow in his voice Hull explained that the job I sought was held by a career civil servant who could not legally be removed , and asked whether I would be interested in an appointment as special assistant to the woman who currently held the post .
After considering his offer for a few days , I thanked Hull for his time and attention but declined the position .
The papers were full of rumors of sex scandals within the State Department , and I decided that that agency probably should n't serve as my initiation into government service .
My meetings with Hull , however , began a cordial , respectful relationship that was to last throughout his nearly 12 years as secretary of state .
Over the next few years I moved through several of the " alphabet soup " agencies President Roosevelt created to focus government attention on the nation 's depressed economy .
At the National Recovery Administration I managed to obtain the participation of the Du Pont Corporation in the NRA 's work .
But soon I recognized that the restrictive codes and regulations imposed by the administration were driving small Mom - and - Pop businesses into bankruptcy and launching chains of conglomerates that changed the very face of American retailing .
Next I began handling complaints for the Agriculture Adjustment Administration ( AAA ) until I witnessed the deliberate slaughter of hogs to keep pork production down .
While millions of families starved and begged for food , the government was directing the destruction of crops , dairy products and animals to prop up prices !
I resigned in protest and took a post in the Treasury Department , which was n't much of an improvement .
As chief of correspondence of the emergency - accounts section in the department 's procurement division , I could watch from a front - row seat while tax dollars were squandered on outrageous programs and federal agencies paid exorbitant sums for equipment that could have been purchased at half the price on the open market .
I argued until I was blue in the face , but it was all to no avail .
The fix was in .
I finally figured that government service was not for me .
Over the next months I began working as a freelance writer for the New York Herald - Tribune , the Pittsburgh Press and the Paul Block newspaper chain , among others .
I also worked for a number of congressmen , writing speeches , handling their public relations and investigating issues .
Meanwhile , Roosevelt was finding that his smooth - sailing ship of state had run into some rough water .
The Supreme Court declared both the NRA and the AAA unconstitutional and challenged other parts of Roosevelt 's New Deal program .
Roosevelt , of course , fought back .
He began behind - the - scenes maneuvers to purge members of the Senate who opposed his pet projects , and blatantly tried to pack the Supreme Court with justices who would be subservient to his whims .
For me that was the last straw .
I publicly broke with the President and began directing my efforts against his tyrannical plans .
At the height of the controversy I wrote to Supreme Court Justice James C. McReynolds and questioned him about the rumors circulating in the capital that he intended to retire .
McReynolds advised me in his reply to " disregard " all the talk about his resignation , and I leaked the text of the letter to my friend Lyle Wilson , Washington bureau chief of United Press .
The story put a damper on Roosevelt 's court - packing plan and spelled defeat for his judicial reorganization proposal in Congress .
Only nine months after FDR took the oath of office for his second term as President , I continued my assault by revealing in the New York Herald - Tribune on October 31 , 1937 , that Roosevelt was hoping for a war in Europe so that he could sidestep the Constitutional provision limiting a President to eight years in office and seek an unprecedented third term .
The story was later reprinted in full in the Congressional Record , only weeks before the election in 1940 .
Of course , my organizing activities against Roosevelt earned me his undying hatred , just as my efforts in his behalf a decade earlier had won his friendship .
But it was clear he had become a demagogue and wanted to be a sort of king or a president - for - life .
I was not alone in that assessment , and my opposition to a third term for Roosevelt also gained for me the fellowship of many politicians and even the grudging admiration of one of Roosevelt 's own Cabinet secretaries , Cordell Hull .
For decades Hull had toiled in service to the nation .
He volunteered for duty in Cuba during the Spanish - American War , and upon his return he rode the Tennessee hills as a circuit judge .
He was elected to Congress in 1907 , and he remained there until Roosevelt beckoned him in 1933 .
Between 1921 and 1924 he had paid his political dues serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
As secretary of state , he suffered in silence while Roosevelt used Undersecretary Sumner Welles - a closet bisexual - to direct foreign policy from the White House , undercutting Hull at every turn .
At first , Hull had ample reason to be patient .
He wanted to be President and told me later that Roosevelt had secretly promised Hull not to seek reelection to a third term .
Roosevelt , Hull claimed , had even vowed to support him for the Democratic nomination .
But unknown to Hull at the time , FDR had made the same guarantee to a score of others .
Months went by - crucial organizing months - while Roosevelt refused to discuss the issue of a third term publicly .
Finally , when FDR made his move , Hull realized he had been betrayed .
By the time Roosevelt 's third term ended in 1944 , Hull would be 72 - too old , he figured , for a tough race for the White House .
Early in 1941 I came upon some incredible information that , if true , could have badly tarnished Hull 's shining political image .
Remembering his personal kindness years before , I wrote to the secretary of state and requested a private audience .
Independently , I managed to confirm the gist of the story that concerted events dating back to the beginnings of Hull 's career in public life .
My intention was merely to get a statement from the secretary of state and then publish the story .
In a series of meetings over the following weeks Hull acknowledged the truth of what I had discovered .
The scene of our meeting in Hull 's office is still etched deeply in my memory : the courtly secretary of state , hunched over in despair , sobbing and pleading with me to keep the story secret .
As Hull related to me the difficult circumstances Roosevelt had placed him in , I began to understand the sorrow and anguish he had suffered .
He 'd had enough , I decided .
I promised Hull never to reveal the information I had obtained , and I have kept that confidence to this day .
Hull told me he never forgave Roosevelt for double - crossing him in 1939 ; yet he remained in office , cautiously and carefully tying to hold together the fabric of U.S. foreign policy .
Hull knew he was the only man in the New Deal Cabinet who had the power and stature to blow the whistle on Roosevelt 's chicanery .
But he remained a loyalist for the good of the nation .
It was clear that war clouds were on the horizon and that a political crisis in the United States could only benefit the enemies of democracy .
It was in this volatile and uncertain atmosphere that Cordell Hull telephoned me early on Saturday , November 29 , 1941 , and asked me to see him in person as soon as possible .
He wanted to discuss a matter of extreme importance with me , and it was a subject of such sensitivity , it could not be talked about on the phone .
There was an obvious note of urgency in his high - pitched voice , and I quickly agreed .
We met outside the State Department ( then housed in what is now known as the Old Executive Office Building next door to the White House ) , and after exchanging brief hellos , walked briskly across the street to Lafayette Park .
As we sat on a bench , Hull was fidgeting nervously , betraying the emotions usually masked by his cool demeanor .
Suddenly , he burst into tears , and his lanky figure shuddered .
I resisted an impulse to drape my arm around his shoulder and waited patiently for him to regain his composure .
Sucking in great gasps of air , Hull began to talk .
His words came slowly at first and then fairly streamed from his mouth .
It was as if he could barely wait to pronounce them he was so anxious to tell the story .
I could only sit in startled silence as Hull told me Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor within a few days , and pulled from his inside coat pocket a transcript of Japanese radio intercepts detailing the plan .
Recovering from my shock , I began to question him .
" Why are you telling me this ? " I blurted out .
" Why do n't you hold a press conference and issue a warning ? "
" I do n't know anyone else I can trust , " he replied , shaking his head .
" I 've confided in some of your colleagues in the past , but they 've always gotten me into hot water .
You 've had the goods on me for months ; yet you 've kept your promise not to publish them .
You 're the only one I can turn to . "
" Does the President know the Japs are going to attack Pearl Harbor ? "
" Of course he does .
He 's fully aware of the plans .
So is Hoover at the FBI .
Roosevelt and I got into a terrible argument , but he refuses to do anything about it .
He wants us in this war , and an attack in Hawaii will give him just the opportunity .
That 's why I can't hold a press conference .
I 'd be denounced by the White House .
No one would believe me ! "
( Hull 's allegations about FBI complicity in the coverup were confirmed more than a month after Pearl Harbor .
A bylined article by United Press reporter Fred Mullen in the Washington Times - Herald declared , " FBI Told Army Japs Planned Honolulu Raid . "
The article explained that the bureau had intercepted a radio - telephone conversation on December 5 , which mentioned details of the planned raid .
Within hours of publication Hoover pressured the newspaper into pulling the story from its later editions . )
After exacting a promise from me never to reveal where I got the document , Hull gave me a transcript of the Japanese message intercepts .
I nearly ran the few short blocks to the National Press Building on 14th Street , where I had an office .
I took the elevator up to the United Press bureau and brushed past the clerks and reporters into Lyle Wilson 's private office .
Wilson was a longtime friend who had used many of my stories in the past .
He was also a chum of Steve Early , Roosevelt 's press secretary ; so I swore him to secrecy before I would reveal the purpose of my visit .
I told Wilson I had just left a high governmental official who gave me unimpeachable evidence that Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked and that Roosevelt knew all about it .
Wilson was incredulous .
He told me my story was simply unbelievable and refused to put it on the United Press wire .
Again I made Wilson swear an oath that he would not divulge what I had told him , and I hurried out of his office .
After a frantic series of calls I finally located Harry Frantz , until recently the cable editor of United Press .
Harry still had excellent connections at the bureau , and he managed to transmit the story on the UP foreign cable - but not the syndicate 's main trunk line .
Though written in haste , the story as it left Washington contained all the important details of what Hull had confided to me earlier that morning .
Yet , somehow , the text was garbled in transmission .
The only newspaper in the whole world to use any portion of the story was the Honolulu Advertiser .
A front - page banner headline in the paper the morning of Sunday , November 30 , " JAPANESE MAY ATTACK OVER WEEKEND ! "
A subhead noted , " Hawaii Troops Alerted " .
Suspiciously , the story did n't mention that the target of the Japanese attack would be Pearl Harbor itself .
The horrible cost paid for that simple omission is well - known .
The gloomy news of the calamity at Pearl Harbor descended on Washington like a pall .
A couple of days later Lyle Wilson phoned and asked me to come to the bureau .
As I walked into his private office , he handed me Roosevelt 's personally edited press release about the " surprise offensive , " saying simply , " I want you to have this . "
" Why are you giving this to me ? " I inquired .
" It will probably be recorded as the most famous speech Roosevelt ever gave ! "
" Steve Early gave it to me , " he replied .
" You see , I told him I knew about the attack and did n't use the story .
It was Early 's way of saying thanks .
I muffed the most important story of my career .
We might have saved thousands of lives . "
Wilson slumped behind his desk and buried his face in his hands .
Clutching FDR 's press release , I sat in an empty chair and wept .
Our review of the Kindle , Amazon 's eBook reader , noted a wide variety of quirks and limitations that the device suffers from .
Although these problems did n't prevent the Kindle from performing its primary function — accessing and reading books — they certainly did n't make it a completely satisfying experience .
Despite these quirks and a relatively high price , Amazon has frequently sold out its entire stock of the device , though the significance of this feat is unclear , given Amazon 's unwillingness to share actual sales figures .
A new batch of Kindles recently reappeared at Amazon , just in time for the company 's quarterly results announcement tomorrow , and the company claims same - day shipping for the devices .
Although that 's too late to help the quarterly bottom line , it is timed nicely to feed into any product announcements that Amazon might make to coincide with its financial conference call .
Ars has heard that Amazon may be on the verge of announcing a Kindle 2.0 , described by a source aware of the launch plans as " the device they wanted to release in the first place . "
Let 's take a look at what that might entail .
A key question is whether the update will be software , hardware , or both .
Given that Amazon has gone through extended periods without any Kindles available , a major revamp of the hardware seems unlikely .
If new hardware were in the works for the short term , it makes little sense to make a new batch of the current version available today .
The new stock is almost certainly not new hardware , as shipping times will put it in the hands of consumers prior to any announcement Amazon makes tomorrow .
So while there is a small chance that Amazon may have fixed some of the minor hardware annoyances , such as the flaky charge indicator , the general hardware configuration appears to be here for a while .
The fact that they 're still selling the current version also suggests that they have committed to this design in all its white - plastic glory .
In the long term , there 's still the option of moving some of the awkwardly - placed controls and of improving the E Ink screen ( color and improved contrast or faster response times , seem inevitable ) .
But Amazon is n't the only one using these screens so , unless they 've managed an Apple - style control over their supplier 's product announcements , we 'll know when this upgrade is coming well in advance .
All of this leaves changes to the software as the most likely candidates for 2.0 improvements .
Realistically , we could only infer what Amazon considered to an acceptable interface based on what was released as 1.0 .
If this does n't reflect what they " wanted to release in the first place , " then all bets on what may change are off .
Still , it 's not too difficult to go through the list of complaints we voiced in our review and figure out what 's likely to be easiest to fix .
We did n't give blog and newspaper content high marks because of the awkward way in which the left - to - right reading model of the Kindle meshed with constantly refreshed news material .
Since Amazon controls the whole widget here — they format the content on their servers and control its display on the Kindle — improvements should be relatively painless .
Plus , Amazon has a number of good RSS readers to act as their models for managing this content .
They also may have the incentive of competition ; a European cell phone network has started testing a dedicated 3G newsreading device .
The stripped - down music player that appeared in the experimental software would be simple to improve and move into the production category ; again , decent music software provides Amazon with plenty of ideas on what to do .
Expect the experimental browser to stay where it is , though .
With Amazon footing the bill for Kindle users '
Internet browsing and dynamic web content not playing nice with the E Ink screen refreshes , the Kindle seems destined to be a web device of last resort indefinitely .
What the Kindle needs most , however , is a coherent vision for its user interface .
The progress for user - driven activities is displayed in different locations , sometimes using different graphics , and is frequently absent entirely .
The scrolling LCD to the right of the E Ink screen allows simple dynamic displays , but it 's used inconsistently .
A top - to - bottom rethinking of how the device keeps its users engaged and informed would require a lot of work , but such a usability reboot is probably the most significant thing that Amazon could bring to a Kindle 2.0 .
On the theorem of Pythagoras
For the theorem of Pythagoras , I start from Coxeter 's formulation ( " Introduction to Geometry " , p.8 )
" In a right - angled triangle , the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the two catheti . "
Let us play a little bit with that formulation .
In a triangle with sides a , b , and c — different from 0 so as to make its angles well - defined — we introdue the usual nomenclature α , β , and γ for their respective opposite angles .
( We introduced one angle name so as to be able to express right - angledness , and the other two for reasons of symmetry . )
A formal expression of Coxeter 's formulation is
γ = π/2 ⇒ a 2 + b 2 = c 2 .
Besides the nomenclature we introduced , this formulation contains the ( transcendantal ! ) constant π.
Fortunately we can eliminate it thanks to
π = α + β + γ .
α + β = γ ⇒ a 2 + b 2 = c 2 .
(0 ) α + β = γ ≡ a 2 + b 2 = c 2 .
α + β ≠ γ ≡ a 2 + b 2 ≠ c 2 .
Elementary arithmetic yields the equivalent formulationIs n't that nicely symmetric ?
It immediately suggests — at least to me — the strengthening ( This will turn out to be a theorem . )
We get an equivalent formulation by negating both sides :
But x ≠ y ≡ x < y ∨ x > y , and the latter disjuncts are mutually exclusive .
Remembering that the larger angle is opposite to the larger side , is it bold to guess
α

Bold perhaps , but not unreasonable .
( 1) and ( 2 )
Note that ( 0 ) , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are not independent : from any two of them , the third can be derived .
They can be jointly formulated in terms of the function sgn — read " signum " — given by

sgn.0 = 0 ∧ ( sgn.=1 ≡>
0 ) ∧ ( sgn.= - 1 &equiv< 0 ) , viz. sgn . ( ) = sgn . ( ) .
Consider now the following figure .
We have drawn
the case α + β < γ , in which the triangles Δ CKB and Δ AHC , of disjoint areas , do n't cover the whole of Δ ACB ; denoting the area of Δ XYZ by " XYZ " we have in this case
CKB + AHC < ACB .
In the case α + β = γ , H and K coincide and we have
CKB + AHC = ACB ,
α
β
γ
CKB + AHC > ACB .
sgn . ( α + β - γ ) = sgn . ( CKB + AHC - ACB ) .
and in the case , the two triangles overlap and we have
In summary
The three areas of the right - hand side are those of similar triangles and hence have the same ratios as the squares of corresponding lines , in particular
CKB / a 2 = AHC / b 2 = ACB / c 2 > 0 ;
sgn . ( CKB + AHC - ACB ) = sgn . ( a 2 + b 2 - c 2 ) ,
henceHence we have proved
sgn . ( α + β - γ ) = sgn . ( a 2 + b 2 - c 2 ) ,

a theorem , say , 4 times as rich as the one we quoted from Coxeter .
The title of this note could make one wonder why I would waste my time flogging a horse as dead as Pythagoras 's Theorem .
So let us try to summarize what we could learn from this exercise .

 Three cheers for formalization !
Instead of setting out to provefor a right - angled triangle , we included the antecedent γ = π / 2 in the formal statement of what was to be proved .
It was only after the introduction of π that we could eliminate it and met the " nicely symmetric " formulation . 
Three cheers for the equivalence !
It makes quite clear that the theorem is not about right - angled triangles , but about triangles in general .
Three cheers for the notational device captured in sgn .
If we had not been careful , we would have ended up provingforany of the six relations = , ≠ , , and ≥
No cheers at all for that stage of the argument in which lack of axiomatization forced us to resort to a picture .
Pictures are almost unavoidably overspecific and therby often force a case analysis upon you .
Note that I carefully avoided the pictures for ; there are 9 of them : to the right of , coincident with , and to the left of , and similarly for the pairand .
For the argument these distinctions are irrelevant but , when drawing a picture , you can hardly avoid making them . 
One of these days I would like to find a convincing explanation of the circumstance that youngsters continue to be educated with the theorem of Pythagoras in its diluted form as quoted from Coxeter .
Notice that the 9 figures could have been avoided by also provingi.e. proving ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) in full . 
Notice that our figure was not pulled out of a magicians hat !
As soon as sgn . ( ) occurs in the demonstrandum , it is sweetly reasonable to construct that difference .
In order not to destroy the symmetry betweenand , one starts withand subtractsat the one side andat the other : and this is the germ of the figure we drew .
I am in a paradoxical situation .
I am convinced that of the people knowing the theorem of Pythagoras , almost no one can read the above without being surprised at least once .
Furthermore , I think that all those surprises relevant ( because telling about their education in reasoning ) .
Yet I do n't know of a single respectable journal in which I could flog this dead horse .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States on Wednesday urged China to stop vilifying the Dalai Lama and instead talk to the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader in order to achieve peace and stability in troubled , Chinese - ruled Tibet .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ The Chinese government should seize the opportunity to talk to those Tibetans , represented by the Dalai Lama , who oppose violence and do not seek independence for Tibet , ” Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte told a U.S. Senate hearing .
“ Public vilification of the Dalai Lama will not help defuse the situation , ” he said of China ’s angry tide of statements since protests erupted across Tibet in March .
Negroponte told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China ’s response to U.S. attempts to persuade Beijing to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama and to allow diplomats or other observers into troubled Tibet have been “ minimal at best . ”
Lack of access to tightly controlled Tibetan areas in China wee a concern because China had detained some 4,000 people and
“ reports of mistreatment of detainees are numerous , ” he said .
Negroponte said China would not achieve the stability it seeks without resolving grievances built up over decades of Chinese rule , and failure to work with the 72 - year - old Buddhist leader would cede ground to extremists in the Himalayan region .
“ Through outreach and genuine dialogue , China and the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of the vast majority of Tibetans , can begin to bridge differences , explore the meaning of genuine autonomy and address long - standing grievances , ” he said .
Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of being behind March 14 riots in Lhasa and unrest that followed in other ethnic Tibetan areas , as part of a bid for Tibetan independence and to ruin the coming Olympic Games .
The Dalai Lama has said he wants autonomy for Tibet , not a separate state , and has denied he orchestrated the unrest , which China says killed 19 people .
Exiled Tibetans have given a far higher death toll .
Hollywood actor Richard Gere , chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet , dismissed China ’s account .
He said the protests had no connection to the Olympics and were “ not instigated by the Dalai Lama , no matter what the Chinese authorities have so offensively claimed . ”
U.S. President George W. Bush should “ throw some weight behind this issue and become publicly engaged , ” he told the Senate panel .
Bush awarded the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal last October , but “ today , when Tibetans are in their greatest moment of need , we have heard only a passing comment from the president , ” Gere said .
The situation has resulted in demonstrations against and attacks on the Olympic torch as it travels around the world ahead of the summer games in Beijing .
The Dalai Lama met Paula Dobriansky , the U.S. special envoy for Tibet , in Michigan on Monday and told her he appreciated U.S. concern with China ’s handling of the political unrest in Tibet , adding : “ At this moment we need your help . ”
If you thought the Microsoft - Yahoo courtship was intricate before , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
What 's the news ?
The Wall Street Journal reports that Yahoo is hoping to merge with Time Warner 's AOL division , and then buy back stock in the combined entity at prices in the mid $ 30s .
Time Warner would most likely throw in a few billion dollars to seal that deal , and this tricky sequence of dance steps would move the extra cash off Yahoo's balance sheet before Microsoft could put its grubby hands on the new loot .
A deal like that could push up the legitimate price tag for Yahoo by as much as $ 10 billion and establish a new baseline for its share price , possibly pushing the company out of Microsoft 's price range .
The same article also notes that Microsoft has been working the phones , too .
Steve Ballmer is talking to Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp. crew to set up a three - way deal that would combine MySpace , Yahoo , and MSN into a single company .
News Corp. has $ 3.5 billion of cash on hand , and could add some heft to the purchase price ( though the company also has $ 13 billion in long - term debt , unlike Microsoft which is debt - free ) .
We have discussed the merits of an AOL - Yahoo combination before , and nothing much has changed in those dynamics .
I 'd much rather see Yahoo tacking on the AOL portal to its online real estate than watch the company getting dragged under the Microsoft umbrella , kicking and screaming .
This is the first time we 've heard of Murdoch lining up on Ballmer 's side of the proceedings , and I have to admit that the idea sounds intriguing .
Diluting the threat of clashing corporate cultures by adding MySpace as a buffer could take some of the pain out of a Microsoft deal , particularly if the companies could figure out a way to distance the three - headed online beast from Microsoft proper , just a little bit .
Redmond could actually suck in this combination and then spit it out again as a freestanding spin - off under the Yahoo name , with majority ownership and financial interests remaining in Washington State .
For a recent example of this kind of structure , have a look at EMC - VMware , where EMC holds 98 percent of the voting power in its former subsidiary .
The upshot
I 'm still not convinced that Microsoft would be a good fit with Yahoo , regardless of any third parties thrown into the mix , but if it has to happen , this sounds like the best idea so far .
It sure beats a nasty proxy battle , which looked like a near - certain outcome only yesterday .
But if Murdoch is willing to spin out MySpace to combine with MSN and Yahoo , then why not with Yahoo alone ?
That still looks to me like the best solution available , even preferable to Yahoo standing all alone .
But any love is good love , and you take what you can get .
The question is only which suitor 's big brown eyes can melt Jerry Yang 's heart .
The finale is drawing near .
Most of the bionic eye systems we 've seen involve clunky glasses - cam headgear , but the implantable camera now being developed at UCLA does it straight Terminator - style and keeps your face unencumbered .
The camera , which researcher Michelle Hauer and her team recently filed a patent for , is small enough to be implanted directly on the eye 's lens , and feeds image data to a chip at the back of the eye , where it can either be fed into the optic nerve to aid the blind , or just into a portable hard drive to aid the creepy .
Hauer says power will come from on an onboard battery , but we 're more interested in the mention of " optical control signals " in the patent application -- and by " interested " we mean " terrified of a zombie android army . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration picked Gen. David Petraeus , its top commander in Iraq , on Wednesday to take charge of operations across the Middle East and chose his former No. 2 to take over in Baghdad .
The decision to elevate both Petraeus and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno , who together implemented a new military strategy that drove violence down in Iraq , signals that Washington does not plan any major changes in its approach to that war .
It also shows the Pentagon ’s desire to apply Petraeus ’ experience in fighting insurgencies to Afghanistan , where violence has soared as the Taliban and al Qaeda regrouped .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called Petraeus the most qualified general to lead the U.S. Central Command , manage counterinsurgency operations in both wars and face threats including Islamist extremism throughout the region .
“ I do n’t know anybody in the United States military better qualified to lead that effort , ” Gates said .
President George W. Bush has approved both recommendations and will send the nominations to the U.S. Senate , Gates said .
The White House asked the Senate to act on the nominations quickly , by the end of May , but Gates said he did not expect the changes to take effect until “ late summer or early fall . ”
If confirmed by the Senate , Petraeus will replace former Adm. William Fallon , who resigned after a reported break with the Bush administration over Iran policy .
His nomination also puts an Army general , rather than a Navy admiral , back in charge of the two ground wars .
IRAN , PAKISTAN PORTFOLIO
Central Command is considered the toughest regional military command to lead .
There , Petraeus will oversee U.S. operations in a region that includes Iran , Pakistan and 25 other countries as well as international waters that are both strategically and economically significant , such as the Gulf .
It also includes the Strait of Hormuz , arguably the most prominent choke point in the global crude oil trade , handling more than a third of total water - borne crude oil shipments .
Petraeus will face competing requirements for troops and equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He also will be responsible for supporting Pakistan ’s counterterrorism efforts and managing rising tensions with Iran .
Army Gen. David Petraeus , commanding general of Multi-National Force - Iraq , answers a question during a meeting with members of the Department of Defense press pool travelling with Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates in Baghdad , in this December 6 , 2007 file picture .

“ Each is at least as important to America ’s long - term security as the Iraq conflict , yet the United States does not have as direct a role or as much influence in Iran or Pakistan as it ’s had and still has in Iraq , ” said Michael O’Hanlon , an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Both Petraeus and Odierno have spoken out strongly on Iran , saying it is the most serious long - term threat to Iraq .
Some Democrats said they worry Petraeus will focus too heavily on Iraq as head of Central Command , neglecting other national security threats .
“ Congress must ensure that Gen . Petraeus does not bring an Iraq bias to his new job , at the expense of America ’s broader security needs , ” said Sen. Joseph Biden , a Delaware Democrat and chairman of the Senate committee on foreign relations .
Gates said he spoke with senior senators and did not expect problems with the nominations .
COUNTERINSURGENCY
APPROACH
When Petraeus arrived in Iraq in February 2007 , the country was on the verge of all - out civil war between majority Shi’ites and minority Sunni Arabs .
Petraeus implemented a new strategy , ordering his troops to leave the relative safety of big bases and set up smaller outposts with Iraqi forces to better protect the population .
His strategy , coupled with the addition of about 30,000 more U.S. troops , was widely credited with driving violence and casualties down throughout the country .
That strategy created enough relative calm for Iraqi lawmakers to advance legislation seen by Washington as critical for long - term stability , although U.S. officials still see the political progress as insufficient .
“ The course , certainly that Gen. Petraeus has set , has been a successful course .
So , frankly , I think staying that course is not a bad idea , ” Gates said .
Petraeus ’ counterinsurgency approach could have the most impact on Afghanistan , where a NATO - led force has struggled to hold on to security gains against the Taliban and al Qaeda .
The United States plans to add troops to that war zone .
Gates noted that the U.S. military has had success in the area of Afghanistan it controls -- the eastern region .
“ The question is , how do we do a better job with our allies ” in Afghanistan ’s restive south , Gates said .

APRIL 7-- Faced with a lawsuit by a Pittsburgh couple who claims that their privacy was invaded by Google 's " Street View " mapping technology , the search giant has removed images of the family 's home from its servers .
Several photos of the Oakridge Lane home of Aaron and Christine Boring have been yanked from Google Maps and replaced with a black image , as seen here .
But while photos of the Boring property have been scrubbed , a more intrusive series of photos of a neighboring home remain on Google ( and can be found here and here and here ) .
The home of Janet and George McKee is the only property on Goldenbrook Lane , a narrow , gravel path off Oakleaf Lane , a two - way street .
The McKee residence is at the end of Goldenbrook Lane , which the family was able to name at the time their home was built in 1993 .
As the " Street View " images show , a Google vehicle - - outfitted with a roof - mounted camera taking 360 - degree images -- drove down the gravel path and onto the paved driveway leading to the McKee home .
The Google car continued past the steps leading to the McKees 's front door and came to a stop outside the house 's three - car garage ( and next to the family 's trampoline and portable basketball rim ) .
Taking photos all the time , the Google vehicle was squarely on private property , a fact that presumably should have been apparent when the gravel path became paved .
Janet McKee , who was unaware of the " Street View " images until contacted by TSG , said that it was " a little bit creepy to think of someone filming our home without me knowing about it . "
She said that the property line began with the paved driveway .
A photo of the McKee property can be found on Allegheny County 's Office of Property Assessments web site , but that image was snapped from a distance -- not from the family 's backyard , as was Google 's preference .

NEW YORK ( Billboard ) - With their digital download sites , a growing number of indie rock labels have begun to answer the prayers of fans who would love to hear long - out - of - print singles on their iPods or other mobile devices .
Merge Records became the latest to join the field with the recent launch of its online emporium , which , according to label president Mac McCaughan , features “ high - quality MP3s and full FLAC ( free lossless audio codec ) files of recent , older and out - of - print titles , including all the early Merge singles , as well as the Superchunk ‘ Clambakes ’ series . ”
The store will also eventually host exclusive tracks , remixes and video content , in addition to the label ’s catalog .
Given the wealth of options available to indies that want to peddle their merchandise online , why would a label want to sink the time and money into developing its own store ?
Merge would n’t divulge how much it cost to build its online store , but it did say that most of the expenses were upfront .
And whatever profits it makes will go directly to the label and bands , Merge publicist Christina Rentz said .
“ There is no middleman taking fees , so we are the only ones who benefit . ”
The ability to promote artists on label download sites is also key .
Rentz said that through a “ recommended artists ” feature on the Merge site -- similar to Amazon ’s -- the label will promote lesser - known or older artists .
Such sites can also help foster a new ethic of digital - song ownership .
After a song is purchased at Seattle label Sub Pop ’s download store , launched in fall 2007 , “ you can log on to your account page and download it as many times as you want , ” director of technology and digital development Dean Hudson said .
“ We are also able to do things like automatically upgrade songs without any cost to the buyer once the song becomes available at a higher bit rate .
And of course , all the songs are ( digital - rights - management ) - free . ”
CHANGING BUYERS ’ HABITS
Perks like those aside , driving buyers to a single - label online store can be a challenge , especially if they are used to purchasing all their music from one , multilabel outlet , such as eMusic or iTunes .
Def Jux , one of the first indie labels to start a download site , circumvents the problem by making its Web site and Web store one and the same .
Many other labels ’ digital stores are directly connected to their online physical stores as well , so that users can purchase T - shirts , CDs and MP3s all at once .
“ We are counting on our mail - order customers being our early adopters , ” Rentz said .
“ Our goal is to make it a real one - stop shop . ”
Most of those one - stop - shop customers are n’t trying to replace long - lost discs from their high school years , however .
In fact , label representatives say that new releases account for the bulk of their online sales .
“ Our highest growth months have always been those with new releases , ” Def Jux general manager Jesse Ferguson said .
“ They tend to bring the most new people to the site . ”
Hudson noted a similar phenomenon : “ People do dip into the catalog from time to time , ” he said .
“ But in general , the newer stuff sells . ”
And when the newer stuff does sell , it sells for pretty much the same price it would on iTunes .
Merge will sell its tracks for 99 cents each ; Def Jux ’s albums are $ 9.95 each , and Sub Pop ’s are $ 9.90 .
McCaughan said he chose the price structure for philosophical reasons : “ Driving down the price of downloads will devalue the music . ”

Although the young woman said that her family was relatively well off and that she was receiving a good education , the future was bleak here even for someone like her because the system favors the Han .
“ I ’m not even sure I can get a job after graduation , ” she said .
“ For rich Tibetans and for officials , they send their children out to Chengdu or Beijing . ”
A sense of the fear many Tibetans live with could be heard in the comments of a religious leader in Aba Prefecture in Sichuan Province , the site of a protest by monks and others this week in solidarity with the Lhasa demonstrations , and the scene of a subsequent fierce crackdown .
“ I only know that the Communist Party is good , that they are good to us , ” said the religious leader , Ewangdanzhen , when asked about official explanations that have blamed the Dalai Lama for the protests .
“ I only believe in the Communist Party .
Splitting is bad .
We want unity and harmony .
We do n’t have any contacts with him and we do n’t need to contact him . ”
Far from giving up on their way of life , though , or renouncing their attachment to the Dalai Lama , the exiled spiritual leader whom the Chinese government has long vilified as a separatist , or “ splittist , ” most Tibetans interviewed while dodging heavy police checks during a 450 - mile road trip through Tibetan areas in Gansu and Qinghai Provinces professed near - universal devotion to the Dalai Lama , and vowed to continue resisting government attempts to control their faith .
“ All Tibetans are the same : 100 percent of us adore the Dalai Lama , ” said Suonanrenqing , a 40 - year - old resident of a Tibetan village in Jianzha County , in Qinghai Province .
Asked about China ’s decision to commandeer an ancient Tibetan religious rite and select the Panchen Lama , the second highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism , in 1995 , and the implications for how Beijing would manage things after the Dalai Lama , who is 72 , dies , Suonanrenqing ’s response suggested indefinite tensions between Chinese and Tibetans .
“ We ’re not sure if it ’s true that the Panchen was appointed by the government , but if it is true , we cannot support him , ” he said .
“ We would n’t support a Dalai Lama appointed by the government either .
These people should be chosen by monasteries . ”
Next time your travel plans take you to Northern Sweden , you should try swinging by Kiruna , the future European base for Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic passenger space program .
Officials there are busy whipping the town into shape for Virgin 's arrival – evaluating their infrastructure , researching weather issues , and working out potential regulatory hurdles with Sweden and the European Union .
Kiruna will join Spaceport America in New Mexico as a Virgin Galactic operating base , and hopes to see flights begin in 2010 or 2011 .
Why did Virgin choose Kiruna , a town of 18,000 located 90 miles north of the Arctic Circle ?
For one thing , Kiruna has a well - oiled marketing machine .
Spaceport Sweden , a consortium of organizations that includes the Esrange Space Center , the ICEHOTEL , and the local airport , is a sort of tourism board charged with making Kiruna the European hub for commercial spaceflight .
One of the town 's major selling points is its stunning views of the Aurora Borealis , which could be viewed up close by passengers on board a spacecraft such as Virgin Galactic 's SpaceShipTwo .
But Spacesport Sweden officials say Virgin Galactic is just one part of the town 's appeal , and are marketing Kiruna as a full - service space - themed vacation destination .
The discriminating visitor can tour Kiruna 's space center , enjoy dog sled rides and helicopter tours of Sweden 's highest mountain , and book a room at the hip ICEHOTEL , which is built out of snow and ice .
To lure Virgin to Kiruna , last year the Swedish government signed a deal agreeing to do the regulatory legwork that would allow the company to operate passenger flights there .
And because the local space center already launches three to five rockets a year , much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place .
So far , more than 250 people from 30 different countries have made firm reservations to catch a ride with Virgin Galactic , and 80 have already begun training .
The company has banked $ 30 million in deposits , and says that another 85,000 people have expressed interest .
Have 200 grand to spare ?
The company is taking reservations now .

Stirling Council said the upside down ticket was not valid
Stirling Council said that although the £ 3.50 ticket was displayed , wardens could not read it .
They claim Marie McGrath was fined because she broke the car park conditions .
Ms McGrath , of Tullibody near Stirling , was fined in January after parking at the temporary railway station car park at Forthside .
She said : " I found the fine on my windscreen and noticed the ticket was upside down .
" I thought it was clear I had made an attempt to display a ticket but when I contacted the council with evidence about it they ignored it and then ended my appeal process .
" I think the council could show a bit of common sense .
I 've got the ticket to prove I had bought one .
It 's not like I was intending to defraud them or looking to deliberately park illegally . "
A Stirling Council spokeswoman said : " The conditions of use of our car parks , clearly displayed at each car park entrance , indicate that a valid ticket must be displayed within the vehicle .
" In this case a ticket was displayed but it was not possible for the car park attendants to determine whether or not it was valid so an excess charge notice was correctly served .
" It is the responsibility of the vehicle owner to comply with the conditions of use . "
In 2004 , they began a movement that changed America .
In 2008 , they 're on the brink of something huge .

The Cost of Israel to U.S. Taxpayers
A Comprehensive Guide to U.S. Aid to Israel
By Shawn L. Twing
Few aspects of U.S. foreign policy are as elusive as U.S. aid to Israel .
Despite severe budgetary constraints and an ongoing battle between congressional Republicans and the White House over the terms of a balanced U.S. budget , there is one thing on which both sides agree : U.S. aid to Israel will not be reduced .
To understand the magnitude of U.S. aid to Israel it is necessary to look past the economic and military components of the U.S. foreign aid budget , of which Israel receives more than one - quarter of the worldwide total ( $ 12.1 billion for fiscal year 1996 ) , to additional amounts disbursed through the budgets of other departments and agencies scattered throughout the U.S. government .
It also is important to understand the terms of these aid components , which include preferential treatment for Israel , exemption from certain U.S. laws and also from the oversight applied to every other U.S. aid recipient , and even disregard of Israeli abuses when they are revealed .
Finally , Israel 's current economic profile suggests that it no longer needs U.S. financial largess .
Nevertheless , a pattern has developed whereby neither Congress nor the White House dares dismantle what Indiana Democratic Representative Lee Hamilton has referred to as Israel 's " aid industry . "
ECONOMIC AID
Since 1949 , U.S. taxpayers have provided Israel $ 23.122 billion in grant Economic Support Funds ( ESF ) and $ 1.517 billion in ESF loans .
An additional $ 94 million in economic grants and $ 588.5 million in loans were given to Israel from 1952 through 1974 under the " Food for Peace " program .
Prior to 1971 , ESF aid was given for program - specific uses which were intended only to purchase U.S. - made products .
After 1971 , ESF funds were provided on a direct - transfer basis to be spent at the discretion of the Israeli government without any U.S. government oversight .
In each fiscal year since 1994 , Israel has used approximately $ 1 billion of its $ 1.2 billion in ESF to cover the interest and principal due on its outstanding loans from the United States government .
Ever since 1984 , the Cranston Amendment , named after its Senate sponsor , California Democrat Alan Cranston , has been attached to every U.S. foreign aid bill .
It compels the U.S. government to provide Israel enough ESF funds to meet its debt burden to the United States .
The Cranston Amendment reads , in part : " It is the policy and the intention of the United States that the funds provided in annual appropriations for the Economic Support Fund[s ] which are allocated to Israel shall not be less than the annual debt repayment ( interest and principal ) from Israel to the United States Government in recognition that such a principle serves United States interests in the region . "
The Cranston Amendment guaranteeing that the amount of Economic Support Funds going to Israel will not fall below the amount of money needed by Israel to repay its loans from the United States government has led to some interesting justifications for continued ESF economic assistance .
Lobbyists for Israel and their sympathizers in Washington argue that current ESF grants really do n't cost American taxpayers anything .
They maintain that providing U.S. taxpayer funds to Israel to pay off debts owed to the U.S. government simply moves money around without actually giving it to Israel .
Anyone who has ever borrowed money from a bank or used a credit card knows that this is nonsense .
Two decades ago the U.S. government borrowed money to lend to Israel on the assumption that the Israelis would pay it back and the U.S. then could use the repayments to repay its own debts .
Now the U.S. government continues to pay interest on the money it originally borrowed to lend to Israel , and also pays the interest on the money Israel borrowed from the U.S .
In January 1992 , after months of heated debate between the administration of President George Bush and the Israeli government and its supporters in American Jewish groups and in Congress , Congress and the White House agreed to provide Israel with $ 10 billion in loan guarantees to be distributed at the rate of $ 2 billion a year over five years .
The legislation accompanying the loan guarantees stipulated that Israel could not use the money to settle Jews in the Israeli - occupied territories .
It provided that the loan guarantees would be reduced by whatever amount the Israeli government spent on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza .
As a result , the $ 2 billion sum was reduced by $ 437 million in FY94 and $ 216.8 million in FY95 based on U.S. government estimates of Israel 's illegal construction in the territories during the previous fiscal year .
In each case , however , President Clinton increased the actual amount of aid to Israel for that year to help offset the reductions in the loan guarantees , thus keeping a promise he made to Israel 's late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that he would not allow the total amount of aid to Israel to drop below the level provided to Israel in fiscal year 1993 .
Israeli officials and lobbyists argue that the $ 10 billion in loan guarantees will not cost the United States anything because the Israeli government borrows the money from private financial institutions .
The U.S. government , however , guarantees the full value of the loans in the event that Israel defaults on repayment , which gives Israel considerable leverage if it asks for U.S. financial assistance to help repay the loans .
Israel has achieved a good international credit rating , thanks to the congressional practice of providing Israel with new grants to cover " repayment " of its loans from the United States government .
This track record makes it likely that the U.S. government actually will absorb some or all of the costs of repaying both the principal and interest on Israel 's new $ 10 billion in U.S. - government - guaranteed debts .
This would involve a cost to the U.S. taxpayers of far more than the original $ 10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Israel .
MILITARY AID
At present the largest component of U.S. grant aid to Israel is the annual $ 1.8 billion military aid package .
Since the U.S. military aid program to Israel began in 1959 , the U.S. government has provided Israel $ 40.28 billion in military aid .
Of this , $ 29.065 billion has been in grants and $ 11.213 billion has been in loans which U.S. taxpayers repay each year .
Since 1985 , however , all of the U.S. military aid component of U.S. foreign aid to Israel has been in the form of grants rather than loans , exactly as has been the case with the economic component of U.S. foreign aid to Israel .
U.S. military aid to Israel reached the $ 1.8 billion annual level in 1987 and , according to pending legislation and congressional and White House promises , it will continue at this level at least through FY97 ( which ends on Sept. 30 , 1997 ) .
The purpose of the military aid package , as elaborated by the administration of Ronald Reagan and both of its successors , is to maintain Israel 's " qualitative military superiority " over any combination of its Arab neighbors .
Proponents of this massive U.S. military subsidy to Israel argue that it is not a total loss for the United States because much of it subsidizes America 's defense industry , especially in the current post - Cold War period when defense contractors are faced with declining orders for military hardware .
The reality , however , is that the $ 1.8 billion foreign military sales ( FMS ) grant to Israel could instead be used to procure defense items needed for U.S. forces .
Consider this : one year of U.S. military aid to Israel could purchase 18 of the much - needed F - 22 next generation fighter aircraft for American pilots , at the staggering price of $ 100 million apiece .
The Pentagon plans to procure for U.S. use more than 400 of the F - 22s over the next two decades .
Eliminating Israel 's annual aid subsidy during that same time frame would accomplish just that , without the additional cost to U.S. taxpayers .
Also ignored by proponents of Israel 's military aid program is the clause written into the grant since 1991 stating that $ 475 million of that $ 1.8 billion package " shall be available only for procurement in Israel of defense articles and defense services , including research and development . "
Normally military aid components of U.S. foreign aid may be used only for purchases of U.S. weapons or training .
Exceptions in the case of military aid to Israel began in fiscal year 1977 , when Israel asked for a " one- time - only " provision to use $ 107 million of U.S. FMS assistance for its Merkava main battle tank .
Congress approved a similar measure in 1983 for $ 300 million for the Lavi fighter .
Since FY91 , the U.S. government has allowed Israel to use $ 475 million each year for investment or purchases from its own defense industry .
Such exceptions , which are not made for other countries receiving U.S. military aid , enable Israel to expand its defense industries , which compete on the international market with U.S. defense firms .
The exceptions for Israel are completely contrary to the original intent of the foreign military sales program .
OTHER BUDGETED ITEMS
Aside from the $ 3 billion given to Israel each year from the foreign aid budget for economic ( $ 1.2 billion ) and military ( $ 1.8 billion ) aid , significant amounts of American tax dollars are channeled to Israel through other means .
These additional expenditures are included in the budgets of the State , Defense and Commerce departments and other federal agencies , and are not included in official estimates of U.S. foreign aid .
In the State Department 's budget for FY96 an additional $ 93.5 million in grants to Israel were allocated as follows : $ 80 million to resettle in Israel Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union ; $ 3.5 million for a regional cooperation agreement with Egypt ; and $ 10 million to pay for Israel 's own foreign aid program .
This brings to $ 993.4 million the total of additional grants provided to Israel from the State Department 's budget since FY73 , when the first refugee resettlement payment was given to Israel .
None of these grants are included in Economic Support Fund or Foreign Military Sales calculations of U.S. foreign aid totals .
The Defense Department also is a major supplier of money , equipment and training to Israel outside the regular foreign aid budget .
In FY90 , $ 100 million worth of hardware was added to the existing $ 100 million U.S. military equipment stockpile in Israel , which is available to Israeli forces in case of a military emergency .
During FY95 , an additional $ 200 million worth of equipment was added , for a total of $ 400 million .
Justification for the placement of the equipment in Israel rests on the assertion that Israel is a U.S. " strategic asset " in the Middle East .
Few , if any , of the Pentagon 's contingency planners and commanders would agree .
In fact , the U.S. Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , the division of the U.S. military charged with protecting U.S. interests in East Africa , the Arabian Peninsula , the Persian / Arabian Gulf , and Southwest Asia , does n't include Israel within its area of responsibility .
Because of the unsettled dispute with the Palestinians , other American allies among the Arab states in the region would refuse to participate in any coalition or regional defense scheme which included Israel .
Evidence of the hollow nature of the " Israel as a strategic asset " justification for U.S. foreign aid came during the Gulf war .
After Iraqi Scud missiles landed in Tel Aviv , Israel insisted that it would use its own air force to destroy the missile launchers in Iraq .
U.S. defense officials feared that Israel 's involvement in the war would rupture the 37 - nation coalition aligned against Iraq .
The Israelis maintain that they eventually agreed not to attack Iraq because of the damage that would have caused the coalition .
In reality , it 's an open secret that the United States refused to give Israel the Identification Friend or Foe ( IFF ) signals that identify friendly aircraft during U.S. military operations .
The truth is , had Israeli aircraft attacked the Iraqis without these codes , the Israeli aircraft probably would have been shot down by coalition aircraft .
The forced diversion of coalition aircraft from the main attack on Iraqi forces to find and destroy mobile missile launchers targeting Israel , and the danger to the coalition posed by Israel 's behavior during the Gulf war exposed the emptiness of the claim by lobbyists for Israel that their client is a U.S. " strategic asset " in the Middle East .
Congressional decisions in 1991 to grant Israel $ 700 million in drawdown authority from U.S. military stocks in Western Europe , followed by an additional $ 75 million drawdown in FY95 , were not well received in the Pentagon .
The drawdown authority was used by Israel to obtain used F - 16 multi-role aircraft , but their categorization as " excess " was false .
The F - 16s given to Israel were not collecting dust in Air Force hangers , they were protecting American national security interests in Western Europe .
Nor was this the first time that U.S. defenses in Europe were jeopardized to protect Israel .
The sharp drawdowns of U.S. equipment in use by American forces in Europe and the U.S. to re-arm Israeli forces during and after the October 1973 war left U.S. components of NATO forces dangerously unprepared for possible Soviet attack for many months .
Significant resentment remains among members of the U.S. armed forces who believe Congress twice put their own and the nation 's safety at risk on behalf of Israel .
Israel 's Arrow anti-tactical ballistic missile is another program of little or no benefit to the United States .
It does n't show up in U.S. foreign aid totals , but it is funded by American taxpayers .
Since its inception in 1988 , the Arrow program has cost the United States over $ 653 million , and U.S. officials have promised Israel at least another $ 711.3 million through FY2001 .
( For a complete breakdown of U.S. aid to Israel 's Arrow program , see the October / November 1995 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , p. 12 . )
The money comes from the budgets of the U.S. Air Force and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and , with the exception of $ 97.9 million of Israel 's " share " paid with U.S. FMS aid money , all of the Arrow 's costs to the United States are in addition to Israel 's portion of the U.S. foreign aid budget .
Israel 's lobbyists argue that the Arrow should not be considered " foreign aid " because it is an example of U.S. - Israeli " strategic cooperation " and both sides benefit from the project .
That is nonsense .
The Pentagon has made it clear that it has no intention of buying the Arrow , a relatively low - technology ATBM unsuited for U.S. defense needs .
Further , the transfer of technology in the Arrow program is decidedly one - way : from the United States to Israel .
It took significant amounts of U.S. - origin technology and technical guidance to get the Arrow off the ground .
Arrow advocates maintain that the technology developed by Israel for use in the Arrow 's seeker , the device which tracks ballistic missiles , aided in the development of the U.S. Army 's high - technology Theater High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) system .
No one , however , is willing to argue that the money spent in Israel on the Arrow program produced better results for U.S. theater missile defense systems than would have been produced by the same amount of U.S. money spent in the United States .
Pentagon funds also go to Israel via U.S. purchases of Israeli - produced or co-produced military hardware .
If these American purchases from Israel were used to offset the cost of Israeli military purchases from the U.S. , it might be considered a normal two - way relationship .
Instead , Israel uses its FMS appropriations from the U.S. foreign aid budget for its purchases from the U.S. , and the U.S. uses Department of Defense funds for its purchases from Israel .
U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for both sides of the two - way trade , but only the Israeli purchases show up in the published totals of U.S. taxpayer - funded foreign aid .
Thus U.S. taxpayers fund the export of U.S. jobs to Israel , since all of the military equipment the U.S. government purchases there also could be purchased from U.S. manufacturers .
Over the past decade the Pentagon has provided funds for research and development and / or purchase of Israeli - made mortar shells , external fuel tanks for CH - 53 helicopters , night - vision equipment , external fuel tanks for F - 15 fighter aircraft , rear stabilizers for F - 16 multi-role aircraft , unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , tank armor upgrades , air - to - ground missiles , attack helicopter targeting systems , a television weapons sighting system , communications equipment and two experimental laser programs .
The Pentagon's FY96 appropriations bill , for example , authorizes $ 20 million for the Hunter UAV ( co- produced by Israel ) ; $ 39 million for the AGM - 142 HAVE - NAP air - to - ground missile ; $ 14 million for reactive tank armor upgrades ; $ 38 million for AH - 1 Cobra attack helicopter night - targeting systems ; an unspecified amount for the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System ( SINCGARS ) and $ 5 million for the Nautilus laser program .
Congress 's decision to include these items in the Pentagon 's funding authorization earned it praise from Israel 's principal Washington , D.C. lobby , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
The Aug. 14 , 1995 Near East Report , a biweekly newsletter published by AIPAC , praised individual congressional committee members by name for their role in promoting this Pentagon - funded " U.S. - Israeli Strategic Cooperation . "
The Immigration and Naturalization Service also purchases equipment from an Israeli company .
In November 1995 , INS officials announced that the Israeli Elbit firm will supply the U.S. border patrol with 500 long - range infrared surveillance systems over five years for a total cost of $ 17 million .
This contract , which is similar to those arranged by the Pentagon , would have to be placed with American companies if the U.S. " Buy American " act were enforced .
Instead , Israeli firms have been exempted by Congress from that piece of U.S. legislation and therefore are allowed to compete with American companies for U.S. government contracts .
The Department of Commerce budget also contains funds for Israel 's use which appear nowhere in U.S. foreign aid totals .
One example is joint sponsorship of the U.S. - Israeli Science and Technology Commission for which , in FY95 , the Department of Commerce provided $ 5 million .
Pending legislation for FY96 requests an additional $ 2.5 million .
This money funds joint technological research by the U.S. and Israeli private sectors .
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ISRAEL
Not only has tiny Israel been the recipient of the largest share of U.S. foreign aid for many years , it also receives its aid from the United States on uniquely friendly terms .
Many congressionally mandated benefits to Israel are applicable to no other recipient nation in the world .
One example is in the way its ESF funds are disbursed .
Unlike all other U.S. foreign aid recipient countries , which receive their funds on a quarterly basis , since 1982 Israel has received its annual foreign aid in one lump sum , usually paid by the end of the first month of the U.S. fiscal year .
In order to provide the full amount to Israel in this manner , the United States government pays between $ 50 and $ 60 million in additional bank charges , which are not deducted from the money given to Israel .
Israel then reinvests the aid money in U.S. Treasury notes , earning between $ 80 and $ 90 million in interest paid by U.S. taxpayers .
The importance to Israel of this unique advance distribution arrangement was highlighted during the recent dispute over anti-abortion language added to the foreign aid bill by pro-life members of Congress .
Because President Clinton refused to sign the bill as it was submitted to him , the impasse held up the distribution of Israel 's aid money .
This led Israeli Ambassador to the United States Itamar Rabinovich to complain about the delay .
" The longer we have the money the more interest we earn , " he explained .
No one in the U.S. government dared to point out that " the longer the U.S. delays in providing the money to Israel the less the U.S. taxpayer has to pay in interest . "
Another benefit Israel receives , along with several other FMS recipients including Egypt , is cash flow financing , which allows Israel to pay only the current - year charges for multi- year FMS contracts .
Other countries that purchase defense items over an extended period of time are required to set the total amount of the contract aside in their FMS account .
Israel pays only the required installment for that year , which analysts say creates a commitment on the part of the United States government to furnish more aid during the following years to pay for the already agreed - to contracts .
Israel also enjoys considerable latitude in its FMS account .
In purely commercial contracts it is common for purchasers to negotiate price offsets based on the incorporation of technology from the purchasing country into the foreign item to be purchased .
In FMS contracts , however , the intention is to provide customers for U.S. defense companies , and offsets are not allowed in items purchased with FMS funds , except , of course , in the case of Israel .
Unlike any other country receiving U.S. FMS credits , Israel can negotiate with U.S. defense companies for offsets from its own ( and largely U.S. - subsidized ) defense industry , thereby lowering the cost of the items it purchases and providing jobs for Israelis by reducing jobs in the American companies providing military goods and services to Israel .
ISRAELI VIOLATIONS OF U.S. LAW
Despite the remarkably generous treatment given to Israel by the United States government , Israel consistently has abused its relationship with Washington and has shown blatant disregard for U.S. laws .
There are two important conditions for receiving U.S. military aid that Israel has violated repeatedly .
Under the Arms Export Control
Act , military hardware provided by FMS funds can be used only for defensive purposes or to maintain internal security .
Israel violated this agreement during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon when it used U.S. - made cluster bombs against both military and civilian targets in Lebanon .
In response , Congress suspended the sale of cluster bombs to Israel , a ban that remains in effect today .
In reality , however , Congress suspended only the sale of cluster bomb casings to Israel , not the bomb components themselves .
Now Israel manufactures its own casings , and procures the rest of the cluster bomb components from the United States .
So far this circumvention of U.S. law has not been challenged .
The most egregious allegations of abuse of the U.S. - Israeli relationship by Israel have arisen from illegal transfers of U.S. technology from Israel to third countries .
According to the Arms Export Control Act , Israel is forbidden from retransferring U.S. - origin defense items to third parties without the permission of the United States government .
However , according to officials in the U.S. intelligence community , the Pentagon and the State Department , Israel has or may have retransferred sensitive U.S. technology to Ethiopia ( during the reign of a communist government there ) , South Africa ( during the apartheid era ) , Chile , Venezuela and communist China .
Among the items allegedly transferred were the Patriot theater ballistic missile defense system and the largely U.S. - funded Lavi next generation fighter ( see the January 1996 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , p. 12 , for the Lavi ; September 1995 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , p. 8 , for Israel 's retransfer of U.S. technology ) .
Israel 's retransfer of U.S. defense technology , virtually all of which is provided to Israel by U.S. taxpayers , threatens U.S. national security , creates unfair competition for U.S. defense firms , and has strengthened regimes guilty of serious human rights abuses or actively working against U.S. national interests .
Israel 's supporters in Congress , however , do not seem to care .
At least nine reports of Israel 's illegal retransfer of U.S. defense items have been given to Congress , including two in January 1995 .
None has had a discernible impact on Israel 's retransfer policies .
Israel continues to receive massive amounts of U.S. aid and then derives additional profits from that aid by breaking the conditions of U.S. aid agreements in ways that export more U.S. jobs and threaten the security interests of the United States .
ISRAEL'S ECONOMY
Supporters of foreign aid in general and aid to Israel in particular argue that America 's foreign aid program is a necessary component of its foreign policy .
In many cases foreign aid can be justified either on the basis of the recipient 's need , the benefits to the United States from providing that aid , or both .
Israel , however , does not meet either of these criteria .
In 1995 , Israel 's per capita Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , the value of a nation 's annual production divided by the number of its citizens , exceeded $ 14,000 , placing it above that of Spain and approaching that of England .
Israel , as Israeli minister without portfolio Yossi Beilin recently pointed out , " is not a poor country . "
Why so much aid then ?
Since Israel is not a needy country , the secondary justification for aid , that a country or countries are so valuable to the donor that aid is justified , generally is invoked in the case of Israel .
Israel 's lobbyists and supporters emphasize Israel 's role as a " strategic asset " and its importance to the United States based on their " special relationship . "
The former argument was not valid even during the Cold War , when U.S. support of Israel was exploited by the Soviet Union to garner allies throughout the Middle East among countries that had no conflict with the U.S. but were bitterly opposed to Israeli occupation of Arab lands .
That Israel remains a strategic liability in the Middle East was vividly demonstrated during the Gulf war .
Then and now U.S. government officials privately expressed anger over the economic and military bonuses demanded by Israel for staying out of the war .
These included $ 700 million in military hardware , a $ 300 million addition to the U.S. military stockpile in Israel and $ 650 million in extra economic support funds for FY91 .
The so - called " special relationship " between the United States and Israel is , in fact , a domestic political arrangement whereby lobbying organizations in the United States , directed by the Israeli government , and a network of political action committees established and , to a large extent , directed by that lobby , reward presidential candidates and members of Congress for continuing massive amounts of U.S. aid to Israel while simultaneously ignoring massive violations of U.S. laws .
At the same time that Congress and the president are locked in a titanic struggle over the size , shape and direction of the federal budget , they have openly agreed , without debate , that in the 1996 fiscal year alone , American taxpayers will provide Israel $ 3.5053 billion ( $ 3,505,300,000 ) in U.S. grants and $ 2 billion in loan guarantees ( see table ) , and they have quietly pledged continued aid at similar levels in the future .
PITTSBURGH , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
After a weekend of playing defense about his " bitter " comments , Sen. Barack Obama went on offense Monday against his Democratic rival and the presumptive Republican nominee .
Sen. Barack Obama participates Sunday in the Compassion Forum at Pennsylvania 's Messiah College .
Obama mocked Sen. Hillary Clinton for throwing back a shot of whiskey in front of TV crews over the weekend and said she must think she 's " doing me a favor " by attacking him and toughening him up for a fall race against Republican Sen.
John McCain .
" I 'm sure that Sen .
Clinton feels like she 's doing me a favor because she 's been deploying most of the arguments the Republican Party will be using against me in November and so it 's toughening me up .
I 'm getting run through the paces here , " Obama told The Associated Press ' annual meeting .
Clinton has been hitting Obama hard after he referred to some small - town Pennsylvanians as " bitter " people who " cling to guns and religion " at a fund - raiser last week .
Obama later said the remarks were badly phrased but accurate .
Watch Obama try to clarify his comments »
On Sunday , Clinton called the comments " elitist , out of touch and frankly , patronizing , " and added , " You know , the Democratic Party , to be very blunt about it , has been viewed as a party that did n't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans . "
Obama opened his remarks to the AP making light of what is being called " bitter - gate . "
" I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made last week .
Some of you might even be a little bitter about that , " he said to soft laughter .
But his offensive began Sunday night when he mocked Clinton for acting like " Annie Oakley ... packin ' a six - shooter " in her attempts to connect with gun owners .
He was referring to Clinton 's efforts over the weekend to appeal to Second Amendment supporters by hinting that she has some experience of her own pulling triggers .
" I disagree with Sen .
Obama 's assertion that people in our country cling to guns and have certain attitudes about trade and immigration simply out of frustration , " she began .
" You know , my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl , " she said .
Asked Sunday when she last fired a gun or attended church services , Clinton said the query was " not a relevant question in this debate . "
Watch Clinton face questions on gun use »
Obama blasted Clinton Sunday shortly before the two appeared at Faith in Public Life 's Compassion Forum at Messiah College in Grantham , Pennsylvania .
" Shame on her , " he told a Steelton crowd .
" I expected this out of John McCain , " Obama said in a decibel higher than his everyday stump tone .
" But I 've got to say , I 'm a little disappointed when I start hearing the exact same talking points coming out of my Democratic colleague , Hillary Clinton .
She knows better .
Shame on her . "
Watch Obama target Clinton »
On Monday , he attacked her for what happened at an Indiana campaign stop over the weekend .
Saying too many candidates are giving voters only rhetoric , the senator from Illinois added , " They 'll promise you anything .
They 'll even give you a long list of proposals .
They 'll even come around with TV crews in tow and throw back a shot and a beer . "
With the national media present , Clinton drank a beer and chatted with voters .
After ordering her beer , the bartender asked , " You want a shot with that Hillary ? "
After some deliberation , Clinton settled on a shot of Crown Royal , a Canadian whiskey .
Responding to Obama 's remarks , Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said , " With all due respect , this is the same politician who spent six days posing for clichéd camera shots that included bowling gutterballs , walking around a sports bar , feeding a baby cow and buying a ham at the Philly market ( albeit one that cost $ 99.99 a pound ) .
Sen .
Obama 's speeches wo n't hide his condescending views of Americans living in small towns . "
Clinton heard a few boos Monday as she continued to criticize Obama .
" I understand my opponent came this morning and spent a lot of his time attacking me , " she said at the same forum where Obama launched his assault .
The crowd responded with audible grumbles , and a few in the hall shouted , " No ! "
Clinton continued , " I know that many of you , like me , were disappointed by the recent remarks he made . "
Watch as CNN's Candy Crowley offers a recap of the ' bitter ' dispute »
This time , a louder , sustained chorus of " No ! " emanated from the audience .
" I am well aware that at a fundraiser in San Francisco he said some things that many people in Pennsylvania and beyond Pennsylvania have found offensive , " she said .
Again , she was met with jeers , which the Clinton campaign said came from Obama supporters .

All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
After recent gaffes confusing Sunnis and Shiites , John McCain has now mixed up Sadrists - followers of Iraqi Shiite militia leader Muqtada al - Sadr - with satirists .
Aboard his campaign plane yesterday afternoon , the Republican presidential candidate answered a question about the dangers of Sadrists waging an all - out war on US troops , saying , " Well , here 's some straight talk for you - I think Sadrists like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have been waging a war on our troops for years .
And it 's about time , my friends , that we face this reality and confront them head - on . "
Attempting to correct the Arizona senator , New York Times journalist Elizabeth Bumiller , the reporter who had asked him the question , said , " Uh , Senator .
I do n't think Stewart and Colbert are the Sadrists I was referring to . "
But McCain , vigorously reiterating his position , replied , " Well , maybe not .
But they 're two of the most popular out there .
Ratings are high , kids love 'em .
Here 's some more straight talk - I 've been on Jon 's show but I 'll admit I was wrong to do it , and I hope my Democratic opponents will have the courage to denounce their associations with him , too .
The point is , anyone with military chops knows the best strategy for victory is to cut the snake off at the head .
My friends , it 's time we take these jokers out . "
When Bumiller tried to correct him one last time , McCain erupted , " Look , I do n't come to your office at the Times , elbow my way threw that Third World newsroom of Marxist homosexual terrorists , and stand over your desk telling you how to type !
So , please - please - my friend , do n't tell me how to win a war ! "
Senator Joe Lieberman ( ?!- CT ) , a fixture at McCain 's side throughout his presidential run , was unable to step forward this time and whisper facts into McCain 's ear as he did during one of the two previous Sunni - Shiite blunders .
Lieberman , observing the Passover holiday , had relegated himself to the Kosher for Passover section of the campaign aircraft .
Stephen Colbert , who responded in character during the taping of Thursday 's scheduled Colbert Report , said , " This is further proof that Senator John McCain has what it takes to lead this country - a limited yet firm grip of the facts , a tenuous hold on reality , and Bunyanesque balls of stainless steel .
Senator McCain , if posing as your patsy to win this war is wrong , then I do n't want to be right .
Hand me a Crave Case of White Castles and an elephant tranquilizer gun , and I 'll take down Michael Moore for you , sir ! "
When notified of John McCain 's comment on the set of The Daily Show , host Jon Stewart stammered , loosened his tie and said , " Huh ... is it hot in here , or is it me ? "
Breaking into a Woody Allen impression , he then added , " Well , I , uh , that 's very interesting .
You 'll have to excuse me .
I , I seem to remember I , I have a plane to catch ... to Peru . "
On MSNBC 's Hardball last night , guest John Amato , proprietor of the popular blog Crooks and Liars , said , " So now we know what to expect .
George W. Bush averted attention away from al Qaeda and Afghanistan to attack Iraq , and John McCain wants to avert attention away from the Sadrists to attack the satirists .
You know , Chris , if Terry Southern and Stanley Kubrick were alive today , they would n't need a script . "
But MSNBC commentator Pat Buchanan countered , " Look , what we have here is a case of turning lemons into lemonade .
Did McCain confuse Sadrists and satirists ?
Maybe he did , maybe he did n't .
But whatever happened , he brought attention to a growing problem - homegrown insurgents , like Stewart and Colbert , who are doing our troops a grave disservice .
I 'm with McCain , I say take 'em out . "
McCain , however , did note that he would spare 70 - year - old comedy legend Rich Little , considering both Little 's magnanimous White House Correspondents Dinner routine the year following , as the senator put it , " Mr. Colbert 's Tet Offensive of comedy , " and because he considers Little more an impressionist than a Sadrist .
Swatting at imaginary flies above his head for a moment , McCain then added , " He 's one Sadrist who 's proved his loyalty to the United States and I honor him for his service . "

Unemployment rates are rising across the United States , except Oklahoma .
That state is experiencing the most dramatic reduction in unemployment since 2007 , an improvement many in Oklahoma attribute to the passage last year by the state legislature of a strong employment - focused immigration reform law .
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday reported unemployment in Oklahoma had fallen to 3.1 percent in March , down from 4 percent in March last year , while unemployment nationwide was 5.1 percent , up from 4.4 percent in March last year .
" Oklahoma is no longer ' OK ' for illegal aliens , " said State Rep. Randy Terrill , who sponsored House Bill 1804 which passed by overwhelming majorities last year in both the House ( 84 - 14 ) and Senate ( 41 - 6 ) of the Oklahoma Legislature .
" The bottom line is illegal aliens will not come here if there are no jobs waiting for them , " Terrill said .
" They will not stay here if there is no government subsidy , and they certainly wo n't stay here if they know that if they ever encounter our state and local law enforcement officers , they will be physically detained until they are deported . "
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
House Bill 1804 , the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007 , has been characterized by USA Today as " arguably the nation 's toughest state law targeting illegal immigration . "
The Oklahoma law imposes strict penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens , makes it a felony to transport or shelter illegal immigrants , forbids the state to issue drivers licenses or pay social welfare benefits to illegal aliens or their families , and empowers state and local police to enforce federal immigration laws .
Last month , the Oklahoma Bankers Association threatened Oklahoma would lose about $ 1.8 billion annually in productivity and wages , largely because House Bill 1804 , which went into effect in November last year , will force an estimated 50,000 illegal immigrants to leave the state .
The group based the conclusions on a study done by economists Russell Evans and Kyle Dean of the Oklahoma - based Economic Impact Group that estimated as many as 70,000 illegal immigrants were living in Oklahoma when the legislation was passed .
Proponents of the law would counter that forcing illegal aliens to leave Oklahoma was precisely the intended effect of the bill .
" The next question to ask would be whether citizens have taken jobs that illegals used to do , " observed blogger Tom Blumer .
" Though the lower unemployment rate does n't in and of itself prove that , it does point strongly in that direction . "
" Will anyone in Old Media dig more deeply into the Sooner State 's situation ? "
Blumer wondered .
" Or will they try to pretend that Oklahoma 's improvement does n't exist , because finding out why might expose some inconvenient truths , and hurt the cause of illegal - immigrant ' amnesty . ' "

The Aztecs had more numbers than we do , or at least symbols denoting numerical concepts .
When it came to measuring land — critical for levying the proper tax or tribute — these medieval Mesoamericans used arrows , hearts , hands and other units representing fractions , according to a new study in Science .
To figure this out , mathematician Maria del Carmen Jorge y Jorge of the National Autonomous University of Mexico ( U.N.A.M ) channeled the mind of an Aztec land surveyor .
That meant retraining herself to use a different numerical system and combing through the Codex Vergara , one of two remaining books that record Aztec land surveying .
Working with geographer Barbara Williams and del Carmen Jorge y Jorge counted 367 fields in this book with both an overall area for the plot of land as well as the lengths of the sides .
Roughly 60 percent of these fields had areas that matched the basic mathematical rule of length multiplied by width or other common surveying calculations .
But the rest were off , usually by a small amount .
And 69 had areas that were prime numbers such as 211 — numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers together , such as 20 times 10 .
Instead , del Carmen Jorge y Jorge determined that the Aztecs were using the equivalent of fractions .
" We found these smaller units of measure that we call monads that have the role of a fraction , " she says .
" We do n't like to call them fractions , though , because they were considered as unitary entities like inches , seconds or minutes . "
To denote half the Aztec basic unit of measure — known by Aztec experts as tlalquahuitl or land rods — the surveyors used an arrow symbol .
So for a field that measured 20 land rods by 10 land rods plus an arrow ( or 20 multiplied by 10.5 ) , the correct area was 210 .
" Two arrows is one unit , five hearts is two units , five hands is three units , " del Carmen Jorge y Jorge notes .
These extra units — arrow , heart , hand , bone and arm — cannot be subdivided further , standing alone as essentially extra numbers .
It is unclear what exactly these measurements equal , but the team speculates that an arrow is the measure of the length from the shoulder to the hand ( like an archer with a taut bow ) , a heart is a measure of the length from that organ to the tip of the hand and a hand as the measure from outstretched hand to outstretched hand — just as an English foot is the measure of a man 's foot .
" That could be an interpretation , " del Carmen Jorge y Jorge says .
" We can not prove it . "
The researchers will next try to assess the accuracy of the Aztec surveyors .
The neighborhood of Asuncion outside Mexico City still bears the markings of the ancient Aztec terraced fields on its hillsides that were recorded in the Codex Vergara .
" We were there trying to measure those terraces , " del Carmen Jorge y Jorge says .
" This is complicated because this is sloping land . "
It is no doubt easier to measure sloping land with modern devices like satellite global positioning systems and computers than it is to try to inhabit an alternative mathematical system and devise the meaning of mysterious symbols — as well as grasp the algorithms that can explain how they were used .
" I can use my math , my computers and whatever I want , " she says .
" With this paper , I am only using hand calculations . "
* This article erroneously referred to a heart as measuring 2.5 land rods .
The correct measurement is two - fifths .

Biology is crucial to understanding psychosis , “ but there is more to psychosis than mere biology , ” says Jason Robert , an Arizona State University bioethicist and philosopher of science .
“ Psychiatrists in particular appear to be grappling with the complexity of classification and diagnosis , ” Robert explains .
“ But I am always worried that the prime material of the psychiatrist – often ill , unhappy people who behave in bizarre ways – will be ignored in favor of DNA tests results or brain images , with almost certainly negative impacts on patient well - being . ”
Robert , an assistant professor in the School of Life Sciences at ASU ’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences , will bring conceptual research and perspective to the subject of cross-cultural issues in defining mental illness during a presentation on Feb. 16 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting .
“ My claim is that gene maps and brain scans will likely not be able to offer universal , culture - free representations of the essence of mental illness .
That is , mental illness is subject to biological and socio-cultural factors , such that isolating any of these as core elements will almost always miss the mark at the expense of patient care , ” he says .
Robert will dissect the notion that personalized medicine is the wave of the future .
“ In many people ’s minds , personalized medicine means medicine tailored to an individual ’s genetic makeup .
We have heard over and over again that genetics and neuroscience will revolutionize medicine , and these claims come with elaborate predictions about new taxonomies of disease , new diagnostic tools , and fabulous new treatments .
“ None of these predictions have borne out , in part because they fail to grapple with the complexity of human beings – as brains , bodies , and , embedded in culture , steeped in history , and dynamically creating their own words , ” he says .
" If we 're really going to have personalized medicine , we have to be focusing not just on the genome , but the person , " Robert says .
He adds that this is an emphasis with medical students in the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix , in partnership with Arizona State University , where he holds a faculty joint appointment .
“ We feel this newest generation of physicians have to be deeply well - trained in genetics and neuroscience , but not at the expense of a deep and meaningful training in interpersonal communication , interaction with actual people who really at the end of the day are your patients and your first priority , ” Robert says .
Robert will introduce the AAAS audience to the complexity of diagnosis and management of mental illness , from the perspective of the individual and across cultural boundaries .
“ Within psychiatry , questions about the aetiology , classification , and diagnosis of complex disorders , such as schizophrenia , span cultural and national boundaries , ” he says .
“ My take - home lessons are these : Classification and diagnosis are complex , interpretive and analytical tasks .
These tasks are more complex in cross-cultural contexts , whether local ( within the U.S. ) or global .
“ Genetics and neuroimaging may prove useful in simplifying these tasks , but only if integrated with clinical phenomenology – careful clinical description based on patient narratives , observation , and interpretation – to serve the needs of embodied and enculturated people , not disembodied brains or genomes . ”
One major concern , according to Robert , is how to operationalize these philosophical and ethical ideas in the development of new diagnostic and classification manuals , such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V and the International Classification of Disease – 11 .
“ While there is clearly a commitment to embrace an integrative and systems approach to mental illness in such efforts , it remains to be seen how this will affect the final products , ” he says .
“ A second major concern is how to educate mental health care professionals toward cultural competency in ways that are sensitive to the dynamic , constitutive nature of culture , rather than merely presenting so - called facts about ‘ this is what Native Americans / Latinos / Ugandans believe about this , that , and the other thing , ’ ” Robert says .
“ We should n’t pretend that culture is any easier to understand than a person is ; to understand that you ca n’t have caricature of culture in mind .
What ’s really critically important is understanding cultures dynamically , as complex , historic , social and political structures that dramatically influence people ’s lives ”
While Robert acknowledges that it ’s certainly the case that DNA and brain scans are going to be important , “ if you ignore everything else , you might never have the capacity to actually influence the well - being of the patient . ”

When Felix ’s special phone rang at 2:00 in the morning , Kelly rolled over and punched him in the shoulder and hissed , “ Why did n’t you turn that fucking thing off before bed ? ”
“ Because I ’m on call , ” he said .
“ You ’re not a fucking doctor , ” she said , kicking him as he sat on the bed ’s edge , pulling on the pants he ’d left on the floor before turning in .
“ You ’re a goddamned systems administrator . ”
“ It ’s my job , ” he said .
“ They work you like a government mule , ” she said .
“ You know I ’m right .
For Christ ’s sake , you ’re a father now , you ca n’t go running off in the middle of the night every time someone ’s porn supply goes down .
Do n’t answer that phone . ”
He knew she was right .
He answered the phone .
“ Main routers not responding .
BGP not responding . ”
The mechanical voice of the systems monitor did n’t care if he cursed at it , so he did , and it made him feel a little better .
“ Maybe I can fix it from here , ” he said .
He could log in to the UPS for the cage and reboot the routers .
The UPS was in a different netblock , with its own independent routers on their own uninterruptible power supplies .
Kelly was sitting up in bed now , an indistinct shape against the headboard .
“ In five years of marriage , you have never once been able to fix anything from here . ”
This time she was wrong — he fixed stuff from home all the time , but he did it discreetly and did n’t make a fuss , so she did n’t remember it .
And she was right , too — he had logs that showed that after 1:00 a.m. , nothing could ever be fixed without driving out to the cage .
Law of Infinite Universal Perversity — aka Felix ’s Law .
Five minutes later , Felix was behind the wheel .
He had n’t been able to fix it from home .
The independent router ’s netblock was offline , too .
The last time that had happened , some dumbfuck construction worker had driven a Ditchwitch through the main conduit into the data center and Felix had joined a cadre of fifty enraged sysadmins who ’d stood atop the resulting pit for a week , screaming abuse at the poor bastards who labored twenty - four / seven to splice ten thousand wires back together .
His phone went off twice more in the car ; he let it override the stereo and play the mechanical status reports through the big , bassy speakers of more critical network infrastructure offline .
Then Kelly called .
“ Hi , ” he said .
“ Do n’t cringe , I can hear the cringe in your voice . ”
He smiled involuntarily .
“ Check , no cringing . ”
“ I love you , Felix , ” she said .
“ I ’m totally bonkers for you , Kelly .
Go back to bed . ”
“ 2.0 ’s awake , ” she said .
The baby had been Beta Test when he was in her womb , and when her water broke , he got the call and dashed out of the office , shouting , The Gold Master just shipped !
They ’d started calling him 2.0 before he ’d finished his first cry .
“ This little bastard was born to suck tit . ”
“ I ’m sorry I woke you , ” he said .
He was almost at the data center .
No traffic at 2:00 a.m .
He slowed down and pulled over before the entrance to the garage .
He did n’t want to lose Kelly ’s call underground .
“ It ’s not waking me , ” she said .
“ You ’ve been there for seven years .
You have three juniors reporting to you .
Give them the phone .
You ’ve paid your dues . ”
“ I do n’t like asking my reports to do anything I would n’t do , ” he said .
“ You ’ve done it , ” she said .
“ Please ?
I hate waking up alone in the night .
I miss you most at night . ”
“ Kelly — ”
“ I ’m over being angry .
I just miss you is all .
You give me sweet dreams . ”
“ OK , ” he said .
“ Simple as that ? ”
“ Exactly .
Simple as that .
Ca n’t have you having bad dreams , and I ’ve paid my dues .
From now on , I ’m only going on night call to cover holidays . ”
She laughed .
“ Sysadmins do n’t take holidays . ”
“ This one will , ” he said .
“ Promise . ”
“ You ’re wonderful , ” she said .
“ Oh , gross .
2.0 just dumped core all over my bathrobe . ”
“ That ’s my boy , ” he said .
“ Oh that he is , ” she said .
She hung up , and he piloted the car into the data–center ’s lot , badging in and peeling up a bleary eyelid to let the retinal scanner get a good look at one of his sleep - depped eyeballs .
He stopped at the machine to get himself a guarana / medafonil power bar and a cup of lethal robot - coffee in a spill - proof clean - room sippy - cup .
He wolfed down the bar and sipped the coffee , then let the inner door read his hand geometry and size him up for a moment .
It sighed open and gusted the airlock ’s load of positively pressurized air over him as he passed finally to the inner sanctum .

USB in a NutShell
Making sense of the USB standard
Starting out new with USB can be quite daunting .
With the USB 2.0 specification at 650 pages one could easily be put off just by the sheer size of the standard .
This is only the beginning of a long list of associated standards for USB .
There are USB Class Standards such as the HID Class Specification which details the common operation of devices ( keyboards , mice etc ) falling under the HID ( Human Interface Devices ) Class - only another 97 pages .
If you are designing a USB Host , then you have three Host Controller Interface Standards to choose from .
None of these are detailed in the USB 2.0 Spec .
The good news is you do n’t even need to bother reading the entire USB standard .
Some chapters were churned out by marketing , others aimed at the lower link layer normally taken care off by your USB controller IC and a couple aimed at host and hub developers .
Lets take a little journey through the various chapters of the USB 2.0 specification and briefly introduce the key points .
Chapter Name Description Pages 1 Introduction Includes the motivation and scope for USB .
The most important piece of information in this chapter is to make reference to the Universal Serial Bus Device Class Specifications .
No need reading this chapter .
2 2 Terms and Abbreviations
This chapter is self - explanatory and a necessary evil to any standard .
8 3 Background Specifies the goals of USB which are Plug ’n ’ Play and simplicity to the end user ( not developer ) .
Introduces Low , Full and High Speed ranges with a feature list straight from marketing .
No need reading this chapter either .
4 4 Architectural Overview
This is where you can start reading .
This chapter provides a basic overview of a USB system including topology , data rates , data flow types , basic electrical specs etc. 10 5 USB Data Flow Model
This chapter starts to talk about how data flows on a Universal Serial Bus .
It introduces terms such as endpoints and pipes then spends most of the chapter on each of the data flow types ( Control , Interrupt , Isochronous and Bulk ) .
While it ’s important to know each transfer type and its properties it is a little heavy on for a first reader .
60 6 Mechanical
This chapter details the USB ’s two standard connectors .
The important information here is that a type A connector is oriented facing downstream and a type B connector upstream .
Therefore it should be impossible to plug a cable into two upstream ports .
All detachable cables must be full / high speed , while any low speed cable must be hardwired to the appliance .
Other than a quick look at the connectors , you can skip this chapter unless you intend to manufacture USB connectors and / or cables .
PCB designers can find standard footprints in this chapter .
33 7 Electrical
This chapter looks at low level electrical signalling including line impedance , rise / fall times , driver / receiver specifications and bit level encoding , bit stuffing etc .
The more important parts of this chapter are the device speed identification by using a resistor to bias either data line and bus powered devices vs self powered devices .
Unless you are designing USB transceivers at a silicon level you can flip through this chapter .
Good USB device datasheets will detail what value bus termination resistors you will need for bus impedance matching .
75 8 Protocol Layer
Now we start to get into the protocol layers .
This chapter describes the USB packets at a byte level including the sync , pid , address , endpoint , CRC fields .
Once this has been grasped it moves on to the next protocol layer , USB packets .
Most developers still do n’t see these lower protocol layers as their USB device IC ’s take care of this .
However a understanding of the status reporting and handshaking is worthwhile .
45 9 USB Device Frame Work
This is the most frequently used chapter in the entire specification and the only one I ever bothered printing and binding .
This details the bus enumeration and request codes ( set address , get descriptor etc ) which make up the most common protocol layer USB programmers and designers will ever see .
This chapter is a must read in detail .
36 10 USB Host Hardware and Software
This chapter covers issues relating to the host .
This includes frame and microframe generation , host controller requirements , software mechanisms and the universal serial bus driver model .
Unless you are designing Hosts , you can skip this chapter .
23 11 Hub Specification
Details the workings of USB hubs including hub configuration , split transactions , standard descriptors for hub class etc .
Unless you are designing Hubs , you can skip this chapter .
143
So now we can begin to read the parts of the standard relevant to our needs .
If you develop drivers ( Software ) for USB peripherals then you may only need to read chapters ,
4 - Architectural Overview
5 - USB Data Flow Model
9 - USB Device Frame Work , and
10 - USB Host Hardware and Software .
Peripheral hardware ( Electronics ) designers on the other hand may only need to read chapters ,
4 - Architectural Overview
5 - USB Data Flow Model
6 - Mechanical , and
7 - Electrical .
USB in a NutShell for Peripheral Designers
Now lets face it , ( 1 ) most of us are here to develop USB peripherals and ( 2 ) it 's common to read a standard and still have no idea how to implement a device .
So in the next 7 chapters we focus on the relevant parts needed to develop a USB device .
This allows you to grab a grasp of USB and its issues allowing you to further research the issues specific to your application .
The USB 1.1 standard was complex enough before High Speed was thrown into USB 2.0 .
In order to help understand the fundamental principals behind USB , we omit many areas specific to High Speed devices .
Introducing the Universal Serial Bus
USB version 1.1 supported two speeds , a full speed mode of 12 M bits / s and a low speed mode of 1.5 Mbits / s. The 1.5 M bits / s mode is slower and less susceptible to EMI , thus reducing the cost of ferrite beads and quality components .
For example , crystals can be replaced by cheaper resonators .
USB 2.0 which is still yet to see day light on mainstream desktop computers has upped the stakes to 480 M bits / s . The 480 M bits /s is known as High Speed mode and was a tack on to compete with the Firewire Serial Bus .
High Speed - 480 Mbits/s
Full Speed - 12Mbits/s
Low Speed - 1.5 Mbits/s
The Universal Serial Bus is host controlled .
There can only be one host per bus .
The specification in itself , does not support any form of multimaster arrangement .
However the On - The - Go specification which is a tack on standard to USB 2.0 has introduced a Host Negotiation Protocol which allows two devices negotiate for the role of host .
This is aimed at and limited to single point to point connections such as a mobile phone and personal organiser and not multiple hub , multiple device desktop configurations .
The USB host is responsible for undertaking all transactions and scheduling bandwidth .
Data can be sent by various transaction methods using a token - based protocol .
In my view the bus topology of USB is somewhat limiting .
One of the original intentions of USB was to reduce the amount of cabling at the back of your PC .
Apple people will say the idea came from the Apple Desktop Bus , where both the keyboard , mouse and some other peripherals could be connected together ( daisy chained ) using the one cable .
However USB uses a tiered star topology , simular to that of 10 BaseT Ethernet .
This imposes the use of a hub somewhere , which adds to greater expense , more boxes on your desktop and more cables .
However it is not as bad as it may seem .
Many devices have USB hubs integrated into them .
For example , your keyboard may contain a hub which is connected to your computer .
Your mouse and other devices such as your digital camera can be plugged easily into the back of your keyboard .
Monitors are just another peripheral on a long list which commonly have in - built hubs .
This tiered star topology , rather than simply daisy chaining devices together has some benefits .
Firstly power to each device can be monitored and even switched off if an overcurrent condition occurs without disrupting other USB devices .
Both high , full and low speed devices can be supported , with the hub filtering out high speed and full speed transactions so lower speed devices do not receive them .
Up to 127 devices can be connected to any one USB bus at any one given time .
Need more devices ?
- simply add another port / host .
While most earlier USB hosts had two ports , most manufacturers have seen this as limiting and are starting to introduce 4 and 5 port host cards with an internal port for hard disks etc .
The early hosts had one USB controller and thus both ports shared the same available USB bandwidth .
As bandwidth requirements grew , we are starting to see multi-port cards with two or more controllers allowing individual channels .
The USB host controllers have their own specifications .
With USB 1.1 , there were two Host Controller Interface Specifications , UHCI ( Universal Host Controller Interface ) developed by Intel which puts more of the burden on software ( Microsoft ) and allowing for cheaper hardware and the OHCI ( Open Host Controller Interface ) developed by Compaq , Microsoft and National Semiconductor which places more of the burden on hardware ( Intel ) and makes for simpler software .
Typical hardware / software engineer relationship . . .
With the introduction of USB 2.0 a new Host Controller Interface Specification was needed to describe the register level details specific to USB 2.0 .
The EHCI ( Enhanced Host Controller Interface ) was born .
Significant Contributors include Intel , Compaq , NEC , Lucent and Microsoft so it would hopefully seem they have pooled together to provide us one interface standard and thus only one new driver to implement in our operating systems .
Its about time .
USB as its name would suggest is a serial bus .
It uses 4 shielded wires of which two are power ( +5 v & GND ) .
The remaining two are twisted pair differential data signals .
It uses a NRZI ( Non Return to Zero Invert ) encoding scheme to send data with a sync field to synchronise the host and receiver clocks .
USB supports plug ’n ’plug with dynamically loadable and unloadable drivers .
The user simply plugs the device into the bus .
The host will detect this addition , interrogate the newly inserted device and load the appropriate driver all in the time it takes the hourglass to blink on your screen provided a driver is installed for your device .
The end user needs not worry about terminations , terms such as IRQs and port addresses , or rebooting the computer .
Once the user is finished , they can simply lug the cable out , the host will detect its absence and automatically unload the driver .
The loading of the appropriate driver is done using a PID / VID ( Product ID / Vendor ID ) combination .
The VID is supplied by the USB Implementor 's forum at a cost and this is seen as another sticking point for USB .
The latest info on fees can be found on the USB Implementor ’s Website
Other standards organisations provide a extra VID for non-commercial activities such as teaching , research or fiddling ( The Hobbyist ) .
The USB Implementors forum has yet to provide this service .
In these cases you may wish to use one assigned to your development system 's manufacturer .
For example most chip manufacturers will have a VID / PID combination you can use for your chips which is known not to exist as a commercial device .
Other chip manufacturers can even sell you a PID to use with their VID for your commercial device .
Another more notable feature of USB , is its transfer modes .
USB supports Control , Interrupt , Bulk and Isochronous transfers .
While we will look at the other transfer modes later , Isochronous allows a device to reserve a defined amount of bandwidth with guaranteed latency .
This is ideal in Audio or Video applications where congestion may cause loss of data or frames to drop .
Each transfer mode provides the designer trade - offs in areas such as error detection and recovery , guaranteed latency and bandwidth .
SADDLE RIVER , N.J. , Aug. 17  After spending the better part of two decades knocking on more doors than most people will in a lifetime , Fred Ferguson , a delivery driver with DHL Worldwide Express , has seen his share of sights strange and unpleasant .
But what Mr. Ferguson witnessed as he peered through the glass door of a colonial style home here in one of New Jersey ’s most exclusive towns the other day left him groping for adjectives : a handful of cats and dogs , fur matted and unkempt , walking aimlessly amid piles of animal feces that in parts of the house was nearly knee high .
“ What ’s a worse word than ‘ disgusting ’ ? ” Mr. Ferguson , 40 , asked .
“ I did n’t know if somebody was dead in the house . ”
Not somebody , but something :
Twenty - three pets were decomposing inside , some so badly that the authorities could not tell whether they were cat or dog .
And the live animals Mr. Ferguson saw were among more than 100 dogs and cats that the authorities said had been neglected for years by an upper - middle - class couple here in a home valued at $ 2.4 million .
The building was owned by a front man for Cali cocaine cartel leader José Santacruz Londono .
Inside was a computer center , manned in shifts around the clock by four to six technicians .
The central feature of the facility was a $ 1.5 million IBM AS400 mainframe , the kind once used by banks , networked with half a dozen terminals and monitors .
The next day , Colombia 's attorney general secretly granted permission for U.S. agents to fly the mainframe immediately back to the United States , where it was subjected to an exhaustive analysis by experts from the Drug Enforcement Administration and various intelligence agencies .
The so - called Santacruz computer was never returned to Colombian authorities , and the DEA 's report about it is highly classified .
But Business 2.0 has ferreted out many of its details .
They make it clear why the U.S. government wants the Santacruz case kept quiet .
According to former and current DEA , military , and State Department officials , the cartel had assembled a database that contained both the office and residential telephone numbers of U.S. diplomats and agents based in Colombia , along with the entire call log for the phone company in Cali , which was leaked by employees of the utility .
The mainframe was loaded with custom - written data - mining software .
It cross-referenced the Cali phone exchange 's traffic with the phone numbers of American personnel and Colombian intelligence and law enforcement officials .
The computer was essentially conducting a perpetual internal mole - hunt of the cartel 's organizational chart .
" They could correlate phone numbers , personalities , locations -- any way you want to cut it , " says the former director of a law enforcement agency .
" Santacruz could see if any of his lieutenants were spilling the beans . "
They were .
A top Colombian narcotics security adviser says the system fingered at least a dozen informants -- and that they were swiftly assassinated by the cartel .
A high - level DEA official would go only this far : " It is very reasonable to assume that people were killed as a result of this capability .
Potential sources of information were compromised by the system . "
The discovery of the Santacruz computer gave law enforcement officials a chilling glimpse into the cartels ' rapidly evolving technological sophistication .
But here 's what is truly frightening :
Since the discovery of the Santacruz system in 1994 , the cartels ' technological mastery has only grown .
And it is enabling them to smuggle more dope than ever before .
The drug lords have deployed advanced communications encryption technologies that , law enforcement officials concede , are all but unbreakable .
They use the Web to camouflage the movement of dirty money .
They track the radar sweeps of drug surveillance planes to map out gaps in coverage .
They even use a fleet of submarines , mini-subs , and semisubmersibles to ferry drugs -- sometimes , ingeniously , to larger ships hauling cargoes of hazardous waste , in which the insulated bales of cocaine are stashed .
" Those ships never get a close inspection , no matter what country you 're in , " says John Hensley , former head of enforcement for the U.S. Customs Service .
Most of the cartels ' technology is American - made ; many of the experts who run it are American - trained .
High - tech has become the drug lords ' most effective counter - weapon in the war on drugs -- and is a major reason that cocaine shipments to the United States from Colombia hit an estimated 450 tons last year , almost twice the level of 1998 , according to the Colombian navy .
In a sense , the cartels are putting their own dark twist on the same productivity - enhancing strategies that other multinational businesses have seized on in the Internet age .
Indeed , the $ 80 billion - a- year cocaine business poses some unique challenges :
The supply chain is immense and global , competition is literally cutthroat , and regulatory pressure is intense .
The traffickers have the advantages of unlimited funds and no scruples , and they 've invested billions of dollars to create a technological infrastructure that would be the envy of any Fortune 500 company -- and of the law enforcement officials charged with going after the drug barons .
" I spent this morning working on the budget , " the head of DEA intelligence , Steve Casteel , said recently .
" Do you think they have to worry about that ?
If they want it , they buy it . "
That 's an especially troubling thought just now , as the Bush administration pressures Congress to expand the $ 1.3 billion anti-narcotics plan for Colombia and to allow the U.S. military to take a more forceful role in the savage fighting between Colombia 's left - wing rebels , right - wing paramilitary units , and the drug - trafficker allies of both .
Archangel Henao is the man whom authorities credit with much of the drug runners ' recent technological progress .
According to Colombian and U.S. narcotics officials , Henao heads the North Valley Cartel , the largest and most feared criminal organization to emerge from the chaos that gripped Colombia 's underworld after the old Medellín and Cali cartels were broken up in the 1990s by the country 's military -- with extensive U.S. help .
Officials say that Henao , a heavyset 47 - year - old born with a withered left arm , controls Buenaventura , the principal port on a stretch of the Pacific coast that is the launching point for most of the cocaine and heroin smuggled into North America from Colombia .
His North Valley Cartel foot soldiers are known for dismembering the bodies of their enemies with chain saws and dumping them into the Cauca River .
The U.S. Treasury Department has banned Henao from doing business with U.S. companies because he is a " drug kingpin , " and the DEA publicly calls him one of Colombia 's biggest traffickers .
He has never been convicted of a drug- related offense , although a DEA official says the agency is " trying to build an indictment " against him .
Henao's cartel is a champion of decentralization , outsourcing , and pooled risk , along with technological innovations to enhance the secrecy of it all .
For instance , to scrub his profits , he and fellow money launderers use a private , password - protected website that daily updates an inventory of U.S. currency available from cartel distributors across North America , says a veteran Treasury Department investigator .
Kind of like a business - to - business exchange , the site allows black - market money brokers to bid on the dirty dollars , which cartel financial chiefs want to convert to Colombian pesos to use for their operations at home .
" A trafficker can bid on different rates -- ' I 'll sell $ 1 million in cash in Miami , ' " says the agent .
" And he 'll take the equivalent of $ 800,000 in pesos for it in Colombia . "
The investigator estimates the online bazaar 's annual turnover at as much as $ 3 billion .
Henao and other cartel leaders recruit IT talent from many sources , intelligence officials say .
The traffickers lure some specialists from legitimate local businesses , offering scads of cash .
They also contract with Israeli , U.S. , and other mercenaries who are former electronic warfare experts from military special ops units .
Cartel leaders have sent members of their own families to top U.S. engineering and aeronautical schools ; when the kids come home , some serve as trusted heads of technical operations .
Most of the high - end gear the cartels deploy comes from household - name multinational companies , many of them American ; typically , front companies purchase equipment from sales offices in Colombia or through a series of intermediaries operating in the United States .
The talent and tools are among the best that money can buy , and it shows .
For instance , Henao 's communications have become so advanced that they have never been intercepted , Colombian intelligence sources say .
The last clear view inside the organization 's technical operations was provided in 1998 , when a small army of Colombian police arrested Henao 's top IT consultant , Nelson Urrego .
That bust soon led to the discovery of an elaborate communications network that allowed Urrego to coordinate fleets of North Valley Cartel planes and ships that were smuggling 10 to 15 tons of cocaine each month .
The network 's command center was hidden in a Bogotá warehouse outfitted with a retractable German - made Rhode & Schwarz transmission antenna about 40 feet high , and 15 to 20 computers networked with servers and a small mainframe .
The same kind of state - of - the - art setup existed in communications centers at Urrego 's ranch in Medellín , at an island resort he owned , and at a hideout in Cali .
Seized invoices and letters show that Urrego or his associates had recently bought roughly $ 100,000 worth of Motorola ( MOT ) gear : 12 base stations , 16 mobile stations installed in trucks and cars , 50 radio phones , and eight repeaters , which boost radio signals over long distances .
The range of Urrego 's network extended across the Caribbean and the upper half of South America .
He and his operatives used it to send text messages to laptops in dozens of planes and boats to inform their pilots when it was safe to go , and to receive confirmations of when loads were dropped and retrieved .
According to one intelligence official who analyzed Urrego 's network , it was transmitting 1,000 messages a day -- and not one of them was intercepted , even by U.S. spy planes .
When Urrego typed a message into his computer , it created a digital bit - stream that was then encrypted and fed through a converter that parceled the data out at high frequencies .
Digital communications over a radio network can be put into a code much more easily than voice transmissions , and thus are far tougher to intercept and decipher .
" There 's going to be a delay in sending and receiving messages , " says a surveillance expert who does code - breaking work for the DEA and CIA , " but it 's going to be fairly friggin ' secure . "
The cartel 's fleets still had to dodge surveillance aircraft like the dozen or so P3 Orions that U.S. Customs flies over Colombia .
But by bribing officials and drawing on an elaborate counterintelligence database maintained by the cartels , Urrego learned the operations schedule of the planes .
According to a former narcotics operative in the U.S. Army 's Southern Command , cartel pilots routinely map the radar coverage of U.S. spy planes by putting FuzzBuster radar detectors in their drug plane cockpits and logging the hits .
" They 'd use every piece of data to build a picture , just like a jigsaw puzzle , " the retired officer explains .
" A piece of data could be ' One of our airplanes was flying on this azimuth at this altitude , and his FuzzBuster went off , ' which means he was being painted by the radar .
So they put that piece of data in the computer .
Then another airplane was flying on that azimuth at that altitude , and his FuzzBuster did not go off .
As they put that data together , they 'd build a picture of the radar signature . "
Law enforcement officials believe that much of Urrego 's system has simply been reconstituted -- with upgrades based on the latest advances in communications and encryption gear .
A lanky man with deep bags under his eyes sits in a cinder - block office within a heavily fortified army base .
He may have the most dangerous job in Colombia .
He is a top special operations commander , and he probably knows more about the drug cartels ' technological prowess than anyone on the outside .
He rarely gives interviews , but late one Saturday night , he agrees to discuss one of his special areas of expertise : Archangel Henao .
Lately , the commander says , he has been studying how Henao 's cartel uses technology for what amounts to corporate espionage and competitive advantage against business rivals .
The North Valley Cartel has waged a war against other smuggling groups over a variety of issues , including control of the port of Buenaventura .
The commander recites a litany of recent assassinations and bombings .
In February 2001 , for instance , North Valley Cartel operatives commandeered a Bell helicopter used by the government in coca fumigation programs and pressed it into service in an attempted assassination of a rival trafficker .
The rival was in jail in Cali at the time , so the hit men flew over the prison and dropped a homemade bomb containing 440 pounds of TNT .
The detonator failed , but had the bomb gone off , it would have killed more than 3,000 people , the commander estimates .
Within a month of that attack , the intended victim 's organization retaliated with a flurry of hits -- among them , a submachine - gun ambush of four North Valley Cartel figures in a Cali hospital cafeteria .
( In February , Henao 's brother - in - law , a top North Valley Cartel capo , was poisoned to death in a maximum - security prison . )
Many of the targets in the power struggle , the commander says , were located by signals intelligence -- things like pager and e-mail intercepts , transmitters planted on vehicles , or bugs hidden in homes and offices .
" This is a technological war , " he says .
Actually , it has been for a long time -- as the mysterious story of the Santacruz computer suggests .
According to Carlos Alfonso Velásquez Romero , a now - retired colonel who commanded the elite unit that discovered the computer , one of the principal IT gurus behind the system was Jorge Salcedo Cabrera , a former army intelligence operative and electrical engineer who crossed over to the underworld .
The Santacruz computer was n't his first big technological splash .
When the Colombian government launched the unit that Velásquez would later head , it established a toll - free tip line for information about Cali Cartel leaders .
The traffickers tapped the line , with deadly consequences .
" All of these anonymous callers were immediately identified , and they were killed , " a former high - ranking DEA official says .
Henao's cartel built on this and other prior technology initiatives , in part by creating what amounts to a narco research and development program .
One early fruit of that effort , intelligence officials say , was an advanced version of a cheap boat called a semisubmersible .
Shaped like the Civil War-era Monitor , the small craft cruises below the waterline , except for a conning tower where one of its two - man crew pilots the boat .
The vessel has underwater propulsion , radar , and short - band radio towers .
And it 's virtually invisible to even the most sophisticated spy gear .
" You basically need a visual sighting to detect one , because you 're not going to pick them up in a radar sweep , " says Hensley , the former U.S. Customs enforcement chief .
Semisubmersibles , however , are unstable , and narcotics officials think the cartels have lost several at sea -- one reason that the traffickers upgraded to submarines .
According to the head of the Colombian navy , Adm. Mauricio Soto , the North Valley Cartel and other organizations have used real subs for years .
Authorities believe that the Cali Cartel purchased a Soviet sub in the early ' 90s , and that its crew accidentally sank it off Colombia 's Pacific coast during its first smuggling run , probably because they lacked the 10 skilled people needed to operate it .
More recently , the cartels have built their own subs , with help , Soto suspects , from Italian engineers who stayed in Colombia after overseeing the construction of the navy 's own fleet of commando submarines two decades ago .
Henao , for instance , is believed by military and intelligence officials to have a small fleet of mini-subs -- used for , among other things , hauling dope to those toxic waste freighters .
So far , Colombian authorities have found only two drug subs , both of which were under construction .
The most recent one , discovered 21 months ago outside Bogotá , was a 78 - foot craft that cost an estimated $ 10 million .
Intelligence sources say it belonged to Henao's North Valley Cartel .
A Colombian official says Henao wanted a vessel that could carry several more tons than the Buenaventura mini-subs and travel as far as 2,000 miles -- say , to the coast of Mexico or Southern California .
Arrayed against this formidable technological arsenal is , well , not much .
The commander of the narcotics agents in the Buenaventura area is a world - weary man who rarely ventures outside his military compound not far from town .
He never goes into Buenaventura itself .
Traffickers have put a price of 35 million pesos ( about $ 17,000 ) on his head .
" Life is cheap here , " he mutters .
He displays boxes and boxes of seized high - tech gear .
Even personnel at the bottom of the cartel food chain have Israeli night - vision goggles , ICOM radio frequency scanners , and Magellan GPS handhelds .
The commander says an informant told him about mini-subs off Buenaventura months ago .
But neither he nor his men have ever seen one .
His outfit does n't have the equipment to detect underwater craft .
Nor does the commander know many details about the Santacruz computer bust that first alerted officials to how technologically advanced his adversaries had become .
He is unaware , for instance , of one of the biggest reasons U.S. officials want details of the system and the murders of U.S. intelligence sources it triggered kept top secret .
Jorge Salcedo Cabrera , the main IT whiz who set up the Santacruz computer , eventually became an informant against cartel bosses .
The DEA declined to comment on Salcedo .
But according to several intelligence officials , he is now living in America at taxpayer expense , under the witness protection program .
Finally !
Paul McCartney has signed a $ 400 million deal , which will see the Beatles catalog make its way to iTunes , at long last .
UPDATE : While the UPI is a great source , and their story was written as fact , Sony / ATV , holders of much of the Beatles publishing rights , are throwing doubt on any of this being true .
The UPI could have been had , too .
Consider their source , the Daily Mail .
And EMI , who we contacted directly , denies any news , either .

Though McCartney will probably make off with the lion 's share of the cash sum , Ringo Starr and the families of the late John Lennon and George Harrison will also benefit .
Michael Jackson , EMI and Sony will also be paid , as they each own a share in the back catalog .
McCartney may actually have to pay out a little more on his divorce settlement because of the deal .
How that works is anyone 's guess , but you gotta feel sorry for him ; having to share all those millions is just plain malicious .
When the albums will actually hit iTunes is not yet confirmed , but we 'll keep you up to speed with any banging of Maxwell 's silver hammer .
[ United Press International ]
A new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq cites significant security improvements but concludes that security remains fragile , several American government officials said .
Even as officials described problems with the planning and performance of the Iraqi forces during the Basra operation , signs emerged Wednesday that tensions with Moktada al - Sadr , the radical cleric who leads the Mahdi Army militia , could flare up again .
Mr. Sadr , who asked his followers to stop fighting on Sunday , called Thursday for a million Iraqis to march to the Shiite holy city of Najaf next week to protest what he called the American occupation .
He also issued a veiled threat against Mr. Maliki ’s forces , whom he accused of violating the terms of an agreement with the Iraqi government to stand down .
Estimates by Iraqi military officials of the number of officers who refused to fight during the Basra operation varied from several dozen to more than 100 .
But three officials said that among those who had been relieved of duty for refusing to fight were Col. Rahim Jabbar and Lt. Col.
Shakir Khalaf , the commander and deputy commander of an entire brigade affiliated with the Interior Ministry .
A senior military official in Basra asserted that some members of Colonel Khalaf ’s unit fought even though he did not .
Asked why he believed Colonel Khalaf did not fight , the official said that the colonel did not believe the Iraqi security forces would be able to protect him against threats to his life that he had received for his involvement in the assault .
“ If he fights today , he might be killed later , ” the official said .
The senior American military official said the number of officers was “ less than a couple dozen at most , ” but conceded that the figure could rise as the performance of senior officers was assessed .
Maine Bear Monitoring
I was privileged to go on a bear monitoring trip some 20 + miles west of Ashland last Sunday , I will take several days sending the mailings so as not to choke anyone 's computer ....... for more info google maine bear monitoring ... this pic shows the crew getting ready to leave .
In the previous weeks an airplane had located signals from collared bears , the coordinates were put on a map and given to the ground crew , this makes locating the bears much quicker using locating equipment , the person on the right is holding up an antenna .
The den is located and snow removal begins .
The den entrance is located , digging through 5 ' of snow in the middle of the Northern Maine woods and into the opening of a bear den , pretty impressive !!
The bears are in a torpor state , not as quick or alert as they would be in the summer , but aware and moving around in the den feeding and grooming the cubs , still capable of inflicting pain , they 've even on occasion run out of the den when confronted in the winter , in this picture 2 of the guys takes turns going in and assessing the situation ...
I wonder what these guys do for excitement on days off !!
One of the guys prepares a jab stick , this will be used to inject a sedative and put her to sleep .
2 of the guys are discussing how best to stick the bear , the person on the left is holding the jab stick with the glove on it for protection .
He 's got a flashlight and is ready to go in , note the jab stick has been shortened to 2 feet , he plans on getting pretty close .
The jab was successful , it 'll take 10 minutes for the drug to work , time for lunch .
Time to go back in and check to see if she 's asleep , she is .
One person holds on to the bears back legs while 2 others outside pull his back legs and the bear out .
With the bear out the examination starts , this young female did n't have any cubs .
The bear gets a complete physical , everything is recorded and compared to last years examination , since the study is in the same area every year many of these bears have been seen before .
The physical is nearly over .... 138 lbs
Her head is held up while the person on the left takes her picture , note the person in the middle is about to give her a wake up shot , she is then returned to the den and the entrance of it covered with snow , the whole procedure is quick but very professional , these guys know their stuff !!
These pics were taken at a different location , this 13 year old 168 lb mother had 3 cubs , the biologist planned to visit 4 dens that day , I stayed for 2 of them .
The cubs are also given physicals .
3.5 lbs
Mother being posed for her photo , all part of the record , this bear had also been reviewed many times in past years .
The cubs pretty well stay put after they find a warm safe place .
Be nice to take one home , but ...
Could n't of had a better day .
Thanks to Chuck Johnston ( P. Isle ) for the making this day possible .
Yours truly .
No words needed !!
The following statement was issued by the Honourable Danny Williams , Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador .
It was also read in the House of Assembly :
I am very pleased to rise today to announce that in this year�s budget , our government will eliminate the 15 per cent retail sales tax on insurance premiums .
This is yet another concrete example of our government putting money directly back into the pockets of tax payers in this province .
This will cost the government approximately $ 94 million this year and an estimated $ 75 million annually thereafter .
This substantial investment will benefit each and every individual , corporation , small business , community , municipality and volunteer organization in this province and our government is proud to make it happen .
The sales tax on insurance premiums was implemented in the 1960s .
In April 1997 , the government of the day harmonized the provincial retail sales tax with the GST , and adopted the same tax base as the GST .
However , the sales tax on insurance is not subject to GST / HST .
The previous government retained the retail sales tax on insurance premiums , and increased the rate to 15 per cent , leading many people to believe that HST and the RST on insurance premiums were the same tax .
Only two other provinces had imposed a similar tax but with a much lower rate and a narrower base .
Those provinces do not have a harmonized sales tax .
While we need to impose taxes to provide health care , education and other public services , this particular tax just did not seem fair and many have advocated for its elimination .
I know the Minister of Finance has heard it directly from people through pre-budget consultations .
When we assumed office in 2003 , we found ourselves in an extremely difficult fiscal position , heading potentially for billion dollar deficits .
We were not in a position to eliminate this tax .
As circumstances improved , we had many priorities to address before we could address this problem .
We have made significant inroads in dealing with our infrastructure deficit , including substantial investments into our hospitals , long term care facilities , schools , post - secondary institutions , roads , bridges and ferries .
We have implemented a poverty reduction strategy that is held up as the national model .
We have assisted seniors in many ways , and we have created more economic opportunities for our people .
Last year , we lowered personal income tax rates to become the lowest in Atlantic Canada .
We recognize that competitive tax regimes are critical to economic growth and stimulation and inward investment .
The elimination of this tax will be retroactive to January 1 , 2008 .
We will ask insurers to refund any tax that has been collected from January 1 , 2008 until now on new contracts and renewals .
I appreciate that this will place a small compliance burden on insurers , however , the insurance industry has lobbied long and hard for the elimination of this tax and I am confident they will be pleased to comply .
Given our province�s ever - improving financial position , we as a government must continue to give back to the people of this province .
As Newfoundland and Labrador continues to prosper and grow , our people must benefit in meaningful and tangible ways .
Today�s announcement does exactly that .

BACKGROUNDER
Insurance Premiums Tax
Today , government announced the elimination of the provincial 15 % Retail Sales Tax ( RST ) on insurance premiums , effective January 1 , 2008 .
RST had been applied to insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance policies ( mainly vehicles , homes and business locations ) .
It did not apply to life , sickness , or health insurance premiums .
The tax had applied to consumers , businesses , municipalities and the not for profit sector .
The tax was payable at the time of purchasing or renewing a contract of insurance .
While it has been common practice among insurers , agents or representatives to extend payment terms to customers over a number of months , the insurer was required to levy and remit the tax upon the full premium amount at the time of the purchase or renewal of insurance , regardless of the payment terms .
Effective immediately , insurers are no longer required to collect this tax .
If a person purchased or renewed a contract of insurance on or after January 1 , 2008 , that person will receive a refund of tax paid .
No refunds will be available for insurance contracts purchased or renewed prior to the effective date .
No refunds of tax will be provided to taxpayers who cancel insurance policies that were acquired before 2008 .
Insurers are asked to refund to clients any tax collected from January 1 to the present .
Insurers can apply to the Department of Finance to recover the tax refunded to their clients .
The annual cost to the provincial treasury of removing RST on insurance premiums will be about $ 94 million this fiscal year , and $ 75 million annually thereafter .

Talk To Action :
One of John McCain 's senior advisors has publicly declared that the religious right is a " serious problem . "
While I would certainly agree , this statement comes at a time when his candidate has embraced some key leaders -- and is further courting this faction of the party , which mostly did not support in him in the primaries .
The Washington correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger , speaking to an audience of young Jews on behalf of the McCain campaign , had some things to say about the religious right that reminded us of the McCain of old who once denounced Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as " agents of intolerance . "
They also underscore that John McCain has become the very kind of panderer he once denounced .
Eagleburger , Schmuel Rosner writes
" did not mince his words .
In a response to a question about the religious right , an important component of the Republican coalition , he said that it was , indeed " a serious problem , " and reminded his listeners that he now lives in Charlottesville , surrounded by such people that he needs to fight .
One would think that this is not exactly what McCain needs , while he is trying to win over this reluctant constituency .
But Eagleburger calmed these young Jews by promising that McCain will not change his ways to please anyone .
And he did not forget to take a swipe on Rush Limbaugh - not for the first time - even while forgetting , or pretending to forget , his name .
It is not clear from the context of the article , in what ways Eagleburger views the religious right as a problem .
He might begin by considering that his candidate John McCain has pandered to the religious right by declaring , and refusing to retract the idea that
Up to 30,000 people are said to have died in the Karabakh conflict
In a cemetery for Armenian military heroes , high above the capital on a snow - covered hilltop , Gagik stands in silence after laying fresh flowers on his nephew 's grave .
The 64 - year - old pensioner says he has eight relatives buried here .
The graveyard has become a symbol of the Armenian war with neighbouring Azerbaijan for the disputed mountain region of Nagorno - Karabakh .
" Of course , it 's never good that people die , but people have to die to protect their nation , " Gagik insists .
" We were forced to fight for this land , and land which has been won with blood should never be returned . "
' Freedom of Karabakh '
Nearby , 47 - year - old Tamara is lovingly polishing her husband 's gravestone , with its poignant engraved portrait of a man wearing military uniform and combat medals .
She , too , refuses to contemplate any compromise with Azerbaijan to end the long - running conflict over Nagorno - Karabakh .
" I feel proud when I come here ; I feel free in this cemetery , because here I can feel the freedom of Karabakh , " she says .
The war in Nagorno - Karabakh ended in 1994 when Armenian fighters won control , although the region is still internationally recognised as being part of Azerbaijan .
No peace deal has yet been signed , and the two former Soviet republics are officially still at war .
Like the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , the Armenian authorities in Nagorno - Karabakh are seeking recognition as an independent state .
' Karabakh clan '
The conflict has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in the campaign for the presidential elections .
There have been angry exchanges and accusations of betrayal over suggestions that Armenia should offer more concessions to Azerbaijan to reach a peace agreement .
If the Soviet Union had not given Karabakh to Azerbaijan by cutting it from Armenia , from the motherland , then the conflict would not exist
Serge Sarkisian
Armenian Prime Minister
The government - backed candidate in the presidential race , current Prime Minister Serge Sarkisian was born in the disputed region , and served as a military commander during the war .
Mr Sarkisian argues that if Kosovo is internationally recognised as independent but not Nagorno - Karabakh , this could be considered as double standards - despite the fact that Armenia itself has not recognised the territory as an independent state .
Although the current Armenian government is led by men from Nagorno - Karabakh , Mr Sarkisian rejects accusations that what the opposition calls the " Karabakh clan " has failed to reach a peace agreement because of its hardline approach .
Political will should be shown to settle this conflict as soon as possible .
The current authorities have n't had such political will
Levon Ter -Petrosian
Presidential contender
" We do n't want problems to remain which will be the basis for the future resumption of the conflict , " he told the BBC , stressing that he favours a peaceful solution .
" If the Soviet Union had not given Karabakh to Azerbaijan by cutting it from Armenia , from the motherland , then the conflict would not exist , so we want to resolve it in a way that is really final , " he said .
' Comeback kid '
While Mr Sarkisian was fighting the war in Nagorno - Karabakh , Levon Ter-Petrosian was the president of Armenia .
But he was forced to step down in 1998 after advocating concessions to end the conflict .
Many residents of Akhurik say the village is dying
After almost a decade of silence , Mr Ter - Petrosian has made a dramatic comeback as an outspoken opposition leader , and he accuses the government of prolonging the negotiations to maintain the status quo in the disputed region .
" Political will should be shown to settle this conflict as soon as possible .
The current authorities have n't had such political will , and they will not if Serge Sarkisian is elected as president , " Mr Ter - Petrosian says .
" Any political solution has to be based on a compromise , " he argues .
The clash of personalities between these two powerful characters - the former president and his former ally - brought the Armenian presidential campaign to life .
Baku 's stance
But in Azerbaijan , the government is more concerned about how the next Armenian president will deal with the Nagorno - Karabakh peace negotiations .
The authorities in Baku insist that the region is theirs and must not be allowed to break away .
" Whoever is elected , the main point is that he should adopt a policy on conflict resolution consistent with the principles and norms of international law , refrain from the policy of occupation , and leave Azerbaijani territories , " Azerbaijan 's Foreign Ministry spokesman Khazar Ibrahim told the BBC .
Azerbaijan and its ally , Turkey , both closed their borders with Armenia because of the war .
The country 's economy - already struggling to recover from post - Soviet collapse - has suffered as a result .
Barbed wire
There is a further unresolved problem with Turkey - the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks during World War I , which Armenia wants to be internationally recognised as genocide .
Armenia 's border with Turkey remains shut , damaging trade
In the village of Akhurik , a short walk from the Turkish border but a long day 's drive from Nagorno - Karabakh , a group of men stand around chatting and smoking cigarettes .
The road through the village used to be a trading route , but it now stops short at a barbed wire fence with a military checkpoint blocking the way into Turkey .
" There is no life here - the place has died , " says Hovik , one of the men passing the empty hours on the icy pavement .
Border villages like Akhurik have been marooned in economic isolation by political disputes .
Hovik and his friends used to do business with the Turks , but they still insist that Armenian control over Nagorno - Karabakh is more important than their own hardship .
" Even if it meant that this border would re-open , " he says , " there should be no compromises over Nagorno - Karabakh . "
Documents show Pentagon now using FBI to spy on Americans Associated Press

Print This Email This ACLU obtains documents after suit over National Security Letters
The military is using the FBI to skirt legal restrictions on domestic surveillance to obtain private records of Americans '
Internet service providers , financial institutions and telephone companies , according to Pentagon documents .
The American Civil Liberties Union expressed outrage at the new revelations , based its conclusion on a review of more than 1,000 documents turned over by the Defense Department after it sued the agency last year for documents related to national security letters , or NSLs , investigative tools used to compel businesses to turn over customer information without a judge 's order or grand jury subpoena .
" Newly unredacted documents released today reveal that the Department of Defense is using the FBI to circumvent legal limits on its own NSL power , " said the ACLU , whose lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court .
ACLU lawyer Melissa Goodman said the documents the civil rights group studied " make us incredibly concerned . "
She said it would be understandable if the military relied on help from the FBI on joint investigations , but not when the FBI was not involved in a probe .
The FBI referred requests for comment Tuesday to the Defense Department .
A department spokesman , Air Force Lt. Col.
Patrick Ryder , said in an e-mail that the department had made " focused , limited and judicious " use of the letters since Congress extended the capability to investigatory entities other than the FBI in 2001 .
He said the department had acted legally in using a necessary investigatory tool and noted that " unusual financial activity of people affiliated with DoD can be an indication of potential espionage or terrorist - related activity . "
Ryder said the information in the ACLU claims came in part from an internal review of DoD 's use of the letters .
" We have since developed training and provided it to the services for their use , " he said .
He said that there was no law requiring it to track use of the letters but that the department had decided it was in its best interest to do so .
Goodman , a staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project , said the military is allowed to demand financial and credit records in certain instances but does not have the authority to get e-mail and phone records or lists of Web sites that people have visited .
That is the kind of information that the FBI can get by using a national security letter , she said .
" That 's why we 're particularly concerned .
The DoD may be accessing the kinds of records they are not allowed to get , " she said .
Goodman also noted that legal limits are placed on the Defense Department " because the military doing domestic investigations tends to make us leery . "
In other allegations , the ACLU said : _ The Navy 's use of the letters to demand domestic records has increased significantly since the Sept. 11 attacks .
_
The military wrongly claimed its use of the letters was limited to investigating only Defense Department employees .
_
The Defense Department has not kept track of how many national security letters the military issues or what information it obtained through the orders .
_
The military provided misleading information to Congress and silenced letter recipients from speaking out about the records requests .
Goodman said Congress should provide stricter guidelines and meaningful oversight of how the military and FBI make national security letter requests .
" Any government agency 's ability to demand these kinds of personal , financial or Internet records in the United States is an intrusive surveillance power , " she said .
Pentagon expected to close Rumsfeld - sparked spy office " The Pentagon is expected to shut a controversial intelligence office that has drawn fire from lawmakers and civil liberties groups who charge that it was part of an effort by the Defense Department to expand into domestic spying , " the New York Times reports Wednesday .
" The move , government officials say , is part of a broad effort under Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to review , overhaul and , in some cases , dismantle an intelligence architecture built by his predecessor , Donald H. Rumsfeld . "
" The intelligence unit , called the Counterintelligence Field Activity office , was created by Mr. Rumsfeld after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as part of an effort to counter the operations of foreign intelligence services and terror groups inside the United States and abroad , " the Times adds .
" Yet the office , whose size and budget is classified , came under fierce criticism in 2005 after it was disclosed that it was managing a database that included information about antiwar protests planned at churches , schools and Quaker meeting halls . "
" Inevitably , after I finish speaking , the strong opinions come .
It happens the same way every time : People listen and then they say what they 've been feeling .
Videogames are not good for you .
Videogames are a waste of time .
They isolate children .
Kids never go outside to play .
They just sit there and stare at the TV all day . "
1. PNG is great , but I ca n’t use them because they do n’t work in Internet Explorer .
This is one is almost entirely false .
PNGs of any flavor will display in Internet Explorer , even back to some pretty old versions .
The problem here is the alpha transparency of PNG - 24 ’s does n’t work in IE 6 .
That ’s it .
if you do n’t need alpha transparency , you can do anything with PNG in IE that you could in any other browser .
If you DO need alpha transparency , even that is n’t too big of a deal as there are lots of ways to deal with it .
2. PNG has the smallest file sizes .
When comparing GIF to PNG - 8 , PNG - 8 often has better compression .
Not always , but often .
But if you are talking about PNG - 24 ( The ones with alpha transparency ) , they never have the smallest file sizes .
In fact , they are often nasty large and huge culprits for slow loading pages .
3. PNG has better color
Again , this is an attribute of PNG - 24 only .
PNG - 24 ’s have great color .
PNG - 24 even has lossless compression , meaning you can save it over and over and never lose quality !
But of course it comes at the expense of file size .
PNG - 8’s use the same color - indexing and have the same color limitations GIF does .
4. PNG is the all - around best format .
Completely false .
Each of the three major image formats , JPG , GIF and PNG , all still have their place as the best format for the job .
For photographic images JPG still cannot be beat in terms of file size .
PNG - 24 can replicate the quality , but at several times the file size .
PNG - 8 beats GIF almost all the time , but PNG ca n’t do animation at all , so any time that is needed GIF is your format .
For more information on when to use which format , check out this post from the archives .
Also , here is a pretty great article on creative uses for PNG .

Juliette Binoche – Academy Award - winning actress for The English Patient .
Academy Award and Golden Globe - nominations for her role in Chocolat .
Winner Best Actress , European Film Awards ( twice ) , Berlin Film Festival , Venice Film Festival , Cesar Awards .
Winner Best Supporting Actress , British Academy Awards , National Board of Review .
Article The Telegraph 9/1/07 : " A Few Days in September is witty and clever , but there is a serious point behind it - with which Binoche is more than a little obsessed .
She describes it as a dramatised version of the events depicted in Michael Moore 's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 .
It alleges that various vested interests - including state security services around the world - knew what was about to happen on September 11 , 2001 .
While preparing for the role Binoche had long conversations with a secret agent , who consulted on the film and on whom she modeled her character .
" Of course he could not reveal everything to me , but he said a lot , " she says .
" Some things I forgot because it was just too much .
Certain things I was very amazed by and when I told people close to me about them they just would n't believe it .
Everything in there is true , " she adds , her eyes blazing with the fervor of a conspiracy theorist .
So is she saying the film is a dramatization of real events ?
" Absolutely , " she says .
" I went to see the Iranian ambassador at the time and he said of course it 's true .
Things that I thought were hidden and private … they were very open about it . "
So she means the CIA and other agencies knew 9/11 was going to happen ?
" Of course . "
So is she saying it was an inside job ?
Or that al - Qaeda was responsible ?
" Everybody is responsible for it .
If you only knew more , it 's even more depressing . "

Martin Sheen
Martin Sheen – 12 - time nominated and 3 - time Emmy Award winning and Golden Globe winning Actor .
Star of numerous movies in his 46 - year career ; he 's best known for his roles in the movies Apocalypse Now and The Execution of Private Slovak and the television series , West Wing .
Father of actors : Emilio Estévez , Ramón Luis Estévez , Charlie Sheen and Renée Estévez .
Interview aired on The Alex Jones Show 10/29/07 :
" Actor Martin Sheen questioned the official 9/11 story , as well as the collapse of Building 7 and Larry Silverstein's " pull it " comment during an anti-war march this past weekend in Los Angeles , saying that recent revelations about the attacks had caused him to have doubts .
...
" Up until last year , I was very dubious , " said Sheen , " I did not want to believe that my government could possibly be involved in such a thing , I could not live in a country that I thought could do that - that would be the ultimate betrayal , " he added .
" However , there have been so many revelations that now I have my doubts , and chief among them is Building 7 - how did they rig that building so that it came down on the evening of the day ? " said Sheen .
Sheen also questioned the comments of Larry Silverstein , the leaseholder of the WTC complex , who told a September 2002 documentary that the decision was made to " pull " Building 7 , a demolition industry term for the deliberate implosion of a structure .
" How convenient , " said Sheen , " When did they rig that building ?
That 's the most interesting question and I have not received a satisfactory answer - nobody could give me an answer to how you rig the building - what a coincidence - two weeks prior and then bring it down on the day , that is the one thing that I have not got a sensible answer about from anyone , " he concluded .
Sheen also stated that NORAD 's failure to follow its standard operating procedure on 9/11 was " something to wonder about . "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .

Christine Ebersole :
There are some people I work with that I think are upset about my talking about 9/11 and thinking that it was an inside job , and , you know , they 're worried about my career and worried about what 's going to happen and things like that .
I do n’t think people really want to really take in the reality that our government could do us harm .
I think that 's the thing .
It 's really just a matter of taking in that reality .
I think we want to look at our government as sort of like a benevolent father that ’s going to take care of us and be kind to us and treat us well and I think it ’s just too much for people to even conceptualize and I 'm sure that ’s what happened to people in Nazi Germany .
...
Things just were n't adding up .
For me it ’s really hard to say , John , what ’s the exact sort of epiphany that I had where I just realized that it was the government that did harm to its own people .
But I think maybe what a deciding one was when my dentist sent me a link to Loose Change [ 9/11 documentary ] and when I saw that , everything that I feared or everything that I intuitively felt was confirmed by watching Loose Change .
John Connor : You suspected ?
Christine Ebersole : Yeah .
Um hmm .
John Connor : Christine , if we were friends and you had never approached me about this subject , if I was still an ignorant zombie , how would you go about educating me ?
What would you say ?
Christine Ebersole : I 'd ask about World Trade Center number 7 .
Number one , I think that 's really to me that 's the most obvious blunder .
Because Silverstein [ WTC leaseholder ] said publicly that we had talked with the fire department and we felt that World Trade Center 7 was so badly damaged that we decided to take it down .
Or take it out .
Take it out , I guess that 's the term that 's used for controlled demolition .
Now you cannot put controlled demolition devices in a building in an afternoon .
That 's just not possible .
So , how do you --
Of course they never even , mention that .
Then they talk about the Twin Towers collapsing .
That 's never even mentioned .
It 's never even brought up in the Report , the 9/11 Commission Report .
So , to me -- How do you explain that ? "

Interview with Xavier de Moulins 2/26/08 :
" On the Internet , one can see many films regarding conspiracy theories about 9/11 .
They are enthralling , perhaps even addictive .
...
One shows a tower , which I believe was in Spain , which burned for 24 hours .
It never collapsed .
No tower has ever collapsed [ due to fire ] .
But within minutes , the [ WTC ] towers collapsed .
And now afterward we can speculate at length about them .
Because the towers contained a lot of gold on 9/11 .
And also the towers were built a long time ago , I think 1973 , and to retrofit the buildings to bring them up to the current technology was much more expensive to do the work rather than simply destroy them . " http://www.marianne2.fr

If you have already been exposed to these issues , you 'll see that there are many things that you 'll want to look at .
We have a large group of gifted researchers .
Some of them have been questioning the official story of Sept. 11th from the very first days after the attacks .
The questions these researchers have raised has been the subject of countless articles , discussions initiated by citizens in their homes .
And there 's been an official silence by the commercial media about these events , but we 've had a tremendous impact on what people have thought .
Last month , a representative poll commissioned by Zogby found that about one - half of this city 's residents [ New York ] do not believe that the attacks came by surprise . "

Rosie O'Donnell : No , but I do believe that in the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel .
I do believe that it defies physics for the World Trade Center Tower 7 , Building 7 , which collapsed in on itself [ Watch video . ] ; it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved -- World Trade Center 7 .
World Trade 1 and 2 got hit by planes .
7 , miraculously , the first time in history , steel was melted by fire .
It is physically impossible .
Elisabeth Hasselbeck :
And who do you think is responsible for that ?
Rosie O'Donnell : I have no idea .

It 's called [ The 9/11 Commission Report : ]
Omissions and Distortions .
It might already be out .
It might be something that I think everyone ought to sit down and read .
...
The DVD that I have just seen , called Connecting the Dots , shows a close up of video taken of the [ WTC ] buildings coming down .
And you actually see the explosions 20 to 30 stories below the demolition wave as the buildings are coming down .
You see these puffs of smoke blowing out the floors below them .
And that 's never addressed , never talked about at all .
...
And you know that a steel - framed building has never , ever collapsed before or since because of fire .
You know I think that what 's really difficult is for American people to wrap their minds around the fact it is possible that our government had something to do with this attack .

30 minutes into the second hour Michelle Phillips : I have so many questions now that I have actually seen and know details about 9/11 that just do n't add up at all to the Commission report .
Paul Berenson :
There 's actually not much that adds up .
Michelle Phillips : None of it adds up .
...
There 's going to be a very interesting book that comes out .

President of the Jury at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival , where he had previously won the Palme d'Or in 1990 .
Eraserhead , The Elephant Man , Dune , Blue Velvet , Twin Peaks , Lost Highway , Mulholland Dr. , Wild at Heart , INLAND EMPIRE Video interview 12/3/06 :
Interviewer :
There also are conspiracy theories of huge proportions .
And you suggested we show part of or a clip of the documentary Loose Change by Dylan Avery .
And it was a film that has been watched by 10 million viewers because you could see it through the Internet , no charge .
The film sums up in a way all the theories about US government having planned the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center
But let 's first watch it .
[ A four - minute segment from Loose Change is shown . ]
Interviewer :
What do you think ?
Do you think it 's convincing what they tell in the film ?
David Lynch :
It 's not so much what they say .
It 's the things that -- you know -- make you look at what you thought you saw in a different light .
And those things for me that bother me : is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane ; the lawn is n't mussed up ; and the government 's not showing the plane hitting , when many cameras photographed it .
At the World Trade Center , three buildings came down like demolition .
And two of them were hit by a plane , but the third one [ WTC 7 ] they said , ' Do you want us to pull it ? '
And they pulled it and it looked just like the other two .
Those things bother me .
[ Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse . ]

In Pennsylvania , the plane that went down , it was just a hole in the ground .
There was n't any wreckage .
There was n't any skid marks .
There was n't any tear in the earth .
And no one 's ever really found out about that .
So , every place there 's questions coming from this documentary .
And you do n't have to believe everything in the documentary to still have questions come up .
...
Interviewer :
And the suggestion that the American government is behind it , what does it mean ?
David Lynch :
That 's too big for people to think about .
It 's too big .
It 's like something no one wants to think about .

Richard Greene : I am at the Immanuel Church and there is a commemoration for 9/11 and one of the stars is Gina Belafonte and she 's going to be speaking in a few minutes .
And I 've pulled her out from the audience .
...
So why are you here at a 9/11 commemoration at Immanuel Church here in Los Angeles .
Gina Belafonte : I 'm connected to 9/11 TruthLA and to Lynn Pentz and Kathleen Rosenblatt [ co - founders ] who asked me to participate this afternoon .
And though I did not lose a close family member in 9/11 , one of my best friends did lose someone very , very dear to them and to this day it has affected their family quite deeply with a lot of emotional stress .
And there is no picture op that is going to take care of the wounds that so many of us feel around the issues of 9/11 .
Richard Greene :
What do you hope that will happen as a result of the 9/11 Truth Movement ?
Another investigation ?
The impeachment of Bush and Cheney ?
Stopping another 9/11 ?
What 's most important for you ?
Gina Belafonte : I hope that people will continue to reach out into their communities and educate them about the truth and that people will never be discouraged in finding that truth , no mater how many walls they come up against , no matter how many barricades they come up against .
People will always try to stop you especially when you 're getting to a deeper truth . "

Interview aired on The Alex Jones Show 10/29/07 :
" Award winning actor Mark Ruffalo says he is " baffled " at the collapse of the twin towers and Building 7 on 9/11 and has called for re-opening the investigation into the attacks , joining Martin Sheen in publicly doubting the government 's official story .
Ruffalo's notable film roles include Michel Gondry 's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Academy Award - nominated 2000 film You Can Count on Me and most recently , 2007 's Zodiac .
He is a vocal critic of the Iraq war having appeared on Democracy Now and spoken at the October 2006 World Ca n't Wait protest in New York City .
In an interview with We Are Change L.A. at an anti-war rally in Los Angeles this past weekend , Ruffalo said he was " baffled " with how the twin towers and Building 7 came down , but cautioned that so much information had been put out that the truth had been " stretched " and that too many people were being distracted by the more " sensational " aspects of some claims made about 9/11 that were being fostered to " discredit the movement . "
Ruffalo also slammed the 9/11 Commission Report .
" The fact that the 9/11 investigation went from the moment the planes hit to the moment the buildings fell and nothing before and nothing after I think makes that investigation completely illegitimate , " said Ruffalo .
" If you 're gonna do a crime investigation , you have to find motive .... and we did n't follow that , it was quickly pushed away , " he added .
Ruffalo concurred that the immediate interference in the crime scene as well as the initial appointment of Henry Kissinger to head the 9/11 Commission were obvious signs that the investigation was compromised , mandating a re-opening of the inquiry . "

Lella Costa
Lella Costa – Italian stage , film , radio and television actress and writer , best known for her theater monologue performances .
Co-narrator of the documentary Zero : An Investigation Into 9/11 10/26/07 :
" ' Bullshit invented by a general ' is how Nobel Prize winner for Literature Dario Fo describes the official version of the attacks on the Twin Towers .
The actor and director is convinced of this version of events in no uncertain terms , and this version is told in Zero : An Investigation Into 9/11 , the documentary by Claudio Fracassi and Francesco Trento , which has been submitted to the Rome film festival .
Fo , with Lella Costa , Moni Ovadia and Gore Vidal , is one of the narrators of the film , which is not fiction , and is the result of an investigation by Giulietto Chiesa [ Member of Parliament of the European Union ] , that provides witness accounts and reconstruction of events which cast doubt on the official version of 9/11 provided by the USA .
...
The playwright explains " The authors of Zero did not begin the project with preconceived ideas but instead created the documentary based on the truths that emerged .
What they ask of you is to watch the film critically . "
Fo says , " As far as 9/11 is concerned , some of the situations we have been told are not only unlikely but also grotesque .
They sound like a General 's bullshit , who is normally capable of very crooked inventions , also thanks to the funny cap he wears " .
He also added , " Ever since Kennedy 's murder I have used the unlikely explanations given by the US Government on some events as material for four of my shows ; they are sometimes really an insult to people 's intelligence . "

Peter Coyote
Peter Coyote – Emmy Award - winning actor , narrator , and author .
Acted in over 90 films and has narrated over 120 documentaries .
Author of the memoir , Sleeping Where I Fell ( 2004 ) .
Interview with Paul Thompson , author of The Terror Timeline ; A Comprehensive Chronicle of the Road to 9/11 2/10/07 :
Peter Coyote :
As the Village Voice newspaper puts it , Paul Thompson 's Timeline is based on public documentation of what we know .
It almost has to be taken more seriously than the 9/11 Commission Report because it 's open .
There 's nothing secret here .
...
When did you first get the idea that maybe these were n't casual mistakes that were going on ; that information was actually being suppressed ?
Paul Thompson :
Well , like I said , my first reaction was finding these articles that I found were really fascinating coming out in reputable newspapers but really getting buried .
I think that the problem first began with the media coverage .
...
People were getting a really skewed view of events .
...
There really was n't that kind of critical analysis , I think , to really ask " Why did these attacks happen ? " , " Why were they successful ? " and all the way until today I do n't think we 've really had that conversation as a nation .
Peter Coyote : ...
Why do you think the administration has tried so hard to prevent an investigation ?
Paul Thompson : ...
As we 've seen in the film [ 9/11 : Press for Truth ] there are quite a lot of things that do n't look good for the Bush Administration .
...
Peter Coyote : ... According to a July poll , this year [ 2006 ] , conducted by Scripps News Service , 1/3 of Americans , 1/3 , think the government either carried out the 9/11 attacks or intentionally allowed them to happen in order to provide a pretext for war in the Middle East .
...
Paul Thompson : Another study , I would also point out , came out recently , another poll is , I think , only 16 % of the people when polled pretty much agreed with the U/S government view of what happened on 9/11 , for instance the attacks basically could n't be stopped , and so forth .
So , you have almost 85 % of the people have some level of doubt about that story .
...
Peter Coyote :
Is it possible that the administration and the government and the media are serving a deeper purpose that perhaps the people themselves do n't really want to know ? ...
You found lots of links between the administration and the Saudis and the bin Laden family .
And I can remember a story about a certain number of Arab being spirited out of the country on a CIA plane .
And business relationship between the Bushes and bin Laden .
How did you discover this stuff and why do you think the leads were not followed ?

Interviewer : Can you do me one favor and say anything about 9/11 Truth .
Esai Morales : Hi , I 'm friends with William Rodriguez .
He heard the explosions before the planes hit His friend 's skin [ Felipe David ] was hanging off and he had come from the basement .
This is a false flag operation .
It was planned .
It 's too many coincidences .
This is my feeling .
When I saw the buildings go down , I knew something was wrong .
And then when Building 7 went down --
Do you know how long it takes to rig a building ?
" Oh , we decided to pull it . "
Thank you Larry Silverstein .
Who 's we ?
And when you decided to " pull it " , how soon afterwards was it down ?
So you must have pre-rigged it ?
Is that where the CIA and the FBI kept all the information ?
Is that maybe the building that had all the evidence of their involvement ?
At the scene of a crime , how do you get rid of the evidence and cart it to China ?
You know , the molten metal and all that sort of things ?
It is a bunch of bullshit .

It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "

Essay WTC 1 and 2 : Justice and 9/11 Demands Accountability .
Forensic Evidence Indicates Presence of Controlled Demolition Material 9/10/10 :
" It was so painful for me as my wife Lil and I watched the events of September 11 , 2001 on television .
Seeing a plane hit the World Trade Center ( WTC ) North Tower at 8:46 , then a second plane hit the South Tower at 9:02 .
Shortly , we saw the firefighters and other first responders courageously going into the buildings hoping to extinguish the fires , but it was impossible to foresee what followed .
Then we watched in shock as nearly a dozen people were jumping from the upper floors to their deaths .
We felt profound horror at 9:59 as the South Tower cascaded in freefall into its own footprint , and then 29 minutes later when the North Tower came down in the same impossible freefall way .
The new forensic evidence which is being released today by Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth demonstrates the presence of controlled demolition materiel in the World Trade Center buildings One and Two .
...
One thing I know is that the official government story of those events , as well as what took place that day at the Pentagon , is just that , a story .
This story is not the truth , but far from it .
I was born on October 12 , 1932 .
I am announcing today that I will be consuming only liquids beginning Sunday until my eightieth birthday in 2012 and until the real truth of what truly happened on that day emerges and is publicly known . "

Interviewed by Jason Bermas on the Alex Jones Show 5/9/08 :
Jason Bermas :
What 's your view on 9/11 ?
We 've had people like Willie Nelson , Jesse Ventura , Senators , Congressmen come on and doubt the official version .
Do you doubt the official version of 9/11 , Tommy ?
Tommy Chong :
Oh , absolutely , absolutely .
There are so many horror stories about 9/11 that have been kept quiet .
It 'll be like the Kennedy assassination .
Years later we 'll find out the truth .
Jason Bermas :
What do you think some of the biggest inconsistencies of the official version are ?
Tommy Chong :
Well , the biggest inconsistency is the fact that , " Who was allowed to fly after everything was shut down ? "
It was the Bin Laden 's . ...
Tommy Chong :
The powers that be , they 're perverting justice .
And we get outraged because we believe in the Constitution and all that .
But there was even reports about Pearl Harbor being a setup .
At least they knew that it was coming and they could have done a lot more than what they did to stop it .
But they needed Pearl Harbor in order to launch the bigger war and that was the same as 9/11 .
It it was n't for 9/11 , we would n't have had Bush in the White House .
Jason Bermas : I agree with you there .
And then you have the Project for a New American Century , which is this neocon think tank , including Cheney and Wolfowitz , and people like Dan Quayle where they actually call for this " New Pearl Harbor " in a document called Rebuilding America 's Defenses , only three months before the [ 9/11 ] attacks where they say they need it in order to transform the Middle East or Eurasia
Tommy Chong : Yeah , yeah , and it's all to subvert and to get the national -- to get the oil , to get their hands on the oil .

Signatory : War Is Illegal Petition 12/07 , which states :
" Against a background of escalating ecological crises , and the fact that large parts of the world´s population are being exposed to extreme poverty , inhuman working conditions and increasing social tensions , the annual global military expenditure has risen to more than 1,000 billion dollars .
The military - industrial complex of just a few G8 countries is responsible for the overwhelming part of this spending , causing incalculable social and ecological consequences .
Unequal distribution of global resources , increasingly controlled by large multinational companies , global debt policy and unfair international trading practices ultimately could not be maintained without military security .
In many countries the military is used to repress critical opposition .
The terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 are increasingly used to justify systematic surveillance and the dismantling of constitutional rights .
[ Bold added for emphasis by Editor of this website . ]
Even European countries have helped to establish Guantanomo - like secret prisons , where torture in all probability takes place .
Iraq was attacked based on falsified evidence causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people , widespread destruction , destabilization and contamination with cancer - causing depleted uranium munitions .
Now plans to attack Iran and the possibility of a new World War have been made public , meeting resistance even from moderate elements within the military due to the unforeseeable consequences .
Faced with the choice between a war , that according to some western leaders , will last for many years or a possible peaceful transformation we support the following demands : ...
International investigation of the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
They are used as the central justification for the " War on Terror " , but well documented evidence shows that the official explanation of 9/11 cannot be correct .
International personalities in science , politics , and culture , including high - ranking military veterans , have called for a new investigation . "

Radio Interview by Carol Brouillet 5/28/07 :
Regarding his experience on September 11 and 12 , 2001 , while making his documentary on the office of the Presidency , Follow The Leader .
" What had happened , Carol , to me was that I had wanted to make a documentary on the United States Presidency .
And at the time I decided I wanted to make that film , George Bush was just entering his first term .
So , I wanted to do a documentary that showed the backstage view of the Presidency ; how it operated ; how the people around him operated to make his office of the President function .
It 's very - it 's a brilliant office , you know , if you have the right person in there who is living up to the ideals and morals that the office demands and leads the country in the way that it should be led .
So , I started to call the White House , and the Secret Service , and some Senators .
And I got a lot of people involved in the film .
And I went to Washington with my partner , Marianne [ Quinn ] , and we made the film .
...
And it was very successful .
I even did a school tour on it later on .
Toured the country , showed the film talking about what it was like to work in the White House with all these people who played such a big part in history during their President 's reign , whoever they were working for .
It was a wonderful film to make .
I totally enjoyed it .
And I did it out of pure patriotism .
I thought the office of the Presidency was great .
I still do .
And we went , of course , to Washington to make the film .
We were there for many months doing this .
And on 9/11 , we had just began --
We decided to do our post - production in Washington DC because I had been promised a sit - down interview with the President three times .
It was always cancelled .
So I said " Let 's do the post - production in Washington , that way when the White House calls , I 'll still be here and I can go over and do the interview . "
Well , 9/11 happened on the very first day that we started to do our post - produciton .
And , of course , that took care of thinking about doing any interviews with the President at that time .
But on 9/12 , my partner and I , Marianne , went over to the Pentagon .
And I said , " We 're not going to be able to get near this .
We 'll just get to drive by as close as we can .
I just wanted to see it . "
Well , we got closer than I ever thought .
We parked on top of the hill where this apartment building was and we walked down to right at the edge of the freeway .
And right across the freeway was the Pentagon -- the crash site .
So , I 'm standing there looking at it and I 'm quiet .
And I did n't say anything .
And -- I do n't know after a little while -- I was in shock .
And I turned to Marianne and I said , " Something 's really wrong here . "
She said , " What ? "
And I said , " Well . "
I said , " Everything .
The grass is n't scorched .
There 's no big hole where this would have impacted .
How come there 's all these trees still up ?
Lampposts where they should n't be are still up . "
The ground was n't torn up .
Not one bit .
The opening where the 757 allegedly hit was ridiculously small .
There was no debris of any sort .
Nothing .
There was nothing there .
And I said , " How could a 757 have crashed into this building ? "
I said , " It 's impossible . "
I said , " In the first place , we should n't even be allowed to be here .
This should be all blocked off as a crime scene , looking for evidence , pieces of the plane . "
I said , " Nothing makes sense . " ...
A few days later , I thought , " Wait a minute here .
If the Pentagon was a hoax and a 757 did n't plow into that as they said it did , that whole thing was preconceived .
All of the Pentagon was .
And that would have had to have meant that New York was pre-planned with the same sort of deception that Washington was . " starting at 11:10 of second hour at http://mp3.wtprn.com/Brouillet

" The former German Minister of Research Andreas von Bülow or the Japanese Member of Parliament Yukihisa Fujita ask for nothing other than an accurate explanation of the events of September 11 , 2001 .
Thousands of scientists , politicians , architects , engineers and explosives experts are working to determine the identity of those responsible .
Their communication is done over the Internet , and as a collective effort , they are much stronger than each individual would be . "

" I 've watched the entire " show " of 9/11 since that fateful morning , and I 've not believed the official version for one minute !
I watched the obvious controlled demolition of WTC 1 , 2 , and 7 , and immediately knew what was up .
Later , I saw that everything was being " sanitized " , that is , covered up .
Everything was kept as " evidence " , and therefore made secret !?
No evidence of anything has been made public .
We 're supposed to believe that the " government " has our best interest at heart and had nothing to do with the cause .
It is quite obvious to me that our extremely sly government wants the truth kept secret .
It is all lies .
A heinous crime has been committed by the Bush administration against the American people . "

Signatory : Petition requesting a reinvestigation of 9/11 , signed by more than 1,500 Architects and Engineers :
" On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . "
http://www.ae911truth.org/joinus.php
Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .

Video : " I 'm very familiar with the 9/11 Truth movement .
And I 'm totally convinced that 9/11 was a fraud .
There 's no doubt in my mind about that .
At first I did n't want to believe it .
It 's such an ugly thing to believe .
...
Most people believe that two buildings fell down that day in New York .
...
Three buildings went down that day , not two .
And the third building was called Building number 7 .
And that was a 47 - story office tower .
It was pretty big .
It was n't as big as the Twins , but it was still enormous .
If you 've ever seen the tape of it falling , you realize it 's a controlled demolition .
It came straight down .
Like you see those building in Vegas come down .
...
He [ Larry Silverstein , the building owner ] said the Fire Department decided to pull it .
Meaning to bring the building down .
That 's what he said .
Now , that was a big mistake on his part .
If you know anything about controlled demolitions you know for a building that size , it would take weeks , weeks to control demolition that building ; to plant explosive on all the floors in all the right places .
You could n't do it in four or five hours .
...
So , once you know that , and he admitted it was controlled demolition , then you realize that that building had been set up weeks , for weeks in advance of 9/11 ever happening .
...
If it was planned weeks in advance , then 9/11 , the Twin Towers , was planned weeks in advance .
It ca n't be any other way .
And that 's why the official government report of 9/11 never mentions Building 7 .
Because they have no explanation .
They have no cover story .
The other cover story is , ' Oh , the planes hit it , so it went down ' , which by the way , ca n't be either .
But rather than getting into all the details , Building 7 is the obvious answer .

" I 'm very familiar with the 9/11 Truth movement .
And I 'm totally convinced that 9/11 was a fraud .
There 's no doubt in my mind about that .
At first I did n't want to believe it .
It 's such an ugly thing to believe .
...
Most people believe that two buildings fell down that day in New York .
...
Three buildings went down that day , not two .
And the third building was called Building number 7 .
And that was a 47 - story office tower .
It was pretty big .
It was n't as big as the Twins , but it was still enormous .
If you 've ever seen the tape of it falling , you realize it 's a controlled demolition .
It came straight down .
Like you see those building in Vegas come down .
... He [ Larry Silverstein , the building owner ] said the Fire Department decided to pull it .
Meaning to bring the building down .
That 's what he said .
Now , that was a big mistake on his part .
If you know anything about controlled demolitions you know for a building that size , it would take weeks , weeks to control demolition that building ; to plant explosive on all the floors in all the right places .
You could n't do it in four or five hours .
...
So , once you know that , and he admitted it was controlled demolition , then you realize that that building had been set up weeks , for weeks in advance of 9/11 ever happening .
...
If it was planned weeks in advance , then 9/11 , the Twin Towers , was planned weeks in advance .
It ca n't be any other way .
And that 's why the official government report of 9/11 never mentions Building 7 .
Because they have no explanation .
They have no cover story .
The other cover story is , ' Oh , the planes hit it , so it went down ' , which by the way , ca n't be either .
But rather than getting into all the details , Building 7 is the obvious answer .
So , when you ask me about 9/11 Truth movement , yes , I believe that and I believe it shows how evil and corrupt our government is . "

The issue of pre-loading needed data for a Rails application has always been somewhat confusing and difficult .
A great post on Rail Spikes discusses the issue in - depth and offers a number of different solutions , but ultimately they all seem just a little short of the desired simplicity .
By combining a few of the ideas and adding a few of my own , I have created a seeding system that I feel is very straightforward and easy to use .
Borrowing the basic premise of the db-populate plugin , Seed Fu is based around loading ruby scripts located in db / fixtures via a Rake task .
What db - populate does n’t offer is a clear syntax for describing the records to be seeded .
That ’s where Seed Fu comes in .
Usage
First , just create a new ruby script in db / fixtures ( and create the directory itself , obviously ) .
Any script that you drop in this folder will be automatically run when you execute your seeding rake task .
Additionally , you can load environment - specific data by adding scripts in a folder of the same name ( i.e. db / fixtures / development .
In these scripts you can execute arbitrary Ruby code with the full Rails environment loaded ; however , you should remember that this code will be executed every time the rake task is called and should not cause duplication or destroy anything that ca n’t be retrieved .
The syntax for Seed Fu works as follows ( with a User model as an example ) :
# db/fixtures/users.rb # put as many seeds as you like in User.seed ( : login , : email ) do |s| s.login = " admin " s.email = " admin@adminnerson.com " s.first_name = " Bob " s.last_name = " Bobson " end User.seed ( : login , : email ) do |s| s.login = " michael " s.email = " michael@abc.com " s.first_name = " Michael " s.last_name = " Bleigh " end 1 # db/ fixtures/users.rb # put as many seeds as you like in User.seed ( : login , : email ) do |s| s.login = " admin " s.email = " admin@adminnerson.com " s.first_name = " Bob " s.last_name = " Bobson " end User.seed ( : login , : email ) do |s| s.login = " michael " s.email = " michael@abc.com " s.first_name = " Michael " s.last_name = " Bleigh " end
The seed method is available on any ActiveRecord .
It takes as parameters the ‘ constraints ’ for that seeding ; in other words , the fixed attributes that will not change in the record ’s life .
The constraints are used to find the record and update instead of creating it with the attributes provided if it already exists .
This way your seeds can change without mucking with other live data on your server .
Once you have set up your fixtures , it ’s simple to run them :
rake db : seed 1 rake db : seed
Or if you want to run them for a targeted environment :
rake db: seed RAILS_ENV =production 1 rake db : seed RAILS_ENV = production
Installation
In edge Rails or Rails 2.1 and beyond :
script / plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git 1 script / plugin install git : //github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git
In previous versions of Rails :
git clone git://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git vendor/plugins/seed-fu 1 git clone git : //github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git vendor/plugins/seed-fu
I have some ideas for the expansion of this plugin ( loading from CSV for larger datasets , etc. ) , so stay tuned !
If you have ideas for additional features or encounter any problems , I have set up a Lighthouse project for your enjoyment .

The other " subjects " in the experiment , one after the other , say that line C seems to be the same size as X .
The real subject is seated next - to - last .
How many people , placed in this situation , would say " C " - giving an obviously incorrect answer that agrees with the unanimous answer of the other subjects ?
What do you think the percentage would be ?

After equating homosexuality with bestiality , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was attacked at the San Francisco Zoo by a gay tiger .
Huckabee had scheduled a campaign stop at the zoo where he made his controversial remarks about homosexuality and bestiality , not realizing that he was standing within earshot of a Bengal tiger with a homosexual lifestyle .
According to onlooker Tracy Klujian , 27 , “ the way that tiger started growling during the speech , you could tell that it felt like it was being taunted . ”
As Huckabee ’s remarks about homosexuality and bestiality reached their peak , the irate tiger leaped over an 18 - foot barrier and began mauling the presidential candidate .
Within minutes , police responding to a 911 call were on the scene , where they fired tranquilizer darts at both the tiger and Huckabee , who had continued to make his offensive remarks throughout the mauling .
According to one aide , the unfortunate tiger attack incident has done nothing to change Huckabee ’s position on gay marriage : “ Not only that , but now he ’s opposed to tigers marrying other tigers . ”
In other campaign news , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney used a speech in South Carolina to tout his life experience , including his stint as a generic white male clipart illustration .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O is not in talks to include Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T Blu-ray high - definition DVD technology in its Xbox 360 video game console , an executive said on Wednesday .

The comments by Aaron Greenberg , group product manager for Xbox 360 , poured cold water on recent speculation that Microsoft could support Blu-ray after Toshiba Corp 6502.T , backer of the rival HD DVD format , gave up when key movie studios and retailers abandoned the technology .
“ Xbox is not currently in talks with Sony or the Blu-ray Association to integrate Blu-ray into the Xbox experience , ” Greenberg told Reuters in an interview .
Microsoft , which has stopped making an HD - DVD add - on for the Xbox 360 , would continue to invest in its Xbox Live online service that already lets users rent hundreds of movies , including ones in high - definition .
“ We ’re the only console offering digital distribution of entertainment content , ” Greenberg said .
The software giant also expected that supply problems for the Xbox 360 meant the machine was outsold in the U.S. market by Sony ’s PlayStation 3 console in February for the second month in a row .
“ We definitely expect we will trail in February as a result of our supply constraints , ” Greenberg said , adding : “ By April , we will be in a very healthy inventory situation . ”
That would be in time for the April 29 launch of Take - Two Interactive Software Inc's TTWO.O " Grand Theft Auto 4 " game , which is widely expected to be one of the best - selling titles of 2008 and could drive purchases of the Xbox 360 and PS3 .
Greenberg spoke a day ahead of the planned release of U.S. video game sales data for February by market research firm NPD , whose monthly reports are pored over by game companies eager for bragging rights .
The PS3 struggled last year due to its high price and lack of must - have games , but sales have picked up in recent months thanks to price cuts in late 2008 and a slate of anticipated upcoming games .
“ We still think we have a great value , that we have significantly better value than Sony .
Every month we ’ve actually been in stock we ’ve outsold them by a 2 to 1 margin , ” Greenberg said .

Europe was mired in a centuries - long dark age before a king named Charlemagne came along and turned on the light switch .
By encouraging arts , culture and education , the 8th - century Frankish king – who would eventually become the first Holy Roman Emperor – tugged the continent out of cultural stagnation that threatened to never end .
Both a fierce warrior and in many ways the first Renaissance man , Charlemagne 's achievements on the battlefield and in his laws led to the first notion of a pan-European identity .
Post - Roman mess
After the break up of the Roman Empire in the late 5th - century , its eastern Byzantine half flourished while the western region disintegrated into a collection of fragmented kingdoms without any central authority .
Europe was entering its fourth century of the " Dark Ages " when Charlemagne was born in A.D. 742 , a time marked by frequent warfare , few important cultural achievements and the virtual cessation of learning .
Charlemagne became ruler of one of those kingdoms in Germany in A.D. 768 and immediately set about expanding his territory .
Through the course of more than 50 battles , most of which he led in person , he 'd conquered almost all of mainland Europe .
Everywhere his rule was established , Charlemagne instituted the same reforms , creating a common identity in people from eastern Germany to southern Spain .
Commerce boomed
One of the most important changes Charlemagne made was abandoning the gold standard and putting all of Europe on the same silver currency .
Trade became easier and the continent prospered , aided by laws that took some power away from the nobles and let the peasantry participate in commerce .
The lower classes benefited in other ways under Charlemagne , who was frustrated with the nobility 's sense of entitlement and had deep sympathy for the peasants , according to historians .
Among other legislation , all local regional governors were subject to regular inspections by royal emissaries to make sure no injustices were being done .
Educational reform was also high on Charlemagne 's agenda .
The progressive leader loved to learn , historians say , and so encouraged schooling throughout his kingdom in his chosen lingua franca , Latin .
All of a sudden , not only were the once - fractured regions of Europe connected by peaceful trade networks and common laws , but people could communicate with each other too .
For spreading Christianity across Europe and to recognize his achievements as the territory 's wide - reaching ruler , Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day in A.D. 800 .
He was the first Emperor to rule the continent since the fall of Rome and was seen as a powerful adversary to the successful Byzantine Empire , centered in modern - day Turkey .
Though the territory would splinter again in the centuries that followed , Charlemagne 's reforms were the spark that ignited Europe 's cultural rebirth .

It should be made clear that there are considerable differences between biofuels in terms of greenhouse gas emissions ( Biofuels : a solution that became part of the problem , March 25 ) .
Sugarcane is by far the most productive , cost - efficient and carbon - saving feedstock for biofuel production .
Sugarcane ethanol allows for a 90 % reduction in emissions , compared with petrol , and its energy balance is 8.3 to one , ie for every unit of energy used in production eight units of energy are created .
Gains in agricultural productivity in Brazil have led to a simultaneous increase in ethanol and food production .
Brazil now produces enough ethanol to power 45 % of its passenger vehicles using only 3.4 m hectares , or 1 % , of its arable land .
This production is located mainly in the centre - south of Brazil , 2,500 km distant from the Amazon .
Brazil 's ethanol production is expected to triple by 2020 , but the increase will require only 6 m additional hectares , only a fraction of the 30 m hectares of degraded pasture currently available .
Thanks to hydroelectric power and to biofuels , approximately 45 % of Brazil 's total energy mix is comprised of renewable sources , compared with the EU 's average of 6.7 % and the UK's 2 % .

Loss of Hastert 's seat in special election is just the latest in string of problems for NRCC's Tom Cole .
House GOP funk worsens
For National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole ( Okla . ) , every week seems to bring a new set of problems .
On Saturday night , things got even worse .
With Democrat Bill Foster ’s victory in the Illinois 14th District special election , Democrats now hold the seats occupied only 21 months ago by former Speaker Dennis Hastert ( Ill. ) and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( Texas ) — the two GOP lawmakers who ran the House from 1998 to 2006 .
Advertisement
Since September , Cole has faced a barrage of bad news :
• The NRCC lags behind the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee by nearly $ 30 million in cash on hand .
• GOP House leadership endured an embarrassing scuffle when Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) tried to fire Cole ’s top two staffers , during which Cole threatened to resign .
• There has been a wave of retirement announcements by veteran Republican lawmakers that will force the NRCC to defend what were once seen as safe GOP seats .
• Rep. Rick Renzi ( R - Ariz . ) was indicted on 35 federal corruption charges , which puts another Republican - controlled district in play .
• And the FBI continues its criminal investigation into a brewing accounting scandal that centers on the former NRCC treasurer ’s activities .
But the GOP ’s defeat in Illinois ’ special election Saturday may trump those setbacks , at least in the short term .
Cole and the House Republican leadership are blaming the loss directly on GOP candidate Jim Oberweis .
A dairy owner who lost three consecutive statewide elections before Saturday , Oberweis has a long history of political baggage .
He won the recent nomination without receiving the support of his Republican primary rival , state Sen. Chris Lauzen .
“ By itself , this would not be that big of a deal , but coupled with everything else it will just deflate the [ House Republican ] Conference , ” said an aide to one top GOP lawmaker .
“ And symbolically , losing Hastert ’s seat is like the toppling of the Saddam statue in Baghdad for Republicans . ”
Cole and the NRCC are desperately spinning Oberweis ’ defeat as an isolated incident that is not endemic of further GOP losses in the fall .
NRCC Communications Director Karen Hanretty , new to the panel after the previous spokeswoman resigned last month , said , “ The one thing 2008 has shown is that one election in one state does not prove a trend .
In fact , there has been no national trend this entire election season . ”
Democrats , however , note that the NRCC spent $ 1.2 million , one - fifth of its cash hoard , in backing Oberweis ’ ultimate defeat .
That comes on top of the $ 2 million - plus that Oberweis spent from his own pocket during the race .
The DCCC spent more than $ 1 million running ads against Oberweis .
Democrats also point out that Hastert never took less than 64 percent in the solidly Republican district , carried handily by President Bush in both 2000 and 2004 .
Even better from Democrats ’ perspective , the efforts on behalf of Oberweis by Hastert , House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , their presumptive 2008 presidential nominee , were not enough to stave off Oberweis ’ loss .
All three Republican leaders had campaigned for Oberweis in recent weeks , with McCain attending a fundraiser for him last month that raised nearly $ 257,000 .
House Republicans already faced a daunting political landscape as Election Day grows closer .
Twenty - eight House Republicans have announced their retirements or have resigned this election cycle – and nearly half of those represent highly competitive districts .
Republicans are also privately pessimistic about retaining Democratic - trending suburban seats held by Reps .
Tom Davis ( Va. ) and Jim Walsh ( N.Y. ) , and they currenty lack a nominee for the open seat of retiring Rep. Jerry Weller ( Ill . ) .
In addition , Republicans have n’t been able to field credible recruits against freshman Democratic Reps .
John Hall of New York , Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Heath Shuler of North Carolina and Zack Space of Ohio — all of whom represent traditionally GOP districts that the party lost in the 2006 election .
On top of that , the DCCC maintains a huge fundraising advantage over its GOP counterpart , ending January with $ 35.4 million in cash , while the NRCC banked $ 6.4 million .
That financial muscle will allow the Democrats to pour money into swing districts , giving the party a chance to pad its House majority .
Yet the situation is n’t entirely hopeless for Cole and the Republicans .
They ’ve successfully recruited some strong candidates in tough districts , including in the open seats of Reps.
Deborah Pryce ( R - Ohio ) and Heather Wilson ( R - N.M . ) .
After a lackluster start , the NRCC ’s fundraising has stabilized as well , with the GOP committee even narrowly outraising the DCCC in January .
An upcoming House Republican dinner with President Bush should net the NRCC at least $ 6 million .
Also , with McCain presumably at the top of the Republican presidential ticket , the party has a chance to compete among independent voters in the Southwest , and he could help Republicans contest two Democratic - held seats in Arizona .
But the small bits of good news threaten to be overwhelmed by Oberweis ’ embarrassing loss .
Even the most pessimistic
Republicans did n’t expect such a crushing defeat : Oberweis lost all but three counties , including Hastert ’s heavily Republican home base of Kendall County .
Republicans say there ’s no way that Boehner can get rid of Cole , despite grumbling about the Oklahoma Republican throughout GOP leadership ranks .
“ We ’re just going to have to work that much harder , ” a senior Republican staffer said Sunday morning .
They also hope that they can unseat Foster , a physicist , in November , when he goes before voters seeking a full term .
“ In a year where change seems to be the big theme in politics , we ’re pretty content with the knowledge that over the next six months Foster will actually have a voting record in a Nancy Pelosi Congress , ” said one top GOP staffer .
But Foster ’s surprise win , in his first run for office , gave Democrats plenty to crow about , and it could further aid their already impressive fundraising advantage as K Street and corporate America look to jump on the winning bandwagon for November .
Foster ’s victory “ sends a political shock wave across America this election year , ” DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen ( Md. ) said in a statement released after the results were announced Saturday night .
A DCCC memo pointed out that “ 80 percent of the Republican open and Republican incumbent seats the DCCC is targeting this cycle have better Democratic performances than Illinois 14 .
Forty out of the 50 seats the DCCC is targeting have Democratic performances of 45 percent or higher . ”

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A top Hamas official said on Tuesday his group was ready to accept a Yemeni initiative for reconciliation with the rival Fatah , but did not say if that means it accepts to relinquish its grip over the Gaza strip .
The Yemeni initiative calls for the situation in Gaza to return to the way it was before Hamas seized control of the territory last June and for early Palestinian elections to be held , conditions endorsed by Abbas and so far rejected by Hamas .
“ The visit is to meet ( Yemeni ) President Ali Abdullah Saleh ... and inform him of the movement ’s acceptance of the Yemeni initiative , ” Hamas deputy politburo chief Moussa Abu Marzouk told Al Jazeera television in Sanaa where Fatah officials were due to meet Saleh .
XiTi Monitor has released the latest numbers on browsers utilization in Europe and the rest of the world , announcing it has reached about 29 % in March 2008 .
Finland , Poland and Slovenia keep leading the pack with 45.9 % , 44 % and 43.7 % respectively .
Considering other browsers including Safari and Opera probably have a strong presence in Europe as well , it could also mean that Firefox is used even more than Internet Explorer in those same countries .
XiTi also notes that usage climbed to 30.1 % on weekends when people is more likely accessing the web from their homes rather than work where company policies may override their personal preferences .
Market share is definitely being grabbed from Internet Explorer which stays in a slow course down .
Opera and Opera are the other major browsers growing at its expense .
Globally , Firefox grew in all the continents and Oceania remains as the leader with 31.2 % ( almost flat compared to February 31.1 % ) .
Africa saw the greatest growth with a 3 % increase month over month .

First the good news .
Storks , pelicans , ibises , and other rare waterbirds from Cambodia ’s famed Tonle Sap region are making a comeback .
Some of the waterbird species have rebounded 20 - fold since 2001 .
That ’s when the Wildlife Conservation Society partnered with the Ministry of Environment of the Royal Government of Cambodia to employ former hunters and egg poachers as round - the - clock park rangers to monitor the birds .
The upshot is that the colonies of Tonle Sap ( Great Lake ) , including the largest , and in some cases , only breeding populations of seven globally threatened large waterbird species in Southeast Asia , have increased from a total of 2,500 breeding pairs in 2001 to 10,000 pairs in 2007 .
Now the bad news .
An alarming new study reveals that Australia ’s shorebirds have suffered a massive collapse in numbers over the past 25 years .
A large scale aerial survey study covering the eastern third of the continent by researchers at the University of New South Wales has identified that migratory shorebirds populations there plunged by 73 % between 1983 and 2006 .
In the same timeframe , Australia ’s 15 species of resident shorebirds have declined by 81 % .
The study is published in the scientific journal Biological Conservation .
“ This is a truly alarming result : in effect , three - quarters of eastern Australia ’s millions of resident and migratory shorebirds have disappeared in just one generation , ” says Richard Kingsford , one of the study authors .
Of the 10 wetlands supporting the highest number of shorebirds , four had been substantially reduced in size during the survey period .
And not only in Australia .
“ The wetlands and resting places that they rely on for food and recuperation are shrinking virtually all the way along their migration path , from Australia through Indonesia , the Philippines , Malaysia and up through Asia into China and Russia , ” says Kingsford .

I have a head cold , and I am really busy so it makes it rough .
But at least I do n’t have to fend off vicious aquatic rodents ….
And yes I know this has nothing to do with the environment , but come on , the guy is fighting off rodents , in the ocean !
Passing rice fields and orchards on my way out of Sacramento , I flashed back to five years prior when my then - wife and I were traveling that same stretch of I - 5 , right around the time Bush attacked Iraq .
Our impossible - to - miss bumper sticker , its big , black letters set against a screaming yellow background , proclaimed : “ NO WAR ON IRAQ . ”
We were stared at .
We were flipped off .
Some yahoo leaning out his window spat at us something unintelligible but assuredly inane .
( You know , sorta like what you ’d hear at a Bush press conference . )
It was a lonely feeling opposing the war then .
One almost had to whisper to ascertain if others likewise reviled the surefire fiasco - in - the - making since , the week of the invasion , eighty percent of Americans drooled over “ shock - and - awe . ”
So now , as I head north again , this time to start my new life in Costa Rica ( yes , I know Central America ’s the other direction : I ’m visiting family near Seattle first ; sheesh ! ) , two - thirds of Americans say they ’re against the war .
But as a famous reptile once said : So ?
Our opinions matter not .
Admittedly , ruling class trivialization of the desires of the great unwashed is nothing new .
However , whereas Marie Antoinette took an entire four words to sum up her contempt for her benighted subjects , Dick Cheney named that ‘ tude in but one .
Give the creature his due :
His monosyllabic dismissal of what the American citizenry ( now ) thinks of his and his imperialism - loving buddies ’ stinking war succinctly expresses the neocon mindset .
Like any in - charge bunch , they ’re wholly impressed with themselves : they ’re the ones with the smarts , they ’re the ones with the balls , they ’re the forward thinkers before whom we rabble should gratefully prostrate ourselves for being saved from silly ideas like , say , giving peace a chance .
It ’s almost too much for me to bear .
Sorry : it is too much for me to bear .
Thus , my decision in May 2005 to flee and now — finally — after a methodical three - year process , I bid good riddance to living under a fascistic government as surreally soulless as it is innately insane .
Friends say , “ You must be excited ! ”
Not really .
Tired is more like it .
It ’s been a lot of grinding .
I assume excited comes later .
Really , though , what I mainly am is sad .
Sad I felt compelled to leave my native country after it became painfully clear my opinion ( read : “ vote ” ) made zero impact on the whole rotten shebang .
What renders me most melancholy , however , arises from the most personal :
While I am powerless over what Bushco does , it is entirely my choice to leave those dearest to me .
Being the fine stunted adult I am , I find accepting sole responsibility for causing pain ( especially mine ) rather distasteful .
I am willingly leaving many friends , most of whom I may never see again .
I am deliberately leaving my hometown , a lovely place I like very much .
I am intentionally leaving my girlfriend , a woman with whom I ’ve shared a relationship so unexpectedly delicious , I ’ve been careful not to ruin it by proposing .
( I ’ve had three marriages .
And three divorces .
Conclusion :
It was time for Plan B. )
She plans to visit me but — will we drift apart ?
Living 3,000 miles from one another can have that effect .
An excruciating parting blow came on March 11 , when I had to say farewell to my beloved golden retriever , Doctor , forever .
He ’d fended off skin tumors for years , but they ’d finally gone inside and done their hideous work .
Now my beautiful boy is going with me to Costa Rica — in a box .
Already , I ’m planning a summer return to Sacramento to take his surviving older sister , Carolina , who continues living with my ex , for more walkies .
Some things I ca n’t say goodbye to for good just yet .
“ It ’s brave what you ’re doing , ” friends also say .
That ’s kind , but I do n’t feel brave .
What I do feel is wildly lucky to be able to leave a country whose actions disgust me , weirdly fortunate my aforementioned then - wife opened the door to all this when she declared our moribund marriage officially dead .
Weeks later , we sold our house at market ’s peak .
My half of the ridiculously high proceeds allowed me to buy property in Costa Rica , where I obtained legal residency with ease and had a house built not with ease ( a long story , but it ’s in the book ; actually , it is the book ) .
I also do n’t feel courageous because , rather than retiring outright as I ’d originally planned , I instead took a one - year leave of absence from work , providing a ) me with more options ( including retiring anyway in twelve months ) and b) America with enough time for its next appointed president , after the end of the current quadrennial dogma- and - phony show , to heroically rescue the Constitution from being totally annihilated by the country ’s democracy - hating corporate masters .
( It ’s possible “ b ” is a tad overly optimistic . )
So , brave ?
Hardly .
I caught some breaks , made a decision and carried it through .
Costa Rica has its problems , for sure .
But what it does n’t have is a military , nor has it had for almost six decades .
The effect on Costa Ricans of long foregoing an army to free up funds for other things , like health care and education , is palpable .
Critics assert Costa Rica might wish to prioritize other items , like , say , infrastructure upkeep .
Potholes , some capable of swallowing cars whole , are ubiquitous and could arguably be the national symbol .
I see it differently .
A government unable or unwilling to make even basic repairs is also less likely to be concerned with tracking my every move , one reason I feel noticeably freer in Costa Rica than I do in the States .
I relish being allowed to just be , a sense of liberty I ’ve not experienced in America for far too long .
For me , then , I ca n’t not go .
But that still does n’t make it easy .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - A Reuters cameraman was killed in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday in what appeared to be an Israeli military strike .
Fadel Shana , 23 , was covering events in the enclave for the international news agency on a day of intense violence when 16 other Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were also killed .
Two youths passing by died in the same explosion that killed Shana , witnesses said .
The cameraman had stepped from his car to film an Israeli tank dug in several hundred meters ( yards ) away .
Video from Shana ’s camera showed the tank opening fire .
Two seconds after the shot raises dust around its gun , the tape goes blank -- seemingly at the moment Shana was hit .
Reuters soundman Wafa Abu Mizyed , 25 , sustained a shrapnel wound and was being treated in a Gaza hospital .
The Israeli army declined immediate comment on what caused Shana ’s death .
It expressed sorrow but also said journalists were putting their lives at risk in areas of combat .
The Reuters vehicle was an unarmored sport utility vehicle bearing “ TV ” and “ Press ” markings .
The blast on a country back road left the car shattered and ablaze .
Shana ’s body amour had been partially torn off .
Abu Mizyed had no recollection of the incident , which occurred in good light around 5 p.m. ( 1400 GMT ) .
An Israeli military spokeswoman , Major Avital Leibovich , said there had been clashes there throughout the day after the three Israeli troops had been killed overnight in the same area .
A military official said : “ We wish to express sorrow for the death of the Palestinian cameraman ...
It should be emphasized that the area in which the cameraman was hurt is an area in which ongoing fighting against armed , extreme and dangerous terrorist organizations occurs on a daily basis . ”

“ The presence of media , photographers and other uninvolved individuals in areas of warfare is extremely dangerous and poses a threat to their lives . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s spokesman said : “ In our operations we try to be as surgical as possible and make every effort not to see innocent people caught up in the fighting . ”
CALL FOR INVESTIGATION
Reuters Editor - in - Chief David Schlesinger called for an investigation : “ This tragic incident shows the risks journalists take every day to report the news .
All governments and organizations have a responsibility to take the utmost care to protect professionals trying to do their jobs , ” he said .
“ Our thoughts are with his family .
We request an immediate investigation into the incident by the Israeli defense forces . ”
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who was visiting Moscow , telephoned Reuters in Gaza to express his condolences .
The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) and Paris - based Reporters Without Borders mourned Shana ’s death .
“ We are asking the Israeli authorities to publicly commit to carrying out an exhaustive investigation into this incident and to make its findings public , ” said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon in a statement .

Shana , who had worked for Reuters in Gaza for more than three years , was wounded in 2006 when an Israeli aircraft fired a missile at a Reuters vehicle .
That car also carried markings showing it was operated by the media organization .
Shana , who was unmarried , was a gentle and popular figure among the 15 - strong Reuters news team in the Gaza Strip .
The bureau was honored by Britain ’s Royal Television Society for its coverage of last year ’s factional fighting in Gaza .
Hundreds of journalists and well - wishers flocked to the hospital where Shana ’s body was taken .
The family planned to hold a funeral on Thursday .
Journalists have become casualties on numerous occasions in the Palestinian territories .
Media watchdogs estimate that nine have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 2000 .
An Israeli soldier shot a Reuters photographer in the leg in Gaza in October .
Two Reuters journalists were wounded by an Israeli tank shell in the enclave in 2003 .
Also in 2003 , one of the most widely renowned Palestinian journalists to work for Reuters , television cameraman Mazen Dana , was shot dead by a U.S. soldier in Baghdad .
Six other Reuters journalists have been killed in that conflict .
There she is , Planet Earth .
Is n't she beautiful ?
It 's Earth Day , that day dedicated to celebrating and contemplating the beauty , fragility , health and get - your - hands - dirty earthiness of our fair planet .
Like any other holiday – much less one founded just two generations ago by hippies – Earth Day has its share of grinches , complaining about eco-sanctimony and whining that it has n't solved the world 's problems .
( Is n't Christmas terrible ?
All those gifts , and we still have war ! )
And then there 's the slightly confused hangers - on : did you know that Major League Baseball " has spent more than a century largely bracing against and defying Mother Nature , working alongside her in a kind of groundskeeping pact " ?
But for those of us who do n't need to deal with Earth Day through a lens of politics or public relations , it 's a handy moment to make the world slightly nicer – what 's so hard about picking up some trash and taking a shorter shower ?
– and go for a walk in the park .
This alone wo n't save the world , but that 's not the point .
And in that spirit , I 'd like to present my favorite images from Earth as Art , a treasury of satellite images selected by NASA and the United States
Geological Survey " for their aesthetic beauty , rather than for scientific value . "
This is our planet .
It 's gorgeous .

When I first heard about Digg I was quite excited .
Digg is a site where you can submit articles , pictures , or other content that you think is interesting .
If other people like the story they can “ digg it , ” and it pushes the story to the top .
The content on the front page only contains articles with a lot of diggs .
What appealed to me is that you do n’t have a “ gatekeeper . ”
You can submit content to Slashdot , but there is a group of editors who have been hired to sift through stories , find the good ones , and ultimately determine what makes it to the front page .
When you have gatekeepers , you will have bias .
If they are not interested in a certain topic , you ’re out of luck .
If a thousand people are interested in a topic , but the editor is n’t , you ’re out of luck .
With Digg , this is n’t a problem .
It ’s democracy in its purest form .
Which leads to the problem .
Let ’s look at an example .
This article about Yahoo rejecting a Microsoft bid was submitted to Digg 59 days ago .
You ca n’t tell by the time any longer , but it was submitted several hours before this article , about the same topic .
The latter article was the one which ultimately made it to the front page .
I see four problems with this scenario .
First , although the one article was submitted first , ultimately it was the second submitted article that made it to the front page .
Not a big deal , but it starts to raise a red flag .
Why did the second article make it , even though the first article had several more hours to collect diggs ?
The Digg submissions were linking to different articles on the same topic – maybe the article that made it to the front page was of higher quality ?
Which leads us to the second problem .
The article that made it to the front page can be found here .
It is three sentences long .
The rest of the page seems to be nothing but ads , ads , and more ads .
The article that did n’t make it can be found here .
In my opinion , the article that did n’t make it is superior because it links to outside sources , is clear and concise , and goes into depth .
So it can be argued that the article submitted later , which made it to the front page , is of lower quality .
The third problem is that of duplicate articles fighting to get to the front page .
The article that did n’t make it got 95 diggs .
Anybody who has submitted articles to Digg knows that it can take a long time to get that many diggs .
If you have 5 - 10 articles on the same topic , and they are all getting dugg , a “ breaking story ” might not make it to the front page for some time because the votes are being spread over a number of articles .
Finally , what I ultimately see as the biggest problem of Digg takes us back to the “ gatekeeper ” issue .
My initial excitement over Digg was the removal of this gatekeeper .
If a story is good , it will make it to the front page .
But this example shows me that this might not be happening .
Instead , what I ’m seeing is a group of submitters who have risen to the top and now have a better chance of getting material to the front page .
In fact , we ’ve ended right back where we began , with a group of gatekeepers .
But it ’s worse than that .
Often these power diggers seem to push their own site or maybe a site with which they have an existing relationship .
Otherwise , why the low quality submissions ?
Minimal content or stories are copied from others sites and then combined with tons of ads on a new site ( as is the case in our example ) .
In other words , these gatekeepers now are n’t pushing material they think is interesting .
Rather , they seem to be pushing whatever reused content is on a predefined set of sites with which they are likely to have a relationship .
Conflict of interest in its purest sense .
So , in the end , we ’re left in the same situation as we were before , except the gatekeepers are n’t paid employees who must demonstrate competence in their job or risk being fired , but people who are pimping unoriginal , copied content – likely for personal gains .
There will always be bias in these “ gatekeepers , ” but blatant bias can be dealt with in the first model , not as much in the second .
There has been a lot of talk about Digg vs. Slashdot ( which uses paid gatekeepers ) .
In my mind , there is little comparison .
Slashdot is not a perfect model , but Digg is even less so .
So , if you want pictures of cute puppies , stories about topless women , and random interesting tech articles posted as a copy of a copy on somebody ’s personal website ( that you can see after you ’ve closed all the popup ads ) , then keep digging away .
If you ’re looking for something a bit meatier , I recommend Slashdot or any of the other “ traditional model ” sites .

Computer Heart Transplant
A few weeks ago I blogged about my old computer PSU and motherboard dying .
I could only find one motherboard still being sold for Socket A ( 462 ) processors , and I did n't want to replace the CPU as well .
This was the first motherboard replacement I 've ever done .
Moving the CPU across was a tense moment .
Made even tenser when I realised that I had n't bought any heat grease .
Luckily I still had the tube from when I 'd swapped over the fan on the CPU before , which came with its own silicone .
Thankfully it was all straightforward , even configuring the FSB speed with jumpers and putting the panel connectors in the new locations .
phew
I still wonder what caused the PSU and the motherboard to blow ...
Webfaction Hosting
As I 'm sure you know , choosing a hosting company is a bit like entering the lottery , except perhaps with slightly better odds .
I should know , I 've been through my share of them .
If you want to experiment with Python web - applications , install applications and generally have a good level of control over your server then a virtual server ( running under Xen or similar ) is one option .
The difficulty with this is that you have to maintain your own Linux installation and are generally on your own when sorting out difficulties .
I did this for a while , luckily I had someone on hand to help me configure mail and web servers , do security updates and all the other fun and gnarly things that go along with maintaining a server .
A few months ago I took the jump of changing host again , to Webfaction .
This was after meeting Remi at the London Python meetups and being convinced that I would trust him with my data .
They offer a ' managed ' hosting service .
You do n't have root login , but you do have SSH access and can install whatever software you want .
You can have long - running processes ( i.e. web applications ) , use cron etc .
Best of all , the account is managed so the server is kept secured and maintained .
They never oversell , so you really get the promised resources .
I 've found the service from Webfaction to be excellent .
A while ago I wanted to change a CNAME record for a sub -domain .
The control panel only allowed me to configure ANAME records .
I emailed a feature request .
Within a few days the feature had been added , and to test it Remi had configured mine for me .
There have been two recent impressive changes .
Firstly Webfaction have opened up the API for their Application Installation Control Panel .
This allows you to install applications , like Django , Turbogears and Pylons , into your hosting account with a single click .
The new API allows anyone to create an installer for new applications .
They 've also just upped the amount of RAM and long - running processes on all accounts .
Hmm ... if my sales pitch has convinced you and you 're thinking of opening an account , you could do me a favour and use my affiliate link .
API Reference Update
One of the great things about Python is that re-inventing the wheel is easy .
Uhmm ...
I meant to say that simple tools can be built very quickly .
This is often easier than adapting existing tools , because :
It does exactly what you want and nothing more
You do n't have to understand someone else 's code
It is completely customisable
Answers a and c are good reasons to create something , answer b is n't .
At Resolver we need to document part of our public API , we need ( ed ) a documentation tool that would produce a reference for our library code .
We want to be able to tightly control the output format .
As I would have been working unpaired on Wednesday I got to work from home ( which with a two hour each way commute is a big bonus ) .
I created a simple prototype tool in 330 lines of Python plus unittests .
As I also put some of my own time into it I 'd like to release this tool as open source .
It makes a very nice simple core of a documentation tool .
My boss is still considering it , he is worried that we would n't be able to release further changes into the community for some time .
Anyway , in lieu of the code you can look at the output .
There is a lot it still does n't do , but it 's not bad .
As you can see it does include docstrings , which was only about ten extra lines of code .
API Reference Without Docstrings
At work we are getting close to our private beta .
This is when we will give Resolver to our initial friendly customers .
They will undoubtedly uncover lots of bugs that we have n't found yet .
More importantly they will help us prioritise the features we have n't yet added and come up with use cases we have n't imagined .
The most important documentation is the parts of Resolver that our customers wo n't be able to work out for themselves , or wo n't be able to use at all without documentation .
I guess there are at least three types of documentation :
Tutorial / Introduction Reference Examples
The part of Resolver that needs most documentation is the public API , both because it will be harder for users to work it out without documentation and because it opens up some of the most interesting possibilities .
A lot of this we can most usefully provide with good examples , but a full reference would be nice .
It has been in creating this API ( which we have n't yet tightly specified ) that I have learned to appreciate why programmers like being able to specify attributes and methods as private .
Our code is tightly specified in the unit tests .
We do n't use comments or docstrings , except in rare cases where obscure workarounds are needed which makes the code hard to read .
We maintain our unit tests rather than maintaining comments .
This has n't been my approach in my own personal projects but it works well at Resolver .
We place a high emphasis on code readability and maintainability , which is why Python works so well for us .
Anyway , all that is by the way .
I 'm looking for a tool that can autogenerate bare API ' docs ' from modules .
Really just a list of public classes , methods and class attributes , with the appropriate function signatures included .
Does anyone know of such a tool ?
Of course if we then have to maintain the documentation separately , maybe it does make sense to keep it in docstrings and generate it automatically .
I realise that it would n't be very hard to create such a tool , and if necessary I 'll do that .
As for the output format , I like ReST because we can use it to create PDF and HTML , so plain text is probably what I 'm after .
A Python syntax coloring system that can generate both HTML and LaTeX output would also be nice .
Developing with Python and Vim on the PocketPC
Python runs on lots of places .
This includes 8 bit microcontrollers thanks to a very interesting project called PyMite .
Perhaps more useful to mere mortals is the distribution that runs on the PocketPC : PythonCE .
With the addition of ctypes to the distribution and a working console , Python provides a viable development system for this platform .
Personally I tend to develop on my PocketPC ( rather than for it ) .
You know , boring meetings , travelling and that sort of thing .
This was never an easy task .
I could n't find an IDE that ran on it , so I would use Pocket Notepad which at least was a no - frills text editor .
I 'm pretty fast on the old screen keyboard and would challenge anyone to a duel with stylus at dawn .
Earlier this year Ed Blake ported IDLE to run on the PocketPC .
This uses Tkinter for the PocketPC .
Bandung has been explaining how to use Rainer VimCE 6 to develop with :
I get VIM working by building an appropriate _vimrc file Forget about doing all of those registry edits as the web site suggests .
My pda seems to ignore them anyway .
Just setup the _vimrc file along with all of the plugins and macros that you want .
I installed the Vim 6.3 desktop version and then copied everything over to the appropriate directories on my storage card .
The only module that produced errors for me was the vim.vim one .
I simply removed it and everything else works ok .
The other problem that I had was a missing format.vim module .
It is in the root Vim directory on the desktop rather than in the Syntax sub directory .
I copied it to the SYNTAX sub - directory on the storage card and everything is cool .
Boy , do I love using Vim on my pda .
I have all of my syntax , the help files and my environment works ok .
Do n't forget to set the rows and column widths using a set lines = 10 and set tw = 78 .
Everything , and I do mean everything else within Vim worked .
I added the most up - to - date python syntax script I could find and that is what I use .
Here is the link to My Pocket Vim file .
Remember , you will have to go through the various sub- folders and delete the files that you do n't need .
There are 4 megs of doc files , and several megs of tutorial files that you might not want on your pda .
Also there are tons of syntax formats that you may never use .
If you open my vimrc_bandung .vim setup file , you will note that I have defined a few short keys .
For example , to type an < esc >
I use three tabs < tab > < tab > < tab > .
I also wanted square brackets so I use < tab > < tab >k and < tab >< tab >l
Here are my keyboard mappings for the additional keys that are not on my Starcom6700 : vmap < tab > > gv vmap < s - tab > < gv imap < tab > < tab > < tab > < C - c > imap < tab > < tab >< down > \ imap < tab > < tab>k [ imap < tab > < tab>l ] imap < tab > < tab >n < imap < tab >< tab > m > imap < tab > < tab > a ^ map < tab >< tab >< tab > < C - c > map < tab >< tab>q < C - Q> map < tab > < tab >< down > \ map < tab > < tab>k [ map < tab > < tab>l ] map < tab > < tab > n < map < tab >< tab > m > map < tab > < tab > a ^ set lines =10 set tw=78 set mouse=a set nowrap set expandtab set ruler filetype plugin on filetype indent on
This is a guide to installing and using VimCE with PythonCE on the Pocket PC ( running Windows CE , Pocket PC or Windows Mobile ) .
You unzip the file and copy the Vim directory to your \ Storage Card \Program Files \Vim directory or into the device 's main memory , i.e. \ Program Files \Vim .
You will want to create a shortcut to the Vim.exe executable .
Then you can launch Vim and begin programming .
You get the context sensitive color highlighting that is within Vim .
You can get the same feature using Idle by the way .
You install python and can run it .
I like to put my unit in the landscape mode and use the hardware keyboard .
If you want to use the Sip keyboard , you can .
I use Calligrapher 's SIP keyboard because it floats and I can move it to the top , middle or bottom of the screen .
Calligrapher also gives me an < esc > key and a few other goodies .
You do n't need a cmd console to program with .
I wanted it so that I could launch programs from a command prompt .
Since my pocket SSH tunnelling programme must be launched via a dos command prompt , that 's what I use it for .
I can also launch other programs from the command prompt such as pword .
exe , Python , Vim , you name it .
I can also launch apps and provide it with an input file name as a command line argument , and the app will start with that file loaded .
Notice how I 've typed python calctaxes .py at the command prompt .
This will launch python and load the module .
You will also note that I ran a bat file that I created .
This bat file is called env.bat and it expands my pocket pc's Path to include the locations where Python , Vim and my other apps are located .
See Pocket PC Console for links to these cmd files , either Microsoft 's or Symbol 's pocket console .
I added a little utility that permits me to do a " right click " , if you will , on a file within the file explorer and choose an alternative to the default " open " .
You can see the additional command called " open with " in the next image .
This permits me to simultaneously launch a python module , then move to my file explorer and choose to open it with vim in order to edit it .
Putting it all together .
I developed a gui app using Tkinter and Python .
I later added Bwidgets and then found another widget called tkTable .
I would start with these tools in order to build your first gui app .
I had a lot of trouble trying to get wxPython to work on my pda .
I would prefer to use this tool since I use it on my desktop but , it wo n't load .
Keeps writing an out of memory error .
So there you have it .
You should be able to test these tools using your pda emulator on your desktop .
One other thing .
It makes sense to get a good taskbar manager .
I use vbar .
This works like < alt > < tab > on your desktop so you can easily move between apps that are open , or close them .

Finalmente il giorno decisivo , finalmente la decisione che molti aspettavano con ansia : Milano ospiterà l’Esposizione universale del 2015 .
Il tema sarà “ Nutrire il mondo - Energia per la vita ” : migliaia di eventi in sei mesi , che dovrebbero attirare quasi 30 milioni di visitatori .
E’ facile capire da questi numeri come la posta in gioco fosse molto alta : si stimano 20 miliardi di investimenti complessivi .
E’ una grossa occasione di crescita della città , speriamo che la sfida a farla diventare una metropoli davvero moderna venga raccolta e affrontata come si deve .
Sarebbe insopportabile vedere che tutto finisce a tarallucci e vino , e gli unici a guadagnare sono gli investitori : questa volta si può fare molto per i cittadini , e non solo per i milanesi .
C’è molto lavoro da fare , rimbocchiamoci tutti le maniche !
Per approfondire , link utili :
Update : pare che comincino già i primi problemi .
Minuzie , ma se questo è l’inizio …
From Barack Obama 's website : " Obama Has Never Been A Muslim , And Is a Committed Christian . "
Obama on the importance of Christ in his life : " I submitted myself to His will , and dedicated myself to discovering His truth and carrying out His works . "
Jabil Bush Hussein is outraged .
Despite repeated denials by the PDP ( Pakistan Democratic Party ) leader and candidate for prime minister , rumors that he is or once was a Christian continue to gather momentum .
Hussein ’s campaign aides have emphasized his strong Muslim beliefs and downplayed any Christian connection .
Hussein spokesman Nouri Aswari issued a statement yesterday reiterating that “ Husssein has never been a Christian , was not raised as a Christian , and is a committed Muslim . "
" After I graduated from college , I submitted myself to Allah ’s will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth and carrying out his works , " Hussein said yesterday .
He also called “ vile and scurrilous ” the use of his middle name , Bush , by some members of the opposition Pakistan People ’s Party .
“ As I have said before , I did not choose my middle name , and I am not a Christian .
Nor does my middle name have , as some have insinuated , anything to do with Moses and the burning bush .
I am not a Jew either . ”
Islamic fundamentalist groups , as well as some PPP leaders , have sought to tarnish Hussein ’s reputation by associating his name with former US strongman George W. Bush , widely reviled for his murderous invasion of Iraq that left more than a million civilians dead and the country in shambles .
PPP Chairman Salah Yusef formally denounced Thursday the Karachi PPP ’s use of Jabil Hussein ’s full name in a recent press release questioning Hussein ’s commitment to Palestine .
Rahim was asked , " You do n't believe that MP Hussein is a Christian ? "
" Of course not , there is no basis for that .
I take him on the basis of what he says , " Rahim said .
" And you know , there is n't any reason to doubt that . "
Meanwhile the Christian world continues to be outraged by the debate over Hussein ’s religion .
“ They hate our freedom and our way of life , ” US President John McCain said yesterday .
“ Such a hateful debate would never take place in a Judeo - Christian culture such as ours .
If this continues much longer we may have to consider sending troops to Pakistan for a hundred years . ”
President McCain has asked Rudy Giuliani , secretary of the Department of Anti-Anti-American Thoughts and Activities , to study the situation further .
President McCain ’s statements were echoed by Democrats on the Hill .
“ We support the president on this issue , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ Our only disagreement is on how long the brave men and women of our armed forces should be deployed to Pakistan .
We believe our troops should stay there no longer than 99 years .
However , I am hopeful we can arrive at a compromise time - frame with the president . ”
In an unusual trinity of agreement , televangelist Pat Robertson added his voice to the McCain - Pelosi chorus .
At a press conference yesterday , Robertson said : “ The attack on Christianity in Pakistan proves once again that Islam is a religion of intolerance .
Such hatred would be unimaginable among Christians .
If that is not the truth , may God strike me d … ”
At that very instant , a lightning bolt cremated Roberston .
His bedazzled followers immediately burst into Pakistani - American singer Nadia Ali ’s song , Rapture :
“ You make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet … ”
Half - Human , Half - Ape
By Paul Stonehill
FATE Magazine - April 2005
A “ chimera ” — originally the fabulous Greek mythological creature with a lion ’s head , a goat ’s body , and a serpent ’s tail — has come to mean any hybrid of two or more creatures .
Chimpanzees are believed by many scientists to be the closest relatives of humans .
The genetic difference between the two species is estimated to be about 1.7 percent at the DNA level ( less than that between horses and zebras ) .
Recent progress in studies of DNA sequences , the fossil record , and brain functions support the idea that there is a sizeable gap separating chimpanzees and monkeys , but not chimpanzees and humans .
Many years ago , according to the recently declassified Soviet documents , a famous scientist tried to close the gap between Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes .
Human - Ape Hybrids
Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov was born in 1870 .
In 1898 , he established several zoological laboratories in Moscow , where he studied the reproductive processes of farm animals .
In 1901 , he established the world ’s first center for artificially impregnated horses .
Before and after the Bolshevik revolution , Ivanov applied his practical technique to other domesticated species .
Several million cattle and sheep were artificially inseminated by the mid-1930s ; the Soviets needed strong animals for their monumental transformation of the economy .
Ivanov also tried to preserve some endangered species using artificial insemination .
In 1927 , the Russian émigré newspaper Russkoye Vremya published articles concerning shocking experiments in which Ivanov allegedly tried to artificially inseminate human and ape females with the other species ’ sperm .
Few people , however , believed these reports .
Many in the West at the time were supporting the “ progressive ” Soviet Republic .
Proof came after the fall of the Soviet Union , according to Alexander Potapov , who published his research in Na Grani nevozhmozhnogo newspaper ( issue 335/4 , 2004 ) .
A document was discovered in the state archives of the Russian Federation reporting the findings of a special commission created in 1929 to evaluate Ivanov ’s proposed anthropoid interspecies hybridization experiments .
These experiments were considered to be of “ great scientific importance , ” and the report indicated that they were to be continued in the Sukhumi Monkey Colony , a Soviet primate center .
The hybridization experiments ( the artificial insemination of human females by anthropoid sperm ) were to be conducted only with the written agreement of the female .
She would accept the risk and obey the required strict isolation regime .
The experiments were to be conducted with all necessary safeguards , including preclusion of natural insemination .
The trials were to be conducted on as many human females as possible , but in no case , fewer than five .
Why would the luminaries of Soviet science laud Ivanov ’s uncanny research ?
According to Potapov , the Bolshevik elite wanted to destroy the belief in God , and subject nature to serve the new Soviet Man .
As a former Soviet citizen myself , I can affirm that neither general ethical concerns nor Judeo - Christian beliefs would be of any interest to Soviet Marxists .
Stalin , whose bloody star was rising in the crimson world of Soviet politics , would get hybrid slaves who would be completely obedient .
The GULAG and its network of concentration camps would not be a necessity for the hybrids .
Ivanov and the Socialist Motherland were interested in another result of crossbreeding , referred to as hybrid vigor , or heterosis .
Heterosis levels tend to be higher as a result of crossbreeding , meaning that the vigor of the hybrids is greater than that of the parental lines .
I am sure that Stalin and his henchmen would have found another use for the chimeric anthropoids designed by Ivanov .
Today we call it biological warfare .
Guinea
Ivanov decided that an expedition to Africa would help him achieve the necessary results .
He put in a request , and received an approval from the Soviet government .
He also was given a financial support in the amount of $ 291,912 , a huge amount of money for the impoverished Socialist state .
Ivanov believed that he would have no problems inseminating African women with chimpanzee sperm .
But he was wrong .
Local women refused to crossbreed with apes .
The Russian scientist would not give up , and made an agreement with physicians in a local hospital to conduct the intramural hybridization experiments .
The governor of the province did not object to the experiments on the condition that the patients would agree to it .
But the women of Guinea categorically refused to be any part of the lurid experiments of the Soviet scientist .
Ivanov was arrested on December 13 , 1930 , and sentenced to a concentration camp for five years .
The OGPU ( the forerunner of the KGB ) commuted his sentence to a five - year exile in Kazakhstan , and finally , Ivanov was released from prison in 1932 .
He died just a few months later , on March 20 .
But our story does not end here .
USSR
In 1974 , Belgian zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans and Soviet scientist Boris F. Porchnev published a fascinating book entitled L’homme de Néanderthal est toujours vivant .
This book contains the account of a Russian doctor who escaped from the Soviet concentration camps , and in 1952 or 1953 met a trusted friend of Heuvelmans .
The doctor claimed that he was arrested because he refused to obey the orders from his superiors .
He was to conduct artificial insemination of Oriental women by the sperm of male gorillas .
The experiments were conducted in the medical department of the Soviet forced labor camps .
The doctor claimed that a race of apemen was created .
They were extremely strong and covered with fur , worked tirelessly in the salt mines , and grew larger than the humans — but they could not reproduce .
Did the Soviets create an apeman in their secret labs , a creature that later escaped to be mistaken in Russia and Eurasia for a “ snowman , ” or a relict hominoid ?
People ’s Republic of China
The noted British novelist , screenwriter and director Stephen Gallagher revealed an interesting bit of information during an address given at the Wellcome Institute ’s symposium on the topic “ Do Artists Demonize the New Genetics ? ” on March 23 , 1995 .
Gallagher had heard of a doctor in Shenyang , in northeast China , who claimed to have achieved success with the artificial insemination of human sperm to a female chimpanzee , only to have the three - month - old fetus destroyed by Red Guards who came in and smashed up his laboratory .
Scientists in China have created embryonic chimeras , hybrid embryos that contain human and rabbit DNA .
On September 7 , 2001 , a report in Beijing Youth Daily stated that Professor Chen Xigu in the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat - sen University had transferred a skin cell nucleus from a seven - year - old boy into a rabbit ’s denucleated egg and created an embryo .
The aim of his research , according to the paper , was to use cloning to develop cures for such illnesses as diabetes and Parkinson ’s disease .
Apparently , with the growing numbers of scientists and medical centers engaged in similar experiments in China ( such as the Shanghai Second Medical University ) , there is also a growing debate over the ethics of cross-species reprogramming .
Italy , 1987
A very interesting article , headlined “ New breed of half - ape ‘ slave ’ thought possible , ” was published in the May 14 , 1987 , issue of the Houston Chronicle .
Brunetto Chiarelli , dean of anthropology at Florence University , claimed that he had knowledge of a secret experiment in which a chimpanzee egg was exposed to human sperm with the result that an apparently viable embryo was created .
The experiment was interrupted at the embryo stage because of ethical considerations .
“ Scientific information is numerous but reserved .
Maybe at the end of the year we will have an idea of what has been achieved , ” Chiarelli said .
Apparently , the cell proceeded to divide ; it was the beginning of a routine developmental process that could potentially have resulted in a human - chimpanzee hybrid .
Italy , 1990's
Another fascinating document from the declassified Soviet archives confirms that noted endocrinologist Sergey Voronov conducted experiments on great apes in the 1920s .
Voronov lived in a special facility in Grimaldi , Italy , a center he established known as “ The Simian Castle . ”
This animal preserve could contain 100 animals at a time .
Voronov was searching for a formula to enable him to slow down the process of aging .
He also conducted experiments to increase male virility and researched organ transplantation .
Voronov published a book about sexual cell transplantation from apes to humans .
Ventimiglia is a small Italian town on the Ligurian Sea and the Italian Riviera , near the French border .
In nearby Grimaldi are grottoes in which prehistoric remains have been found .
Strange creatures were sighted in this area in the 1990s , resembling the crossbreed of a primitive man and a gorilla .
They were naked and stood two meters tall , with long hair , human - looking heads , large hypnotic eyes , and wrinkled skin .
Did Voronov create chimeric creatures whose descendants wander in the wilderness around the Italian Riviera ?
There is little available information about the enigmatic Russian surgeon .
Did he know of Ivanov and his research ?
Italian sources state that the Russian scientist tried to “ graft bodies of animals on human ones . ”
United States
According to an article in the October 27 , 2003 , issue of U.S. News and World Report ( “ Mixing species — and crossing a line ? ” ) , U.S. scientists have placed human neural stem cells into the brains of fetal monkeys to see how well these cells formed brain tissue .
The cells thrived and migrated through the brain .
The experiment drew little notice at the time .
Nell Royce , the author of the article , wrote that today the experiment would spark more debate .
Scientists in Advanced Cell Technology , an American biotechnology company in Massachusetts , had previously ( 1998 ) mixed human cells and cow eggs in an attempt , similar to the Chinese experiments described above , to make hybrid embryos as a source of stem cells .
The genes activated and the egg began to divide in the normal way up to the 32 - cell stage at which it was destroyed .
According to a number of American newspapers , those experiments were not successful .
Ethical Concerns
Nowadays the use of genetic engineering raises a number of concerns .
By far , the greatest public concern is over the mixing of human and animal genes .
After all , both cell fusion and recombinant DNA techniques allow species barriers to be readily overcome .
Human beings are changing the world at an ever - increasing pace .
New crops appear almost every day .
It is certain that we will be using genetic manipulation to change life forms themselves in the coming decades .
Of course , we should be more alarmed about manipulation of animals than of vegetation and microorganisms .
Rachel McConnell suffers from the curse of a creative mind .
She 's always running out of time for projects .
Outside her work at how - to site Instructables , she could n't manage to wedge in enough hours for welding , crafting , and the projects spinning out of her hacker collective .
" I have 50 million side projects , " she said .
" I 'm learning electronics hacking right now . "
So she did what any self - described " antisocial geek " would do :
She found a way to stop sleeping .
Or more specifically , she attempted a so - called polyphasic sleep pattern , in which a couple hours ' worth of short , timed naps throughout the day are supposed to replace a whole night of sleep .
There are various types of sleep regimens floating around the internet , but the one Rachel tried was called the Uberman ( though she 's not much for the name ) .
It works like this : you break up the 24 hours of the day into 4 hour chunks .
At some point in each 4 hour set , you take a twenty minute nap ; the total amount of sleep adds up to about two hours .
The schedule meant she'd have to sleep some during the workday , which her bosses approved , as long as she documented her progress on the how - to site .
Her boyfriend was even up for trying to match their schedules .
McConnell began her sleep regimen , and at first things went well .
" I was able to get more done .
I was up at three in the morning thinking , ' Ok , what can I do now ? ' " she said .
" I was able to make significant headway on my enormous to - do lists .
I would go out on bicycle rides in the middle of the night . "
But by day five , her experience was already starting to deteriorate , even as she held out hope that her body would acclimate to the new sleep schedule .
" Despite the feeling awful part of the time , I am definitely getting things done , " she wrote .
" If I do n't acclimatize and feel crappy half the time like now , it is not worth it . "
Indeed , she made a few changes to her regimen , adding sleeping time , but about 17 days in , McConnell got sick and decided to quit the sleep experiment .
In her farewell note , she summed up her experience , " My current belief is that polyphasic sleep is a method for handling sleep deprivation as well as possible , but that it likely does not provide enough sleep for an average person . "
That polyphasic sleep helps the horribly sleep - deprived is the only positive conclusion about extreme sleep regimens that can be backed up by the limited scientific literature on the topic .
Open - ocean sailors provided the data for a 1989 study that showed under continuous work situations , in which a full night of sleep is not available , " best performance results " were obtained by sailors sleeping for periods between 20 minutes and one hour and for a total of about 5 hours a day .
A more recent study of truckers found that irregular shift drivers tended to move into polyphasic sleep as " a strategy to cope with sleep deprivation . "
Still , McConnell has n't given up on finding the sleep pattern that 's right for her , instead of just the one the rest of the world uses .
Her new plan is to get on a 28 - hour cycle , staying awake for nineteen hours , then sleeping for nine .
That would give her an extra couple hours of waking time and because twenty - eight divides evenly into 168 , the number of hours in a week , six of her days conveniently translate into seven calendar days for the rest of us .
McConnell is planning to try out the new sleep regimen in the next couple of months , so keep an eye on her Instructables page if you want to follow along .

The following is a transcript of a phone interview of Gene Ray , inventor ( or discoverer ) of Nature 's Harmonic Simultaneous 4 - day Time Cube .
The interview was conducted over the phone from San Francisco by Bruno Connelly on June 14 , 2001 .
Audio transcribed by Matt Lagoy .
An mp3 of this phone conversation is available from http://www.whack.org/~bruno/mp3/Gene_Ray-Timecube_Interview.mp3.
Noded with permission .
GR : Hello ?
BC : Hello .
Could I speak to Gene Ray , please ?
GR : This is Gene Ray .
BC : Hey , Gene .
My name 's Bruno .
I 'm calling from San Francisco , California and I 'm doing a little study on the Time Cube and I was wondering if you might have a few minutes to chat with me about it .
GR : Surely .
BC : So , maybe you could just explain the basics of the Time Cube theory itself .
GR : Well , primarily , we have been miseducated into taking the Biblical one first day and the academic Greenwich one day earth rotation .
There are actually four simultaneous twenty - four - hour days in one rotation of Earth .
While we measure time from one point on Earth , actually four points exist : one at mid-day , one at sundown , one at midnight , and one at sun-up and the four corners rotate ... twenty - four hours each : ninety - six hours and that 's all that is .
Some of them try to think of that as infinity time but that 's not .
It 's only four and you can only exist in one corner at a time during the four - corner rotation , but three other people can exist in the others .
BC : And hence your theory on debunking Greenwich Mean Time - the fact that there is no concept of a single day because we always have these four days -
GR : That 's right .
You are one of four - it 's like your body has a front , back and two sides , but you only walk in one direction .
You 're- a human is really a quarter of one corner .
In , like , human metamorphosis - they 're like the things on your hand .
You got the baby , the child , the parent and the grandparent and you can't be four at one time .
The baby dies , becomes the child ; the child dies , becomes the parent and the parent dies ; becomes the grandparent .
Everything created has a top , bottom , front , back and two sides .
The Solar System has that ; the Earth has that ; the human ... and now , if you take ...
Everything on Earth is created between two pole - hemispheres and every human is created between two sexual hemispheres and so each hemisphere , if you treat it like a pie , you divide into four quarters .
That is all there is !
You can't divide it into any more .
All new divisions are the divisions of one of the quarters .
BC : Right .
Now , you mentioned almost like a concept of singularity there , the fact that ... like , dividing a human life into four portions - that you can only exist in one portion at one time .
GR : That 's right .
BC : But then , on your website you also mentioned a concept of four simultaneous years ?
GR : Yeah , because ... the Earth tilt represents an imperfection which life is based upon .
If Earth had a perfectly vertical earth axis , there would be no seasons and therefore no life , but Earth rotates four seasons simultaneously as it revolves around the Sun .
BC : Now , does n't that kind of contradict the previous theory of singularity ?
The fact that you can't exist outside of one of these four quadrants ?
GR : Well , now -
BC : Or at a given period of time ?
GR : Well , I 'm trying to understand what you said .
Let me finish this .
BC : Please .
GR : Now , if you sum up the tilt of those four simultaneous years as it revolves around the sun and divide it by four , you 'd have a perfectly vertical earth axis which represents the perfection of death .
It 's kind of like the straight line on the heart monitor .
The straight one represents the perfection of death .
Life is the imperfection of it - oscillation .
Now , let me get back to your question , then .
BC : So , you mentioned that there 's somewhat this singularity within the Time Cube , that we have these four equal quadrants but you can only exist in one quadrant at a time .
GR : That 's right .
BC : That being a portion of the Earth or , hence , a time zone or a portion of someone 's life .
GR : Yeah .
We can only exist in one of them at the same time .
Now , if you stand at the point " Mid- Day " , that same point also equals somebody else 's sundown , somebody else 's midnight and somebody else 's sundown .
Everything 's into fours ... and so that , but we on the ???
the one , the entity , and even you , like ...
You had four grandparents and each of them had four , like , sixteen - but you do n't use sixteen because that demeans the value of four .
What you actually have is four fours .
BC : So , does that mean that there is no concept -
So , there is no concept of sixteen , there 's only the concept of four fours .
GR : Yeah .
Four fours .
BC : Interesting .
GR : Because sixteen demeans four and the Great Pyramid has four corners - four cornerstones and each cornerstone has four corners .
Just like -
Same as your body - you have four pads : two palms and two soles that represent the corners of the pyramid and your fingers represent the corners of the cornerstones .
BC : So , anything that 's not four does n't technically exist ?
GR : That 's right .
You can't have - well , now that - that is - the way - Earth is - the Nature - now , the human exists as one quarter and in other words you go - you really live in four lifetimes like the baby , child , parent and grandparent almost like four different worlds during the- during your total lifetime and as , like ...
The mother and baby are the same age because there is no mother until the baby 's born ...
It 's a new life for both of them and you can say , " How old was the mother when the baby was born ? "
The mother was only one day old .
We do not recognize human metamorphosis and only the baby is born .
Adults are not born and if you do n't recognize human metamorphosis , adults do not exist except as a continuum - babies or big babies .
We do not recognize anything " four " .
We are so intent on recognizing the singularity ...
I think Einstein and Stephen Hawking and all of them were talking about singularity like the arrow but , actually , you have four arrows in the quarter - I mean - the square .
The Earth rotates , like , in a Time Cube .
Now , you can use your bedroom with four corners and four walls .
You ignore the significance because time is not vertical .
It 's a horizontal rotation around the four corners of mid-day , sundown , midnight and sun-up and so the ...
You can travel between the North Pole and South Pole in zero time because time is not vertical ...
Only time occurs when you 're going north and south if the Earth is rotating .
BC : Now what about the fact that a cube itself , if we look at it three dimensionally , has six sides , not four sides .
GR : Well , now .
The cube has a top and bottom .
You can't call the ceiling and the floor - two poles - as sides ...
Everything has a top and bottom like the top of your head and the bottom of your feet .
You would n't call those sides , see , and that 's where we get -
We 're wrong in a lot of things and you can't lean on the ceiling , lean on the floor .
You go in - because those are the parameters of north and south .
BC : So , what about a concept - I do n't want to use the word " God " , but , you know - of some creator or some higher being , et cetera , et cetera ?
How does that tie into the Time Cube and the theory of " fours " and -
GR : Well , the creation , creator or whatever is not a human form .
It 's more of a cubic spirit .
A cubed spirit , because like the mid-day to mid-day ( the twenty - four hour light race day ) , sundown to sundown is twenty - four hour Asian race day .
Midnight is a twenty - four hour black race day .
Sun-up is a twenty - four hour Indian race day .
As it rotates , it creates the four stages - each one .
Those are primary stages .
Now , you can put all six billion people on Earth into your bedroom and it'll only have four corners .
The number of people do not increase the number of corners .
BC : Interesting .
GR : And -
BC : I 'm sorry .
GR : Go ahead .
BC : Next , another question :
To the best of your knowledge , are you the first person to have discovered the Time Cube ?
GR : Yes .
I can't find anything anywhere .
They threw me - I used to get on some of the internet scientific and philosophy boards and they threw me off ' cause I would n't compromise with them so I started the Time Cube - and the way it looked - I would tack stuff on .
To me , each one was important and sometime I would -
It would get so far back , I 'd have to bring them up to the front and some of them criticized about the repeating , but that 's what academia 's based upon is rote - over and over and over ' til you learn it ...
Actually , I have physicists who acknowledge it , but they can't do it publicly because all your academic institutions are actually religious institutions and they will not allow the physicists to teach this .
No university or academic school on Earth ( so far ) has allowed students to debate the Time Cube .
Now , I have young students call me and tell me they are elected head of the- president of the student body and this kind of thing and they gonna have a debate and some tell me they have prepared for a lawful thing , that they gonna have a debate , but none of them have been allowed to have a ...
Brown University students had my data tacked all over the dining hall walls and they were forced to take it down .
I met with some Georgia Tech students .
I was invited up there to talk with them and they got into religious hassle because the university teach religion .
But , actually , it 's only a single creation and we 've got over two thousand different religions and all of them are wrong .
You can't have but one .
BC : Right , right , but would n't you agree that universities do profess a lot of very scientific and non-religious explanations towards , I mean , everything from creationism to ... you know , ad nauseum .
GR : Well , yeah , they teach it but it 's all wrong .
If they would - The problem with what -
It 's not so bad what they are teaching , it 's -
What is really bad is what they 're denying .
BC : So , I guess what I 'm curious of is :
What is your theory on why universities and academia in general not adopting the Time Cube ?
Why are they so adverse to the concept of the Time Cube ?
GR : Because it would disprove religion and it would disprove academia because academia is based on one corner like the straight line of Stephen Hawking and Einstein .
It will prove that time is cubic .
It 'll disprove everything we 've been taught .
In fact , humans would be better if they were ignorant .
They could comprehend the Time Cube better because now they have been taught on the negative side of ignorance .
They 've almost got to be de-educated before they can comprehend the Time Cube .
You have no idea how hard it is for - I get in debates with national people all the time but they - and they just - they so educated -
They can not comprehend it .
I got brothers and sisters that got some of that high academic degrees in Alabama and they say , " We do n't want to know ! "
They do n't want to , and that 's the way most people are : they do n't want to know .
BC : So , what would you say if someone had the argument that the Time Cube is kind of a simplistic explanation .
You know , just kind of forcing everything to fit into , you know , these nicely , you know , these nicely cut cubes of fours and ...
GR : Well , it is simplistic .
Now , it 's like the - Now , you can even get rid of the four if you recognize the four - the corners ( which are four ) or the quarters of the quadrants .
You could really eliminate the numbers totally and because the corners ( four corners ) ...
I do n't like using a square because a square has no corners .
It 's kind of like if you say " family " , it has no mother - daughter and son-father .
You 'd say father , I mean , family cube - then that includes the others .
You get what I 'm talking about ?
BC : Right .
GR : ... and so ... but -
Anytime you use the entity it denies the main parts in it , and so that 's one of the fallacies of that .
... but I think that if you changed your math from , like , a hundred - by the tens that we use , to the ... from a hundred down to ninety - six ( ' cause it has , like , ninety - six hours in a cube ) .
If you use ninety - six in a hundred , I think maybe pi would probably equal a perfect three point two oh , and it 's - Everything we have been taught is wrong , and that 's reading with Kent .
... and God is kind of like a facade , kind of like a cardboard figure in front of a door .
Now , if we push
Him aside and open that door , it 's a whole new world inside .
It 's a different world from what we know .
BC : Almost enlightenment .
GR : Yeah .
Yeah .
It is .
BC : Now , why do we disregard numbers other than four ?
I mean , why would we disregard numbers that are , say , powers of four ?
Why not , you know , anything that 's divisible by four ?
Sixteen ?
Thirty - two ?
Sixty - four ?
GR : Well , you can 't - Odd numbers -
Now , you can take the four sixteen -
Well , like a clock I show on there with the quarters of four fours equals sixteen an so forth .
You can divide , like , the four sixteen , the four four , down through the atom , up through the universe .
You can not do it with odd numbers .
Now , the flea and atom represent the micro cubes ( the fours ) , and then the fours get bigger up to the human , up through the elephant , and then the four cubes up through the earth sphere and on up through the solar system .
They all -
They 're just different sizes .
BC : Now , do you think other creatures in nature , despite the human , have a concept of the Time Cube ?
Like , say , the earthworm , for example ?
GR : Well , they live by -
That 's how they live .
They do n't need a god .
They live by this principle - and it's a principle - and even if , like , I do n't believe in the Bible or anything , but if you look at Revelations 21:16 , they talk about the coming of the New Jerusalem .
See , it has the length , width and height of a cube and it'll only have the Spirit and the Lamb .
There 'd be no temples in it .
So , I mean , that 's something ( even though I do n't believe in the Bible ) that is in there and that ties , and another thing :
Like , we use the three dimensions of length , width and height .
If you apply that in your bedroom it does not account for the fourth corner perspective dimension ...
The cube has four - corner perspective and " length , width and height " is erroneous .
Also , the Cartesian Coordinates of three dimensions is erroneous .
All our math is wrong .
... and... but , through this -
It 's nothing that you can't understand through this , and I 've been on old Lionel 's show in New York , the eYada station , for about six times .
I think he had it on there yesterday , the interview , and I 've been on his station about six times , but I think -
Now , the newspapers wo n't print this for a million dollars .
St. Petersburg Times wo n't print it .
I can say the worst things , call them the worst names , and they ignore it , and I go down to the Webber College University and they say , " If you come back down here , we 'll put you in jail . "
The Board of Education said , " If you send us another fax , we 'll put you in jail . "
Now , I got flyers made up I 'm gonna take down to the St. Pete Times and distribute them , accusing them of being evil because they will not inform the public of the Time Cube discovery .
It 's forbidden knowledge .
BC : Are you concerned with who 's going to evangelize the Time Cube once you 're no longer here ?
I mean , since you 're having such an adverse reaction to whoever you 're trying to explain it and debate it with .
GR : Well , I have a lot of people that understand it , but now , the purpose of my Time Cube site was not to educate people , it was really to induce a research group to evaluate it and slowly release it to the public ' cause if it ever hits overnight and some media picks up on it , I mean , it 's gonna cause a hell of a lot of trouble .
It should be controlled , but no one 's interested in controlling it because it 's gonna take a lot of changes , a lot of rethinking and ...
But , nobody wants to analyze it .
BC : Have you thought that maybe you stumbled across something so powerful that you 're just , you know , bound to be persecuted for it ?
You know , something that 's just too powerful for people to comprehend and -
GR : Well , they do n't want to change and , actually , religion and everything is really a scam against children and it's the young people that gonna have to realize it in order to stop the adult plunder of the resources or they are gonna inherit a barren Earth .
Already , our social security is ... the same as a pyramid scheme and it's going ( they say 2016 or something , I think ) -
It will be bankrupt ... and so ...
What we 're doing , we 're destroying everything belong to the children .
The adults , if possible , they could sell every resource on Earth today and to hell with tomorrow .
They already say , " I live for today ! "
They do n't give a damn about tomorrow and anybody that do n't live for tomorrow should die overnight .
They do n't deserve a tomorrow .
BC : Right .
Seize the day .
GR : .. and so that 's ... ... but now I get people calling me all the time like you do and , like I say , it 's a lot of people , I mean -
You know , they say it 's " brilliant " and things of this nature , but they just - I had one fellow from Drake University that was gonna sue me for the thousand dollars and he said he disproved it and he sent me a very apologetic letter , said his physics professor sat him down and said that humans can not conceive of anything that rotates in four different directions simultaneously .
I mean , Earth moves toward mid-day , sundown , midnight and sun-up simultaneously and humans can't comprehend that .
BC : So you have had no one successfully disprove the -
GR : No .
It 's impossible to improve - I got a plastic cube as a paperweight , got an Earth inside of it and it represents , like , the Time Cube .
The sun shines on one corner .
It creates the optic corner of midnight and where the two join , synnergy creates the two new corners .
In other words , you got two majors , two minors .
Just like -
You put in - Summer and Winter - You join them - Everything is corners and you join the two major corners , Summer and Winter , and they create two minor corners of Spring and Fall .
Hot and cold creates two new corners of warm and cool .
You got two majors and two minors and just about everything fits into that scheme .
I , like I said , I been working on it over twenty years .
I can't find anything else , anything yet , that contradicts it .
BC : Well , Gene , thank you .
Thank you very much for your time .
GR : Yeah .
BC : I appreciate the opportunity to chat with you and get some answers to some questions .
GR : Yeah .
Well , if you can get any -
That 's what I 'm - Primarily , what I 'm pushing for is debate .
I'm " challenge and debate " it .
If they ever debate it , it will come out but they know what it 's gonna do and so that 's the reason they wo n't allow it to debate and so , yeah -
Anything you do -
If I can ever force one media to print it , I mean , Lionel 's show up on ... that eYada , and it's ... on these web stations ...
I mean , he 's got a big audience , like I say .
He likes it and so - Hey - Let me ask you another question .
Do you know your father was a fish ?
BC : My father was a fish .
No .
Please explain .
GR : Well , it 's a little " microspermfish " , I mean -
The sperm , it swims upstream just like the salmon do .
You fertilize the female egg laid in the water .
BC : Interesting .
GR : It is , and it's so fascinating , the stuff you can come up with in this thing but , see , what religion does , primarily -
It is a cessation of the ...
Tape ends .
Merrill Lynch is expected to announce another huge asset write - down tomorrow , as the turmoil in the financial world continues to cost the world 's biggest banks billions of dollars .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the US bank will report up to $ 8bn ( £ 4 bn ) in new losses on securities backed by US mortgages – taking its total write - downs to about $ 30bn .
This would see the firm post a loss for the third quarter in a row for the first time in its history and could undermine chief executive John Thain 's efforts to rescue the firm 's fortunes .
The WSJ claimed the bank would also cut 10 - 15 % of jobs in certain areas , including bond financing .
JP Morgan and Citigroup are also expected to announce fresh write - downs alongside their financial results this week , adding to the pain already caused by the credit crunch .
Merrill incurred its huge losses through its deep involvement in mortgage securities .
It originally profited by packaging mortgages into complex vehicles such as collateralised debt obligations , but came unstuck when America 's sub - prime mortgage market collapsed .
The resulting credit crunch has sent stock markets falling and sparked fears of tens of thousands of City job losses .
With consumer confidence also waning , prime minister Gordon Brown will meet with Wall Street bankers later today as part of his three - day visit to the US .

Work of a Truck Driver
BOSS Snowplows - Snowplows , Salt Spreaders and other Snow Removal Equipment for the Professional and Homeowner
Truck drivers are a constant presence on the Nation ’s highways and interstates .
They deliver everything from automobiles to canned food .
Firms of all kinds rely on trucks to pick up and deliver goods because no other form of transportation can deliver goods door - to - door .
Even if some goods travel most of the way by ship , train , or airplane , almost everything is carried by trucks at some point in its journey .
Before leaving the terminal or warehouse , truck drivers check the fuel level and oil in their trucks .
They also inspect the trucks to make sure that the brakes , windshield wipers , and lights are working and that a fire extinguisher , flares , and other safety equipment are aboard and in working order .
Drivers make sure their cargo is secure and adjust the mirrors so that both sides of the truck are visible from the driver ’s seat .
Drivers report equipment that is inoperable , missing , or loaded improperly to the dispatcher .
Once under way , drivers must be alert in order to prevent accidents .
Drivers can see farther down the road because large trucks seat them higher off the ground than other vehicles .
This allows them to see the road ahead and select lanes that are moving more smoothly as well as giving them warning of any dangerous road conditions ahead of them .
The duration of runs vary according to the types of cargo and the destinations .
Local drivers may provide daily service for a specific route or region , while other drivers make longer , intercity and interstate deliveries .
Interstate and intercity cargo tends to vary from job to job more than local cargo .
A driver ’s responsibilities and assignments change according to the type of loads transported and their vehicle ’s size .
New technologies are changing the way truck drivers work , especially long - distance truck drivers .
Satellites and the Global Positioning System link many trucks with their company ’s headquarters .
Troubleshooting information , directions , weather reports , and other important communications can be instantly relayed to the truck .
Drivers can easily communicate with the dispatcher to discuss delivery schedules and courses of action in the event of mechanical problems .
The satellite link also allows the dispatcher to track the truck ’s location , fuel consumption , and engine performance .
Some drivers also work with computerized inventory tracking equipment .
It is important for the producer , warehouse , and customer to know their product ’s location at all times so they can maintain a high quality of service .
Heavy truck and tractor - trailer drivers operate trucks or vans with a capacity of at least 26,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight ( GVW ) .
They transport goods including cars , livestock , and other materials in liquid , loose , or packaged form .
Many routes are from city to city and cover long distances .
Some companies use two drivers on very long runsone drives while the other sleeps in a berth behind the cab .
These “ sleeper ” runs can last for days , or even weeks .
Trucks on sleeper runs typically stop only for fuel , food , loading , and unloading .
Some heavy truck and tractor - trailer drivers who have regular runs transport freight to the same city on a regular basis .
Other drivers perform ad hoc runs because shippers request varying service to different cities every day .
The U.S. Department of Transportation requires that drivers keep a log of their activities , the condition of the truck , and the circumstances of any accidents .
Long - distance heavy truck and tractor - trailer drivers spend most of their working time behind the wheel , but also may have to load or unload their cargo .
This is especially common when drivers haul specialty cargo , because they may be the only ones at the destination familiar with procedures or certified to handle the materials .
Auto - transport drivers , for example , position cars on the trailers at the manufacturing plant and remove them at the dealerships .
When picking up or delivering furniture , drivers of long - distance moving vans hire local workers to help them load or unload .
Light or delivery services truck drivers operate vans and trucks weighing less than 26,000 pounds GVW .
They pick up or deliver merchandise and packages within a specific area .
This may include short “ turnarounds ” to deliver a shipment to a nearby city , pick up another loaded truck or van , and drive it back to their home base the same day .
These services may require use of electronic delivery tracking systems to track the whereabouts of the merchandise or packages .
Light or delivery services truck drivers usually load or unload the merchandise at the customer ’s place of business .
They may have helpers if there are many deliveries to make during the day , or if the load requires heavy moving .
Typically , before the driver arrives for work , material handlers load the trucks and arrange items for ease of delivery .
Customers must sign receipts for goods and pay drivers the balance due on the merchandise if there is a cash - on - delivery arrangement .
At the end of the day drivers turn in receipts , payments , records of deliveries made , and any reports on mechanical problems with their trucks .
Some local truck drivers have sales and customer service responsibilities .
The primary responsibility of driver / sales workers , or route drivers , is to deliver and sell their firm ’s products over established routes or within an established territory .
They sell goods such as food products , including restaurant takeout items , or pick up and deliver items such as laundry .
Their response to customer complaints and requests can make the difference between a large order and a lost customer .
Route drivers may also take orders and collect payments .
The duties of driver / sales workers vary according to their industry , the policies of their employer , and the emphasis placed on their sales responsibility .
Most have wholesale routes that deliver to businesses and stores , rather than to homes .
For example , wholesale bakery driver / sales workers deliver and arrange bread , cakes , rolls , and other baked goods on display racks in grocery stores .
They estimate how many of each item to stock by paying close attention to what is selling .
They may recommend changes in a store ’s order or encourage the manager to stock new bakery products .
Laundries that rent linens , towels , work clothes , and other items employ driver / sales workers to visit businesses regularly to replace soiled laundry .
Their duties also may include soliciting new customers along their sales route .
After completing their route , driver / sales workers place orders for their next deliveries based on product sales and customer requests .
Truck Driver Working Conditions
Truck driving has become less physically demanding because most trucks now have more comfortable seats , better ventilation , and improved , ergonomically designed cabs .
Although these changes make the work environment less taxing , driving for many hours at a stretch , loading and unloading cargo , and making many deliveries can be tiring .
Local truck drivers , unlike long - distance drivers , usually return home in the evening .
Some self - employed long - distance truck drivers who own and operate their trucks spend most of the year away from home .
Design improvements in newer trucks have reduced stress and increased the efficiency of long - distance drivers .
Many newer trucks are equipped with refrigerators , televisions , and bunks .
The U.S. Department of Transportation governs work hours and other working conditions of truck drivers engaged in interstate commerce .
A long - distance driver may drive for 11 hours and work for up to 14 hours including driving and non-driving duties after having 10 hours off - duty .
A driver may not drive after having worked for 60 hours in the past 7 days or 70 hours in the past 8 days unless they have taken at least 34 consecutive hours off - duty .
Most drivers are required to document their time in a logbook .
Many drivers , particularly on long runs , work close to the maximum time permitted because they typically are compensated according to the number of miles or hours they drive .
Drivers on long runs face boredom , loneliness , and fatigue .
Drivers often travel nights , holidays , and weekends to avoid traffic delays .
Local truck drivers frequently work 50 or more hours a week .
Drivers who handle food for chain grocery stores , produce markets , or bakeries typically work long hours starting late at night or early in the morning .
Although most drivers have regular routes , some have different routes each day .
Many local truck drivers , particularly driver / sales workers , load and unload their own trucks .
This requires considerable lifting , carrying , and walking each day .

With the U.S. armed forces stretched to their limits fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the debate in the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the funding of these operations has stalled .
Although the Democrats took control of the House in January 2007 , efforts to cut off funding remain mired in intra-party disagreements .
Meanwhile , one Republican Congressman has introduced legislation of grave importance to our troops deployed overseas – if passed , the “ Military Honor and Decency Act ” will ban the sale of Playboy and Penthouse on military bases .
It ’s currently illegal under the 1997 Defense Authorization
Act to sell “ sexually explicit ” material on military bases .
Magazines like Playboy and Penthouse have thus far been permitted because they contain substantial non-sexual content .
Intent on closing this so - called loophole , Rep. Paul C. Broun ( R - GA ) announced his bill in this April 17 press release :
“ As a Marine , I am deeply concerned for the welfare of our troops and their mission , ” said Broun .
“ Allowing the sale of pornography on military bases has harmed military men and women by : escalating the number of violent , sexual crimes ; feeding a base addiction ; eroding the family as the primary building block of society ; and denigrating the moral standing of our troops both here and abroad .
Our troops should not see their honor sullied so that the moguls behind magazines like Playboy and Penthouse can profit .
The ‘ Military Honor and Decency Act ’ will right a bureaucratic–and moral–wrong . ”
Broun is a medical doctor by profession , serving his first term in the House after being elected in a district where the previous Congressman died .
One would be hard - pressed to question a former Marine ’s dedication to the welfare of the troops , but Broun ’s claim that pornography is responsible for sexual violence is highly dubious .
Living in 2008 , most Americans have had easy access to internet pornography for about a decade .
There is no evidence of a correlating increase in sex crimes over that period .
Even noted feminist Naomi Wolf has observed that widely - available porn has not transformed men into sexual predators – if anything , it ’s turned off men ’s interest in real , live women .
Advertisements
But judging from Rep. Broun ’s official congressional web site , he ’s not so much interested in the welfare of the troops as he is in enforcing morality .
Broun proclaims to have a four - point test that he applies to any legislation that comes before him :
1 ) Is it Moral / Right ?
2 ) Is it Constitutional ?
3 ) Is it Necessary ?
4 ) Is it Affordable ?
Broun is certainly entitled to establish any criteria he chooses for voting on a bill , but it does n’t inspire confidence that the constitutionality of proposed legislation is n’t his primary concern .
According to Newsweek , Broun drafted the “ Military Honor and Decency Act ” after receiving a complaint from a constituent who saw an officer buying a dirty magazine at a military exchange store in front of her children .
Moved by this woman ’s anguish , Broun immediately set about ensuring no child would ever again be subjected to this horrible vision – an adult man in uniform purchasing a magazine featuring photos of women without uniforms .
Broun ’s spokesman , John Kennedy , tried to spin the bill as a matter of concern over taxpayer dollars , which are “ used to pay military salaries , so taxpayer money is , in effect , being used to buy these materials . ”
Taxpayer dollars are frequently disbursed to private citizens in the form of unemployment benefits , disaster assistance , and student loans .
If Broun truly intends to regulate individual expenditures of such funds , he ’s going to have his hands full .
The main issue is whether or not U.S. troops , including those deployed overseas , should be able to purchase nudie mags on base with their own money .
Obviously , troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are basically celibate – their spouses are n’t deployed with them in war zones , and their dating options are severely limited .
It ’s worth noting that Broun , like most Republicans , is a reliable supporter of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and believes we need to complete both missions .
In other words , Broun is willing to continue funding two controversial wars , but he draws the line at allowing soldiers to buy soft porn magazines .
That ’s a very peculiar theory of fiscal conservatism .
But is it moral / right ?
According to Broun it is , and that ’s the most important thing .
Researchers have confirmed the first case of complete lunglessness in a frog , according to a report in the April 8th issue of Current Biology , a publication of Cell Press .
The aquatic frog Barbourula kalimantanensis apparently gets all the oxygen it needs through its skin .
Previously known from only two specimens , two new populations of the aquatic frog were found by the team during a recent expedition to Indonesian Borneo .
“ We knew that we would have to be very lucky just to find the frog , ” said David Bickford of the National University of Singapore .
“ People have been trying for 30 years .
But when we did and I was doing the initial dissections — right there in the field — I have to say that I was very skeptical at first [ that they would in fact lack lungs ] .
It just did not seem possible .
We were all shocked when it turned out to be true for all the specimens we had from Kalimantan , Indonesia .
“ The thing that struck me most then and now is that there are still major firsts ( e.g. , first lungless frog ! ) to be found out in the field , ” he added .
“ All you have to do is go a little ways beyond what people have done before , and — voila ! ”
Of all tetrapods ( animals with four limbs ) , lunglessness is only known to occur in amphibians .
There are many lungless salamanders and a single species of caecilian , a limbless amphibian resembling an earthworm , known to science .
Nevertheless , Bickford said , the complete loss of lungs is a particularly rare evolutionary event that has probably only occurred three times .
The discovery of lunglessness in a secretive Bornean frog supports the idea that lungs are a malleable trait in amphibians , which represent the evolutionary sister group to all other tetrapods , according to the researchers .
Barboroula kalimantanensis lives in cold , fast - flowing water , they noted , so loss of lungs might be an adaptation to a combination of factors : a higher oxygen environment , the species ’s presumed low metabolic rate , severe flattening of their bodies that increases the surface area of their skin , and selection for negative buoyancy — meaning that the frogs would rather sink than float .
The researchers said that further studies of this remarkable frog may be hampered by the species ’s rarity and endangerment .
They therefore strongly encourage conservation of the frogs ’ remaining habitats .
“ This is an endangered frog — that we know practically nothing about — with an amazing ability to breathe entirely through its skin , whose future is being destroyed by illegal gold mining by people who are marginalized and have no other means of supporting themselves , ” Bickford said .
“ There are no simple answers to this problem . ”

AS you prepare to open those college rejection letters , or worry about having to take summer school classes , fret not – being brilliant is not in the numbers .
A roundup of IQ studies from Cambridge University Press , called the “ Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance , ” proves that Thomas Edison was right all along : Genius is 99 percent perspiration .
“ There are international chess masters that have below - average IQs , ” says Dr. K. Anders Ericsson , a professor of psychology at Florida State University in Tallahassee , who edited the handbook .
“ Basically , there is no indication that people with higher IQ are able to reach the top faster .
We are finding people who meet the criteria for being skilled surgeons , chess masters , athletes or magicians .
Once you start looking at what makes them successful , IQ does n’t make any difference . ”
The 918 - page book raises the question of whether we should eliminate the idea of determining one ’s potential through IQ altogether .
Instead of accepting a child into an elite school for a number they scored on a test or scouting a CIA recruit because of his IQ score , we might “ speak instead of expertise , talent or even greatness , ” Ericsson says .
Writes British journalist David Dobbs in New Scientist magazine : “ Examine closely even the most extreme examples – Mozart , Newton , Einstein , Stravinsky – and you find more hard - won mastery than gift .
“ Geniuses are made , not born . ”
In one study of adult graduates of New York City ’s Hunter College Elementary School , where an admission criterion was an IQ of at least 130 , researchers found most had average lives , with few achieving an extreme accomplishment .
“ There were no superstars , no Pulitzer Prize or MacArthur Award winners , and only one or two familiar names , ” said study leader Rena Subotnik , a research psychologist with the American Psychological Association .
The three keys to success ?
Hard work , persistence and a solid upbringing .
The Cambridge studies show that people who have become internationally successful invariably worked with a mentor who has been at that level .
“ Ability does n’t seem to have anything to do with it , ” Ericcson says .
“ You need to accumulate your experience .
Perfect practice makes perfect .
If you ’re out playing tennis and you miss an overhand volley , the game will go on .
The next time the identical situation happens , you ’re not going to be more successful .
In order to improve , you need a special training environment where a mentor will give you appropriate shots . ”
The Cambridge “ Handbook ” also makes the claim that in order to achieve ( or overachieve ) genius status , one must put in five times extra work and 10 years of effort more than an amateur .
“ A lot of people think highly talented people can become good at anything rapidly , ” Ericsson says .
“ But what this study says is that nobody has been able to rise without having practiced for 10 years .
In [ classical ] music right now , it takes more than 15 - 20 years before they start winning in competitions . ”
Four mega - dangers international financial markets face
Dennis Snower
The financial turmoil has been worsening as lagged adjustment processes play out .
This column outlines economic dangers that may arise as they unwind , including a scenario in which the United States suffers extended stagflation .
Day after day new , alarming news emerges from the world ’s financial markets , and day after day the public is surprised by how bad it is .
But instead of wringing our hands , let ’s ask ourselves an important , unconventional question :
What is more surprising : that financial markets have turned from bad to worse , or that we continue to be surprised by each successive piece of adverse news ?
I suggest that our repeated surprise should be more surprising .
This issue is important , because if we were better at recognising the financial risks we face , we could do more to avoid them .
If banks , investment houses , and American homeowners had done a better job in recognising the risks in the subprime mortgage market , we could have spared ourselves the current crisis .
Why does the public repeatedly underestimate the repercussions of the present financial crisis ?
The answer is simple : most of us are short - sighted ; we ca n’t imagine a future that is radically different from the present .
In particular , most of us do n’t understand that economic events often unfold gradually due to the operation of important lagged adjustment processes embedded in the economy .
The public , the media and politicians would do well to give them close attention .
Lagged adjustment processes .
After the Titanic ’s hull was punctured , it took hours for its hull to fill with water ; thus the passengers could n’t imagine that it would sink .
In my judgment , there are currently four major dangers facing the world economy , and all of them are currently obscured by the fact they play themselves out slowly .
Four dangers
The first danger we have witnessed since August 2007 :
The subprime mortgage crisis gave rise to a liquidity crisis in the international banking system , due to uncertainty about who holds the losses .
This is leading to reduced lending to firms and households .
But that is not the end of the story , because the reduced lending will lead to reduced consumption and investment .
With a lag , reduced sales of goods and services will reduce stock market valuations .
And , with another lag , the lower stock market prices will – in the absence of any favourable fortuitous events – intensify the banks ’ liquidity crisis .
The second danger lies in the dynamics of U.S. house prices .
As more and more U.S. households find themselves unable to repay their mortgages , foreclosures are on the rise , more houses are put on the market , the price of houses falls further – with further lags – this leads to more foreclosures and declines in housing wealth .
This dynamic process plays itself out only gradually , as households face progressively more stringent credit conditions and house sales gradually lead to lower house prices .
The third danger results from the interaction between wealth , spending and employment .
As U.S. households ’ wealth – in the housing market and the stock market – falls , their consumption is beginning to fall and will continue to do so , again with a lag .
This decline in consumption is leading to a decline in profits , of which more is on the way , which in turn will lead to a decline in investment .
The combined decline in consumption and investment spending will eventually lead to a decline in employment , as firms begin to recognise that their labour is insufficiently utilised .
The decline in employment , in turn , means a drop in labour income , which , with a lag , leads to a further drop in consumption .
And that leaves the fourth ( and possibly the nastiest ) of the dangers , one that concerns the latitude for monetary policy intervention .
As the Fed reduces interest rates to combat the crisis , the dollar is falling .
This is leading to higher import prices and oil prices in the United States , putting upward pressure on inflation .
The greater this inflationary pressure – which is currently in excess of 4 percent – the more difficult it will be for the Fed to reduce interest rates in the future , without running a serious risk of inflaming inflationary expectations and starting a wage - price spiral .
U.S. firms and households will gradually recognise this dilemma and the bleak prospect of little future interest rate relief will further dampen consumption and investment spending .
Eventually , of course , the decline in spending will lead to a decline in inflation , but this will only happen with a lag .
The longer the lag turns out to be , the longer the period over which the U.S. economy will endure stagflation , that is , a cruel combination of rising prices and falling aggregate demand .
Much hinges on how persistent U.S. inflation is .
More persistent inflation will inevitably give rise to higher inflationary expectations , leading gradually to higher inflation , and so on .
It took central banks over a decade , in the 1980s and early 1990s , to get inflationary expectations under control , and the fruits of this battle are now in danger of being lost .
Global implications
The international financial crisis and the decline in the U.S. economy will inevitably have an adverse effect on the growth of the world economy .
Europe and the emerging markets of Latin America and the Far East cannot fill the gap that the U.S. economy leaves .
There exists no economic mechanism whereby a drop in the U.S. aggregate demand will be matched by a correspondingly large increase in aggregate demand elsewhere .
Germany and other European economies highly exposed to the vagaries of international trade will certainly feel the pinch .
In the longer run , the prospects for the world economy look much brighter .
Eventually U.S. house prices will stabilise , rising exports will help the U.S. economy recover , the fall in world demand for goods and services will reduce the price of raw materials , U.S. households will learn the importance of saving , and global imbalances will correct themselves .
These rosy prospects lie in the mists of the future .
Meanwhile , however , we are well advised to stay focused on the four dangers .

Cheney , Others OK’d “ Harsh Interrogations ”
The Huffington Post
LARA JAKES JORDAN AND PAMELA HESS
Meetings In White House Situation Room With Attorney General John Ashcroft , Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet And Condoleezza Rice
WASHINGTON — Bush administration officials from Vice President Dick Cheney on down signed off on using harsh interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists after asking the Justice Department to endorse their legality , The Associated Press has learned .
The officials also took care to insulate President Bush from a series of meetings where CIA interrogation methods , including waterboarding , which simulates drowning , were discussed and ultimately approved .
A former senior U.S. intelligence official familiar with the meetings described them Thursday to the AP to confirm details first reported by ABC News on Wednesday .
The intelligence official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue .
Between 2002 and 2003 , the Justice Department issued several memos from its Office of Legal Counsel that justified using the interrogation tactics , including ones that critics call torture .
“ If you looked at the timing of the meetings and the memos you ’d see a correlation , ” the former intelligence official said .
Those who attended the dozens of meetings agreed that “ there ’d need to be a legal opinion on the legality of these tactics ” before using them on al - Qaida detainees , the former official said .
The meetings were held in the White House Situation Room in the years immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks .
Attending the sessions were Cheney , then - Bush aides Attorney General John Ashcroft , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice .
The White House , Justice and State departments and the CIA refused comment Thursday , as did a spokesman for Tenet .
A message for Ashcroft was not immediately returned .
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D - Mass. , lambasted what he described as “ yet another astonishing disclosure about the Bush administration and its use of torture . ”
“ Who would have thought that in the United States of America in the 21st century , the top officials of the executive branch would routinely gather in the White House to approve torture ? ”
Kennedy said in a statement .
“ Long after President Bush has left office , our country will continue to pay the price for his administration ’s renegade repudiation of the rule of law and fundamental human rights . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to investigate .
“ With each new revelation , it is beginning to look like the torture operation was managed and directed out of the White House , ” ACLU legislative director Caroline Fredrickson said .
“ This is what we suspected all along . ”
The former intelligence official described Cheney and the top national security officials as deeply immersed in developing the CIA ’s interrogation program during months of discussions over which methods should be used and when .
At times , CIA officers would demonstrate some of the tactics , or at least detail how they worked , to make sure the small group of “ principals ” fully understood what the al - Qaida detainees would undergo .
The principals eventually authorized physical abuse such as slaps and pushes , sleep deprivation , or waterboarding .
This technique involves strapping a person down and pouring water over his cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
The small group then asked the Justice Department to examine whether using the interrogation methods would break domestic or international laws .
“ No one at the agency wanted to operate under a notion of winks and nods and assumptions that everyone understood what was being talked about , ” said a second former senior intelligence official .
“ People wanted to be assured that everything that was conducted was understood and approved by the folks in the chain of command . ”
The Office of Legal Counsel issued at least two opinions on interrogation methods .
In one , dated Aug. 1 , 2002 , then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee defined torture as covering “ only extreme acts ” causing pain similar in intensity to that caused by death or organ failure .
A second , dated March 14 , 2003 , justified using harsh tactics on detainees held overseas so long as military interrogators did not specifically intend to torture their captives .
Both legal opinions since have been withdrawn .
The second former senior intelligence official said rescinding the memos caused the CIA to seek even more detailed approvals for the interrogations .
The department issued another still - secret memo in October 2001 that , in part , sought to outline novel ways the military could be used domestically to defend the country in the face of an impending attack .
The Justice Department so far has refused to release it , citing attorney - client privilege , and Attorney General Michael Mukasey declined to describe it Thursday at a Senate panel where Democrats characterized it as a “ torture memo . ”
Not all of the principals who attended were fully comfortable with the White House meetings .
The ABC News report portrayed Ashcroft as troubled by the discussions , despite agreeing that the interrogations methods were legal .
“ Why are we talking about this in the White House ? ” the network quoted Ashcroft as saying during one meeting .
“ History will not judge this kindly . ”

The United States is continuing its game of brinksmanship against China in what is now perceived to be a brewing conflict that could go beyond economic and into the domain
BEIJING 
The Chinese government is restricting foreign journalists from entering Tibet and neighboring areas , and blocking some news , video and Internet reports about the protests there from appearing inside China , according to journalists working here .
For the past few days , CNN , the BBC , Google News , Yahoo and YouTube have been blocked or have faced temporary blackouts or service disruptions in some parts of China .
Some foreign journalists also say their e-mail service has been disrupted .
Such measures are not unusual here .
China strictly censors news that appears in the Chinese media and occasionally disrupts the activities of international news organizations and foreign Web sites operating in China , particularly if the content they are distributing is deemed politically offensive to the government .
The Foreign Correspondents Club of China issued a statement on Monday calling for China to immediately allow foreign journalists access to Tibet , which is in far western China .
The organization , made up of foreign journalists based here , said Beijing had failed to honor its promise that before and during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , it would allow foreign reporters greater freedoms to report in China .

The United States used waterboarding in terrorism interrogations but no longer does , a former U.S. spy chief said in the Bush administration ’s clearest confirmation of the technique ’s use .
U.S. officials have been reluctant to acknowledge the CIA ’s use of the simulated drowning technique , which human rights groups call an illegal form of torture .
The remarks by former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte in an interview with National Journal magazine come as senators are expected Wednesday to grill Attorney General Michael Mukasey on a promised review of the legality of interrogation methods .
Asked by the magazine if debate over U.S. counterterrorism techniques was hampering its effort in a “ war of ideas , ” Negroponte said , “ We ’ve taken steps to address the issue of interrogations , for instance , and waterboarding has not been used in years . ”

Tett has an intriguing little piece in today ’s Financial Times , in which she reports on the first public valuation of particular structured credit instruments .
The odd bit ( and theories by those that may have insight are welcome ) is that JP Morgan apparently elected to make these prices public .
JPM needed to value the securities for a court filing ; perhaps it decided it had nothing to lose by sharing its pricing and thought it might encourage other banks to similarly disclose value estimates in legal cases in the hopes of encouraging more transparency .
But as the article makes clear , the markdowns from face value , even of the top rated instruments , were considerable .
From the Financial Times :
Maria Iglesias of San Antonio , Honduras , used to leave her home at 6 a.m. on summer days , trek to the nearest water basin , and do essential chores there until finally arriving back home around 4 p.m .
But now , she spends her days at home immersed in labors of love , thanks to a life - changing development .
At least a few days per week , she has running water .
" I have time now to help my children with their school work , " Mrs. Iglesias said in a letter last year to WaterPartners International , an American nonprofit group that helped bring water to her village .
" I can do dishes and laundry right here at my home .
I do n't have to walk to the ' pozo ' [ old water source ] .
This is a dream come true for me . "
Across the developing world , some 700 million people have gained a household connection to drinking water since 1990 - and helped the world reach a crucial tipping point .
Now for the first time , more than half the globe 's people have drinking water piped into their homes , according to an August report from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and UNICEF .
Such progress , along with the spread of sanitation systems , has reduced hygiene - related illnesses , pushed more students into schoolrooms , and begun to break the cycle of urban poverty by making water much less expensive .
Yet for millions of women like Iglesias , the most immediate and surprising benefit of the new water systems is the gift of time .
" When we ask women how water projects have changed their lives , their first answer is always , ' We have more time with our kids , ' " says Marla Smith - Nilson , cofounder of WaterPartners International , which has projects in Central America , Africa , and Asia .
" We 're focused on sanitation and health , but we 're always hearing stories of how lifestyle has improved . "
In rural regions of developing nations , the task of collecting water falls almost entirely to women .
In Honduran mountains and the African countryside alike , women normally get the job of hiking to the nearest water source , washing whatever needs washing there , and returning , often under the weight of wet laundry , clean dishes , and full canisters .
In Tanzania , to walk four to six miles each way is not uncommon , while in Ethiopia a 10 - mile trek can easily consume six hours per day .
Yet where even the most rudimentary of water projects have come on line , rural women are finding themselves blessed with time they need to become not only better mothers and homemakers but also economic contributors .
For instance , Tanzanians are building new schools in just five months in watered districts , where women have time to swing hammers .
Equivalent projects drag on for eight months or more in areas where women spend their days fetching water , according to the Tanzanian Embassy in the United States .
What 's more , children who do n't need to haul water are more apt to go to school and break a cycle of poverty , says Ms. Smith - Nilson .
Experts say improved sanitation can have a similar effect .
" If girls do n't have access to a private toilet , they 're not going to go to school , " says Tessa Wardlaw , data analyst for the WHO / UNICEF report .
" The fact that half the world has no access to improved sanitation [ beyond some sort of waste pit ] is inexcusable . "
Among the forces driving progress has been an approximate $ 3 billion in annual investment from among the 189 nations whose heads of state in 2000 signed onto a common goal : to cut in half by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide who lack sustainable drinking water and basic sanitation .
Progress is measured against benchmark data from 1990 .
Tracks diverge
The effort so far has produced mixed results .
The world is on track for its drinking water target , with South Asia leading the way in terms of rapid progress , according to the WHO / UNICEF report .
But sanitation tells a different story , as Asia , sub -Saharan Africa , and Oceania are falling behind the timetable .
Tight funds pose one obstacle .
Engineering conditions also vary , which means mountain folk who can take advantage of gravity 's pull might get water more easily than those in a flat desert .
Politics plays a role as well , especially in the developing world 's sprawling megacities , where the water sweepstakes can mean big savings for shack dwellers at the expense of hefty profits for their landlords .
For instance , in the capitals of Indonesia , Haiti , and Bangladesh , recent arrivals from the countryside now take shelter beneath tin slabs and boards and commonly depend on a landlord 's illegal water - line tap , according to WaterPartners ' Smith - Nilson .
This means that they must pay inflated rates , anywhere from 10 to 100 percent higher than those paid by legitimate water - district customers .
As a result , the poorest of the poor are spending between 25 and 75 percent of their incomes on water , which may not even be safe to drink .
" You 're never going to get ahead in life if you 're spending all this money for water , " Smith - Nilson says .
" You 'll never get out of the slum . "
Better health
Nevertheless , in locales where running water has arrived , health is measurably improving , according to studies conducted by the Center for Global Safe Water at Emory University .
Rural Honduran communities with water projects demonstrated fewer incidents of diarrhea and less growth stunting than in unimproved areas , according to the center 's 2003 studies .
In such areas , where intestinal diseases kill more infants than does any other cause , family life is apparently being transformed .
" We 're talking about women who have six children and three die before the age of 5 versus situations when the children do n't die , " says Christine Moe , codirector of the center .
Rough waters ahead
Looking ahead , water - development experts see a challenging landscape .
Dr. Moe says poor sanitation poses a lingering threat to clean - water sources .
Projects lag behind in part because few politicians want their " pictures taken next to a latrine or sewage - treatment plant . "
Among other roadblocks cited by Kevin Lowther , Africare 's regional director for Southern Africa : weak economies , war - ravaged infrastructure , and an AIDS crisis that 's leaving scant extra money for other African priorities .
Still , water and sanitation projects are most achievable when indigenous beneficiaries step up to borrow what they need and pay it back , Smith - Nilson says .
Ownership leads to long - term responsibility for upkeep , she says , as well as pride in accomplishing an important task .
" This sort of improvement shows these kind of goals are achievable , " Ms. Wardlaw says .
" But we still have a long way to go . "
More Americans have fallen behind on consumer loans than at any time in nearly 16 years , as credit problems once concentrated in mortgages have spread into other forms of debt , according to the American Bankers Association .
In a quarterly study , the association said the percentage of loans at least 30 days past due rose to 2.65 percent in the fourth quarter , from 2.44 percent in the third quarter and 2.23 percent a year earlier .
The rate of delinquencies was the highest since a 2.75 percent rate in the first quarter of 1992 .
“ There ’s no question that the economy is weakening beyond housing , resulting in the loss of household purchasing power , ” said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody ’s Investors Service .
“ Deterioration of household credit should continue through 2008 , though the rate may moderate , ” he said .
“ If it intensifies , then the current recession may prove more severe than anticipated . ”

European regulators approved Google Inc.'s $ 3.1 billion acquisition of online advertising giant DoubleClick on Tuesday , removing the last major obstacle for a deal that critics said would hobble competition and violate consumer privacy .
The decision by the European Commission allowed Google to immediately close the merger , which was announced nearly a year ago .
By combining forces with DoubleClick , Google is significantly bolstering its formidable online advertising business .
Already a juggernaut in search engine advertising , Google 's acquisition also makes it the leader in placing banner ads on third - party Web sites .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" We are thrilled that our acquisition of DoubleClick has closed , " Eric Schmidt , Google 's chief executive , said in a statement .
In a subsequent blog posting , Schmidt raised the possibility of job cuts in the United States and elsewhere as part of the integration of the two companies and said a decision will be made in early April .
DoubleClick , whose operations are based in New York , has about 1,500 employees .
Consumer advocacy groups , along with rival Microsoft Corp. , launched an intense lobbying campaign to try to torpedo the acquisition out of fear that it would create an Internet colossus that could muscle out competition .
Some argued that the marriage would also allow Google , based in Mountain View , to collect too much information about the online habits of Internet users .
European regulators rejected those arguments , saying " the transaction would be unlikely to have harmful effects on consumers " or competitors .
Commissioners noted that advertisers have several alternatives to Google , including Microsoft , Yahoo and Time Warner Inc. 's AOL division .
Regulators looked primarily at the business impact of the Google - DoubleClick merger but added that the combined company must follow laws on privacy protection and the collection of personal data .
The decision by the European officials echoes the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , which conducted its own review .
The commissioners voted 4 - 1 in December to approve the merger after determining that it did not raise antitrust concerns and that competition in the Google - DoubleClick market is " vigorous and likely to increase . "
Jeff Chester , executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy , a consumer group that opposed the merger , was disappointed the acquisition was approved .
In addition to antitrust concerns , he had raised fears about Google compiling increasingly detailed dossiers about its users '
Internet habits and said the DoubleClick merger would give it access to even more information .
" Antitrust regulators have shot consumers and competitors in the digital foot here by allowing Google to become an even more powerful No. 1 , " Chester said .
" It 's very likely that in two or three years well look back at this decision and throw up our hands and say ' What have we done here ? ' "
Google 's merger proposal last year sparked a wave of consolidation in the Internet advertising industry .
Microsoft bought aQuantive ; Yahoo acquired BlueLithium and the part of Right Media that it did n't already own ; and AOL acquired several smaller Internet advertising players .
Still hoping to play catch up , Microsoft has proposed an unsolicited $ 44.6 billion acquisition of Sunnyvale 's Yahoo .
Although its bid was rejected , Microsoft is still trying to consummate a deal .
Liz Ross , president of Tribal DDB West , an online advertising firm , said the Google - DoubleClick merger will benefit advertisers by allowing them to better target their advertising to users .
She was unconcerned about Google becoming too powerful in online advertising in the wake of the DoubleClick acquisition , although she said that its only major competitor now is Microsoft .
" From our perspective , it 's good , " Ross said .
" The bond of trust between marketers and consumers to deliver the right message at the right time has been broken for some time . "
According to the Secretary of State ’s office , since January about 217,000 new voters have registered for the April 22 primary , the vast majority of whom signed up as Democrats .
Dem voter surge could cut Clinton margin
An historic spike in Democratic voter registrations in Pennsylvania could help Barack Obama cut into Hillary Clinton ’s vote in Tuesday ’s primary , robbing her of the big victory margin she needs to justify continuing the primary fight .

The changing party demographics also are contributing to an overall bluing of the Keystone State that could dim Republican John McCain ’s hopes of competing there in the fall .
A county - by - county analysis by Politico suggests that the hard - fought primary between Obama and Clinton has accelerated an ongoing partisan shift in Pennsylvania that could soon move it out of the battleground presidential states and ripple across congressional races this fall , as well .
“ We may have one or two more competitive presidential races , but I ’m not sure what will come after that , ” said Terry Madonna , a political scientist and director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll .
The first evidence of the changing Democratic demographics could be on display Tuesday .
According to the Secretary of State ’s office , since January about 217,000 new voters have registered for the April 22 primary , the vast majority of whom signed up as Democrats .
In Philadelphia , by far the state ’s largest city , more than 12,000 new Democrats were added to the rolls in the final week before the March registration deadline , compared to just 509 Republicans .
That statewide Democratic surge has been accompanied by a flood of party - switching .
More than 178,000 voters have changed their party status since January — and the Democrats have captured 92 percent of those voters .
In Delaware County , a Philadelphia suburb once home to a storied Republican machine , nearly 14,000 voters have switched their party affiliation to Democratic since January compared to just 768 who became Republicans .
Those party - switchers now represent about 7 percent of the roughly 2 million Democratic voters expected to turnout Tuesday , said Madonna .
A poll of those switchers and new registrants released by Madonna last week found that Obama was the preferred candidate for 62 percent of them .
Clinton insiders said they are also bracing for the same 60 - 40 split among newly registered Democrats .
Depending on turnout , Madonna said , those newcomers could help Obama cut a Clinton victory margin by 2 to 3 percentage points and keep her below a double - digit win that would breath new life into the hard - fought race .
“ It ’s another important factor working in his favor , ” Madonna said .
Clinton is still favored to win the state .
But Politico ’s analysis illustrates how the geographic concentrations of new Democrats could make a difference , if turnout is high among them .
For instance , about 143,400 Democratic newcomers – including newly registered and party switchers — are in Philadelphia and its suburbs .
Those numbers could help Obama rack up big margins in what is considered his strongest turf .
About 28,400 of them are in or around Pittsburgh , an urban area Clinton needs to counter Obama ’s Philly support .
Another 30,000 of them hail from the generally smaller , conservative counties in the state ’s northwest and southwest , a region that Clinton is hoping to draw Reagan Democrats back to the party and to her cause .
Finally , the Clinton - friendly sections of central Pennsylvania are now home to more than 70,000 of the Democrats ’ new recruits , including more than 6,000 in Centre County which is home to Penn State University .
An area where Obama and Clinton are likely to battle for voters is the state ’s northeast corridor .
Those ten counties , ranging from Carbon to Wyoming , have recorded more than 40,000 newly registered Democrats and party switchers .
In Lehigh County , for instance , Clinton is expected to have an edge in working - class Allentown .
But Obama could tap a vein of votes from the host of small universities and liberal arts colleges based in the county .
Pennsylvania voters are allowed to switch their party affiliation back to a previous one after an election , and some of these voters may not stick with the Democratic nominee come November .
But history suggests many of them will .
Gov. Ed Rendell lured about 20,000 moderate Republicans to switch parties in 2002 to help him beat Bob Casey , now a U.S. senator , in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary .
Many of those voters have continued to support him , providing two easy general election wins .
The trend toward Democrats also had a big impact in 2006 when two of three Republican House incumbents from districts outside of Philadelphia were ousted .
This cycle , the last Republican standing outside Philly could be at greater risk .
Chester County , the home turf of Republican Rep. Jim Gerlach , now has more than 17,900 new Democratic voters on its rolls .
Republicans still hold an edge in Chester County , but there are 10,000 fewer of them compared to 2004 .
Among the six counties that have flipped from Republican to Democratic majorities since 2004 are Bucks and Montgomery , two historic Republican suburban stalwarts that were once part of the foundation for statewide Republican victories .
In 2004 , Bucks included 208,638 Republicans voters and 173,803 Democrats .
Today , it has 181,696 registered Republicans – a drop of nearly 27,000 – and 185,381 Democrats – a gain of more than 11,500 .
Meanwhile , eight Democratic counties are turning darker blue .
Four years ago , there were 74,004 Democrats and 59,688 Republicans registered to vote in Easton ’s Northampton County .
Today , there are 96,978 registered Democrats compared to 68,759 Republicans .
The Politico analysis also found that about a half dozen Pennsylvania counties are now much more competitive .
In Delaware County , Republicans had a clear voter registration advantage four years ago , 213,030 to 131,317 respectively .
Today , the margin is much tighter with 188,834 Republicans compared to 156,608 Democrats .
The upshot is that Democrats have managed to double their partisan advantage in the Keystone State to 1 million registered voters today compared to a 500,000 edge in 2004 .
Secretary of State Pedro A. Cortes is trying to prepare both the county registrars and the voters for huge turnout – as much as 50 percent -- in the primary .
In 2004 , just 21 percent of the state ’s Democrats showed up to vote in the primary .
“ We have communicated to the counties what they know : this is a historic election , they are likely to see a larger percentage of voter participation , ” said Cortes in an interview .
“ We have advised that they ensure they provide adequate staffing and adequate ballots .
I ’m fairly sure they have heeded that advice , ” he said .
“ People will face larger lines than they usually would for a primary .
We ’re asking our voters to prepare for that . ”
People who bought music from the MSN music store have been royally hosed by Microsoft : as of today , if you buy a new computer , or refresh your hard - drive , you have to kiss all your music goodbye .
Microsoft has shut down its DRM " license server " and left people who bought music — instead of downloading it from a P2P site — out in the cold .
All those years the music industry spent insisting that the only way they 'd sell music is with crippling DRM attached managed to totally discredit the idea of buying music at all :
MSN Entertainment and Video Services general manager Rob Bennett sent out an e-mail this afternoon to customers , advising them to make any and all authorizations or deauthorizations before August 31 .
" As of August 31 , 2008 , we will no longer be able to support the retrieval of license keys for the songs you purchased from MSN Music or the authorization of additional computers , " reads the e-mail seen by Ars .
" You will need to obtain a license key for each of your songs downloaded from MSN Music on any new computer , and you must do so before August 31 , 2008 .
If you attempt to transfer your songs to additional computers after August 31 , 2008 , those songs will not successfully play . "
This does n't just apply to the five different computers that PlaysForSure allows users to authorize , it also applies to operating systems on the same machine ( users need to reauthorize a machine after they upgrade from Windows XP to Windows Vista , for example ) .
Once September rolls around , users are committed to whatever five machines they may have authorized –along with whatever OS they are running .

One of the central philosophies of climate change alarmism and an image that adorned the cover of Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth – the contention that global warming causes deadly hurricanes – has been completely discredited by the expert who first proposed it .
Hurricane buff and professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT Kerry Emanuel asserted for over 20 years that global warming breeds more frequent and stronger storms and he shot to prominence just one month before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when he delivered the " final proof " that global warming was already causing extreme weather events and wrecking livelihoods .
Emanuel was subsequently acknowledged with a place in Time Magazine ’s " 100 People Who Shape Our World " list .
Al Gore was so inspired by Emanuel ’s research that he devoted the iconic front cover image of his 2006 movie An Inconvenient Truth to his warning , portraying a hurricane emerging from a Co2 - belching smokestack .
An inconvenient cover image – Al Gore ’s depiction of global warming ’s contribution to hurricanes has been completely discredited .
Unfortunately for the church of environmentalism , who ceaselessly profess to have a monopoly on truth and insist that " the debate is over " on global warming , Emanuel has completely recanted his position and now admits that hurricanes and storms will actually decline over the next 200 years and have little or no correlation with global temperature change whatsoever .
" Emanuel ’s newest work , co-authored with two other researchers , simulates hurricane conditions nearly 200 years in the future .
The research — the first to mesh global climate models with small - scale high - resolution simulations of individual storms — found that while storm strength rises slightly in some areas , it falls in others — and the total number of worldwide storms actually declines slightly , " reports Daily Tech .
" The new work suggests that , even in a dramatically warming world , hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries , " reports The Houston Chronicle .
" The research , appearing in the March issue of Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , is all the more remarkable coming from Emanuel , a highly visible leader in his field and long an ardent proponent of a link between global warming and much stronger hurricanes . "
" The models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us , " said Emanuel , adding , " The results surprised me . "
This bears testimony to the fact that we cannot accept the shrill claims of the alarmists that " the debate is over " on global warming , because to do so would hand control of our future over to bumbling , self - serving control freaks who have been proven wrong time after time .
How can we let technocrats impose sweeping control measures based on a " consensus " about the effects of global warming that is n’t necessarily correct ?
Those that propose drastic responses to a " crisis " that is n’t even fully understood should be treated with extreme suspicion .
The admission that global warming has no effect on extreme weather patterns , in addition to last week ’s report confirming there has been no global temperature increase since 1998 , spells disaster for the alarmists and current weather patterns are not doing them any favors either .
Shortly after China experienced its coldest winter in 100 years and northeast America was hit by record snow levels , Britain is currently experiencing its coldest April in decades as late - blooming daffodils are pounded with hail and snow on an almost daily basis .
Since forecasters have problems predicting what the weather will be in a few days time , to claim an understanding of climate patterns hundreds of years into the future is not only asinine , it is the height of arrogance and a danger to humanity .
The proposals for combating so - called global warming are so drastic that they will inflict a worse burden on humanity than any claimed minor temperature increase , wrecking economies , increasing starvation and stripping away basic freedoms in the name of rallying to save mother earth from a problem that does not even exist .
For eons , earth has been battered by violent storms and experienced huge temperature swings as a result of natural climate change before man ever set foot on the planet .
Historically , we are currently living in a frigid " Ice House " compared to the " Hot House " endured by our predecessors the dinosaurs , who roamed the earth when the poles were covered by lush forests .
But all this matters little to the demagogues of a giant sprawling cash cow whose continued funding relies on tying everything that happens to man-made global warming and that " evil " life - giving gas , carbon dioxide .
The real environmental issues – GM frankenstein food , deforestation and toxic waste dumping amongst others , will continue to be neglected as we are led on a merry dance by the climate change cultists – but as the hard evidence increasingly belies the hoax that they have foisted upon us , their credibility and influence will continue to wane .

Feedback on Midterm Paper
US History , 10th Grade
Richard :
I find it very painful to say this , but your midterm project is unsatisfactory in virtually every way an academic paper can be .
I can only hope that this is a one - time occurrence and not a sign of deeper problems that could compromise what promises to be a fine scholarly career .
I must say that it was rather unorthodox to open your paper with what I can only characterize as a personal attack on me and my so - called revisionist history . 
While I grant you it is academically healthy to question the veracity of the information you are given in your textbooks , it is hardly constructive to couple your claims with crude statements about my family life , moral character , and mental capacities .
I did my best to prevent my evaluation of your work from being colored by your opening remarks .
So , then , on to your central thesis .
I certainly cant dispute your assertion that the presence of ninjas at Gettysburg would have altered the outcome of the U.S. Civil War .
However , it is one thing to make this statement and quite another to claim that a clan of ninjas indeed was present and was , in fact , the force that tipped the balance of power in the war to the Union .
Your evidence is ... scanty .
Even if it is true ( and I dont pretend to know either way ) that ninjas ceased their activities in Japan in the early 1860s , this hardly constitutes a smoking gun indicating their recruitment by Abraham Lincoln .
And your contention that Lincolns assassination could only have been carried out by ninjas angry over a payment dispute is baseless speculation .
To be quite honest , I would describe your Booth - as - a - patsy - in - a - ninja - cover - up theory with the exact same words you use to describe me in your opening paragraph .
One other matter your inquiry into whether ninjas make love with their masks on or off was prurient , overly graphic , and , frankly , of no consequence with regard to the presence ( or absence ) of ninjas at Gettysburg .
Those three pages certainly do not count towards the assignments 10 - page minimum .
Richard , in light of your past achievements , I am giving you three days to hand in a more reasonable research project .
I trust you will find a different topic , or , if not , at least use more primary sources .

With scientists now saying there 's a 99 percent chance " the big one " will finally hit California sometime during the next 30 years , seismologists are scrambling to come up with new ways to detect and analyze quakes as soon as they happen .
One team of researchers is now hoping to employ the distributed computing approach to detection and create a giant , low - cost tremor - sensing network that takes advantage of the motion sensors that may already be in your laptop .
The Quake Catcher Network , while not replacing the slew of sophisticated seismometers are already in place in California , will " fill in the gaps , " Paul Davis , a professor of geology at UCLA , told Technology Review .
Indeed , researchers say the they will initially focus on quake - prone areas like the San Francisco Bay and Greater Los Angeles Basin and eventually expand the initiative to other parts of the world .
As seismologist Elizabeth Cochran of the University of California at Riverside told wired.com : " We can measure the seismic waves and then get a warning out to people before the seismic waves get to them .
That to me is physically possible . "
Here 's how it will work :
If you have a Mac laptop with an accelerometer , you 're pretty much good to go ( you can sign up for news when apps for Windows machines and USB externals will be available ; no mention when and if the Wii will be supported ) .
Just download and install the distributed computing software ( BOINC ) , enter up to five of your favorite laptopping locations , and bam , your computer is now a seismometer .
After enough people have signed up for the program , the resulting ad - hoc network will use this software to analyze only the largest shakes sensed by your computer 's accelerometer and report them back to a central server .
Small jolts , like someone bumping into a table or the passing of a garbage truck , will be disregarded by the software .
Ultimately , researchers say the pattern of signals received by the server should allow the network to recognize a significant earthquake very quickly .
Thankfully , the plan is to also add software that also turns PC computers , like the Thinkpad and HP laptops , into portable seismometers as well .
Currently , the initiative is in beta , and touts links to several hundred Mac laptops .
Researchers stress they 're not trying to predict earthquakes here , but rather looking for ways to measure and analyze them as quickly as possible and get that information out before damage is done to large populations .

Obama could build a lead over Clinton if he can win big in small and medium - sized states .
Obama landslides could break deadlock
Barack Obama ’s landslide victories in three mid-sized states Saturday suggest that he has the opportunity to build a significant lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton among the locked - in “ pledged ” delegates before the candidates face off in the big battlegrounds of Ohio and Texas on March 4 .
The results in Washington and Nebraska vindicated Obama ’s strategy of preparing expensive efforts to organize votes after the Feb.
5 contests that many expected — wrongly — effectively to decide the race .
Clinton ’s campaign , meanwhile , played down its own efforts in the states , though she did air television ads in both Washington and Nebraska .

Obama also won in Louisiana , buoyed by taking nearly 90 percent of the support of black voters , according to exit polls .
And he won overwhelmingly in the U.S. Virgin Islands , winning all three of the territory ’s pledged delegates .
In squeezing every delegate out of the small and mid-sized states between now and March 4 , and every dollar out of his supporters , Obama is hoping to build a head of steam this month that will make him unstoppable and will lure free - floating superdelegates to his camp .
Clinton , meanwhile , aims to keep the debate national in scope and sharply competitive in the national media , if not on the ground in the primary states .
Though turnout in the Washington and Nebraska caucuses overwhelmed the state parties , the raw numbers of voters were relatively small : About 40,000 people , in total , participated in the Nebraska caucus .
But in what was a test of enthusiasm and organization , Obama showed an ability not just to win but also to rack up the landslide margins necessary to build a delegate lead .
He seemed set to gain on Clinton by a margin of well over 40 delegates Saturday night , according to preliminary estimates .
( A Democratic candidate needs 2,025 delegates to claim the nomination . )
“ Today , voters from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast to the heart of America stood up to say that it is time to turn the page , ” Obama told the Virginia Democratic Party ’s Jefferson - Jackson Dinner in Richmond , according to his prepared remarks .
He told the gathering that he represents “ real change ” and touted his appeal to independent voters .
Clinton , meanwhile , did n’t congratulate Obama in her speech to the Richmond gathering earlier in the evening .
Instead , she continued to draw sharp contrasts with her rival , and associated him with the likely Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
“ I am the only candidate left in this race , Democrat or Republican , with a health - care plan to cover every single man , woman and child , ” she said .
Her campaign also sought to introduce a measure of good news by releasing word , as polls closed in Louisiana , that she had raised $ 10 million from more than 100,000 donors this month .
Obama ’s campaign shot back that more than 350,000 donors have given him money this year .
Though high turnout and a surge of new voters have been regular features of this primary cycle , they still seemed to strain untested primary and caucus systems in states unused to being the focus of national attention .
In Louisiana , the Obama campaign complained of “ irregularities ” after , it said , Democrats claiming their party registration had been switched were not permitted to cast provisional ballots .
However , it was unclear whether Obama 's supporters had actually registered as Democrats and were turned away improperly , or were in fact independents and unable to vote in the primary .
And in Washington , caucusgoers cited “ pandemonium ” and “ chaos ” in flooded caucus sites , prompting the editor of The Stranger , the alternative weekly newspaper in Seattle , to compare the scene to a horror movie .
“ The gym at Stevens Elementary right now resembles the Brooklyn Bridge scene in Cloverfield — only without the promise of giant , derivative monster showing up to put Capitol Hill caucus - goers out of our misery , ” the editor , Dan Savage , wrote on the newspaper ’s blog [ LINK : http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/02/the_cloverfield_caucus]
Saturday .
“ And instead of bloodied hipsters asking each other ‘ What the hell is that ? ’ over and over again , it ’s roughly 1500 people wearing tasteful scarfs asking each other , ‘ Where the hell is the line for my precinct table ? ’ ”
The two candidates , meanwhile , spent parts of Saturday in Maine , preparing for a hard - fought caucus .
Observers there had one eye to the weather , which threatens snow — offering an edge to the candidate with the most devoted supporters .

Neat , eh ?
No install , just click and go .
To save the bookmarklet , right click the link and “ add to favorites / bookmarks ” .
Now you can open the calculator on any page .
Today we ’ll walk through the anatomy of a bookmarklet , dissect a few , and give you the tools to build your own .
Bookmarklets 101
Regular bookmarks ( aka favorites ) are just locations to visit , like “ http://gmail.com”.
Bookmarklets are javascript code that the browser runs on the current page , and they ’re marked by “ javascript : ” instead of “ http : / / ” .
When clicking a bookmarklet , imagine the page author wrote < script > bookmarklet code here </ script > — it can do almost anything .
There are a few restrictions :
Restricted length : Most URLs have a limit around 2000 characters , which limits the amount of code you can run .
There ’s a way around this .
No spaces allowed : Some browsers choke on spaces in a URL , so yourcodelookslikethis .
We have a trick for this too .
A simple bookmarklet looks like this :
< a href= " javascript:alert ( ' hi' ) ; " > my link </a>
Click this link to see it in action .
This example is n’t too wild , but the key is that bookmarklets let you run code on an existing page .
What do you want to do ?
Your bookmarklet should do something useful .
Ideas include :
Transform the current page .
Do find / replace , highlight certain words or images , change CSS styles …

Look at the bookmarklet directories for more inspiration .
People spend most of their time on other sites .
Web application authors , think creatively : how can people use your service when away from your site ?
Javascript for Bookmarklets
A bookmarklet can use any javascript command , but certain ones are helpful :
Get current page title : document .
title
Get the current URL : location .
href
Get the currently selected text :
// get the currently selected text var t ; try { t= ( ( window.getSelection && window.getSelection ( ) ) || ( document.getSelection && document.getSelection ( ) ) || ( document.selection && document.selection.createRange && document.selection.createRange ( ) . text ) ) ; } catch(e ) { // access denied on https sites t = " " ; }
Make text url - safe : encodeURIComponent ( text ) ( and corresponding decodeURIComponent ( ) ) .
The page title or URL may have invalid characters ( spaces , slashes , etc. ) so it ’s a good habit to encode them before sending them over ( spaces become % 20 , etc . ) .
Dissecting the Delicious Bookmarklet
Here ’s the code for the delicious bookmarklet ( spaces added for readability ) :
javascript:location.href='http://del.icio.us/post?v=4; url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href ) +' ; title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title )
And here ’s what ’s happening :
Change to a new URL ( to post the item )
Specify query parameters for the current document ’s url ( location.href ) and title ( document.title )
Make the paramaters url - safe with encodeURIComponent
Once you tag and save the post , delicious sends you to the original page .
How do they know where ?
Because it was sent along in the original request !
Bookmarklet Interface Ideas
Imagine this :
Your users are browsing for cat photos ( or the journals of the American Chemical Society , but probably lolcats ) when they click your killer Web 2.0 bookmarklet .
What happens ?
Common techniques are :
Take the user to a new page .
Hopefully , you can use some data from the current page , otherwise it ’s a regular bookmark .
Hopefully , you can use some data from the current page , otherwise it ’s a regular bookmark .
Frame the current page , like Google translate or Stumbleupon .
This is similar to the first technique , but your site displays the old page inside the window .
, like Google translate or Stumbleupon .
This is similar to the first technique , but your site displays the old page inside the window .
Overlay a new interface .
Use CSS absolute positioning to make a window in a set place , or fixed positioning to have the window follow you as you scroll .
Beware the CSS bugs .
Overlaid windows are great , but wo n’t that be hard to cram into a single line ?
The Big Trick : Dynamic Javascript
Direct javascript works fine if you just want to redirect the user to another page , like the delicious bookmarklet .
The no spaces , 2000 character limit really hurts when you want a more complicated interface .
There ’s a fix :
Our bookmarklet becomes a stub to load another ( regular ) javascript file .
Here ’s the code ( spaces added for readability ) :
javascript :( function ( ) { _my_script=document.createElement(' SCRIPT ') ; _my_script.type='text/javascript ' ; _my_script.src='http://mysite.com/script.js?'; document.getElementsByTagName( ' head ' ) [ 0].appendChild(_my_script ) ; } ) ( ) ;
Here ’s how it works :
Define an anonymous function to download the script
Create a script element , type text / javascript .
We ca n’t use var _my_script because of the spaces , so choose a unique name .
element , type .
We ca n’t use because of the spaces , so choose a unique name .
Set the src of the script to our real javascript file .
This file could pull down more javascript also .
Add the script element to the current page
And that ’s it !
Our bookmarklet can now load any javascript we please , without the annoying restrictions .
An added bonus : see how many people are using your tool , and you we can change our script ( fix bugs or add features ) on the server .
Dissecting the Instacalc Bookmarklet
Here ’s the steps I went through to make the instacalc bookmarklet
Create a bookmarklet interface
I made a trimmed - down page designed for the bookmarklet .
If you click the page it appears fullscreen , but it resizes to the parent container .
I planned on hosting this page inside a smaller iframe .
Create a stub bookmarklet
Because I wanted to get the currently selected text and overlay an interface , I knew I could n’t fit my javascript into 2000 characters .
So I used the dynamic javascript technique above to get the real javascript file .
Careful caching
I did n’t want to cache the bookmarklet javascript in case I wanted to change its behavior ( but I did cache the other files ) .
I added a dummy query parameter using Math.random ( ) , which forces the browser to download the file each time .
Since the script is small , this was n’t too much of an issue .
instacalc_script.src='http://static.instacalc.com/gadget/instacalc.bookmarklet.js?x='+(Math.random());
Build the interface
The script to build the interface is pretty straightforward .
There ’s some helper functions for encoding ( instacalc stores data using base64 ) .
The script gets the selected text , constructs the URL for the iframe , and loads it up .
It generates the CSS to have a fixed window on the top right of the screen , and a button to hide the window .
As a slight trick , if the bookmarklet is run again on the same page , it just shows the existing window instead of creating a new iframe .
Tips & Tricks
Keep this in mind when making your bookmarklet :
Make it friendly .
Do n’t interrupt the user ’s flow .
Bring up the window on the same page , or a new page that closes .
If you must redirect the user to their original page .
This is important : the user was nice enough to use your service , so put ‘em back where they were !
Make it fast .
After you ’ve got it working , tweak your bookmarklet ’s speed using the following techniques
Give people instructions .
Bookmarklets are n’t that common , so help people understand your tool .
A few instructions ( “ right click this link and add to bookmarks / favorites ” ) and a screenshot go a long way .
The gotcha : cross-domain communication
Because of cross - domain security restrictions , your bookmarklets can’t use fancy - pants Ajax techniques to communicate with your site .
The easiest way to communicate is through query parameters in a URL .
Debugging
What ’s programming without bugs ?
Use firefox to debug your javascript and CSS .
Instead of clicking a bookmarklet each time , just make a page that runs the javascript file directly : < script src= " ... " > .
This is what the bookmarklet does .
Once the dummy page is working , try your bookmarklet on other sites .
You ’d be surprised how other CSS rules can mess up your carefully positioned elements ( remember , you ’re running in the context of another site ) .
Links & Resources
I ’m sure you ’ll come up with crazy ways to use your newfound toy .
The main benefits are simple installation , compatibility , and being able to interact with the current page .
There are crunching tools to make your javascript bookmarklet - friendly .
But it ’s nice to just dynamically load the real script and be done with it .
People have put the delicious bookmarklet on steroids , such as letting you type the tags in the url before hitting the button .
Taking this to the extreme , Greasemonkey is a firefox plugin letting you run really powerful scripts .
For example , there was a script to add a “ delete ” button to Gmail before it was available .
Have fun .

Lincoln and His Legacy
February 19 , 2008
At this point it is probably futile to try to reverse the deification of Abraham Lincoln .
Next year , if I know my countrymen , the bicentennial of his birth will be marked by stupendously cloying anniversary observances , all of them affirming , if not his literal divinity , at least something mighty close to it .
No doubt we will hear from the high priests and priestesses of the Lincoln cult : Doris Kearns Goodwin , Garry Wills , Harry V. Jaffa , and all the rest of the tireless hagiographers of academia , who regularly rate Honest Abe one of our two greatest presidents , right up there with Stalins buddy Franklin D. Roosevelt , father of the nuclear age and defiler of the U.S. Constitution .
Such , we are told , is the Verdict of History .
But if Lincoln was so great , we must ask why nobody seems to have realized it while he was still alive .
The abolitionists considered him unprincipled , Southerners hated him , and most Northerners opposed his war on the South .
Only when the war ended and he was shot did people begin to transform him into a hero and martyr of the Union cause .
But that cause was badly flawed .
The Declaration of Independence , which Lincoln always quoted selectively , says that the American colonies of Great Britain had become free and independent states   separate states , mind you , not the monolithic new nation  he proclaimed at Gettysburg .
The U.S. Constitution refers constantly to the states , but never to a nation ; and this is a fact we should ponder .
Alas , it appears that Lincoln seldom thought about it .
For him the Union was somehow prior to its members , except in his younger days , when , oddly enough , he had been a passionate advocate of the most sacred right of secession  in other countries .
When and why he changed his mind , or the reason he never applied this principle to his native country , we do not know ; but Gore Vidal , among other keen observers , has called attention to this most striking inconsistency of his career .
What he called saving the Union simply meant the denial of this most sacred right , and he was willing to pay any price in blood to achieve it .
No wonder his favorite play was Macbeth .
He may have seen himself in the tyrant who had waded too far into a river of gore to turn back .
Far more Americans died in his war than in any other in our history .
A few books have told the dark story of Lincolns suppression of liberty in the North , including the thousands of arbitrary arrests and hundreds of closings of newspapers ; his war on the South required a war on the Bill of Rights in the North as well .
All in the name of freedom , of course .
Despite his symbolic importance , most Americans know little about Lincoln .
He was very secretive about himself and his family , and he remains something of an enigma to his biographers .
One fact is clear , though : he was poorly educated .
He made up for this with his rare rhetorical and political genius ; his eloquence continues to create the illusion of greatness .
Maybe it would have happened anyway , but since Lincoln the Constitution has meant not what it says , but whatever the U.S. Government decides it shall mean .
The very meaning of constitutionality has become entirely fluid , so that the law itself has become exactly what law should never be : unpredictable .
Think of the U.S. Supreme Courts notorious 1973 abortion ruling .
Nobody before then had ever suggested that abortion was a constitutional right , but the Court suddenly discovered that it was , protected somehow by the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments .
The laws of all 50 states were struck down at a blow , but thanks to Lincoln the remedy of secession was no longer available to them .
Todays United States of America would be constitutionally unrecognizable to the authors of the original Constitution , because today the government has become the wolf at the door .
Do I exaggerate ?
A television commercial asks ,  Is the IRS ruining your life ? 
Imagine what Washington and Jefferson would have said about that question !
They never dreamed that their countrymen would live in dread of the government created to secure their liberty .
But that is what has happened to this country , and much of this is Abraham Lincolns legacy .

The US and Israel accused Syria on Thursday of building a secret nuclear reactor with North Korean help .
There was a lot of innuendo in the press that the reactor was intended for nuclear weapons production .
But AFP notes :
‘ They said US intelligence had “ high confidence ” that the structure bombed by the Israelis was a nuclear reactor , “ medium confidence ” that the North Koreans were involved in building it , and “ low confidence ” that plutonium from it was for nuclear weapons .
Because other elements of a weapons program , such as a plutonium reprocessing plant , had not been detected , US intelligence was less certain that the plutonium was for nuclear weapons , they said . ’
We would have to know exactly what kind of reactor it was to know if it was suitable to help in a weapons program .
As the Bush administration admits , there is n’t any evidence of that .
Moreover , I ’m not really very impressed that they only have medium confidence that North Korea was involved .
Even the high confidence that the building was a reactor cannot be just accepted without question .
They had high confidence that Saddam had a nuclear weapons program in the early zeros , which was not true .
We should be skeptical about these sorts of stories until we see the proof .
I have been disappointed that more nuclear engineers in the US do not express themselves publicly on what is likely and unlikely .
This story seems to me fishy .
Syria is a poor state .
Where would it have gotten the money for a reactor ?
Why exactly are there doubts that North Korea was involved ?
How much of the intelligence is from US sources and how much from Israeli ?
The latter are highly politicized .
The head of Mossad in 2002 expressed confidence that Saddam was close to getting nukes .
Moreover , while I am against proliferation of nuclear weapons , the idea that the Israelis can just bomb anyone ’s innocent research or civilian power reactor any time they like for no good reason is scary .
The Israelis rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and broke with international consensus to acquire by hook and crook British , French and US nuclear secrets and built dozens , perhaps hundreds of nuclear bombs , provoking the nuclear weapons race in the region .
The real question is the timing of the announcement , since the bombing happened a long time ago .
It is suspicious to me that the announcement was made just after a spy for Israel was arrested in the US who had stolen US nuclear secrets .
Is it diversionary ?
Syria expert Josh Landis discusses a different theory of diversion , having to do with revelations that Syria and Israel are closer to an agreement on the future of the Golan Heights .
I ’d add that former president Jimmy Carter ’s recent trip to meet with Hamas leaders has put pressure on Israel to come back in a serious way to the negotiating table .
Also Hamas ’s own apparent change in stance on diplomacy , as Helena Cobban discusses .
Bush ’s own remarks Thursday that he is seeking a viable Palestine that does not look like Swiss cheese revealed some of what the administration must have been pressing the Israelis on in recent months in preparation for Bush ’s trip in May .
So the timing of the Syria reactor announcement does seem suspicious in Middle East terms .
If the US does n’t in fact think there is any evidence that the reactor had weapons implications , then it is really a non story , and releasing it can only be for hoopla reasons .
Here is Aljazeera ’s report on the issue , which contains yet another diversionary theory , that the revelations are aimed at pressuring North Korea :
The Buddha at Swat was only slightly damaged
The statue , thought to date from the second century BC , sustained only minimal damage in the attack near Manglore in remote Swat district .
The area has seen a rise in attacks on " un-Islamic " targets in recent months .
This is the first such attack in Pakistan and is reminiscent of the Taleban 's 2001 destruction of the giant Buddhas at Bamiyan in Afghanistan .
Dynamite
Officials and witnesses in Swat said armed men arrived in the area on Monday night .
We heard the sound of drilling twice and then early Tuesday morning we heard two blasts
Villager Amir Khan
Afghan Buddha future unclear
" Militants drilled holes in the rock and filled them with dynamite and blew it up , " provincial archaeology department official Aqleem Khan told Reuters news agency .
" The explosion damaged the upper part of the rock but there was no damage to the image itself . "
And eyewitness , Shahid Khan , told the BBC that because of its location on a steep ridge the statue had been only slightly damaged .
It is carved into a 40 m ( 130 - foot ) high rock .
Local archaeology expert Professor Pervaiz Shaheen told the BBC that the Buddha statue in Swat valley was considered the largest in Asia , after the two Bamiyan Buddhas .
He said it was 2,200 years old .
Swat valley is a centre of the ancient Gandhara civilization .
" They constructed similar smaller statues and figurines , dozens of which are still present in the area , " Prof Shaheen said .
Swat has seen increased pro-Taleban activity in recent months , with the re-emergence of militant group Tehrik - e - Nifaz - e - Shariat - e - Mohammadi ( TNSM ) under new leader , Maulana Fazlullah .
Last week , militants blew up about 60 music , video and cosmetics stalls at a market in the valley after stall owners ignored warnings to close businesses deemed un -Islamic .
The world watched in shock in March 2001 as Afghanistan 's then rulers destroyed the 6th - Century Bamiyan Buddhas .
The Taleban said they were offensive to Islam .
America is the richest nation in the world , yet 37 million Americans live below the official poverty line and millions more struggle to get by every month .
The fact that our nation ’s leaders allow huge swaths of the country ’s population to live in poverty is more than just a gross moral failing .
Poverty imposes costs on society in the form of increased crime , broken neighborhoods , and squandered human resources .
Our nation has seen periods in which poverty rates have fallen — when there have been sound policies in place and sufficient political will to combat the problem .
But the last six years have seen rises in poverty and inequality .
That ’s why the Poverty Task Force of the Center for American Progress will release a report tomorrow detailing the problem and outlining a pragmatic plan to cut poverty in half in the next 10 years .
Here ’s a look at poverty in America , by the numbers :
A poverty epidemic
37 million : Number of Americans who live below the official poverty line — 12.6 percent of the total population .
Millions more struggle to get by .
36.5 million : Population of California , America ’s most populous state , according to 2006 U.S. Census Bureau numbers
5 million : Number of Americans who are poor today who were n’t in 2000
8 million : Number of Americans who live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty where at least 40 percent of residents are poor
1 in 8 : Proportion of Americans who now live in poverty
1 in 3 : Proportion of Americans who are considered low - income
25 : Percentage of all workers who were in jobs for which year - round full - time work would not pay enough to keep a family of four above the poverty threshold
Poor children have little chance at the American Dream
1 in 5 : Proportion of children who are poor , or 17.6 percent
42 : Percentage of children born in the bottom income quintile who will remain in that quintile as adults
6 : Percentage of children born in the bottom income quintile who will reach the top quintile as adults
1 : Percentage of children from low - income families who will reach the top five percent of the income distribution
22 : Percentage of children from wealthy families who will reach the top five percent of the income distribution
19 : Percentage of children in poverty who lack health insurance , compared to 11.2 percent of children above poverty
$ 500 billion : Persistent childhood poverty ’s estimated cost to the nation each year because of lost adult productivity and wages , increased crime , and higher health expenditures
4 : Percentage of the nation ’s GDP this represents
1.7 million : Number of poor or near - poor youth ages 16 to 24 who were out of school and out of work in 2005 .
Rich country , poor people
$ 19,971 : A family of four that makes below this income is considered poor – far below what most people believe a family needs to survive
12.6 : Percentage of all Americans who were poor in 2005 using this income standard
90 million : Number of Americans who had incomes below 200 percent of federal poverty thresholds ; an annual income of $ 40,000 for a family of four
30 : Percentage of the total American population this represents , or the combined populations of California , Michigan , New York , and Texas
16 million : Number of Americans living in extreme poverty , meaning their incomes are below half the poverty line : less than $ 9,903 for a family of four or $ 5,080 for an individual
24 out of 25 : America ’s ranking among developed nations when measuring how well the countries do on poverty ( what share of a country ’s population has income below 50 percent of the nation ’s median income ) .
Only Mexico has a higher poverty rate than the United States among rich nations
24 out of 24 : America ’s ranking in a UNICEF report on child well - being in rich nations , when child poverty is measured in relation to 50 percent of median income
Inequality has reached record highs
19 percent : Share of the nation ’s income held by the richest 1 percent of Americans , a historic high
3.4 percent : Share of the nation ’s income held by the poorest 20 percent of Americans
$ 5.15 : The current federal minimum wage , which is at the lowest level in real terms that it ’s been in 50 years
30 : Percentage of the average wage that the minimum wage is now .
The minimum wage used to be 50 percent of the average wage
$ 8.40 : What the federal minimum wage would be if it were restored to 50 percent of the average wage
$ 145,500 : Amount by which the post - tax income of the top 1 percent rose between 2003 and 2004
$ 200 : Amount by which the post - tax income of those in the bottom fifth rose between 2003 and 2004
The epidemic of poverty is spreading in America , and it ’s taking its toll on American families .
Inequality is also on the rise , meaning that the nation is moving further away from one of its founding principles : equality of opportunity .
The Center for American Progress ’ 12 - step plan for cutting poverty in half in the next 10 years will be released tomorrow .
It will take time and political will to fight poverty , but if we ’re going to protect the common good , it ’s a battle we ca n’t afford to lose .
Senator Barack Obama beat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday in Mississippi ’s Democratic primary , the final contest before what promises to be a crucial showdown in Pennsylvania in six weeks .
This would be Mr. Obama ’s second straight victory  he won the Wyoming caucuses over the weekend  enabling him to rebound from a trio of popular vote losses to Mrs. Clinton in Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island .
Mr. Obama ’s lead in Mississippi was built on a wave of support among blacks , who made up half those who turned out to vote Tuesday , according to surveys conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press of voters leaving polling places .
The surveys found that roughly 90 percent of black voters supported Mr. Obama , but only a third of white voters supported him , suggesting a racially polarized electorate in the state .
“ It ’s just another win in our column and we are getting more delegates , ” Mr. Obama said in an interview on CNN from Chicago , where he arrived Tuesday evening after spending the day campaigning in Mississippi and Pennsylvania .
“ I am grateful to the people of Mississippi for the wonderful support .
Wat we ’ve tried to do is steadily make sure that in each state we are making the case about the need for change in this country . ”
White House under siege : Will pointed questions burst Bush bubble ?

Print This Email This White House Press Secretary Dana Perino fled from the briefing room on Wednesday after just eleven minutes , leaving more than one reporter frustrated and unable to ask a question .
Although this was my fourth visit in a row in which Dana or her deputy Tony Fratto have refused to call on me ( I went in Monday , Wednesday , and Friday of last week as well ) , yesterday was the first time that other reporters were left hanging too .
I 'm not sure why this time was different .
Maybe she was rattled by Helen Thomas , who asked , more or less , the question I was n't permitted to ask the previous Wednesday and Friday : Q The President has said publicly several times , in two consecutive news conferences a few months ago , and you have said over and over again , we do not torture .
Now he has admitted that he did sign off on torture , he did know about it .
So how do you reconcile this credibility gap ?
MS .
PERINO : Helen , you 're taking liberties with what the President said .
The United States has not , is not torturing any detainees in the global war on terror .
And General Hayden , amongst others , has spoken on Capitol Hill fully in this regard , and it is -- I 'll leave it where it is .
The President is accurate in saying what he said .
... Q
You 're denying , in this room , that we torture and we have tortured ?
MS . PERINO : Yes , I am denying that .
Helen then turned in her seat , looked at her colleagues , shook her head in disgust , and asked sadly : " Where is everybody ?
For God 's sakes ! "
I was waving my hand , but I 'm ashamed that at that point I did n't jump in with my version of the question : " The President admitted that he knew about and approved of meetings at which Vice President Cheney and other top national security officials authorized the waterboarding of prisoners .
Senator John McCain has said that waterboarding is torture .
Is Senator McCain wrong ? "
The other question I wanted to ask today was about the Pentagon 's use of TV military analysts as sock puppets .
My unasked question : " The NY Times has described a Pentagon propaganda operation that provided talking points and extraordinary access to supposedly independent TV military analysts in exchange for positive coverage , while withdrawing that access from critics .
Are those appropriate activities for a governmental agency ? "
I 'm working up my nerve .
Maybe next time instead of raising my hand like a good little boy , I 'll just shout it out .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .
WASHINGTON --
The U.S. military says it has found caches of newly made Iranian weapons in Iraq , leading senior officials to conclude Tehran is continuing to funnel armaments into Iraq despite its pledges to the contrary .
Officials in Washington and Baghdad said the purported Iranian mortars , rockets and explosives had date stamps indicating they were manufactured in the past two months .
The U.S. plans to publicize the weapons caches in coming days .
A pair of senior commanders said a presentation was tentatively planned for ...
I swear to God I did not pose someone in a creepy frock in front of the truck .
They were standing there when I got there .
Goths eat ice cream too , you know .
Especially when summoned by the music of the dark overlord | photo by Elise Thompson for LAist
I heard it for the first time a week after moving into my new house — the jangly strains of the creepiest ice cream truck melody in the world .
It was filled with a Danny Elfman - ish foreboding .
It was happy and childlike , yet somehow brooding , like a melancholy , yet jaunty Irish folk song .
I thought it was just me , that I was just imagining things , until the truck passed by one day while I had a visitor .
My friend asked , " What is that ?
Hell 's ice cream truck ? "
The song continues to haunt me .
I chased down the truck one day , but I did n't find the answer I wanted .
George , the ice cream man , said the song came with the truck when he bought it and he has no idea what it 's called .
He said he keeps playing it because it is so memorable .
Everybody comments on it .
So , finally one day I ran outside and taped the music .
I also bought an ice cream sandwich .
Satan 's ice cream truck does sell ice cream sandwiches ; it 's just your standard ice cream .
Except for the the monkey 's paw .
I really do n't recommend that one .
Here is the tune for your listening pleasure .
Enjoy .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad heads to Pakistan and India this week to put the finishing touches on a controversial deal to build a pipeline that would deliver Iranian gas to both countries , Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency says .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves as he arrives Monday in Islamabad , Pakistan .
Ahmadinejad arrived in Islamabad on Monday for a four - hour visit with newly elected Prime Minister Reza Gilani and President Pervez Musharraf , according to Pakistan 's information ministry .
Later in the day , he heads to Sri Lanka before traveling to New Delhi late Tuesday for a short visit , according to Iran 's state - run news agency IRNA .
The pipeline , if built , would be about 2,700 kilometers ( 1,674 miles ) long .
Pakistan and India , both key U.S. allies , are under pressure from the United States not to sign any kind of agreement with Iran .
Some observers have called the project " the peace pipeline " because of its perceived impact on reducing tension between India and Pakistan , nuclear neighbors that have fought three wars , two of them over the disputed Kashmir region .
Watch Ahmadinejad arrive in India »
The gas pipeline project , which has been in discussions for over a year , is aimed at supplying Iranian natural gas to Pakistan and India .
The pipeline would run from Iran to India , cutting through Pakistan .
According to Fars , Ahmadinejad 's visit comes after Pakistani and Indian energy ministers signed an agreement last week , once they had resolved a major " bone of contention " regarding the route of the gas pipeline .
" Now that all sides have calmed down , President Ahmadinejad will discuss the ' Peace Pipeline ' at the highest levels during his visit to the Sub - Continent , " Fars said .
Under the agreement , the pipeline will run through 1,100 kilometers ( 682 miles ) of Iran , 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) of Pakistan and 600 kilometers ( 372 miles ) of India , according to Fars .
" The pipeline will be capable of daily transporting 150 million cubic meters of gas to Pakistan and India -- 90 million cubic meters will go to India and the rest will go to Pakistan , " Fars said .
" The pipeline project was initially estimated to cost $ 4.5 billion , but the cost has been revised to around $ 7 billion . "
The United States recently tried to scuttle the pipeline by offering India advanced nuclear technology to make up for the loss of Iranian gas .
But Fars reported that India recently declared its readiness to participate in the discussions on the pipeline after more than a year .
China --
Iran 's largest trade partner followed by India -- has previously said that it would negotiate in India 's place if New Delhi withdraws from the project , according to Fars .
China borders Pakistan to the north .
A top adviser to the Iranian president spoke on the eve of Ahmadinejad 's visit about the importance of oil and gas when it comes to putting Western powers " in their place , " according to Fars .
" Oil and gas are two elements of power at the disposal of the Muslims , " Gen. Yahya Safavi said Sunday , according to Fars .
" If it ( the power ) be viewed properly ( with wisdom ) and within the framework of the interests of Islam and Muslims , one can then put the hegemonic powers back in their place . "

prints by The Polaroid Kidd
Mike Brodie aka " The Polaroid Kidd " is a somewhat accidental documentary photographer .
By photographing his friends ,
their homes , and lifestyles , Brodie has captured a marginalized segment of the American population that 's not so prevalent in main stream society .
His haunting photos of hobos , punks , and squatters criss - crossing the country in boxcars are reminiscent of Horace Bristol 's Grapes of Wrath era pics
that captured migrant workers on their way to California .... except now they have facial tattoos .
They 're truly amazing .

After the jump , more exhibits of hoaxes and hatin ' on U2 .
Their newest take on the ordeal is an a cappella version of the song that started it all , from the brilliant CD 180 D'G's to the Future : The Music of Negativland as Performed by the 180 G's , included with the Our Favorite Things DVD .
Let 's call it Exhibit A .
Negativland is U2's Green Goblin , and have documented well their legal and public battles with the fightin ' Irish band .
What began as a trademark infringement suit against Negativland for using the " U2 " name on a single resulted in the best publicity the band could have dreamed of ( if a tough battle for them ) .
A book ( FAIR USE : The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2 ) and a later CD ( These Guys Are From England And Who Gives a Shit ) document in text and audio the war .
( Negativland 's Mark Hosler laid out the whole story at the New School in New York in 2006 .
You can hear the talk right here on this very blog . )
Reviews of the new film U2:3D have made it sound really cool .
There 's only one reason I can't bring myself to go : having to sit through 85 minutes of U2 music .
Yeah , I know , hating on U2 is n't the most daring stand a fella can make .
The band 's list of nonfans includes Negativland , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and at least some of the good people of Africa and Scotland .
And Michaelangelo Matos , who wrote that they " were precisely as full of clumsy rhetoric and / or shit as the Jefferson Airplane had been and therefore ' cared . ' "
Exhibit B
Bono was present for a conference in Tanzania in June 2007 , the upshot of which was that Africa needs investment , not aid .
This report comes from the online magazine The American .
After his impassioned defense of aid , an African man in the audience asked Bono , " Where do you place the African person as a thinker , a creator of wealth ? "
Visibly wounded by the question , confused how anyone could misinterpret his good intentions , Bono , like the proverbial white man with black friends , set out to prove how down he is with the black man .
Africans are the " most regal people on earth " and music is their DNA , he told the room of mostly doctors , engineers , and businessmen .
He then began singing a traditional Irish dirge to show us how Celtic music has Coptic roots , and so is fundamentally African .
I was n't the only one giggling in the back row .
Bono , in his awkward defense of his " Africa credo , " also represents our fundamental failure to listen .
Aid can alleviate immediate misery and that is why we love it .
Charity is a profoundly human response to all those images that pull on our heartstrings .
But all evidence points to the maddening conclusion that , in the long run , aid not only has no positive effect on economic growth , it may even undermine it .
The only way Africa will develop and create wealth is if it can attract foreign capital and trade its goods on the world market like every other economically successful country does .
But investors are jittery .
And considering what we think we know about Africa , who would blame them ?
Exhibit B
That same month , Bono attended the G8 summit in Germany , where he was snubbed by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who said " Meeting celebrities is n't my schtick . "
Bono had made several requests to meet with Harper during the conference .
Exhibit C
In October , 2006 , Counterpunch reported on a particularly nice adaptation of an old chestnut .
A Plea to U2 from Africa 's Children Stop Bono Before He Kills Again !
By CounterPunch News Service Bono is at a U2 concert in Glasgow when he asks the audience for some quiet .
Then in the silence , he starts to slowly clap his hands .
Holding the audience in total silence , he says softly and seriously
into the microphone ...
" Every time I clap my hands , a child in Africa dies ...... "
A voice from near the front pierces the silence : " Well , fucken ' stop
doin ' it then ! "
Exhibit D
The previous October , CNN's The Situation Room reported that U2 was going to play at a campaign fundraiser for Sen. Rick Santorum .
( savvy readers will remember Santorum from another spectacle of righteous indignation ) .
Media Matters reported :
On the October 11 edition 2005 of CNN's The Situation Room , CNN correspondent Ali Velshi reported as fact an Internet rumor that the rock band U2 was " set to perform in Philadelphia on Sunday at a $ 1,000 - a- seat fund - raiser for Sen .
Rick Santorum 's [ R - PA ] re-election campaign . "
Velshi's report -- which contained wording similar to that in a false October 10 article on the conservative website NewsMax -- cited a claim by the " organizer of the fund - raiser " that both Santorum and U2 lead singer Bono " have strong religious convictions and are passionate in their beliefs " as an explanation for Bono 's " new and perhaps surprising cause . "
Additionally , in a teaser for the report , anchor Kyra Phillips appeared to parrot NewsMax when she asked , " Why is U2's Bono teaming up with a conservative Republican senator ? "
Though Velshi later acknowledged that he had been " hoaxed , " his retraction did not reference NewsMax , the event 's " organizer , " or any other possible source for his false report .
Exhibit E
On May 21 , 2005 , public scene - causers Improv Everywhere ( best known for their annual pantless subway rides ) staged a fake U2 concert on a rooftop near Madison Square Garden on the afternoon of the group 's concert .
The stunt ranked number 23 on VH1's " 40 Greatest Pranks .
Ancillary Evidence
A poster named SadIrishEyes76 was writing fake U2 posts on Wikipedia in January .
He created entries for albums called Blindness and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb ( Assembly Edition ) , as well as the band 's Annihilation Tour .
Unfortunately they were gone before I saw them ( anyone who knows more , please post in the comments section ) .
Clinton McClung has done some laudable work on this very blog , including the heartwrenching cover of " One " performed by Bank of America brass celebrating their merger with MBNA in 2006 , and the subsequent legal threats after a video was leaked .
The YouTube clip has been removed , but check the Quicktime link .
Mr. McClung also provided documentation of Hotlanta Artiste DeAundra Peek 's cover of " Mysterious Ways . "
Summary
In fairness , any entertainer who takes political positions opens him or herself up ridicule .
But it 's not Bono 's politics that make him so despicable .
It 's the fact that he and his band of strident men have been on the same earnest and chorus - drenched march for three decades .
When 's the last time you heard somebody say " Hey , I really like the new U2 song . "
I mean , do they make good songs ?
But I should n't be so harsh .
I 'll no doubt be eating my words once the Spiderman musical comes out .
It 's being directed by Julie Taymor , who put Bono in her Beatles movie , so it 's a guaranteed hit .
Until then , we have the 3D movie .
Maybe if I get some of those Bose noise - canceling headphones , I could go to the movie and just listen to my iPod .
On second thought , maybe I 'll just charge it up and go for a walk .
In the first sizable layoffs in its history , Google is cutting about 300 jobs from the American operations of DoubleClick , the advertising technology company that it acquired recently , according to a person with direct knowledge of Google ’s plans .
The cuts represent about a quarter of DoubleClick ’s American work force of about 1,200 .
The company has about 1,500 employees worldwide , and the chief executive of Google , Eric E. Schmidt , has suggested that job cuts would also affect DoubleClick ’s overseas operations at a later date .
Google declined to confirm the number of layoffs .
In a statement , the company said : “ Since our acquisition of DoubleClick closed on March 11 , we have been working to match and align DoubleClick employees in the U.S. with our organizational plan for the business .
As with many mergers , this review has resulted in a reduction in headcount at the acquired company . ”
Google said it also planned to sell a DoubleClick unit , Performics Search Marketing , that helps marketers place ads on search engines , including those owned by Google and its main rivals , Yahoo and Microsoft .
Dear Helena ,
A big group of friends and I were trying to figure out a bar to go to .
The obvious choice was Zeitgeist , a popular San Francisco bar with a giant outdoor beer garden .
But I nixed the choice , because I ’m vegetarian and that place always stinks of hamburgers from their outdoor grill .
My one friend and I got into a big fight about it .
She said , “ But you used to eat meat and not mind the smell .
You make everybody ’s life difficult because of your personal choice . ”
Yes , it was harder to decide on a bar because of me , but I feel that because the first - choice bar made me gag , that was a legitimate reason to not want to go there .
Is it OK for vegetarians to insist on meat - free environments , even if it means distressing nonvegetarians ?
And what ’s the best strategy for getting your way without alienating your friends ?
— Ooh That Smell
Dear Ooh That Smell ,
Gagging is unpleasant .
But as a vegetarian , you ca n’t demand that your dining companions give up meat , barbecue aromas , bouillon cubes , leather shoes , Jell - O , or anything else that came from animals just because it does n’t agree with your personal philosophy .
To do so would be not unlike an atheist insisting that his believer friends give up God .
This is not an overstatement , considering how strongly some meat eaters feel about a good , juicy burger .
Whether or not you , as a vegetarian , have the moral high ground ( and there are many convincing ecological and health arguments to be made that you do ) , you ’re not going to win any converts by making a fuss .
You will only look high - maintenance and preachy to your meaty friends , and they may even think twice about including you in future get - togethers .
Mark Rifkin , a Baltimore dietitian and former animal - rights activist , says , “ Constantly harping on the negative is counterproductive and generates bad karma .
It helps activists vent their frustration and anger but does nothing constructive in terms of behavior change . ”
So instead of scorning the beer garden with the grill , or the hamburger joint that someone else suggests for dinner , research another bar that can accommodate a large group , or rave about a restaurant that does a great garlic eggplant with peanut sauce .
If your ideas are shot down , you may have to put up with the meat smell .
Think of it as a sacrifice you ’re making that may actually help animals in the long run .
If you want to win people over , it ’s better to make vegetarianism look easy , rather than a drag .
Kim Sturla , a vegan and cofounder and director of Animal Place , a sanctuary for abused and discarded farm animals in Vacaville , California , says , “ I have gone to places like Sizzler and I just go to the salad bar . ”
Another thing to consider :
If you ’re rigid about people not eating meat around you , your militancy may be serving an unmet emotional need for attention or control .
If that ’s the case , you ’ll have better luck making an appointment with a psychotherapist .

Black carbon , the stuff that gives soot its dirty color , could be the second most important contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide and a key to preventing warming , at least in the short - run , a new study suggests .
Black carbon is a type of aerosol — a small particle suspended in the atmosphere — that is produced in diesel exhaust and when wood , coal or other types of solid fuel are burned .
Like other aerosols , soot particles absorb and scatter the sun 's radiation ; black carbon is the absorbing component of soot .
V. Ramanathan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California and his colleagues reviewed recent studies of black carbon 's warming contribution in the March 24 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience .
They also used data from satellites , aircraft and surface instruments to arrive at their own estimate of just how much warming black carbon causes .
Their estimates are well above those in the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and suggest that black carbon has a bigger warming effect than previously thought .
Ramanathan suggests that tackling black carbon emissions might be an effective way to prevent some climate warming in the short term , while ways to battle rising carbon dioxide levels are sorted out .
Brown clouds
Aerosols are generally thought to have a cooling effect because many , such as sulfate droplets , reflect solar radiation that hits the Earth back out into space .
Aerosols also act as the nuclei of cloud droplets , which also reflect the sun 's radiation .
So the more aerosols there are in the atmosphere , the more cloud droplets there are , and in this way aerosols can also indirectly have a cooling effect .
Black carbon can mix with other aerosols to form what are called atmospheric brown clouds , which have been observed in regional hotspots over China , India , Southeast Asia , Africa and parts of Central and South America .
These brown clouds absorb incoming solar radiation and prevent it from reaching the surface , warming the atmosphere in the process .
Ramanathan 's study found that black carbon had a warming effect of about 0.9 watts per meter squared ( the average light bulb in a lamp is about 60 watts , so while this effect is a fraction of the heat from a light bulb , that little heater is widespread – there is effectively one on every square meter , about the area of the top of an office desk , across Earth 's surface ) .
The most recent IPCC assessment made a lower estimate of the warming effect , between 0.2 and 0.4 watts per meter squared .
Ramanathan and co-author Greg Carmichael of the University of Iowa said these estimates are conservative because they do n't take into account the amplification of black carbon 's warming effect that occurs when it mixes with other aerosols and because they do n't account for warming differences at different altitudes .
The researchers found a significant warming effect at about 6,500 feet ( 2 kilometers ) altitude , where black carbon absorbs not only sunlight , but the light reflected by clouds at lower altitudes .
They say this effect is unaccounted for in model - based estimates used in most studies , meaning that black carbon 's actual warming contribution has been underestimated .
Its warming impact is more than some greenhouse gases , such as methane , Ramanathan contends .
" Overall , the net effect of the black carbon is to warm the climate system globally , " Ramanathan said .
But atmospheric scientist Dorothy Koch of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , who was not affiliated with the study , cautioned that the case was n't that simple : " There 's a lot of uncertainty with black carbon and that makes people kind of reluctant to put it on the table with the greenhouse gases , " Koch told LiveScience .
Black carbon does n't stay in the atmosphere for long , which means it might have a high effect in the short term , but greenhouse gases that stay in the atmosphere longer have a bigger long - term impact .
There is also uncertainty as to just how much of the black carbon in the atmosphere comes from human activities , Koch said .
" There 's a lot of 'ifs ' in there before you can definitely say this is an important thing " in terms of global warming , " Koch said .
Ramanathan agreed that there is significant uncertainty in just how much warming black carbon causes globally , but said that there is no doubt that it causes some degree of warming .
There is also less uncertainty in the amount regional warming it causes , he said .
Ice melt and public health Because of its warming impact in the atmosphere and the short time it lingers in the air , Ramanathan thinks that black carbon would make a good target to retard warming in the short term .
If steps were taken to switch to cleaner energy sources for cooking fires and heating today to reduce black carbon emissions , " it 'll be gone right away , " Ramanathan said .
In developing countries such as China and India , many people use solid fuels such as wood , coal or cow dung to cook and heat their homes .
Unlike the gas and electric ranges found in North America and Europe , these methods produce a lot of soot because the fuel is burned inefficiently at a low temperature .
The key though is to reduce black carbon without reducing other aerosols that have a cooling effect , at least for the time being , Ramanathan said .
He is currently trying to get funding for a study that would provide clean fuel sources for cooking and heating to people in rural India and measure the effects on regional air pollution .
Black carbon has other effects besides adding to global warming .
It is taken out of the air by rain and snow and can be deposited on ice surfaces .
Scientists think it is contributing to ice melt , especially in the Himalayas , because it makes the ice darker so that it absorbs more radiation .
It also poses a public health risk : Previous studies have estimated that 400,000 deaths of women and children from respiratory diseases each year can be attributed to inhaling the smoke from cooking and heating fires that accumulates in poorly ventilated homes .
" How many more reasons can I give you to get rid of it ? " Ramanathan told LiveScience .
Koch agreed .
" There 's a lot of good reasons to reduce black carbon , " she said , adding though that the impact the reduction would have on global warming is uncertain .
She says that reducing black carbon should be investigated because it could be a way to reduce some warming in the short term .
Of course , any efforts to reduce black carbon would n't mean that we could ignore carbon dioxide , because it lasts much longer in the atmosphere and its effect will continue if its emissions are n't addressed .
" We have to get rid of it , " Ramanathan said .
" We ca n't escape from it . "

What 's Your Environmental Footprint ?
As Zimbabwe 's elections hang in the balance , it 's instructive to look at Robert Mugabe 's master map of electoral manipulation .
There are three distinct stages to how he rigs the poll .
Stage one is the skewing of the democratic environment .
He has always done this .
Even in the very first post - civil war elections in 1980 , that brought him to power with an overwhelming mandate .
Instead of moving all his guerrillas into assembly points , as agreed under the Lancaster House peace deal , he instructed a large number to stay among the rural electorate and warn them to vote for him , or else ' aluta continua ' – the war continues .
Now Mugabe uses the traditional tribal chiefs to control the rural electorate .
He pays them large salaries and gives them luxury SUVs , on condition they instruct their followers to vote for him .
Mugabe also increased the number of rural polling stations , ostensibly , to cut the distance rural voters have to travel to cast their ballots , but actually , to impose greater scrutiny on how they vote .
That way , instead of there being dozens of villages in the catchment Mugabe 's men can now identify opposition votes with particular villages and threaten them with dire consequences .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those consequences often revolve around food : in Zimbabwe hunger is the dictator 's ally , it is easily manipulated .
With so many rural Zimbabweans dependent on food aid , Mugabe threatens to cut food deliveries from areas that do n't vote for his ruling Zanu - PF party ( the government - run grain marketing board has a monopoly on all grain deliveries . )
To ameliorate the effects of hyperinflation , now way over 100,000 per cent , Mugabe gave teachers , soldiers , policemen and civil servants huge salary increases , in the run up to these elections .
For these elections he also gerrymandered parliamentary constituencies , giving more seats to the northern rural constituencies , his traditional bastion , and taking seats away from the cities and from the south , both opposition strongholds .
Mugabe also used the police and the Central Intelligence Agency to harass and intimidate the opposition , and he denied the opposition fair access to the media – especially to radio and TV , which are already state - controlled .
Finally , for stage one , in the week before the election , the heads of the security forces appeared on state media to tell the nation that none of them would allow any candidate , other than Robert Mugabe , to rule Zimbabwe – in effect , threatening a pre-emptive coup to keep Mugabe in power if he lost the vote .
The second stage takes place at the ballot box itself .
The voter 's roles are bloated with " ghost voters , " thousands registered to a single shanty , or to bogus addresses .
Voters rolls were n't made freely available to the opposition to check .
Many legitimate voters ( in known opposition areas ) found their names had been taken off the rolls , and were unable to vote .
As were the Zimbabweans in the growing diaspora , who are not allowed postal votes .
Almost 70 per cent of Zimbabweans between the ages of 18 and 60 now live and work outside the country , most of whom support the opposition .
In the last two elections these two stages of rigging have been enough to get the " right " result for Mugabe .
But in last Saturday 's poll , the swing towards the opposition was so great that these tactics did not , by themselves , prevail .
And so the Zimbabwe Election Commission ( run by a former army officer and usually reliably pro-Mugabe ) was faced with stage three rigging .
Theoretically this is relatively simple .
At the central counting station , figures are massaged to give the desired outcome .
But in these latest elections , it was n't so simple .
For one thing , they were , for the first time " harmonised " elections – four different elections in one .
Voters filled in ballots for parliament , senate and local wards , as well as president .
And what really hamstrung Mugabe this time , was a provision in the new electoral laws that results ( of all four counts ) be posted on walls on the 9,000 polling stations .
In the past , when rigging stages one and two worked well , this would n't really have mattered .
But now suddenly it does .
Opposition representatives went around photographing the posted results , and collating them .
Mugabe 's men were able to chase opposition observers away from polling stations in his heartlands , and it is for these that Mugabe is able to manufacture fictitious results , to swing the overall results of the presidential contest .
But the Mugabe machine is not what it was .
The logistics are creaking , and the once monolithic party is now faction - ridden and beset by internal succession feuds , undermining its rigging operation , perhaps fatally .

The KDE development community has been working on KDE 4 , a major KDE revision that brings in numerous new technologies , and the official release is scheduled for next month .
My colleague Troy has provided in - depth overviews of previous betas , but today we 're going to take a look at the second KDE 4 release candidate , which was made available for download earlier this week .
For my tests , I used the KDE 4 RC 2 Live CD image proved by the KDE community .
The Live CD is based on OpenSUSE and provides easy access to a complete KDE 4 environment .
Although the release candidate has many rough edges and is significantly lacking in polish , the underlying technologies are all in place and deliver some very impressive functionality .
KDE 4 offers some unique architectural advantages over its predecessor , including a completely redesigned desktop and panel system called Plasma , an improved version of the KWin window manager with advanced compositing features , a new modular multimedia framework called Phonon , and a sophisticated hardware API called Solid .
KDE 4 uses a completely new visual style and icon set called Oxygen .
The Oxygen widget theme uses a lot of subtle gradients , light shadows , round edges , and background highlighting .
Generally , the Oxygen style manages to be attractive without becoming a distraction , but there are still some places where additional work is needed .
This is most evident in a handful of preference dialogs where elements are cut off or not rendered correctly .
In most of the major desktop applications , Oxygen looks nice .
I was also impressed with the flexibility of Oxygen .
The appearance preferences dialog gives users extensive control over the colors of specific elements .
Oxygen looks great with both dark and light color schemes .
In current versions of KDE , Konqueror is both a web browser and a file manager .
In KDE 4 , the focus for Konqueror has shifted towards browsing , while Dolphin has become the default file manager .
When I first looked at Dolphin back in April , I really liked what I saw .
The version of Dolphin included in the release candidate still serves up all the same great features and adds a few more nice ones , like a new column view that is similar to the Mac OS X Finder .
Dolphin is powerful , intuitive , and a pleasure to use .
I tested several other applications as well , like Amarok 2 and KWord 2 , both of which are impressive despite some rough edges .
KWord 2's somewhat unusual user interface is intriguing , but clearly requires more polish to be truly useful .
KWord 2 pushes most of the formatting features into a vertical dock that runs along the side of the window , which seems practical for users with widescreen monitors .
The Amarok 2 user interface has a lot of nice little aesthetic flourishes and is easily the most polished of the KDE 4 applications .
Currently , the most significant weaknesses in KDE 4 are in the Plasma desktop layer .
The Plasma components used for the desktop and the panel are undercooked .
One of the primary features of Plasma is support for desktop - embedded widgets — called plasmoids — that are similar in nature to SuperKaramba widgets , Windows Sidebar gadgets , or Mac OS X Dashboard widgets .
I tested several of the plasmoids that ship with the release candidate , including a clock , battery meter , calculator , and dictionary .
On two occasions , adding a plasmoid to the desktop caused the screen to go black and the computer to become unresponsive , requiring me to forcibly kill and restart Xorg in order to continue with my tests .
The plasmoids themselves are also somewhat buggy .
The panel at the bottom of the screen , which is also provided by Plasma , includes a menu button , task list , and notification area .
I was unable to find any way to configure the panel , which is significantly less functional than the panel in the current version of KDE .
The second KDE 4 release candidate illuminates the extent to which KDE 4 has matured since the earlier betas , but a massive infusion of debugging and polish is needed before the release next month .
Heavy development on KDE 4 will obviously continue after the KDE 4.0 release , so whatever pieces are still missing are sure to be filled in eventually .
Some critics point to the deficiencies of KDE 4 and argue that drastic reinvention of basic desktop components might not have been a good idea .
After experiencing KDE 4 myself , I have to disagree .
Transitions are always hard , but when the dust settles , a clean break between versions and an opportunity to introduce some innovative new ideas should lead to a stronger user experience .
After years of development , unnecessary cruft builds up and things tend to get disorganized .
The KDE 4 transition , though it will definitely be rocky at first , gives developers the ability to cut away the cruft and reorganize code in a manner that makes the whole environment more future - proof and easier to maintain .
Evidence of the advantages might not be readily apparent to end users yet , but there are plenty of sweet improvements under the hood in KDE 4 .
Developer - oriented changes like the much - needed migration from Autotools to CMake , the shift from Qt 3 to Qt 4 , or the move from DCOP to D - Bus , for instance , all offer very real advantages .
My experience with KDE 4 revealed a set of hairy , nasty warts that need to be resolved , but it also shone some light on some impressive improvements .
Although I 'm skeptical that all of the problems with the release candidate can be fixed in only one month , a rough first release seems a small price to pay for the significant long - term advantages offered by the transition .
The Republican National Committee this afternoon scolded the Tennessee Republican Party over their use of " Barack Hussein Obama " in an official press release and warned the state party that they will be denounced by the national committee if they use the Democrat 's middle name again , said a GOP official close to the RNC .
" The RNC has notified the Tennessee GOP that they do not support or agree with their approach , " said this source , requesting anonymity to discuss the private conversation between a staffer in the national committee 's political department and a top aide at the state party .
" If they do n't refrain from doing so again , they will be publicly repudiated by the Republican National Committee . "
This source said the national committee did not ask the Tennessee party to retract their statement , but effectively put them on notice for the future .
Monday , Tennessee GOP spokesman Bill Hobbs penned a press release attacking Obama on Israel , using his Muslim - sounding middle name in the process .
" The Tennessee Republican Party today joins a growing chorus of Americans concerned about the future of the nation of Israel , the only stable democracy in the Middle East , if Sen.
Barack Hussein Obama is elected president of the United States , " Hobbs wrote .
The Tennessee GOP chairwoman , Robin Smith , stood by Hobbs yesterday , saying that they " have a duty to inform the Republican base " and pointing out that the state party was n't working for McCain .
Asked if Republicans appreciated the public relations headaches this was causing John McCain , their likely nominee , the source quickly replied : " Yes , that 's why they let people know that this is exactly what they should not be doing .
McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker noted that her candidate condemned the press release and apologized to Obama .
It was the second time he had to do so in as many days .
" There will be times in this campaign where people do and say stupid things , " Hazelbaker said .
" It 's a fact and it 's beyond our control . "
" We will continue to condemn [ such comments ] in the strongest language possible and reitterate our commitment to running a positive campaign based on the issues . "

Some have interpreted the ceaseless criticisms of Google 's privacy policies and its co-operation with totalitarian regimes as a sign the Don't Be Evil goal is unattainable for a profit - driven company .
At the very least , the corporate motto has encouraged the public and the press to hold Google to a higher standard .
" It really was n't like an elected , ordained motto , " Google 's vice - president and 20th employee , Marissa Mayer , said in an interview during her trip to Sydney last week .
" I think that ' Do n't Be Evil ' is a very easy thing to point at when you see Google doing something that you personally do n't like ; it 's a very easy thing to point out so it does get targeted a lot . "
Janis Wardrop , associate lecturer in organisation and management at the University of NSW , said that , regardless of Google 's stated motto , companies are always set up to look after their shareholders and not other stakeholders .
" It [ the motto ] is good PR but really it 's empty because it 's questionable whether shareholders will care [ whether Google is evil or not ] , " she said .
The most recent Google product to raise the ire of privacy activists is the Street View feature of Google Maps , already launched for over 40 US cities and expected to be unveiled for Australia this year .
Google - branded cars with roof - mounted cameras have been traversing Australian capital city streets since late last year , taking highly detailed , panoramic photos .
Soon , Google Maps users will be able to explore much of the country at ground level for the first time , using only a computer and an internet connection .
Privacy groups are up in arms because Google has not made a firm commitment to obscure faces and numberplates , and there have been no assurances that Google 's drivers wo n't accidentally head down private roads .
In the US , Google is already being sued by a US couple for publishing photographs of their home , on a street clearly marked with a private road sign , on Street View .
It has also been accused of invading privacy with photos taken from public streets , as numerous people were unwittingly snapped in embarrassing or compromising positions .
Google offers to take down invasive or sensitive images when it is notified but even that has not been enough to placate its critics , who say Google should vet images before they are put online or accept legal liability for invasions of privacy .
But even before Street View , Google has long faced criticisms over the way it handles the vast stores of personal information it collects from users of its various products .
Collecting as much personal data as possible makes perfect commercial sense because it allows search companies such as Google to deliver highly targeted advertising and better search results , effectively making them more competitive .
But at the same time , people are beginning to fear they are losing control of their personal data and are reluctant to unequivocally trust Google to use their information responsibly .
Google has already committed to anonymising search logs to ensure data it collects is not personally identifiable , and cut the time it stores search information to 18 months .
But a report from the European Union 's privacy watchdog , released this month , said Google and its competitors should go further and delete user data after six months , while making it clearer to users why their personal information is being retained .
Google has also been attacked for co-operating with totalitarian regimes by censoring its search results in China to appease the Chinese Government .
Amnesty International pointed to Google 's " Do n't Be Evil " motto in criticising the company over the " self - censorship " .
Ironically , Yahoo has also modified its service at China 's request - and gave its government information which led to the imprisonment of cyber dissidents - but Google continues to cop the most scrutiny and criticism over the issue .
Even Google 's attempt this year to spruik its environmental credentials - by announcing plans to develop a gigawatt of new renewable energy - has been torn apart .
An article in Harper 's magazine accuses Google of triggering an infrastructure arms race between it and competitors Microsoft and Yahoo , concluding the massive data centres they are building all over the world will be far worse energy guzzlers .
In response to the Harper 's article , Google said the entire company was carbon neutral .
Mayer , who controls the direction of Google 's key products including web search , news , images and maps , would not give a direct answer when asked whether the company now regretted the motto or whether she believed Google was now held to a higher standard than its competitors .
" I do n't think that we should be held to a lower standard , " she said .
" I think that what we 're doing is very meaningful , it 's very important , it 's serious , it has large - scale ramifications for people in their lives and as a result we need to take it very seriously and we should be held to a very high standard regardless of whether it 's self imposed or imposed through public scrutiny . "
Mayer explained that Don't Be Evil was coined in 1999 by one of Google 's first engineers , Amit Patel , who shared a work cubicle with Mayer .
She said Patel and other early employees were resistant when staff with business skills began joining the engineer - driven company .
The engineers feared they would be pressured into moving certain clients higher in search results listings or building products they did not want to build .
Patel voiced his fears via the whiteboard in the conference room where Google sales people met clients .
" In this incredibly neat handwriting in tiny little letters on the bottom right hand side of the white board , he wrote ' Do n't Be Evil ' , " Mayer said .
Some time later , when Google had 200-300 employees , its human resources team decided the company needed corporate values .
They called a team meeting of some of Google 's senior staff .
After they brainstormed 10 positive corporate values , Paul Bucheit , the inventor of Gmail , suggested ditching those in favour of one that covered all angles - Do n't Be Evil .
" Originally Don't Be Evil was No.6 on the corporate values [ list ] but it 's the only one that stuck because it's the catchiest and , as Paul said , encompasses everything else , " said Mayer .
HSBC says no bank account details have been lost The HSBC banking group has admitted losing a computer disc with the details of 370,000 customers .
The disc was lost four weeks ago after being sent by courier from the bank 's life insurance offices in Southampton .
The customers ' details included their names , dates of birth , and their levels of insurance cover .
However , there were no addresses or bank account details and HSBC said the customers ' exposure to potential fraud was limited .
" We are looking into it and basically it has got lost from A to B , " said an HSBC spokesman .
" The reinsurer we sent it to is doing a thorough search for the disc .
We will do anything we can to find it . "
" There are no financial details there in terms of banking details .
There are no address details or anything like that , " he added .
As well as name , date of birth and value of the cover , the documents revealed only the customer 's policy number and whether or nor the customer was a smoker .
Fines The Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) has been informed of the data loss and is likely to mount an investigation .
In the past year , both the Nationwide building society and the Norwich Union insurance company have suffered heavy fines and public reprimands for not looking after customer details properly .
We hold up our hands and say it was n't good enough
HSBC spokesman
In the most spectacular example yet of data loss , last year the HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) lost some computer discs while in transit between London and Newcastle .
These contained the entire child benefit data base , covering 25 million claimants , including full bank and building society details .
The discs have not yet been recovered .
Last month a committee of MPs , the Joint Committee on Human Rights , said the government had " persistently failed " to take data protection sufficiently seriously .
No encryption Despite the reassurances from HSBC , the bank admitted that although the data on the disc was protected by a password it had not been encrypted .
A bank spokesman explained that normally the data on its life insurance customers was sent to its reinsurance firm in Folkestone by an electronic link .
On this occasion , in the middle of February , this link was not working , so instead the data was downloaded onto a disc and sent by the bank 's normal postal service operated by the Royal Mail .
" We hold up our hands and say it was n't good enough , " said the spokesman .
" The documents should have been encrypted , " he added .
The bank will shortly be writing to all the customers while it investigates the loss along with the reinsurance firm .
Similar losses
The HSBC incident is just the latest example of careless behaviour by a big organisation regarding personal information .
Since the loss of the child benefit data by the HMRC last November , similar losses have been happening every month .
Recent failings include : Laptop computer with the personal details of more than 200 children was stolen from a medical centre in Shropshire .
The Courts Service lost four CDs in the post with personal details from court cases .
Information about nearly 600,000 people went missing when a Royal Navy officer had his laptop stolen from a car in Birmingham .
Hundreds of documents from the Department of Work and Pensions containing sensitive personal data were found dumped on a roundabout in Devon .
Nine NHS trusts in England admitted losing patient records covering hundreds of thousands of adults .
Details of 14,000 customer records were lost by the Skipton building society .
Ministers revealed in December that , earlier in 2007 , details of three million candidates for the driving theory test had gone missing while being processed in the US .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) took a dim view of this latest data loss .
" Organisations which process personal information must ensure it is held securely .
This is an important principle of the Data Protection Act , " it said .
" In recent months there have been a number of incidents of data losses in the public sector .
This case demonstrates that data protection must also be a priority for the private sector .
" Once the ICO has heard from HSBC about the outcome of their investigation we will decide what , if any , further action is needed on our part , " it added .

What are these ?
When transcribing interviews , it 's often helpful to the reader to note when either the inquisitor or the person answering the questions laughs - but not in the case of this Q&A with John Oliver , a British - born correspondent for The Daily Show , who visits Denver for two nights worth of standup gigs ; click here for more details .
After all , laughter was so prevalent - especially on the part of your humble scribe - that noting each guffaw would be irritatingly redundant .
Oliver offers a brief sketch of his life in the U.K. entertainment firmament before talent scouts at The Daily Show plucked him from obscurity , for reasons he 's too paranoid to explore .
Afterward , he shares memories of his first day on the job ; divulges secrets about interviewing newsmakers - especially his preference for blindsiding them , as opposed to warning them about what 's coming ; cites the U.S. senator who ended a taping early because he realized what an ass he'd just made of himself ; debunks the notion that America 's youth is getting its news from Jon Stewart ; details the agonies accompanied by the recently ended Writer 's Guild strike , which wound up getting him in a pickle with the immigration service ; speaks with enthusiasm about covering August 's Democratic National Convention in Denver ; gives a brief preview of his performance in the forthcoming Mike Meyers movie , The Love Guru ; and concedes that dishing about politics from club stages is a lot easier now that he 's a regular on Comedy Central .
Luckily , that 's pretty much the only regular thing about him .
Westword ( Michael Roberts ) :
Tell me a little bit about your pre-Daily Show career - the projects that we Americans know nothing about .
John Oliver : Well , my pre-Daily
Show career was certainly not in America .
I 'd never been here before .
I was a writer and standup in Britain for , I guess , eight years or something like that .
Doing various jobs on radio and television and entertaining at drunken comedy clubs to mixed success .
And then I got offered this job , and all of a sudden I was on my dream job .
It happened fast .
It was very strange .
WW : How did The Daily Show folks hear about you ?
JO : I 'm not entirely sure - and it's one of those things where I think everyone has an imposter mentality when they get a job they think is better than they are .
And so I 've not actually asked just in case .
In the back of my mind , I 've wondered :
What if a mistake was made , and the wrong letter was sent out ?
They could find out !
Do n't ask any questions !
WW : When you moved to the States , were you looking forward to it or dreading it on some level ?
JO : Well , I was very nervous .
I came in Sunday night and I was on the show the following Monday morning .
Like I say , it happened fast .
I was looking forward to it .
I could n't believe it was happening to me .
It was absolutely my favorite comedy show , and I was very intimidated .
I remember getting on the plane in London and thinking , What on earth are you doing ?
I remember my manager said , " Oh , do n't worry about it .
You 'll probably get fired within three weeks . "
I could n't believe it !
That was his good - luck message : " You 'll get fired within three weeks .
I 'll see you in a month . "
" Well !
Thank you very much ! "
WW : Is that the British equivalent of " break a leg " ?
JO : I think so !
What a boost to my confidence that was .
" See you in a few weeks .
There 's no way you 're going to hold this job down . "
WW : Do you remember what that first story was ?
JO : Yeah , it was about Bush and Blair .
It was when he was caught on camera saying , " Yo , Blair . "
We wrote something during the day and did it that night , and I was so tired , I did n't really have time to get nervous .
I 'd fallen asleep on the sofa with jet lag and had a few hours sleep and then turned up to work , thinking , Just give me a nice , relaxing first day to break me in .
And they said , " No , no .
This has happened .
You 're on tonight . "
It probably worked out for the best , though , because I did n't have time to get as scared as I should have been .
WW : Obviously , the show deals with all kinds of topical issues .
Do you feel it's an advantage that you bring an outsider 's perspective to most of the stories you cover ?
JO : Maybe .
As a British person , you 're the ultimate outsider , in that we wrecked the world long before you tried to .
WW : We 're playing catch - up ...
JO : And it 's a good effort !
But you 're going to do very well to do as much damage as we did .
I do n't know .
I guess that helps in a way , because there 's nothing you can say about America that you can't say about ten times stronger about the British empire .
I do n't know .
I guess it helps in a way .
Comedy always works best from an outsider 's standpoint anyway , and being vocally and physically different ...
I 'm pronounce words correctly , and I 'm far more pasty than any American has the capacity of being .
WW : When you sit down to interview someone , do you pull them aside before hand and say , " You do know I 'm going to be making fun of you relentlessly throughout this , do n't you ? "
JO : No ! No !
Absolutely not .
I try and spend as little time with the person before as possible , so you just walk in and start the interview .
It 's an interesting process , those interviews .
They are usually as tense as they look .
I do a series of interviews with U.N. ambassadors , and they were incredible .
They 'd literally never been spoken like this before .
You only have about forty minutes to do those , because they 're busy people and they have better things to do with their day than being insulted by someone they 've never heard of .
But they stick it out .
They sit there .
WW : What percentage of people you interview seem to know what they 're in for ?
JO : Well , they know what the show is - politicians in particular .
But there 's that in - built arrogance where they think , " They wo n't get me ...
They might have done that to other people , but not me .
I can get around them . "
And the truth is , that 's very rarely the case , because we 've usually thought a lot more about the interview than they have .
That kind of arrogance is usually the pride that comes before the fall .
WW : Have you had people storm out angrily ?
JO : Only one guy .
I did a piece on English as the official language of the United States , and there was a guy , James Inhofe [ a Republican senator from Oklahoma ] , who had written this bill wanting English as the official , not the national , language , which would have banned translations in hospitals .
And we did this joke with him ...
He 'd said diagnosis was n't necessarily always verbal .
It could sometimes be physical .
And I said , " Oh , he could mime it out .
Like , he 's broken his arm - he could mime it out .
Or he could mime if he had a pain in his side .
Or mime , ' I 'm allergic to penicillin . ' "
And there was this long , excruciating silence , and about two minutes later , all of a sudden , he had an appointment he 'd forgotten !
Out of nowhere !
" Oh , I forgot to tell you , I have to leave ... "
" Oh , that 's interesting , because you said you had two hours . "
" Oh , no .
I can't .
I 'm getting out of here ... "
WW : Was that a moment of great pride for you ?
JO : At that point , that was a really reprehensible part of the immigration bill , and it had been really hard , because he was toeing the party line the whole way through , and then he made this one slip .
I thought we could get him , because the whole concept of their whole argument was so ridiculous .
Really , all you had to do was get him to state his actual case and you should be able to find jokes in that .
But he was a smart enough guy to know that as soon as that happened that he was finish .
But that was excruciatingly tense .
I remember the camera crew that day , it was the first time they 'd shot The Daily Show , and as he left , they were like , " Was there anything funny in that at all ? "
And me and the producer said , " Oh , that will be fine .
Do n't worry about that . "
WW : The Daily Show actually has a rather modest - size audience .
Does it surprise you the impact it has anyway .
JO : Sometimes I think it 's exaggerated .
Yeah , we have a very modest audience .
So I think when people say it 's kind of a touchstone for young people - that ridiculous idea that young people get their news from it - that 's patently untrue .
You would n't get the jokes unless you knew what we were talking about .
They just get it from other sources other than network news at the moment .
But at the end of the day , it 's just a comedy show .
If we started thinking about that , we 'd spend all our day worry about it , and we 've got to do a show a day , so there 's no real time .
We just make each other laugh .
It 's a small operation .
It 's a tiny office .
Our office is above the studio , which is downstairs .
So it 's just like coming to work every day .
It does n't feel like that big a deal .
We 're in one of the least glamorous parts of Manhattan , next to the place where they keep the Central Park horses , so it smells of horse excrement in the morning .
It 's really not the glamorous thing that some people would believe .
WW : Does that aroma help you keep your feet on the ground ?
JO : I think so !
It 's a kind of fitting aroma for a comedy show , I think .
Horse excrement wafting in the window .
It lets you know exactly what 's your place in the entertainment canon of America .
WW : So as the funniest correspondent on The Daily Show , do you get special treatment ?
JO : Whoa , there .
I would refute that question .
I do n't know how to answer that !
We 're all the same .
It 's an egalitarian outfit .
It 's basically like televisual communism .
WW : One for all and all for one .
JO : Exactly ...
WW : When the writers went on strike , you were one of the first persons out on the picket line .
If I remember correctly , you were interviewed by NPR , right ?
JO : Maybe .
There was a lot of media around that first week .
I can't even remember who I talked to , to be honest .
WW : Was it difficult to have to explain the reasons for the strike to people who just wanted to watch a new episode of the David Letterman show ?
JO : Very difficult .
Everything about the strike was difficult .
It was very worrying , not only for the writers , but also for all the people we worked with .
I did n't really sleep properly the whole strike , I was so concerned about all the people with jobs who stood to gain nothing from this negotiation .
I had n't really thought , either , that there would be anyone there that first day , and then all of a sudden , there were all these cameras .
And there were n't that many people in the Writer 's Guild in New York who were actually on camera .
But thankfully , Tina Fey was there , and she took the brunt of it .
Whenever they could n't speak to Tina , they came over to me .
But it was horrible .
It was an absolutely horrible time .
WW : When The Daily Show came back in January , you appeared on the show ...
JO : Yeah , because I got into visa trouble .
I 'm a member of the Writer 's Guild , but I 'm also not a U.S. citizen or here on a Green Card - I do n't have a Green Card .
I 'm here on a working visa controlled by Viacom , which meant that when the show went back on the air , I was then striking against my visa - which U.S. immigration took a very dim view of .
WW : Usually , it does n't seem like U.S. immigration does anything ...
JO : That is the American response !
But as someone who deals with U.S. immigration on what can occasionally feel like almost a weekly basis , they are absolutely ferocious .
They are everything Lou Dobbs wants them to be and more .
They 're very frightening , very intimidating people .
I do n't know if that reassures America at all , but it is rough , U.S. immigration .
Even when you have a visa , it 's rough going through immigration .
I seem to have trouble almost every time now .
It 's not easy , and as soon as they found out about that , they were not pleased .
WW : So we can't keep Mexican immigrants from crossing the border , but they can prevent you from striking against a comedy show ?
JO : They certainly gave it a very , very strong effort .
It was very frightening - a horrible , horrible time .
WW : During that period when the strike had n't been resolved yet but you were on the show , who was writing it ?
Were you just winging it ?
JO : No one was writing it .
It was bizarre .
It was bizarre and so strange .
It was so tiring I can't even really remember .
I think it 's like child - birth .
When you come back , the endorphins are so strong that it wiped out the pain .
No one was writing it .
It was weird .
We would just talk .
It was a very strange process .
WW : Do you have a background in improvisation ?
JO : Not really .
I 've got a background in standup , and in standup , you do n't get trained in improv ; you get trained in survival .
So I have an innate survival mechanism from standup , which got me through .
WW : And upon the writers ' return , the endorphins kicked in ?
JO : It was great .
It was really great .
But I honestly do n't have anything positive to say about the strike .
It was horrific , and having everyone back has been fantastic .
WW : Did they come back funnier than ever ?
JO : Yeah , they were just so desperate to come back , and we were desperate to have them .
It kind felt like those black - and - white pictures of soldiers returning from war .
Even though they had n't been at war :
They 'd just been in a minor contractual Hollywood dispute .
But it 's been great to get everything back to normal .
When our previous normal was such a dream job , we were anxious to have it get back that way .
WW : This year , as you know , the Democratic National Convention will be in Denver .
JO : That 's right , and we 're doing shows .
We 're doing a week 's worth of shows .
WW : Have you already plotted out some ideas for it ?
JO : No , not really .
When you have to write shows back to back ...
I know there are production plans going on , but we wo n't be looking at that until nearer the time .
I do know it 'll be hugely exciting .
WW : Do the Democrats this year make for particularly ripe comic subjects ?
JO : Yes , fantastic .
Especially , if , as looks possible if not probable , it 's not been decided by then .
Then , it 's going to be an incredible convention .
But even if there is a nominee by then , it 's still going to be fantastic .
WW : There 's a protest group here called Recreate ' 68 , and their goal is to recreate the level of protest that took place at the Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968 ...
JO : Really ?
WW : Yes .
So would it be better or worse for you guys if things spun completely out of control ?
JO : To be honest , there will be plenty of stuff anyway .
I do n't think we 're going to need their help .
Democrats seem to have a natural self - destruct impulse anyway .
They need n't destroy themselves just for our benefit .
I 'm sure they 'll do that anyway .
WW : You 'll just be there to watch ...
JO : We 'll just be there to watch .
Not necessarily enjoy , but certainly use .
WW : I understand you have a part in the new Mike Myers movie ...
JO : Yeah , I am .
It 's not a big part , but I am in that , yeah .
WW : The character is named Dick Pants ?
JO : Dick Pants !
That 's right - Dick Pants .
WW : What appealed to you most - the opportunity to work with Mike Myers or the chance to have the name " Dick Pants " on your résumé ?
JO : Well , both , obviously .
Both are a huge privilege .
I do n't know - I 've never really done much acting before , so it was a strange offer .
I 've admired Mike Myers for years , so it was an amazing experience .
I do n't know that I 'll be doing any more films after this , but it was great fun to try .
WW : So your debut performance will kill your film career ?
JO : I do n't know .
The weird thing is , I love my job here .
I really love it .
I do n't just like it .
I really do n't want to do anything but this .
I 'm really not looking to do anything other than this .
I 'm a standup , so I can do that around work .
But otherwise , I do n't know - I 'm pretty happy here .
WW : Tell me about your current standup routine .
Do you do topical material ?
JO : Pretty much .
My standup has always been like The Daily Show - childish interpretations of massively serious global situations .
So it 's pretty much that .
Oversimplifying very complicated areas .
WW : Do you try to keep your material is current as possible ?
Will you be coming up with new material the day before you get here ?
JO : It kind of depends .
Work is busy here .
It 's hard to say with standup .
It 's much less of a disciplined process than sitting down in the morning on The Daily Show , then writing it that afternoon and doing it that night .
Standup is kind of ongoing .
I can't even remember when I write standup .
It usually just happens .
WW : Are American audiences easier to win over than British audiences ?
JO : They 're great .
When people know The Daily Show , that makes things a lot easier , because they come expecting a certain kind of comedy .
When you do clubs and they do n't know who you are and you have to convince people not only that you 're funny but that they 're interested in hearing about politics from a standup ...
They 're like , " Really ?
Well , I have worked hard , and I 'm a bit drunk now , so I was hoping you would n't be talking about global economics . "
And they 've got a point .
But I have no plan B .
They 've just got to sit there and hate it .
So it 's a lot easier when people know what to expect and come wanting that .
It makes things a lot more fun .
From an interview with Warren Buffet in Fortune Magazine : What Warren thinks …
Q : Are we a long way from turning a corner ?
Buffett : “ I think so .
I mean , it seems everybody says it ’ll be short and shallow , but it looks like it ’s just the opposite .
You know , deleveraging by its nature takes a lot of time , a lot of pain .
And the consequences kind of roll through in different ways .
Now , I do n’t invest a dime based on macro forecasts , so I do n’t think people should sell stocks because of that .
I also do n’t think they should buy stocks because of that . ”
Buffett talks about not timing the market based on macroeconomics , but he did time the housing market perfectly .
He bought a Laguna Beach , CA house in 1996 for $ 1.05 million ( at the market bottom ) , and sold in 2005 for $ 3.5 million .
It ’s not like he needed the money .
Here was Buffett ’s comment at the time :
“ People go crazy in economics periodically .
Residential housing has different behavioral characteristics , simply because people live there .
But when you get prices increasing faster than the underlying costs , sometimes there can be pretty serious consequences . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - News Corp NWSa.N and Time Warner Inc's TWX.N willingness to make a deal with Yahoo Inc YHOO.
O is seen as a tacit admission that big media empires will not go it alone on the Internet any more .

Even if they lose Yahoo to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O -- as widely expected on Wall Street -- analysts and media industry insiders say the two could explore other combinations including merging Time Warner 's AOL with News Corp 's MySpace .
“ MySpace and AOL are Internet assets that are in either a state of limbo or a state of decline , ” said Jordan Rohan , founder of digital media advisory company Clearmeadow Partners .
“ Google ’s growing faster than you are and it ’s responsible for the majority of profitability for each of these .
You ’re dependent on your biggest competitor and that ’s a terrible position to be in . ”
Both MySpace and AOL depend on Google for search advertising .
As the U.S. economy increasingly looks like it might be in recession , concerns about the long - term growth rate of Internet advertising have forced big media companies to reevaluate their role .
Perhaps the days when they can take on Google or Yahoo by themselves have reached their highest point .
Both Walt Disney Co DIS.N and General Electric 's GE.N NBC shut down their ambitious Internet portals in 2001 .
Time Warner ’s stock has suffered through the 7 years since its merger with AOL , even as its restructuring into a one - stop shop for Internet advertising shows early signs of progress .
Meanwhile , News Corp ’s Fox Interactive Media ( FIM ) , which owns the world ’s largest online social network MySpace , quietly started to dial back growth expectations late last year , and now expects fiscal 2008 revenue to fall short of News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch ’s $ 1 billion target .
It is against this backdrop that talks with Yahoo are taking place .
AOL is discussing a merger with Yahoo , while News Corp is reportedly pondering joining Microsoft ’s bid as well as pursuing individual talks with Yahoo .
“ Who , after all , wants to compete as a sub - scale player -- with a less than complete set of Internet assets -- in a world dominated by Google and Microhoo ? ” Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet wrote last week in a research note .
“ We would not rule out the prospect of AOL / MySpace at some future date . ”
Most investors and analysts expect Microsoft to prevail in buying Yahoo , although some analysts say rivals could possibly turn up a better offer for the Web pioneer , which has rejected the software giant ’s $ 42 billion bid as too low .
In one scenario , Bernstein Research estimated a potential deal to combine AOL and Yahoo , with a side pact to rely entirely on Google Inc GOOG .
O for Web search advertising , could top Microsoft 's initial $ 31 - per - share offer for Yahoo .
Bernstein Internet analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said under that scenario , Time Warner ’s stock and cash offer could be worth up to $ 37.01 per share and eliminate up to $ 800 million in costs .
“ We think the AOL - Yahoo proposal is a viable alternative to Yahoo and , given the deal terms leaked to the press , could actually in a best - case scenario be more attractive , ” he said , but added such a deal would face big hurdles with regulators .
MYSPACE FUTURE IN QUESTION
As for News Corp , there ’s no question that Murdoch ’s $ 580 million investment to buy MySpace will rake in big returns -- any deal involving MySpace would value it at a rich multiple .
But making MySpace ’s continued traffic growth pay off in terms of a boost in ad revenue is the key concern .
“ The social network inventories are being sold at pennies to the dollar , ” Richard de Silva , a general partner at venture capital firm Highland Capital Partners , said of social networks .
His firm has sought out companies focused on helping social networks sell their advertising space more efficiently “ The next wave is about pricing that inventory at full value . ”
Two analysts cut their target price on News Corp shares on Monday , citing concerns about the future of FIM .
Bernstein Research , which downgraded the stock to “ Market - Perform ” from “ Outperform ” , estimated FIM ’s fiscal 2008 revenue to grow about 30 percent , only a third of last year ’s rate , while costs are also estimated to jump 46 percent .
A combination with AOL could help News Corp come closer to solving that “ monetization ” challenge .
For the past year , Fox Interactive Media has worked to better match ads to users and has restructured its ad business .
But results could take longer .
New ad - targeting strategies " do not have the incremental impact that are assumed in many of the business plans , " said Dave Moore , chief executive of WPP Group Plc's WPP.L digital marketing company 24/7 Real Media .
That ’s where AOL could come in .
AOL has spent nearly two years rapidly buying up ad technology firms including content - targeted ad company Quigo , and Tacoda , which displays ads based on a Web surfer ’s online habits .
The moves helped AOL win a deal to exclusively represent Verizon Communications Inc's VZ.N online ad inventory .
ComScore on Monday also rated AOL's Platform - A as the top U.S. ad network in March , beating Yahoo , Google and 12 others .
AOL's ad network reached 9 out of 10 U.S. web users .
Both News Corp and Time Warner have said they could prosper on their own without major deals .
But in a consolidating digital ad world , soon to be polarized by two big players -- Microsoft with Yahoo , and Google -- Murdoch and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes can ill afford to wait .
“ This is not about creating a new growth juggernaut , ” Rohan said .
“ All the companies involved in these discussions are missing their financial targets . ”
Penny Problem : Not Worth Metal
It 's Made Of
The coin costs nearly 1.7 cents to make , so America loses money on each one .
March 16 , 2008 --
The saying goes , " See a penny , pick it up , all day long you 'll have good luck . "
But these days , the penny itself is n't having much luck .
Not only is there nothing you can buy with a penny , it 's literally not worth the metal it 's made of .
With the rising cost of metals like copper and zinc , that one red cent is literally putting us in the red .
" It costs almost 1.7 cents to make a penny , " said U.S. Mint director Ed Moy .
Each year , the U.S. Mint makes 8 billion pennies , at a cost of $ 130 million .
American taxpayers lose nearly $ 50 million in the process .
The penny 's not alone .
It costs nearly 10 cents to make a nickel .
On Friday , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he thought the penny should be eliminated , but he admitted that he did n't think it was " politically doable , " and said he was not going to push the issue .
Congress held a hearing last week on a proposal to make both coins out of cheaper metals , even steel .
They say it would save taxpayers more than $ 100 million .
But for now , tossing the penny altogether is not under consideration .
" One reason there is a lasting attachment to those coins is because they are a part of our country 's history , " Moy said .
The penny has plenty of history .
It was the first U.S. coin to feature a president : Abraham Lincoln .
Next year , the mint plans to issue a new penny commemorating the bicentennial of Lincoln 's birth .
That means more pennies for us to pocket .
Plasma speakers have been around in science labs since the 1950s , but that does n't make them any less amazing in the 2000s .
Like a standard speaker , plasma speakers work by creating compression waves in the air .
But unlike a standard speaker that uses magnets and paper / plastic / etc to drive these compressions , plasma speakers are using the non-gas , non-liquid , non-solid " fourth state of matter " plasma .
What can be tough to see in these demonstrations ( the first is the completed setup , the second is an FM - based prototype ) is that pitch is altered by the constantly shifting intensity of the plasma arc ( the creator puts the frequency response range at 200 Hz to 12kHz , and the speaker runs at 50 W ) .

So are these beauts for sale ?
From the creator :
A lot of work to do before I could consider selling - the safety aspect for starters .

Apparently someone needs to send this guy the memo .
The danger is precisely what makes plasma so freaking cool .
Thanks Martin !
Robert Mugabe was desperately attempting to cling to power tonight despite his clear defeat in Zimbabwe 's presidential election by blocking the electoral commission from releasing official results and threatening to treat an opposition claim of victory as a coup .
The Movement for Democratic Change said that what it regards as the overwhelming win by its candidate for president , Morgan Tsvangirai , is " under threat " despite growing support from foreign monitors for its claim of victory .
The party also said it had " security concerns " after a police raid on its election offices today , and Tsvangirai made no public appearances apparently out of concern for his safety .
Mugabe 's spokesman , George Charamba , warned Tsvangirai not to declare himself president because that " is called a coup d'etat and we all know how coups are handled " .
But sources close to the MDC said that the party leadership has put out feelers to the military and elements of the ruling Zanu - PF to try and arrange a peaceful transfer of power .
Independent monitoring groups said that returns posted at about two - thirds of polling stations gave Tsvangirai 55 % of the vote to Mugabe 's 36 % .
The monitors said there is no way now for the president , who even lost in his home territory of Mashonaland as well as other former strongholds , to legitimately win the election .
A third presidential candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with Mugabe , took about 9 % .
Zanu -PF also suffered losses in the parliamentary election with at least nine members of its politburo losing their seats including the vice president , Joice Mujuru , and the defence , information and education ministers .
The MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , said the party was increasingly alarmed at the refusal of the state - run Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to issue any results .
" We are very much concerned by the lack of results from the ZEC .
It appears the regime is at a loss how to respond and is therefore taking its time .
We are really concerned by this assault on democracy .
The primary point of an election is a result .
We think there is a constitutional threat to those results , " he said .
The commission has in the past begun issuing results as soon as they are posted at polling stations , and collated them by constituency for release within hours of the vote .
ZEC 's chairman , George Chiweshe , declined to explain why he was still not issuing results more than 24 hours after the polls closed .
" This is a complicated election and we will release the results when we have them , " he said .
Opposition supporters in some towns , including Bulawayo , Mutare and Masvingo , publicly celebrated but generally Zimbabweans were cautious , not quite believing that Mugabe will leave office after 28 years in power .
With more than 50 % of the vote , Tsvangirai would avoid a run-off election although his proportion might yet fall below the threshold as many of the remaining results are from rural areas where Mugabe traditionally has support .
Biti warned that there was still scope for fraud .
He said his party is still encountering irregularities including the sudden appearance of additional ballot boxes at polling stations where the count has been completed .
He also said that MDC election agents had been prevented from attending the count at several polling stations where the results then showed Zanu - PF doing significantly better than in surrounding areas .
But there was a growing acceptance among foreign monitors and diplomats that Tsvangirai had secured a clear victory over Mugabe .
South African monitors said they believed the opposition had won but would hold off on a public statement until the official results were announced .
The Pan -African parliament observer mission warned against further delays in issuing the results .
A British foreign office minister , Mark Malloch - Brown , said it was " quite likely " that Mugabe had lost despite " massive pre-election day cheating " .
Biti declined to say how the MDC will confront Mugabe if he refuses to give up power .
But he repeated hints that while the MDC would stay within the law it would encourage its supporters to challenge the government on the streets .
" I 'm not going to prescribe a formula for Zimbabweans .
I 'm going to speak for the party I lead .
We 're going to do everything legally and constitutionally , " said Biti .
Kevin Drum ( and Matt Yglesias ) asks an excellent and important question :
Tyler is arguing for keeping the insurance industry
competitive .
But I simply do n’t see what that buys us .
Even if the
health insurance industry were dramatically improved , this would n’t
especially make healthcare any more efficient .
It would only make the
insurance industry more efficient .
That would be nice , but hardly
earthshaking …
Let me be clear : the incentives today are screwy .
Let me also tell you my ideal world .
Insurance companies are judged by honest third party intermediaries .
Insurance companies compete like heck to make customers satisfied .
Insurance companies monitor doctors , read Robin Hanson , and require evidence - based medicine .
Insurance companies which fail at these pursuits either go bankrupt or they must abide by an ex ante contract to permit the exile of their CEOs to Greenland .
Every year prices would fall in real terms , quality would improve , and coverage would be expanded .
Imagine the whole health care sector working like laser eye surgery or cosmetic surgery .
This is not the world we live in , but it is the world we should aim for and I am more than willing to consider how government might get us there .
( Mandating greater price transparency is but one step . )
But if we institute a single - payer system , or highly regulated mandates , we will never have much chance of arriving in that world .
Ever .
We will have a fairly static sector with high coverage levels but rising costs long term and less innovation .
I believe we know why insurance companies do n’t work this way , namely monitoring problems ; they screw you over instead of serving you and they can get away with it .
Go ahead , call me a pollyanna , but modern information technology and measurement can indeed resolve many monitoring problems .
We can now monitor central bank performance quite well or show up in Sicily with a credit card and rent a car .
Neither was the case forty years ago .
Here is one summary of how health insurance companies are improving information technology for claims processing , medicine itself , and promoting evidence - based medicine .
I do n’t mean this industry - supplied link to be a good summary of the current truth ; take it as one vision of what might be possible .
To put the point another way , insurance companies are not just risk assessors or dollar transfer mechanisms ; they also can be monitors and buyer agents and that is why competition is potentially so useful .
The policy point is not : " you must die today so that the reign of Milton Friedman can arrive in forty years ’ time . "
It is more like : " whatever transfers we wish to do today , let us proceed so that such a future remains someday possible . "
Medical care is just starting to cure human beings , so do n’t think the future will look like the past .
I know that preaching the virtues of insurance company competition is not a popular position in the blogosphere but like Arnold Kling , I see the single - payer advocates and mandate advocates as the conservatives , not the visionaries .
Addendum : A month or two ago , one MR reader left a long and very good comment about all the innovations provided by private health insurance companies .
I ca n’t find it , can any of you ?
Please let us know in the comments or email me .
Addendum : Kevin Drum responds .
After a thousand years stuck on a dusty library shelf , the oldest copy of Homer 's Iliad is about to go into digital circulation .
A team of scholars traveled to a medieval library in Venice to create an ultra- precise 3 - D copy of the ancient manuscript – complete with every wrinkle , rip and imperfection – using a laser scanner mounted on a robot arm .
A high - resolution , 3 - D copy of the entire 645 - page parchment book , plus a searchable transcription , will be made available online under a Creative Commons license .
The Venetus A is the oldest existing copy of Homer 's Iliad and the primary source for all modern editions of the poem .
It lives in Venice at the ancient Public Library of St. Mark .
It is easily damaged .
Few people have seen it .
The last photographic copy was made in 1901 .
I was lucky enough to see the manuscript when I went to Venice with my husband , Christopher Blackwell , who is part of a team organized by the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies to photograph and digitize the ancient book .
The idea is " to use our 3 - D data to create a ' virtual book ' showing the Venetus in its natural form , in a way that few scholars would ever be able to access , " says Matt Field , a University of Kentucky researcher who scanned the pages .
" It 's not often that you see this kind of collaboration between the humanities and the technical fields . "
Venice is not the most convenient work site .
All the gear had to come by boat and be carried or dragged up the stairs of the library .
Built in the 1500s , the library has been renovated periodically , but its builders never envisioned a need for big lights , a motorized cradle , 17 computers or wireless internet .
The group set up shop in an upstairs room , using their own electrical cables and adapters to harness the library 's modest power resources .
They covered the window overlooking the Piazzetta San Marco with a black sheet to keep out sunlight that could damage the manuscript .
They placed the book , the size and weight of a giant dictionary , on a custom cradle that holds it steady , and turned the lights down low .
No more than four people were allowed in the room at one time , to keep down heat and humidity .
The conservator turned each page with his hands and set it against a plastic bar , where light air suction held it in place .
The barn doors covering the lights were flung open for the time it took the photographer to snap a shot with a 39 - megapixel digital camera , a Hasselblad H1 medium - format camera with a Phase One P45 digital back .
As each page was photographed , the classics scholar on duty in the hallway outside the workroom would examine its image to make sure all the text was legible .
Then Field scanned each page to create a 3 - D image .
Using an ordinary flatbed scanner was out of the question – it would flatten the delicate parchments .
So Brent Seales , a computer scientist from the University of Kentucky 's Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments , decided to use a laser scanner on a robot arm to make a 3 - D scan of the pages .
Passing about an inch from the surface , the laser rapidly scanned back and forth , painting the page with laser light .
The robot arm knows precisely where in space its " hand " is , creating a precise map of each page as it scans .
The data is fed into a CAD program that renders an image of the manuscript page with all its crinkles and undulations .
" The resolution yields millions of 3 - D points per page , " Seales says .
To store the data , the team used a 1 - terabyte redundant - disk storage system on a high - speed network .
The classicists on duty backed up the data every evening on two 750 - GB drives and on digital tape .
Blackwell carried the hard drives home with him every night , rather than leave the data in the library .
The next step is making the images readable .
The Venetus A is handwritten and contains ligatures and abbreviations that boggle most text - recognition software .
So , this summer a group of graduate and undergraduate students of Greek will gather at the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington , D.C. , to produce XML transcriptions of the text .
Eventually , their work will be posted online for anyone to search , as part of the Homer Multitext Project .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures dropped more than 3 % Tuesday in a broad - based commodities sell - off , as strength in the U.S. dollar exerted heavy selling pressure on the precious metal .
Gold for June delivery tumbled $ 33.70 , or 3.6 % , to close at $ 887.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The precious metal earlier fell to a low of $ 876.30 .
Other metals futures were also sharply lower , with platinum selling off 5.2 % .
The Reuters - Jefferies CRB index , a benchmark barometer gauging the prices of major commodities , fell 0.3 % to 385.58 .
" Everything from cotton to copper and soybeans to silver is off sharply , " said Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers .
" The ever - weakening dollar had prompted many a fund to pile money into the sector since September last year , pushing values of some commodities well beyond fundamentals . "
" But now , as the dollar is staging somewhat of a comeback , even if a temporary one , the niche is being drained of money quite fast , " Nadler said .
With perceptions that the credit freeze might be thawing , hedge funds appear to be turning away from until now ultra - hot commodities , he said .
Zachary Oxman , senior trader at Wisdom Financial , said , " You 're seeing heavy selling pressure and significant technical damage [ in gold prices ] . "
" I 'd look for further selling into the $ 870 level at this time , " Oxman said .
Culminating a tumultuous quarter , the benchmark gold contract lost $ 15 , or 1.6 % , to end Monday 's trading back at $ 921.50 an ounce .
For March as a whole , gold futures lost $ 50.60 -- a drop of 5.2 % .
But for the first quarter , the precious metal still turned in a stellar performance , gaining $ 86.60 an ounce , a 10.3 % increase .
" Given gold 's recent movements , the yellow metal will remain vulnerable to selling pressure in the coming sessions , " said James Moore , analyst at TheBullionDesk.com .
In a research note , Moore cited how the second quarter 's " traditionally weaker than the first due to general market cycles . "
The dollar extended gains Tuesday , gaining more than 2 % against the yen as stocks soared after the Institute for Supply Management 's manufacturing index unexpectedly inched higher , suggesting to some that the U.S. recession could be mild .

The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies , was at 72.615 , up from 71.749 late Monday .
The ISM index rose to 48.6 % in March from 48.3 % in February .
The consensus forecast of estimates collected by MarketWatch was for the index to slip to 47.0 % .

I have about 236 stupid ideas a week , and luckily , I do n't usually act on them .
A couple of summers ago , however , I did .
Here 's what happened .
I was sitting there watching Donald Trump 's " reality " TV show The Apprentice and thinking , jeez , that 's not business .
Maybe it's how TV producers imagine business , but these dumb projects , with the good - looking contestants trying to get passersby to come into a theme restaurant -- what the heck kind of management challenge is that ?
That 's a minimum - wage job !
Usually , the women with the longest legs were the winners .
Well , at least one thing is realistic .
I had four interns that summer creating a new product .
That 's a real business challenge .
So here was my stupid idea :
Why not make a documentary film about it ?
By way of introduction , I should mention that my company , Fog Creek Software , is , indeed , a software company .
We make project - management software for other software developers , not documentary films , so this idea was precisely the kind of monumental distraction that every venture capitalist warns you to avoid like the plague .
There was another problem :
Our interns were chosen for coding skill , not telegenic appeal .
Not only that , computer geeks are extremely unlikely to suffer one of those spectacular emotional meltdowns that make for good television .
But who knows ?
Maybe there was somebody who would want to learn about what software development is really like .
( Hint : Tap , tap , tap .
Tap , tap .
Tap. Click ! )
I found a documentary filmmaker , who filmed the interns from all angles .
The keyboard tapping got a bit boring , so he added some goofy stuff .
With cockroaches .
And canceled dorm parties .
At the end of the summer , he rushed to edit the movie -- which we decided to name Aardvark'd : 12 Weeks With Geeks -- so that we could sell it in time for the holiday rush .
Our idea was that some parents might buy it for kids who were about to graduate from college and begin pursuing a job in software .
We burned 1,000 copies of the DVD and started taking orders ( at $ 20 a pop ) over the Internet .
Within a couple of days , we realized that we had better order another 1,000 .
And then another 1,000 .
Then another 3,000 .
In all , we ended up with about 5,000 orders .
Of course , everyone wanted delivery by December 24 .
And unexpectedly , the orders came in from all over the world .
Our office manager started buying padded envelopes in bulk and printing postage stickers on the Pitney Bowes machine .
I started running huge mail merges to print out shipping labels .
It 's amazing how small problems turn into huge nightmares when you 're shipping thousands of orders to buyers in 60 different countries .
The customs declarations were what caused the biggest problem .
There was this page on the USPS website where you could fill them out online , but it could only handle one at a time , and we had 2,000 international orders .
So I became a software entrepreneur again .
I wrote a little computer program that filled out the webpage automatically and pushed all the right buttons to print the customs form .
Unfortunately , what you got was still a sheet of paper that had to be signed .
And collated .
And then inserted into a plastic sleeve .
I did n't relish the carpal tunnel syndrome that would result from signing all these forms .
We tried to " sign " them by running the forms through the laser printer again to print the signature in the right place .
But , as I learned , something traumatic happens to paper on its way through a printer .
Once a sheet of paper has been through a laser printer , the next time you try to print on it , it 's going to fight back , jamming the printer and resulting in the deaths of three other pages , and you 're going to spend five minutes with a putty knife cleaning up the bloodshed .
There was one printer in our office that had the ability to print twice on the same sheet , so we used that one for the signature overprint .
Murphy 's Law kicked in , and it ran out of toner .
It was a Dell .
Dell does n't let office products stores sell its toner .
The only way to get toner was to order it from Dell and pay a lot of money for overnight delivery .
Meanwhile , it was taking three minutes of work just to ship one DVD .
This was n't going to work .
So I holed up in my office for two days and built a shipping station .
I ordered a laser printer that could print directly on those green customs forms .
I searched the Web to learn what the high - volume shippers used for labels .
I ended up getting a top - of - the - line Zebra printer .
It spews forth labels at unbelievable speed , and even peels off the wax paper backing for you .
For postage , I signed up for an Endicia account , which lets you print specially formatted bar codes instead of stamps .
For software , I wrote my own .
The big parts of the project were laying out packing slips and customs declarations .
Microsoft Access had a built - in report feature that worked perfectly for both :
It 's designed to put things from a database onto paper at the exact locations you need them .
In all , we cut the time to pack a movie from three minutes down to 30 seconds .
Yes , I am that unfocused .
Here I was , the CEO of a bootstrapped software start - up , and instead of making software , I was futzing around creating a custom shipping system .
There are plenty of companies that will do this for you at a reasonable price .
And they 're a heck of a lot better at it than I am .
I should be writing software .
Or selling software .
Or designing software .
Software that our customers need , not software that we need for an in - house , peripheral , inconsequential function like selling a bunch of movies that were already a distraction from our actual product line ( although they did get a lot of attention for Copilot.com , the remote tech - support system the interns were working on ) .
Making the movie was somewhat distracting .
Sometimes when the filmmaker missed something really interesting , he would drag the interns away from their work to stage a reenactment .
To their credit , the interns still managed to get their work done .
But I 'm more understanding now about why reality TV is so morbidly bad .
I 'm still happy we made the movie .
We ended up paying the filmmaker about $ 30,000 .
But DVD sales reached about $ 100,000 , so we made a nice little profit .
And the movie showed how much fun it is to work at Fog Creek , which helps us recruit great computer science students .
And I 'm happy I took the time to build our shipping station because this is what it means to be a bootstrapped company :
You grow slowly and carefully and you take the time to figure everything out .
You build your own tools -- not only to save money , but also so that you can make them exactly the way you want .
Many companies do n't have time for this nonsense .
They 've got investment capital that they use to trade money for time .
They might only get 95 percent quality instead of 100 percent , and it might cost 200 percent more , but who cares :
They 're growing at 963 percent a year !
The good news is , we have no outside investors , so I do n't have to justify crazy projects to anyone .
And here 's the thing : Building the shipping station was probably the most fun I had all year .
Is n't that a good enough reason to do it ?
WASHINGTON / PARIS ( Reuters ) - As U.S. rice futures marched to another record , the U.N. ’s Food and Agriculture Organization exhorted farmers and governments to ensure this year ’s crop is a success in order to ease the growing food crisis .

Increased demand from rapidly developing nations such as China , the use of crops for biofuels , global stocks at 25 - year lows and market speculation are blamed for pushing prices of wheat , corn and rice to record highs .
That in turn has sparked food riots in several African countries , Indonesia and Haiti .
The FAO has said 37 countries face food crises but Director General Jacques Diouf on Wednesday said solutions were available .
“ This is not Greek tragedy where fate is decided by the gods and humans can do nothing about it .
No , we have the ability to influence our futures , ” he told a news conference in Paris .
“ It ’s a good thing that international institutions ... are helping the poor gain access to food , but on our side we need to fight the most important battle today which is to ensure the 2008 farming season is a success . ”
In Tokyo , EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said the World Trade Organization should pressure food - producing countries to maintain exports .
Some nations have banned exports in an attempt to avert domestic shortages .
“ If we restrict trade , we ’re simply going to add food scarcity to the already large problems of food shortages that exist in different countries , ” Mandelson said in an interview .
“ The WTO stands for free trade .
It needs to exert its pressure and influence to reduce tariffs and thereby encourage trade .
It ’s also got to stand up against export restrictions , export taxes , which too will stop the free flow of trade in foodstuffs and agricultural produce . ”
Prices of rice , a staple in most of Asia , have risen 68 percent since the start of 2008 .
In Chicago , July rough rice futures soared 2.3 percent on Wednesday to a record $ 24.85 per hundredweight .
“ Some of the main rice producing countries have imposed export curbs ... and this has combined with low global stocks to drive rice higher , ” said Kenji Kobayashi , a grains analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo .
In the latest sign that fears of a rice shortage are rippling around the world , Wal - Mart Stores Inc ’s Sam ’s Club warehouse said on Wednesday it was limiting sales of several types of rice .
On Tuesday , Costco Wholesale Corp , the largest U.S. warehouse club operator , said it has seen increased demand for rice and flour as worried customers stock up .
Trade bans on rice have been imposed by India , the world ’s second - largest exporter in 2007 , and Vietnam , the third - biggest , in hopes of cooling domestic prices .
In Thailand , the world ’s largest rice exporter , farmers have planted a rare third crop and are expected to reap another 1.6 million tons of rice paddy this year .
FOOD SPURS DOHA
Diouf said the Rome - based FAO had been signaling the dangers for years .
“ The situation we are in is the result of inappropriate policies over the past 20 years .
Between 1990 and 2000 we lowered food aid for agriculture by half . ”
Generous farm subsidies in wealthy countries had also discouraged agriculture in the developing world , he said .
“ We have lacked two things : the political will and resources .
I hope that this current crisis will give us the political will and the resources to do things . ”
Mandelson said concerns over food and global financial turmoil were spurring progress in the Doha round of WTO talks to liberalize world trade .
The next ministerial meeting on the Doha round may be held in late May or June .
Already one of the poorest countries in the world , Afghanistan has been struggling to cope with higher prices .
President Hamid Karzai ’s government has allocated $ 50 million to buy food from neighbors , a spokesman said .
But many Afghans were unmoved and blamed the government .
“ What should we eat ?
How can a poor man afford to buy food ? ” asked Kamaluddin Khan , out shopping in Kabul on Wednesday .
“ Mr. Karzai sits in his palace and does n’t know what is going on . ”
( The following blog / article was published in The Nation newspaper on March 1 .
Here below , however , is the originally un-edited submission )
Thailand is universally infamous for many a thing , besides its scamming gem shops , dangerous billboards , never - ending plastic bags , drunken cops , pick - pocketing ladyboys , pictures of dead bodies , rabid stray dogs , dodgy beggars and uncovered manholes , there is , and last but not least , it ’s women .
I ’m certainly not going to argue that such a fine species is perfect beyond belief or that every one is a deliciously honest darling , but there are , in general , a rather nicer breed of individual than that perceived by a lot of Farangs , including those who have never even stepped in the country .
According to some newspaper reports , websites , Internet forums and barstools , Thai women are nothing but , scheming promiscuous gold - diggers who view Farang guys as dumb classless walking ATMs .
So , with that said , let me take the opportunity , just for once , to give Thai women a bit of a break and see their ‘ side of things ’
I can’t find any clear statistics , but from what I ’ve read and heard , there sees to be a frightening percentage of marriage failures between Farang blokes and Thai women – the latter of which nearly always gets the blame ( including ever pleading mothers ) .
It is quite obvious that two of the significant factors behind such catastrophic break - ups is ‘ cultural misunderstanding ’ and generalized myths circulated by some of the ever - knowledgeable Farangs themselves .
Let ’s have a look at one of the matters which often leads to the beginning of the end – the marriage dowry .
Do n’t get me wrong like , there are plenty of scheming
Thai mothers out there hoping to acquire as much cash as is heavenly possible out of their the son - in - law wanna - bes , but there are more than enough honest ones who prefer to just adhere to modern - day tradition .
More than your fair share of Farangs either choke on their coffee at the prospect of having to give one or rant and rave in refusal , but much of the time it ’s all simply a ‘ cultural misunderstanding ’ .
We ’ve all heard that classic one of ‘ it ’s just a matter of saving face ’ but we seldom hear Farangs explaining to each other that getting married in Thailand ( the Thai verb for marry ‘ taeng - ngarn ’ literally means ‘ to make a party ’ ) is a combining of two families and not just the two romantic lovers ..
When you get married here , what ’s mostly yours is hers and what ’s hers is yours .
And with that said , if the guy pays any kind of dowry ( which may be excepted and pocketed – some , half or all of it ) then you can be rest assured that one day you ’ll be receiving something in return ; be it land , big shares in dad ’s business , grandmother ’s old house or a herd of buffalo .
Depending of course , on what kind of family you wish to marry into .
Like I said , a lotta Farang geezers throw a frenzy when toothless mother - in - law asks for a substantial amount , but they fail to realize that if they had n’t perhaps been so extravagant prior to the engagement , mother would n’t have ended up being so ‘ greedy ’ .
I think quite a few Thais would like to tell the Farangs that ‘ if you wanna show off how rich you are to everyone in the village ’ then it can be guaranteed that in adhering to the Thai sense of ‘ face ’ mum ’s gonna want to ‘ show off ’ a big sum of greenbacks on the morning of the engagement on wedding day .
Let ’s have a look next at some of the well - told myths about Thai women and start with this awful one ‘ Proper Thai women do n’t want a Farang as a boyfriend ’ .
Shiver - me - timbers , but ‘ proper ’
Thai women have been marrying Farang ever since the first Portuguese arrived .
All right , there are old - fashioned Thai grannies who would n’t want their granddaughters marrying some scruffy - looking Farang , but to stick them all the same boat is bewildering generalization .
Next up , how about this one ?
‘ All Thai women only like Farang for his cash ’ .
Well , if you decide to marry into a poor rural family say , then by Gove , your wife will certainly be expecting you to flash some cash and when she does , you have know right to complain .
You should have realized that from the start , there are a million blogs on the Internet written about such experiences .
Another , quite derogatory myth , is this one ‘ All Thai women want a Farang husband so they can move to the West ’ .
Again , what a load of old cobblers .
Then again , if you are a fan of such websites hooking you up with ‘ lovely Thai brides ’ you can be forgiven for your irrational perception .
Of course , it simply depends on the woman , there are plenty of Thai women here whose ambition in life is not to wake up to the smell of black pudding and fried bread
Let me turn my attention to frivolous but quite important cultural differences , which looking from some Farangs ’ way of thinking , may look bad on Thai women .
“ I ’ve been dating this girl lately but wherever we go she always brings her friend ” .
Well , the reason for that buddy , is probably she ’s still a bit afraid of you ; she ’s also following a kind of Thai tradition .
Next , “ I do n’t know what she really thinks about me , she does n’t show me any affection and especially not in public ” .
Well , sounds like she ’s a decent enough women , Thais do n’t exactly appreciate watching two lovers snogging each other on street corners like high school kids in Farangland .
Thai women show their affection in a much more subtle , hard to detect , kind of way .
Or “ How come when I offer a woman out on date to a disco , she always turns me down .
Again , a simple cultural difference , your average Thai women would prefer to go to the cinema .
“ My girlfriend is so funny , every time we go the seaside she keeps out of the sun and splashes on a whole bottle of sun lotion ” .
Now , Farang guys always laugh about Thai women and their fascination for fair - skin .
We all have to realize however , that Thais think we are just as weird for our obsession of ‘ getting a tan ’ ; lying on a beach all day ignorant to the threat of skin cancer .
Joke about Thai women and their whitening lotion but do n’t forget that the major companies who produce them also sell darkening lotion in Farangland .
And , “ When I ’m not happy about something and complain to a Thai , my girlfriend never sticks up for me ” .
Probably not , I think a lot of Thai women get completely bored of their Farang boyfriends constant bickering usually ending with the typical “ Well , in my country , it would n’t be like this blah blah … ”
You have to realize that most
Thais are proud of their country and get tired of Farangs who compare all the time to how things are ‘ back home ’ , often in an extremely negative way .
Ok , sure , a lot of the times it ’s perfectly fair to raise your voice , us Farangs do have to admit that we moan a lot .
Thais do n’t do it a lot , so that again is just a cultural difference .
There are even different culturally spoken mis-understandings .
“ She must like me , she was asking where my apartment was and if I lived with any woman ” .
Ha…what a joke !
While this elderly guy thinks that some hot honey of 25 fancies him , he is completely oblivious to the fact that Thai women do ask such questions out of normality – they are not Farangs .
It ’s like the other way around when the Thai woman says “ You look fatter now ” ; while he is furious at such an insult , she is thinking that him putting on a bit of weight has actually done him a bit of good .
Anyway , things have certainly improved in regards to ‘ culturally mis-understanding
Thai women over the past decade and even a lot of the old scary myths are being squashed .
Let ’s just hope that things will continue to do so and even speed up .
Not forgetting to mention of course , this article could also be written completely in vice - versa .
Hillary is , as you know , bashing Obama for being “ too liberal . ”
Forget for a moment that Hillary is now parroting the Republican ’s number one blood libel they throw at Democrats , let ’s look for a moment at why Hillary is calling Obama liberal .
She ’s doing it because of a National Journal “ study ” released a while back .
The study purports to look at whose the most “ liberal ” member of Congress .
And in the Senate , they found that Obama was the most liberal .
So , I decided to look at National Journal ’s study and check out some examples of what makes a member of Congress liberal .
You ’re going to love this .
( Note that it ’s not clear which way you have to swing on this legislation to be “ liberal , ” but either way , these things have nothing to do with being liberal or conservative ) :
Legislation that makes you a “ liberal ” according to the National Journal ( and apparently Hillary ) :
Establish a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators .
( So now ethics is liberal ? )
Table an amendment that would require the Homeland Security Department to screen 100 percent of cargo containers entering the country within five years .
( Is screening for Osama ’s nukes liberal or conservative ? )
Approve the fiscal 2008 budget resolution .
Create a national action plan for reducing oil consumption by 35 percent by 2030 .
( Bush has advocated decreasing our dependence on foreign oil . )
Limit debate on an energy bill setting higher fuel standards for vehicles .
( John Dingell , Democrat , is the lead member of Congress opposed to this . )
Increase financial aid for college students and reduce subsidies for student - loan lenders .
( Student aid is liberal ? )
Approve legislation reauthorizing and expanding the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
( This legislation was bipartisan and I seem to recall Hillary saying she created this program ( which is a lie ) ) .
Approve fiscal 2008 appropriations for the Labor , Health and Human Services , and Education departments .
Limit debate on a measure expressing no confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
( That ’s partisan , not liberal . )
Block individuals from serving on Food and Drug Administration drug advisory panels if they have conflicts of interest .
( Again , ethics is liberal ? )
IRBIL , Iraq ( AP )  Vice President Dick Cheney played the part of backroom power broker for two days and came away on Tuesday with pledges from Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds to firm up a new blueprint for U.S. - Iraq relations that will stretch beyond the Bush presidency .
Cheney flew in a cargo plane to Iraqi Kurdistan in the north to finish two days of private meetings with powerful politicians in Iraq .
On Monday , he had talks with officials in Baghdad -- even venturing outside the secured Green Zone to dine and have private discussions .
Topics ranged from security in Iraq to Iran 's rising influence in Mideast , but a key item was about crafting a long - term agreement between the U.S. and Iraq , plus a narrower deal to define the legal basis for continued U.S. troop presence .
The deal would take the place of a U.N. Security Council resolution that expires in December , the same time Bush will be packing up to leave office .
The administration says the deal will not seek permanent U.S. bases in Iraq or codify troop levels , nor tie the hands of a future commander in chief as some Democrats fear
Administration officials say they probably will not seek Senate approval of the plan because the agreement will not be a treaty that provides Iraq with specific security guarantees .
This position has prompted a backlash in Congress , where Democrats have proposed legislation that would render the agreement null and void without the Senate 's blessing .
Democrats and some Republicans have questioned whether the 2002 authorization of force in Iraq still applies legally because it referred to the need to get rid of Saddam Hussein and eliminate the threat of weapons of mass destruction .
Since the 2003 invasion , Hussein has been captured and executed , and no weapons of mass destruction were ever found .
Cheney advisers said that President Jalal Talabani , a Kurd , made clear on Monday that even though the Kurds have a seniautonomous region in northern Iraq , they were completely committed to making the area work within an Iraqi state .
Cheney was warmly greeted in Irbil by Massoud Barzani , head of the regional administration in the semiautonomous Kurdish area .
" We are certainly counting on President Barzani 's leadership to help us conclude a new strategic relationship between the United States and Iraq , as well as to pass crucial pieces of national legislation in the months ahead , " Cheney said .
Barzani said the Kurds are committed to being " part of the solution , and not part of the problem . "
" I would like to reiterate our commitment that we will continue to play a positive role in order to build a new Iraq _ an Iraq with a foundation of a great federal , democratic , pluralistic , free Iraq , " Barzani said .
Cheney spent Monday night at Balad Air Base , northwest of Baghdad .
On Tuesday morning , before he headed to northern Iraq , he spoke at an outdoor troop rally , saying that as long as freedom is suppressed in the Mideast , the region will remain a place of " stagnation , resentment and violence ready for export . "
Later in the day , Cheney flew to Oman , continuing his 10 - day trip to the Mideast , which will include visits to Saudi Arabia , Israel , the Palestinian territory and Turkey .

RAT CELLS ’ immune response has been switched on and off with a magnetic field – a technique that could control treatment of allergies and other illnesses more precisely .

How Valid Are T.V. Weather Forecasts ?
A gentleman named J.D. Eggleston recently wrote to us with a rather interesting report , a nice piece of D.I.Y .
Freakonomics concerning the accuracy of local T.V. weather forecasts .
I thought it was interesting enough to post in its entirety here on the blog , and I hope you agree .
Before we get to the report itself , here is a little background information from Eggleston himself :
I live with my wife and two kids , 15 and 12 , in rural northwest Missouri .
I earned a bachelor ’s in electronics engineering technology from DeVry University in 1987 .
I ’ve been an electronics engineer , software engineer , and for the past 13 years I ’ve owned and operated a consumer electronics retail business .
I ’ve always loved math and statistics and the information that can be learned from studying them .
Growing up , I was told that people like me were called “ weird . ”
Since reading Freakonomics , I now know they are called “ economists . ”
It ’s good to know I ’m not alone .
The forecasting study began in April of 2007 when my fifth - grade daughter was given a school assignment to monitor the temperature and rainfall at our home for a week .
Our family members are big T.V. watchers , and our house is loaded with the latest D.V.R. ( digital video recorder ) technology .
So we decided to document not only the weather results at our home , but also to record the 10 p.m. newscasts for channels 4 , 5 , 9 , and 41 and compare our home results to those reported by the Kansas City T.V. stations .
And while we were at it , we decided to also document each station ’s weather predictions and compare them to the actual results to see if one station was better than the others .
For a non-T.V. weather source , we also recorded the predictions of the federal government ’s National Weather Service each evening .
And now for the report .
The takeaway message ?
Do not plan your weekend activities based on the T.V. weather forecasts unless it is already Thursday — but waiting until Friday would be even better .
How Valid Are T.V. Weather Forecasts ?
A Guest Post
By J.D. Eggleston
The authors of Freakonomics posed the question , “ Do real estate agents have your best interests at heart ? ”
Then they statistically showed they ( the real estate agents ) do not .
So what about meteorologists ?
How accurate are their forecasts ?
Do they even care ?
A seven - month study of weather forecasting at Kansas City television stations was conducted over 220 days , from April 22 to November 21 , 2007 .
The seven - day forecasts for both high temperature and P.O.P. ( probability of precipitation ) for each station ’s 10 p.m. telecast and from the N.O.A.A .
Web site were recorded .
For stations that did not offer a P.O.P. in the form of percent likelihood , the best impression of percent likelihood that could be inferred from the meteorologists ’ words and graphics were used .
The results of Kansas City ’s high temperature and rainfall as reported at the K.C.I. airport weather station — which are the data that become the official record for weather at Kansas City — were also recorded .
Those results were then compared to the high temperature and P.O.P. predictions to determine forecasting accuracy for each source for each of the seven days predicted .
The results were quite enlightening , as were some of the comments of the local meteorologists and their station managers .
Here a few of the quotes we received :
“ We have no idea what ’s going to happen [ in the weather ] beyond three days out . ”
“ There ’s not an evaluation of accuracy in hiring meteorologists .
Presentation takes precedence over accuracy . ”
“ All that viewers care about is the next day .
Accuracy is not a big deal to viewers . ”
Temperature
All of the chief meteorologists were asked , “ How close does your high - temperature prediction have to be to the actual temperature for you to feel like you did a good job ? ”
Without exception , all of the meteorologists answered , “ within three degrees . ”
The chart above shows the results of the stations ’ temperature prediction accuracy for their full seven - day forecasts .
For next day predicting ( one day out ) , all stations met their “ within three degrees ” goal .
For two days out , all but one was within three degrees .
But for three days out and beyond , none of the forecasters met their three - degree benchmark , and in fact get linearly worse each day .
The conclusion to be drawn here is not so much that one station is better than another , since all of them seem to be similar in accuracy — and most people wo n’t alter their plans based on a couple degrees of temperature .
Rather , all of our stations did not do a good job by their own definition of plus / minus three degrees beyond two days out .
Getting It Right the First Time
When we get our first predictions for , say , June 13th , it will be the seventh day of a seven - day forecast made on June 6th .
The following day , it will be the sixth day out , then the fifth , then fourth , and so on until it is tomorrow ’s forecast .
Have you ever noticed that the prediction for a particular day keeps changing from day to day , sometimes by quite a bit ?
The graph above shows how much the different stations change their minds about their own forecasts over a seven - day period .
On average , N.O.A.A. is the most consistent , but even they change their mind by more than six degrees and 23 percent likelihood of precipitation over a seven - day span .
The Kansas City television meteorologists will change their mind from 6.8 to nearly nine degrees in temperature and 30 percent to 57 percent in precipitation , showing a distinct lack of confidence in their initial predictions as time goes on .
The prize for the single most inconsistent forecast goes to Channel 5 ’s Devon Lucie who on Sunday , September 30th predicted a high temperature of 53 degrees for October 7th , and seven days later changed it to 84 degrees — a difference of 31 degrees !
It turned out to be 81 that day .
A close second was Channel 4 ’s Mike Thompson ‘s initial prediction of 83 for October 15th , which he changed to 53 just two days later .
It turned out to be 64 on the 15th .
Even more conclusively than the temperature accuracy graph , this prediction variance graph shows that 21st century meteorology is not developed enough to provide a week of accurate temperature forecasting .
Meteorologists take a blind stab at what the high temperature and rain possibilities might be seven days out , and then adjust their predictions on the fly as the week goes on .
As mentioned earlier , one meteorologist told us : “ We have no idea what ’s going to happen beyond three days out . ”
Will It Rain ?
Precipitation will affect the average person ’s plans more significantly than temperature .
We rely on meteorologists to be accurate in their rainfall predictions so we can plan the events of our lives .
Parades , gardening , ball games , outdoor work , car washing , construction work and farming are all affected — positively or negatively — by rain .
We could just assume it will not rain , but it would be nice to have a little heads - up .
In measuring precipitation accuracy , the study assumed that if a forecaster predicted a 50 percent or higher chance of precipitation , they were saying it was more likely to rain than not .
Less than 50 percent meant it was more likely to not rain .
That prediction was then compared to whether or not it actually did rain , where “ rain ” is defined as one - tenth of an inch or more of rainfall reported at K.C.I .
Anything less than that is so irrelevant , it would likely make no difference in people ’s lives .
The graph above shows that stations get their precipitation predictions correct about 85 percent of the time one day out and decline to about 73 percent seven days out .
On the surface , that would not seem too bad .
But consider that if a meteorologist always predicted that it would never rain , they would be right 86.3 percent of the time .
So if a viewer was looking for more certainty than just assuming it will not rain , a successful meteorologist would have to be better than 86.3 percent .
Three of the forecasters were about 87 percent at one day out — a hair over the threshold for success .
Other than that , no forecaster is ever better than just assuming it wo n’t rain .
If you think that ’s bad , sadly it gets worse :
The data for the precipitation accuracy graph was taken from all days of the study .
For many of those summer days it was clearly obvious there would be no rain , and thus those days were no challenge for the meteorologists .
A better measure of a forecaster ’s skill would be to exclude the days when there was clearly no chance of rain .
After all , if you wanted to measure a golfer ’s putting skill , you would not have him putt his test putts from only six inches away from the cup .
You would want to challenge him with putts from five to fifteen feet — putts that could readily be made or missed .
For that type of meteorologist test , we only included the days that it either rained or the meteorologist predicted it would rain , thus eliminating the days where it clearly was not going to rain .
The following graph shows the results .
Because conditions for rain on these days were more likely and more challenging to predict , we lowered our benchmark for success on this test from 86.3 percent to 50 percent .
Sadly , four of the five stations topped the 50 percent goal only on their next - day forecast .
For all days beyond the next day out , viewers would be better off flipping a coin to predict rainfall than trusting the stations on days where rain was possible .
Oddly , N.O.A.A. — which had been one of the better forecasters in our other evaluations — was the worst in this one , especially when predicting three days out and beyond .
When N.O.A.A. meteorologist Noelle Runyan was questioned about this , she stated , “ Our forecasts are more conservative than the television stations .
We raise our P.O.P. predictions to over 50 percent only when we are sure of rain . ”
This statement and the data above are another illustration of how — with the data and tools given to them — today ’s meteorologists cannot confidently predict the weather beyond three days out .
Second Fiddles
Have you ever wondered if the forecast you get from the weekend meteorologist or vacation replacement is as good as from the chief meteorologist ?
Many people do , so on July 5th , comparisons of the accuracy of each station ’s chief meteorologist to their weekend replacements were made .
Because this comparison did not start to be made until July 5th , the numbers shown in the table below may not match the numbers published for station - to - station comparison in other parts of this report .
For each of the lines below , the top name is a station ’s chief meteorologist , and the second line is their back up .
Here is how the individual meteorologists fared .
At Channel 4 , Mike Thompson ’s weekend man is Joe Lauria .
From the table above , we can see that Lauria is actually much better than Thompson in temperature accuracy from about .5 to 2.5 degrees better across the seven - day range .
Regarding precipitation , Thompson is slightly better than Lauria one or two days out , but Lauria is more accurate three to seven days out , and on the challenging days .
At Channel 5 , Katie Horner ‘s weekend replacement is Devon Lucie .
As with Channel 4 , it appears Channel 5 ’s weekend forecasts are more accurate for both temperature and precipitation , but only slightly .
At Channel 9 , Pete Grigsby is the weekend man for Bryan Busby .
Here , Busby is better at precipitation and at one to three days out on temperature .
Grigsby is better four to seven days out on temperature .
Channel 41 ’s weekend weatherman is Jeremy Nelson .
When it comes to temperature , Nelson is not as good as Lezak one or two days out , but is better than Lezak longer range .
For precipitation , both are pretty even .
The New and Improved Weather
Back in the 1990 ’s in an episode of the television show L.A. Law , a nerdy but effective meteorologist sued his former employer because they fired him and hired a comedian to do the weather .
While none of Kansas City ’s meteorologists are uneducated , stand - up comics , there does seem to be an unfortunate emphasis of style over substance .
When station managers were asked about this , one said , “ There ’s not an evaluation of accuracy in hiring meteorologists .
Presentation takes precedence over accuracy . ”
And when discussing accuracy ( or the lack thereof ) of a seven - day forecast , another station manager stated , “ All viewers care about is the next day .
Accuracy is not a big deal to viewers . ”
When weather events occur that really are news — flooding , tornadoes , ice storms — all of the Kansas City meteorologists do an excellent job of informing their viewers , as do most forecasters across the country .
Likewise , the stations allow their meteorologists ample time to report these serious weather events , be it in their 5 , 6 , or 10 p.m. telecasts , or by interrupting regular programming when necessary .
One of the two major weaknesses in television meteorology today is the “ non-event ” days — the boring , run -of - the - mill days when no significant weather events are upcoming .
It is unfortunate that 13 percent of each news telecast ( actually about 20 percent if you discount the commercials ) is dedicated to a weather forecast that is mostly time - consuming fluff .
The meat of such forecasts could easily be condensed to one minute or less , or maybe even a crawl at the bottom of the screen that runs for the full telecast .
Reduction of the weather segment on days when there is no weather news would allow for more thorough reporting of world , national , and local news .
The other major weakness is that ratings drive television .
Sadly , the data show that stations are so consumed with ratings that accuracy in weather predictions takes an irrelevant back seat to snappy patter and charm .
When directly asked if accuracy mattered in forecasting , every station manager and meteorologist said it did .
But when asked what steps they had taken to measure and ensure accuracy , they were without answers .
No meteorologist or television station kept records of what they predicted , nor compared their predictions to actual results over a long term .
No meteorologist posts their accuracy statistics on their résumé .
No station managers use accuracy statistics in the hiring or evaluation of their meteorologists .
Instead , the focus is on charm , charisma , and presentation .
Their words say they care about accuracy , but their actions say they do not .
Yet , they wish to continue providing inaccurate seven - day forecasts that are no more than a semi-educated shot in the dark because a ) their competitors do and b ) they can get away with it since they think the public does not know how inaccurate they are .
Until the public demands change in the form of lost ratings from this hollow practice of “ placebo forecasting , ” T.V. weather forecasts will continue to blow smoke up our … upper - level - lows .
Until this change comes to pass , we must take what we see on T.V. with a grain ( or perhaps block ) of salt .
And if you really want to know what weather will occur in Kansas City tomorrow , find out what happened in Denver today .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The CIA used a widely condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding on three suspects captured after the September 11 attacks , CIA Director Michael Hayden told Congress on Tuesday .

“ Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees , ” Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee .
It was the first time a U.S. official publicly specified the number of people subjected to waterboarding and named them .
Critics call waterboarding a form of illegal torture .
Congress is considering banning the technique .
Those subjected to waterboarding were suspected September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , Hayden said at the hearing on threats to the United States .
He said waterboarding has not been used in five years .
“ The circumstances are different than they were in late 2001 , early 2002 , ” Hayden said .
“ Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent .
In addition to that , my agency ... had limited knowledge about al Qaeda and its workings .
Those two realities have changed . ”
Hayden told reporters later that the interrogations of Mohammed and Zubaydah were particularly fruitful .
From the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they were delivered to Guantanamo Bay prison in 2006 , the two suspects accounted for one - fourth of the human intelligence reports on al Qaeda , Hayden said .
Some analysts have questioned Mohammed ’s credibility under interrogation .
But Hayden said most of the information was reliable and helped lead to other al Qaeda suspects .
He told the committee he opposed limiting the CIA to using interrogation techniques permitted in the U.S. Army Field Manual , which bans waterboarding .
CIA interrogators are better trained , and the agency works with a narrower range of suspects in its interrogations , he said .
HARSH TACTICS
Hayden said fewer than 100 people had been held in the CIA ’s terrorism detention and interrogation program launched after the September 11 attacks , with fewer than one - third of them subjected to any harsh interrogation techniques .
But applying the field manual ’s limitations to the CIA , he said , “ would substantially increase the danger to America . ”
The CIA is the only U.S. agency that uses harsh interrogation techniques , National Intelligence Director Michael McConnell told the hearing .
The entire military adheres to the Army Field Manual and FBI Director Robert Mueller told the hearing his agency does not use coercive techniques .
A senior intelligence official said after the hearing that it was unclear whether the CIA could legally use waterboarding in the future , given changes in U.S. law .
The Bush administration says it neither uses nor condones torture .
The CIA said in December that it had destroyed videotapes depicting the interrogations of Zubaydah and Nashiri , prompting a Justice Department investigation .
