London ( AFP ) May 17 , 2007
The United States is attempting to weaken parts of a proposed G8 communique on the threat posed by climate change , the Financial Times reported on Thursday .
It said that the United States objected to all references to a scientific prediction that " beyond a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius , risks from climate change will be largely unmanageable . "
The United States was also opposed to references to a need for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change , as well as any mention of the United Nations .
G8 leaders are due to meet in Germany on June 6 - 8 .
The Financial Times also said Washington had tried to weaken the draft document in relation to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released earlier this year .
US officials were also trying to replace a paragraph stating G8 leaders were " deeply concerned about the latest scientific findings confirmed by the IPCC " with : " We take note of the recent assessment of the IPCC that warming of the climate system is occurring . "

A few years ago , a delightfully surreal movie came out called Kitchen Stories , in which a team of 1950s Swedish home economists crossed the border en masse and installed themselves in the kitchens of Norwegian bachelors .
Their objective was to analyse domestic routines , in a very Scandinavian quest to maximise the efficiency of " the modern housewife " .
The film 's defining image was of a strait - laced Swede with a clipboard sitting in the corner of a kitchen , studying a Norwegian making his breakfast .
Kitchen Stories was only a mild exaggeration of actual studies carried out in Sweden .
Today , half a century on , it 's no great stretch to imagine the people from Ikea doing the same when they were devising BoKlok .
BoKlok ( pronounced " book look " , Swedish for " smart living " ) is Ikea 's biggest idea yet .
Having seized the market for affordable home furnishings in the past decade , the Swedish retail giant is now planning to provide the homes themselves .
They 've already built some 3,500 BoKlok dwellings across Scandinavia - and now they 're coming to the UK .
Last month , planning permission was approved for the first British BoKlok development : 36 flats in St James Village , Gateshead , due for completion by the end of the year .
Each apartment , with two or three bedrooms , is expected to cost less than £ 100,000 .
More will follow - many more , probably , since BoKlok is quick to build , energy efficient and aimed at households earning between £ 15,000 and £ 30,000 a year .
Who 's to stop them ?
Jokes about homebuyers being handed a pile of flatpack boxes and one of those fiddly little Allen keys are greeted with forced " have n't heard that one before " smiles at BoKlok 's HQ in Malmo .
" Yes , we get a lot of that , even though they 're built in factories by skilled craftsmen , " says Ewa Magnusson , BoKlok 's marketing manager .
BoKlok , she explains , is actually a joint venture between Ikea and the Swedish construction giant Skanska , and is being built under licence in the UK by Live Smart@Home , a subsidiary of the Home property group .
Expansion into the UK is a big step for BoKlok , but a logical one .
It was conceived in 1996 in response to similar housing conditions to those of present - day UK : demand outstripping supply , rising prices , not enough homes being built at the affordable end of the market .
Initially , the BoKlok team turned not to architects but to researchers .
They tracked trends in the dwindling size of the average Swedish household , and identified the model BoKlok homeowner : a female single parent with one child , no car and an average income .
They then studied how much she could afford in rent , and set their budgets accordingly .
Surveys conducted at Ikea stores across Sweden revealed their potential customers ' housing priorities : the desire to live in secure , small - scale surroundings ; proximity to the countryside ; contact with neighbours ; and homes that were light , well - planned , functional and furnished with natural materials .
BoKlok homes do n't exactly come in flatpacks , but they 're not far off .
The timber - framed buildings are almost entirely prefabricated .
They are usually brought to the site on the back of trucks as pre-assembled units , like Portakabins , with the interiors already fitted out .
Each apartment is made up of two of these units , which are simply moved into position by crane .
Put on the roof and exterior wall cladding , plumb and wire it in , and it 's ready to live in .
The typical BoKlok arrangement is an L - shaped , two - storey block with three apartments on each floor .
One such block can be put up in a day .
It sounds crudely straightforward , but the underlying design principles appear rock solid .
Each apartment gets windows on three sides .
On site , the L shape is often extended into a U , with a low - rise building containing storage space for each dwelling , thus creating a semi-enclosed courtyard .
Each block , Magnusson explains , also gets its own apple tree - " something they can take care of together " - and what she describes as a " conceptual bench " , a place outdoors where neighbours can meet .
The bestselling BoKlok design in Sweden has an exterior of blood - red weatherboard , square white windows and a pitched roof ; it would n't look out of place in a typical Swedish town .
There is a limited choice of colour and cladding types , plus national variations .
Danish ones are dressed more fashionably , for example , with black cladding and steel balconies , and they have found it easier to build straight blocks rather than L - shaped ones on Norway 's hilly terrain .
The one in Malmo that Magnusson takes me to , though , looks anonymously modern , with plain white walls , tall windows , wooden balconies and walkways .
Typically , it is situated among other housing types in a suburb of the city .
Initially , BoKlok sold its apartments out of Ikea stores , but they were so popular that people camped outside for two days to get one - hardly the sort of thing a single mother was likely to be able to do .
So now the company chooses the residents by lottery , making the mix of tenants random : plenty of single parents , but also elderly people who have moved out of bigger houses , young couples and families .
The residents are mostly at work when we visit , and , what with the immature planting around the houses , it feels a little stark and empty .
But , sure enough , there 's the young apple tree in the courtyard and the " conceptual bench " .
It looks just like a real bench .
Inside , the apartments are hardly generous in terms of floor area , but higher - than - average ceilings allow for larger windows and the impression of space .
" They can be changed in many ways , " Magnusson says .
" You do n't want to go into the neighbour 's living room and see an exact replica of your own . "
Engineered wood floors , tiled bathrooms , open - plan living spaces , fitted Ikea kitchens - they 're not unlike the homes you see in Ikea catalogues , but then , each new BoKlok owner does receive an Ikea gift voucher as a housewarming present .
Homeowners are also grilled on what exactly they like and do n't like about their new homes after they 've settled in , so that BoKlok can get it even more right next time .
For example , in response to comments about noise , the gravel on the footpaths has given way to a finer grade .
Such research - led design tends to generate mixed feelings .
It may offer domestic solutions , but also suggests a depressingly mechanistic view of humanity , hinting at a monotonous one - size - fits - all suburban future .
At what point does responding to society 's needs become a form of social engineering ?
Needless to say , BoKlok 's brains have grappled with the conundrum .
For one thing , they have been careful not to swamp the market .
In Malmo , there are two more BoKlok sites - but in other areas of the city .
The apartment blocks are built in groups of no more than seven , making 42 units .
" We 're constantly improving the designs , and there are new versions coming up , so you should n't get too many of the same design in one place , " says Magnusson .
" When you come home , you should be able to recognise your house immediately . "
The same concerns could well apply to Britain , where Live Smart@Home plans to roll out " hundreds if not thousands " of BoKlok homes to achieve the necessary economies of scale .
After the initial 36 apartments , another 117 terraced BoKlok houses are planned for the Gateshead site , laid out in a more conventional street arrangement , and costing £ 120,000 - £ 150,000 .
Additional UK sites will be announced this year ( Glasgow looks set to be the next ) .
" We 'd be hugely disappointed if we did n't become a major provider of housing in the UK , " says Alan Prole , managing director of Live Smart@Home .
" That is our intent . "
The BoKlok apartments in Gateshead will be neither stark , white and modernist , nor Swedish pastiche .
They will be more contemporary , more detailed in their facades , says Prole , although the internal layouts will be fundamentally the same .
" We 've almost taken every single component apart and put it back together to make it suitable for the UK .
We are taking significant input , but keeping an intrinsically Scandinavian flair to it . "
Is Britain ready for Scandinavian living ?
The question is redundant , says Prole , pointing to the way Ikea already dominates the UK's home furnishing market with a mere 15 stores .
" It 's not just a retail outlet , it is more of a lifestyle or a culture - which is why people go there .
Because there is that strong association [ with Ikea ] , people can see the lifestyle they 'll be buying into .
But they also see Scandinavian style as being greener and more liberal , more community - based .
Certainly , those are elements we are encouraging . "
Faced with the alternative , a red - brick terraced Wimpey or Barratt home , buyers are likely to see the appeal of BoKlok .
Even if the Wimpeys and Barratts are upping their game and exploring similar affordable , sustainable options , they face a run for their money .
You can now find an Ikea glass , bookshelf or shower curtain in practically every British home .
It may not be long before you 'll find a BoKlok development in every British town .
Dissecting shared libraries
Get to know your shared library
Shared libraries are a fundamental component for the efficient use of space and resources on a modern UNIX ® system .
The C library on a SUSE 9.1 system is made up of about 1.3 MB .
A copy of that library for every program in /usr / bin ( and I have 2,569 ! ) would take up a couple of gigabytes of space .
Of course this number is inflated -- statically linked programs would incorporate only those parts of the library that they use .
Nonetheless , the amount of space tied up by all those duplicate copies of printf ( ) would give the system a very bloated feel .
Shared libraries can save memory , not just disk space .
The kernel can keep a single copy of a shared library in memory , sharing it among multiple applications .
So , not only do we only have one copy of printf ( ) on the disk , we only have one in memory .
That has a pretty noticeable effect on performance .
In this article , we 'll review the underlying technology used for shared libraries and the way in which shared library versioning helps prevent the compatibility nightmares that naive shared library implementations have had in the past .
First , a look at how shared libraries work .
How shared libraries work
The concept is easy enough to understand .
You have a library ; you share the library .
But what actually happens when your program tries to call printf ( ) -- the real way this works -- is a bit more complex .
It is a simpler process in a static linking system than in a dynamically linked system .
In a static linked system , the generated code possesses a reference to a function .
The linker replaces that reference with the actual address at which it had loaded the function , so that the resulting binary code has the right address in place .
Then , when the code is run , it simply jumps to the relevant address .
This is a simple task to administer because it lets you to link in only those objects that are actually referred to at some point in the program .
But most shared libraries are dynamically linked .
That has several further implications .
One is that you can't predict in advance at which address a function will really be when it 's called !
( There have also been statically linked shared library schemes , such as the one in BSD / OS , but they are beyond the scope of this article . )
The dynamic linker can do a fair amount of work for each function linked , so most linkers are lazy .
They only actually finish that work when the function is called .
With more than a thousand externally visible symbols in the C library and nearly three thousand more local ones , this idea could save a noticeable amount of time .
The magic trick here that makes it work is a chunk of data called a Procedure Linkage Table ( PLT ) , a table in the program that lists every function that a program calls .
When the program is started , the PLT contains code for each function to query the runtime linker for the address at which it has loaded a function .
It then fills in that entry in the table and jumps there .
As each function is called , its entry in the PLT is simplified into a direct jump to the loaded function .
However , it 's important to notice that this still leaves an extra layer of indirection -- each function call is resolved through a jump into a table .
Compatibility 's not just for relationships
This means that the library you end up being linked to had better be compatible with the code that 's calling it .
With a statically linked executable , there is some guarantee that nothing will change on you .
With dynamic linking , you do n't have that guarantee .
What happens if a new version of the library comes out ?
Especially , what happens if the new version changes the calling sequence for a given function ?
Version numbers to the rescue -- a shared library will have a version .
When a program is linked against a library , it has the version number it 's designed for stored in it .
The dynamic linker can check for a matching version number .
If the library has changed , the version number wo n't match , and the program wo n't be linked to the newer version of library .
One of the potential advantages of dynamic linking , however , is in fixing bugs .
It 'd be nice if you could fix a bug in the library and not have to recompile a thousand programs to take advantage of that fix .
So sometimes , you want to link to a newer version .
Unfortunately , that creates some cases where you want to link to the newer version and some cases where you 'd rather stick with an older version .
There is a solution , though -- two kinds of version numbers :
A major number indicates a potential incompatibility between library versions .
A minor number indicates only bug fixes .
So under most circumstances , it is safe to load a library with the same major number and a higher minor number ; consider it an unsafe practice to load a library with a higher major number .
To prevent users ( and programmers ) from needing to track library numbers and updates , the system comes with a large number of symbolic links .
In general , the pattern is that
libexample.so
will be a link to
libexample.so.N
in which N is the highest major version number found on the system .
For every major version number supported ,
libexample.so.N
will be a link in turn to
libexample.so.N.M
in which M is the largest minor version number .
Thus , if you specify - lexample to the linker , it looks for libexample .
so which is a symbolic link to a symbolic link to the most recent version .
On the other hand , when an existing program is loaded , it will try to load libexample .
so. N in which N is the version to which it was originally linked .
Everyone wins !
To debug , first you must know how to compile
To debug problems with shared libraries , it 's useful to know a little more about how they 're compiled .
In a traditional static library , the code generated is usually bound together into a library file with a name ending in .a and then it 's passed to the linker .
In a dynamic library , the library file 's name generally ends in .so .
The file structures are somewhat different .
A normal static library is in a format created by the ar utility , which is basically a very simple - minded archive program , similar to tar but simpler .
In contrast , shared libraries are generally stored in more complicated file formats .
On modern Linux systems , this generally means the ELF binary format ( Executable and Linkable Format ) .
In ELF , each file is made up of one ELF header followed by zero or some segments and zero or some sections .
The segments contain information necessary for runtime execution of the file , while sections contain important data for linking and relocation .
Each byte in the entire file is taken by no more than one section at a time , but there can be orphan bytes that are not covered by a section .
Normally in a UNIX executable , one or more sections are enclosed in one segment .
The ELF format has specifications for applications and libraries .
The library format is a lot more complicated than just a simple archive of object modules , though .
The linker sorts through references to symbols , making notes about in which libraries they were found .
Symbols from static libraries are added to the final executable ; symbols from shared libraries are put into the PLT , and references to the PLT are created .
Once those tasks are done , the resulting executable has a list of symbols it plans to look up from libraries it will load at runtime .
At runtime , the application loads the dynamic linker .
In fact , the dynamic linker itself uses the same kind of versioning as the shared libraries .
On SUSE Linux 9.1 , for instance , the file / lib/ld- linux.so.2 is a symbolic link to / lib/ld- linux.so.2.3.3 .
On the other hand , a program looking for / lib / ld - linux .so. 1 wo n't try to use the new version .
The dynamic linker then gets to do all the fun work .
It looks to see which libraries ( and which versions ) a program was originally linked to and then loads them .
Loading a library consists of :
Finding it ( and it may be in any of several directories on a system )
Mapping it into the program 's address space
Allocating blocks of zero - filled memory the library may need
Attaching the library 's symbol table
Debugging this process can be difficult .
There are a few kinds of problems you can encounter .
For example , if the dynamic linker can't find a given library , it will abort loading the program .
If it finds all the libraries it wants but can't find a symbol , it can abort for that too ( but it may not act until the actual attempt to reference that symbol occurs ) -- this is rare case though because normally , if the symbol is n't there , it will be noticed during the initial link .
Modifying the dynamic linker search path
When linking a program , you can specify additional paths to search at runtime .
In gcc the syntax is - Wl , - R / path .
If the program is already linked , you can also change this behavior by setting the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
Usually this is needed only if your application wants to search paths that are n't part of the system - wide default , a rare case for most Linux systems .
In theory , the Mozilla people could have distributed a binary compiled with that path set , but they preferred to distribute a wrapper script that sets the library path appropriately before launching the executable .
Setting the library path can provide a workaround in the rare case where two applications require incompatible versions of a library .
A wrapper script can be used to have one application search in a directory using the special version of the library it requires .
Hardly an elegant solution , but in some cases it 's the best you can do .
If you have a compelling reason to add a path to many programs , you can also change the system 's default search path .
The dynamic linker is controlled through / etc/ld.so.conf , which contains a list of directories to search by default .
Any paths specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be searched before the paths listed in ld.so.conf , so users can override these settings .
Most users have no reason to change the system default library search paths ; generally the environment variable is a better match for likely reasons to change the search path , such as linking with libraries in a toolkit or testing programs against a newer version of a library .
Using ldd
One useful tool for debugging shared library problems is ldd .
The name derives from list dynamic dependencies .
This program looks at a given executable or shared library and figures out what shared libraries it needs to load and which versions would be used .
The output looks like this :
Listing 1 . Dependencies of / bin/sh
$ ldd / bin/ sh linux - gate.so.1 => ( 0xffffe000 ) libreadline.so.4 => /lib/libreadline.so.4 ( 0x40036000 ) libhistory .so.4 => /lib/libhistory.so.4 ( 0x40062000 ) libncurses.so.5 => /lib/libncurses.so.5 ( 0x40069000 ) libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 ( 0x400af000 ) libc.so.6 =>
/lib/tls/libc.so.6 ( 0x400b2000 ) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0x40000000 )
It can be a little surprising to find out how many libraries a " simple " program uses .
It 's probably the case that libhistory is the one calling for libncurses .
To find out , we can just run another ldd command :
Listing 2 . Dependencies of libhistory
$ ldd /lib/libhistory.so.4 linux - gate.so.1 => ( 0xffffe000 ) libncurses.so.5 => /lib/libncurses.so.5 ( 0x40026000 ) libc.so.6 =>
/lib/tls/libc.so.6 ( 0x4006b000 ) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0x80000000 )
In some cases , an application may need extra library paths specified .
For instance , the first few lines of an attempt to run ldd on the Mozilla binary came out like this :
Listing 3 . Result of ldd for items not in search path
$ ldd /opt/mozilla/lib/mozilla-bin linux-gate.so.1 => ( 0 xffffe000 ) libmozjs .so => not found libplds4.so => not found libplc4.so => not found libnspr4.so => not found libpthread.so.0 =>
/lib/tls/libpthread.so.0 ( 0x40037000 )
Why are n't these libraries found ?
Because they 're not in the usual search path for libraries .
In fact , they 're found in / opt / mozilla / lib , so one solution would be to add that directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
Another option is to set the path to .
and run ldd from that directory , although this is a little more dangerous -- putting the current directory in your library path is just as potentially treacherous as putting it in your executable path .
In this case , it 's pretty clear that adding the directory these are in to the system - wide search path would be a bad idea .
Nothing but Mozilla needs these libraries .
Linking Mozilla
And speaking of Mozilla , in case you were thinking that you 'd never see more than a few lines of libraries , here 's a somewhat more typical large application .
Now you can see why Mozilla takes so long to launch !
Listing 4 . Dependencies of mozilla-bin
linux - gate.so.1 => ( 0 xffffe000 ) libmozjs .so => ./libmozjs.so ( 0x40018000 ) libplds4.so => ./libplds4.so ( 0x40099000 ) libplc4.so => ./libplc4.so ( 0x4009d000 ) libnspr4.so => ./libnspr4.so ( 0x400a2000 ) libpthread.so.0 =>

Learning more about shared libraries
Users interested in learning more about dynamic linking on Linux have a broad field of options .
The GNU compiler and linker tool chain documentation is excellent , although the guts of it are stored in the info format and not mentioned in the standard man pages .
The manual page for ld.so contains a fairly comprehensive list of variables that modify the behavior of the dynamic linker , as well as explanations of the different versions of the dynamic linker that have been used in the past .
Most Linux documentation assumes that all shared libraries are dynamically linked because on Linux systems , they generally are .
The work needed to make statically linked shared libraries is substantial and most users do n't gain any benefit from it , although the performance difference is noticeable on systems that support the feature .
If you 're using a pre-packaged system off the shelf , you probably wo n't run into very many shared library versions -- the system probably just ships with the ones it was linked against .
On the other hand , if you do a lot of updates and source builds , you can end up with many versions of a shared library since old versions get left around " just in case . "
As always , if you want to know more , experiment .
Remember that nearly everything on a system refers back to those same few shared libraries , so if you break one of the system 's core shared libraries , you 're going to get to play with some kind of system recovery tool .

That was what made the difference at 4:40 a.m. yesterday as Gilberto Cantu , a truck driver from Texas , approached the New Jersey entrance of the Lincoln Tunnel in his big rig , loaded with bathtubs , toilets and plumbing fixtures .
The truck was 13 feet 6 inches high .
The tunnel has a height limit of 13 feet .
Six inches can make a big difference .
Mr. Cantu drove the entire 1.5 miles of the tunnel from Weehawken , N.J. , to Manhattan , tearing his way under the Hudson River in the tunnel ’s center tube and peeling back the roof of his tractor - trailer as if it were a tin can .
No one was injured , but an undetermined number of decorative tunnel ceiling tiles were ripped off .
It was unclear why Mr. Cantu did not heed warnings from flashing signs and a loudspeaker in New Jersey , said Steve Coleman , a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which operates the tunnel .
“ There were enough bells and whistles going off that this should not have happened , ” Mr. Coleman said .
“ He told the officers he did n’t know where he was going . ”
Mr. Coleman said that accidents of this kind were almost always averted .

Karl Christian Rove ( born December 25 , 1950 , age 69 ) is a RINO Backer known for losing the Congress to a Democrat takeover in 2006 and pursuing policies that resulted in the Republican Party to suffer landslide defeats in the 2008 elections .
For an encore , perhaps to cater to socially liberal donors to his Super PAC , in August 2012 Rove made vicious remarks against conservative Todd Akin in an unsuccessful attempt to force him to give up his nomination for the U.S. Senate .
Furthering Rove 's downward spiral , less than 2 % of candidates backed by Rove 's Super PACs succeeded in the 2012 General Election .
[ 1 ]
Since leaving the White House in 2007 , Rove has worked as a political analyst and contributor for Fox News , Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal .
Rove is part of the Establishment as a crony of George W. Bush .
Rove sided with Planned Parenthood when Komen for the Cure temporarily stopped funding it , according to Karen Handel , who was an executive at Komen for the Cure at the time . [ 2 ]
Robert Novak famously observed that Rove had become " part of the problem " as he was hurting the Republican Party towards the end of the George W. Bush Administration .
By 2012 , Rove had reinvented himself with funding by Las Vegas casino billionaires for Rove 's Super PAC , American Crossroads and its sister Super PAC , " American Crossroads GPS " .
Rove married for the third time and was flown on his honeymoon in a private jet owned by a Las Vegas casino mogul .
This resulted in his being satirized by Stephen Colbert as " Ham Rove " the political consultant to the Colbert SuperPAC . [ 3 ]
Liberal Newsweek , the Wall Street Journal , and Fox News promote Rove heavily , although it is unclear his political advice and the ads run by his American Crossroads had any positive effect .
Trump
A frequent critic of Donald Trump , Rove described the White House in April 2017 as " unhealthy " and having " three tribes " : [ 4 ]
“ “ There is a group around Jared Kushner and his supporters and allies .
There is one around Steve Bannon and a sort of alt - right in the White House .
And one sort of around Reince Priebus and everybody else , ” Rove remarked .
“ And while I think there is a tendency to exaggerate a little bit in the press , I think there ’s a lot behind this that ’s real . ” ”
According to a report in May 2020 , Rove was advising Trump 's re-election campaign .
[ 5 ]
Following this , the left - wing Salon was none too quick to attack Rove , calling him “ Turd Blossom ” . [ 6 ]
Background
Rove was the Deputy Chief of Staff in the Bush administration .
Rove 's longtime partnership with George W. Bush dates back to Bush 's terms as governor of Texas .
Rove ran all of Bush 's campaigns for governor and for president .
Rove was credited as the " architect " of these elections .
Rove started his political career early , attending the University of Utah but dropping out in July 1971 to work in the College Republican National Committee .
Often called " the brains behind Bush " or " the Architect , " Rove is credited as the chief architect of the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns .
Resignation
On August 13 , 2007 , the Wall Street Journal published an interview with Rove in which he announced that he would be resigning from his position of deputy Chief of Staff at the end of the month . [ 7 ]
Rove explained the move as motivated by his dedication to his family .

Leave those kids alone
The idea that adults should be playing with their kids is a modern invention -- and not necessarily a good one
( Illustration / Aaron Meshon ) WHAT COULD BE more natural than a mother down on the rec-room floor , playing with her 3 - year - old amid puzzles , finger - puppets , and Thomas the Tank Engine trains ?
Look -- now she 's conducting a conversation between a stuffed shark and Nemo , the Pixar clown fish !
Giggles all around .
Not to mention that the tot is learning the joys of stories and narrative , setting him on a triumphal path toward school .
A " natural " scene ?
Actually , parent - child play of this sort has been virtually unheard of throughout human history , according to the anthropologist David Lancy .
And three - fourths of the world 's current population would still find that mother 's behavior kind of dotty .
American - style parent - child play is a distinct feature of wealthy developed countries -- a recent byproduct of the pressure to get kids ready for the information - age economy , Lancy argues in a recent article in American Anthropologist , the field 's flagship journal in the United States .
" Adults think it is silly to play with children " in most cultures , says Lancy , who teaches at Utah State University .
Play is a cultural universal , he concedes , " but adults are n't part of the picture . "
Yet middle - class and upper - middle - class Americans -- abetted , he says , by psychologists -- are increasingly proclaiming the parents - on - all - fours style the One True Way to raise a smart , well - adjusted child .
There is now a concerted effort to spread adult - child play beyond its stronghold in the upper - and middle - classes of wealthy countries .
To this end , many cities and states support programs of some sort .
Massachusetts will give the Parent - Child Home Program , which has 33 sites in the state , $ 3 million this year ( up from $ 2 million last year ) .
Through the program , staff members visit the homes of low - income residents and offer tips not just on good books for toddlers but also on " play activities " for parents and kids .
Likewise , the eminent Yale psychologist Jerome Singer has partnered with a media company to devise imaginative parent - child games ( examples : " My Magic Story Car " and " Puppets : Counting " ) that librarians and social workers can teach to low - income parents .
Lancy is concerned that specialists behind the movement -- psychologists , social workers , preschool teachers -- are too aggressively promoting this intense , interventionist parenting style to low - income parents , and that they are are too quick to claim that adult - child play is crucial for human development .
He does n't quite rule out that some interventions may improve literacy -- though the data are murkier than the psychologists admit , he insists .
But the programs , with their premise ( as he sees it ) that a whole class of people is simply parenting badly , leave their advocates " open to charges of racism or cultural imperialism . " . . .
One inspiration for the article , Lancy says , was that he kept coming across accounts of parents who felt guilty that they did not enjoy playing with their children .
The psychologist Daniel Kahneman and the economist Alan Krueger , both at Princeton , have found that parents routinely claim that playing with their kids is among their favorite activities , but when you ask them to record their state of mind , hour by hour , they rate time spent with their children as being about as much fun as housework .
In his article , Lancy draws on decades of ethnographic work to show how rare parent - child play has been in the world .
The Harvard anthropologist Robert LeVine , for example , observed in a 2004 paper that among the Gusii people of Kenya , " mothers rarely looked at or spoke to their infants and toddlers , even when they were holding and breast - feeding them . "
( So much for the universality of peek - a - boo . )
On Ifaluk Island , in the South Pacific , tribespeople believe that babies are " essentially brainless " before age 2 , so there is no point in talking to them .
The goal of the Yucatec Maya is to keep babies in a " kind of benign coma , " through bathing and swaddling , so that parents can leave them and get work done .
As recently as 1914 , the US Department of Labor 's Child Bureau advised parents not to play with babies , for fear of overstimulating their little nervous systems .
If interactions with babies are rare in much of the world , " mother - toddler play is virtually nonexistent , " Lancy writes .
To be sure , there are exceptions .
Some African foraging tribes display striking examples of parental playfulness .
And the Inuit make toys for their toddlers and get goofy -- but they 're cooped up for months at a time in igloos , bored witless .
Lancy suggests that the American milieu -- caregivers stuck , without a community , in oversized homes -- is not entirely dissimilar .
Alison Gopnik , a developmental psychologist at Berkeley , agrees with parts of Lancy 's argument :
In much of the world , parents are unlikely to be the main caregivers , and Americans go overboard with structured parent - child play which has explicit academic goals .
But she says that Lancy vastly understates the interactions between parents and children .
In many cultures , mothers hold their babies much , much more than American mothers do , and holding and cuddling a child can be as stimulating and playful as peek - a - boo , she says .
" The fact that non-Western parents do not interact with their babies like Western parents does n't mean they are n't interacting with them , " Gopnik says .
And if African children learn from older siblings how to use a bow - and - arrow in a playful way , she asks , how different is that from American parents ( or nannies ) playfully teaching kids practices useful in American culture , such as verbal agility ?
Tribal practices aside , the real source of contention is what sort of child - rearing advice low - income Americans should be receiving from social workers , psychologists , and other people interested in improving the academic readiness of poor kids .
Yale 's Singer , co-author ( with his wife , Dorothy ) of " The House of Make - Believe : Children 's Play and the Developing Imagination " ( 1990 ) , says his data show that children who played versions of " My Magic Story Car , " in which a parent pretends to drive with the kids to various locations , having adventures along the way ( with a subtle vocab lesson or two thrown in ) , do better on literacy tests than their peers .
" I 'm not clear what 's bothering this guy , " he says , referring to Lancy .
" We are not talking about the parents playing all day long with the children .
We 're just saying that children need to play , and particular kinds of play -- imaginative play that has a storytelling element to it -- are very useful " in our culture .
Still , the proselytizing on behalf of playful middle - class approaches vexes many anthropologists .
A crystallizing moment for their concern came with the publication of a lengthy article in The New York Times Magazine last November by Paul Tough , an editor at the magazine , on efforts by some educators to erase cultural differences between low - income and middle - class students .
Tough leaned on the work of the University of Maryland sociologist Annette Lareau , who has described the dominant middle - and upper - middle - class parenting style as one of " concerted cultivation " : scheduled time , interactive banter and play , and the encouragement of the child to challenge the parent 's opinions .
In contrast , she summarizes the low - income parents ' approach as " the accomplishment of natural growth " : less direct involvement with the kids , more unsupervised play , and more enforcement of rules .
More controversial than the sociological work was Tough 's summary -- that poor parents fail to deliver " everyday intellectual and emotional stimuli " or to impart " character , " " self - control , adaptability , patience , and openness . "
Mica Pollock , an associate professor at Harvard 's Graduate School of Education , says it 's one thing to encourage low - income parents to read to their kids or tell them stories .
But " it 's a huge and dangerous overstatement to say that low - income parents do n't stimulate their children . "
In fact , some research , she says , suggests that the approach used by some low - income parents teaches virtues such as patience and adaptability better than more freewheeling parenting styles .
And let 's not idealize middle - class kids : " Some of those children are being raised to be spoiled , demanding , requiring constant adult attention , and inclined to argue with their parents , " Pollock says .
This debate is unlikely to sway the convictions of the pro-play crowd .
Stevanne Auerbach , the author of " Smart Play , Smart Toys : How to Raise a Child with a High PQ " -- play quotient -- says her goal is to " encourage parents to understand that they are their children 's first big toy . "
But for the parents not energized by the prospect of all those hours in the playroom -- parents who would rather be doing something else -- Lancy 's article offers the solace that comes from knowing you 're not alone , globally or historically .

Kenneth Pollack , writing an op -ed for the New York Times with Michael O’Hanlon today :
Here is the most important thing Americans need to understand :
We are finally getting somewhere in Iraq , at least in military terms .
As two analysts who have harshly criticized the Bush administration ’s miserable handling of Iraq , we were surprised by the gains we saw and the potential to produce not necessarily “ victory ” but a sustainable stability that both we and the Iraqis could live with ...
[ T ] here is enough good happening on the battlefields of Iraq today that Congress should plan on sustaining the effort at least into 2008 .
Judicial Watch , a conservative - leaning watchdog group , found a plausible argument against the mandatory use of the HPV vaccine – FDA
records show the vaccine killed 3 girls , and caused problems ranging from spontaneous abortion to fetal abnormalities in 18 pregnant women .
Outside of the three deaths ( .pdf ) – ages 12 , 19 , and unknown – adverse reactions ( .pdf ) in 1,637 women had been reported by May 11 , 2007 in women undergoing the Gardasil vaccination .
Adverse reactions range from the mild ( rash , headache ) to potentially serious ( Guillain - Barre ) , although most cases presenting with Guillain - Barre were associated with receiveg the meningitis vaccine Menactra .
( FDA and CDC safety warning . )
A New York Times ' article from February noted that more than 20 states were considering making the vaccine " mandatory " for young girls , although parents could request that their daughter not be vaccinated .

Facebook BOSTON ( AP ) 
A man said he failed the Massachusetts bar exam because he refused to answer a question about gay marriage , and claims in a federal lawsuit the test violated his rights and targeted his religious beliefs .
The suit also challenges the constitutionality of same - sex marriage , which was legalized in Massachusetts in 2003 .
Stephen Dunne , who is representing himself in the case and seeks $ 9.75 million , said the bar exam was not the place for a " morally repugnant and patently offensive " question addressing the rights of two married lesbians , their children and their property .
He said he refused to answer the question because he believed it legitimized same - sex marriage and same - sex parenting , which is contrary to his moral beliefs .
Dunne , 30 , was denied a license to practice law in May after scoring 268.866 on the exam , just shy of the 270 passing grade .
His lawsuit against the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court also claims the state government is " purposely advancing secular humanism 's homosexual agenda . "
The " disguised mechanism to screen applicants according to their political ideology has the discriminatory impact of persecuting and oppressing ( Dunne's ) sincere religious practices and beliefs " protected by the First Amendment , and was " invasive and burdensome , " according to the lawsuit filed last month .
Dunne 's telephone number was unlisted .
He told the Boston Herald he has a law degree from a Boston law school and is attending a Boston business school .
Officials with the state bar would not say how much the questions are worth or how the tests are scored , and the court also declined to comment .
David Yas , editor of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly , said the suit was " idiotic " and that Dunne was " completely missing the point about what it means to be a lawyer . "
" Knowing the law has nothing to do with agreeing with the law , " he said .
Yas said if Dunne really believed the question was improper , he should " answer the question correctly , get your law degree and use it to argue for what you believe in . "
Lee Swislow , executive director of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , said Dunne is trying to use a legal question to advance a political agenda .
" The bar exam was a test of whether he knew how to apply domestic relations law , and he refused to answer , " she said .
" Now he 's suing , and I think that makes him a loser . "

Mr Ahmadinejad said he would try to make his blog entries shorter
The launch of www.ahmadinejad.ir was reported on state TV , which urged users to send in messages to the president .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's first posting , entitled autobiography , tells of his childhood , Iran 's Islamic revolution , and the country 's war with Iraq .
The blog includes a poll asking if users think the US and Israel are trying to trigger a new world war .
There is a postform for users to send in questions for the president , and a picture gallery containing a series of images of the blogger himself .
The move by Mr Ahmadinejad comes amid continuing internet censorship by the Iranian government .
With hope in God , I intend to wholeheartedly complete my talk in future with allotted 15 minutes
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's blog
In a country where the media is strictly controlled , the internet has become the main forum for dissident voices .
But in its bid to crack down on anti-government bloggers , the government uses one of the most sophisticated internet censorship systems in the world .
Such restrictions will not pose a problem for the president .
However , at the end of his first posting - which runs to more than 2,000 words in English - he promises to try to keep things " shorter and simpler " in future .
" With hope in God , I intend to wholeheartedly complete my talk in future with allotted 15 minutes , " he writes .
Nose bleed
Mr Ahmadinejad 's first entry on his blog , which is available in Persian , Arabic , English and French and includes an RSS feed to get future new entries to readers , is dated Friday .
He begins by telling users of his humble origins .
" During the era that nobility was a prestige and living in a city was perfection , I was born in a poor family in a remote village of Garmsar - approximately 90 kilometres west of Tehran , " he writes .
The internet is extremely popular in Iran , but bloggers face strict censorship
His father was a " hard - bitten toiler blacksmith " and a " pious man " , who had decided to move the family to Tehran when Mr Ahmadinejad was just a year old .
Describing himself as a " distinguished student " , the president tells how he excelled at school , coming 132nd out of more than 400,000 students to take a university entrance test - despite suffering from a nose bleed at the time .
He talks about his admiration and affection for the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , and discusses Iran 's war with Iraq , calling former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein an " aggressor " who was " intoxicated with power " .
The US is also heavily criticised by the president .
At one point he describes it as " Great Satan USA " for what he says was its support for the " terrorist groups " which had tried to collapse Iran 's Islamic government .
And the blog 's current poll asks the question : " Do you think that the US and Israeli intention and goal by attacking Lebanon is pulling the trigger for another world war ? "
' Publicity stunt '
It is not yet clear how well Mr Ahmadinejad 's blog will be received .
User figures already appear high - by 1100 BST on Monday , nearly 12,000 people had taken part in the online vote .
But Keivan Mehrgan , a Tehran - based blogger , told the Associated Press news agency he thought the president 's efforts were merely a publicity stunt .
" Ahmadinejad used to have nothing to do with the internet and even talked against journalists and bloggers before he became president , " he was quoted as saying .
Meanwhile , in a move some suggest is part of the same search for a wider international audience , President Ahmadninejad also gave a rare interview to American television .
In extracts broadcast by the BBC on Monday , Mr Ahmadinejad condemned President Bush for wanting to solve the world 's problems by force , and for " blindly supporting " Israel in its conflict with Hezbollah .
He also flatly denied Iran was seeking nuclear weapons .
" We want to have access to nuclear technology .
We want to produce fuel , " he said .
" Do you not think that the most important issue of the world of tomorrow will be energy ?
We think that Mr Bush 's team and the parties that support him want to monopolise energy resources in the world . "
The BBC's Bridget Kendall , at the United Nations , says Mr Ahmadinejad 's decision to reach out to speak America at this moment - in the wake of the Lebanon conflict - was no accident .
President Ahmadinejad wanted to play on all the doubts about American foreign policy , and counter the notion that Iran is run by mad mullahs trying to get nuclear weapons , our correspondent says .
Intel 's computer chips are used in the majority of personal computers
The lawsuit covers x86 microprocessors , used to run PC operating systems , including Microsoft Windows , Solaris and Linux systems .
AMD said its lawsuit alleges that Intel has coerced customers away from dealing with AMD , and is based on evidence obtained from 38 companies .
Intel has declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by AMD .
AMD filed its case in a federal court in the US state of Delaware on Monday .
Market dominance
" Everywhere in the world , customers deserve freedom of choice and the benefits of innovation , and these are being stolen away in the microprocessor , " said AMD president and chief executive Hector Ruiz .
We are trying to bust open Intel 's chokehold over the computer companies
AMD 's lawyer Charles Diamond
Intel dominates global sales of x86 microprocessors with 80 % of sales by volume and 90 % by revenue , according to AMD .
A report on first quarter 2005 microprocessor sales by independent research firm Mercury found Intel had 82 % of the PC processor market and AMD had 17 % , with VIA and Transmeta mopping up the rest , The Register website reported .
AMD alleges that Intel has used its position to force major customers , such as NEC , Acer and Fujitsu , into exclusive deals or to cap customer purchases of AMD chips .
Its lawsuit quotes then - Compaq chief executive Michael Capellas saying that Intel once withheld delivery of certain chips as punishment for the level of Compaq 's business with AMD .
" Saying 'he had a gun to his head ' , Mr Capellas told AMD he had to stop buying , " AMD 's statement said .
In another example , AMD quotes Gateway executives who said Intel had " beaten them into ' guacamole ' " in retaliation for doing business with AMD .
" We are trying to bust open Intel 's chokehold over the computer companies and get the right to compete freely and fairly for every processor they buy , " said Charles Diamond , attorney for AMD .
Commencement weekend is hard to plan at the University of California , Los Angeles .
The university now has so many separate identity - group graduations that scheduling them not to conflict with one another is a challenge .
The women ’s studies graduation and the Chicana / Chicano studies graduation are both set for 10 AM Saturday .
The broader Hispanic graduation , “ Raza , ” is in near - conflict with the black graduation , which starts just an hour later .
Planning was easier before a new crop of ethnic groups pushed for inclusion .
Students of Asian heritage were once content with the Asian–Pacific Islanders ceremony .
But now there are separate Filipino and Vietnamese commencements , and some talk of a Cambodian one in the future .
Years ago , UCLA sponsored an Iranian graduation , but the school ’s commencement office could n’t tell me if the event was still around .
The entire Middle East may yet be a fertile source for UCLA commencements .
Not all ethnic and racial graduations are well attended .
The 2003 figures at UCLA showed that while 300 of 855 Hispanic students attended , only 170 out of 1,874 Asian - Americans did .
Some students are presumably eligible for four or five graduations .
A gay student with a Native American father and a Filipino mother could attend the Asian , Filipino , and American Indian ceremonies , plus the mainstream graduation and the Lavender Graduation for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgendered students .
Graduates usually wear identity - group markers — a Filipino stole or a Vietnamese sash , for instance , or a rainbow tassel at the Lavender event .
Promoters of ethnic and racial graduations often talk about the strong sense of community that they favor .
But it is a sense of community based on blood , a dubious and historically dangerous organizing principle .
The organizers also sometimes argue that identity - group graduations make sense for practical reasons .
They say that about 3,000 graduating seniors show up for UCLA ’s “ regular ” graduation , making it a massive and impersonal event .
At the more intimate identity - group events , foreign - born parents and relatives hear much of the ceremony in their native tongues .
The Filipino event is so small — about 100 students — that each grad gets to speak for 30 seconds .
But the core reason for separatist graduations is the obvious one : on campus , assimilation is a hostile force , the domestic version of American imperialism .
On many campuses , identity - group training begins with separate freshman orientation programs for nonwhites , who arrive earlier and are encouraged to bond before the first Caucasian freshmen arrive .
Some schools have separate orientations for gays as well .
Administrations tend to foster separatism by arguing that bias is everywhere , justifying double standards that favor identity groups .
Four years ago Ward Connerly , then a regent of the University of California , tried to pass a resolution to stop funding of ethnic graduations and gay freshman orientations .
He changed his mind and asked to withdraw his proposal , but the regents wanted to vote on it and defeated it in committee 6–3 .
No major objections to ethnic graduations have emerged since .
As in so many areas of American life , the preposterous is now normal .

DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( AP ) 
The U.S. military denied reports Tuesday that Iran fired a missile at a U.S. ship in the Persian Gulf .
The rumors of an attack had sent oil prices soaring , but Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Brown of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet said all ships in the Gulf had been checked and the rumors were untrue .
Crude oil futures had jumped nearly eight percent Tuesday in a matter of minutes , topping $ 68.00 as rumors of a military confrontation in the Persian Gulf spurred panic buying , Dow Jones reported .
Rising tensions between Tehran and the West have created a potentially dangerous situation in the Gulf and markets are jumpy .
Tehran continues to hold 15 British sailors it captured on Friday , giving no indications of their whereabouts despite repeated pleas for their release from Britain , the United States and the European Union .
Meanwhile , the U.S. kicked off a military training operation in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday that commanders said was meant to send a warning to Iran .
The operations are the largest show of U.S. force in the Gulf since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .

How out of whack does someone 's moral compass have to be for them to go on national television , demand a reporter look them in the eye , tell the reporter the United States does n't torture ( three times ) , refuse to discuss any interrogation techniques that are used , then , when pressed , offer the classic torturer 's defense ( ticking time bomb , evil men wo n't say anything unless coerced , etc. ) , and expect anyone to believe him .
This was the same technique President Bush used on Matt Lauer : deny it , refuse to discuss it , and then justify it .
All the while they act put out that the reporter would even dare to ask the question despite the volumous evidence that has been leaked about water boarding , stress positions , sleep deprivation , threatening with dogs , etc .
All this from an administration promising to restore honor and integrity to the White House .
Whenever , someone jokes about Clinton not knowing the definition of " is , " I always counter with " at least he knows the definition of torture . "
My favorite part of the George Tenet interview came when he was asked whether anyone had died from the interrogation program used by the CIA .
Tenet quickly said " No , " waited a beat and took a big swig out of a water bottle .
That 's what we call a tell .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday the threat to the United States from al Qaeda has not returned to levels seen just before the September 11 attacks nearly six years ago .
Chertoff played down media reports the militant network has regained strength and was now as great a threat as in the months before the September 11 attacks on Washington and New York .
“ I would n’t put it at that level , ” he told ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
“ I do think we ’ve accomplished an awful lot in dismantling their activities overseas and in building our own defenses .
But I do think the level of intent on the part of the enemy remains very high . ”
The Washington Post reported the militant network has significantly rebuilt itself and established a safe haven in remote tribal areas of western Pakistan .
It cited a new intelligence report to be reviewed by Chertoff and other top officials at a White House meeting later Thursday .
Top intelligence analysts also told Congress on Wednesday that al Qaeda ’s training activities , funding and communications have increased as the militant network has settled into new bases in remote areas of Pakistan .
Chertoff told the Chicago Tribune this week that his “ gut feeling ” was that the United States faced a heightened risk of attack this summer .
But he told NBC on Thursday : “ We do n’t have any specific information about an imminent or near - term attack on the homeland .
We ’re looking at the strategic picture over the next six months to a year .
We ’re evaluating where that is . ”
He said his concern the United States could be entering a period of heightened risk was based on greater al Qaeda activity in Pakistan and Africa , an increase in public messages from militant figures including Osama bin Laden ’s second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahri , and a history of summer attacks .
The salary gap is primarily explained by the fact that female engineers , on average , are less experienced than males .
On average , women in engineering occupations had five fewer years experience than men .
R ecent studies have found that in the United States , women earn between 71 - 74 cents for every dollar earned by men . [ 2 ]
However , such findings often do not take into account a variety of factors that alone or together may explain much of this gap between men�s and women�s salaries .
This issue brief examines the gender salary gap in engineering , an occupation in which women held 10 percent of the jobs in 1995 .
[3 ]
Using multivariate regression analysis , the authors explored various potential explanations for the salary gap in this occupation .
The study showed that the salary gap is primarily explained by the fact that female engineers , on average , have fewer years of experience since their first baccalaureate degree than males ; salaries of female and male engineers with similar years of experience are virtually the same .
Using 1995 survey data from the National Science Foundation , [ 4 ] the study focused on U.S. residents who were employed full - time as engineers ; these included approximately 1.5 million college graduates of all ages in 16 engineering occupations .
[ 5 ]
Within this population , the median salary for women was 13 percent less than the median salary for men ; i.e. , women in engineering earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by men , higher than that for the general population .
This is consistent with other results that show that the earnings gap lessens significantly when women are compared with men with similar educational backgrounds and occupations .
[ 6 ]
The analysis first explored whether men and women differed on a number of measures such as educational field ( engineering vs. non-engineering ) , employment sector , geographic region , engineering specialty , highest degree attained , and years of experience .
Regression analysis was then used to determine whether these factors , alone or together , could help explain the gender salary gap among engineers .
This technique provides an estimate of the size of the salary gap if men and women were identical on these measures .
Occupational Characteristics of Males and Females
Men and women differed on these occupational characteristics : Engineering education .
Although most engineers had earned engineering degrees , a smaller percentage of female engineers had earned engineering degrees than male engineers ( 65 percent of women vs. 78 percent of men ) .
Although most engineers had earned engineering degrees , a smaller percentage of female engineers had earned engineering degrees than male engineers ( 65 percent of women vs. 78 percent of men ) .
Employment sector .
There was a slight difference between men and women with respect to the sectors in which they worked .
Women were better represented in local , state and Federal Government ( 17 percent of women vs. 13 percent of men ) and less well - represented in private industry [ 7 ] ( 77 percent of women vs. 81 percent of men ) .

Engineering specialty .
The one specialty that showed greater female concentration was computer software engineering ( 26 percent of women vs. 13 percent of men ) .
Most other fields showed greater male representation , e.g. , electrical and electronics engineering ( 12 percent of women vs. 21 percent of men ) and mechanical engineering ( 10 percent of women vs. 17 percent of men ) .

The only notable difference was at the doctoral level with a higher percentage of men ( 5 percent ) having doctorates than women ( 3 percent ) .

Years of experience .
Using the time elapsed from the year of an individual�s first bachelor�s degree award as a proxy for years of experience , figure 1 illustrates the different distributions of years of experience of male and female engineers .
Higher percentages of female engineers were found among those with 12 or less years of experience .
On average , women in engineering occupations had five fewer years experience than men .
Figure 2 shows the relationship between this measure of experience and median salary .
As expected , salary levels increase with years of experience .
Further , the rate at which salary increases with experience is the same for men and women .
Findings
The analysis shows that when controlling for years of experience in the regression , the estimated difference in salaries between men and women fell from 13 percent to 3 percent , bringing women�s median earnings to 97 cents to the men�s dollar .
When the other variables listed above are added to the regression , the estimated difference is lowered only another 1 percentage point .
The remaining 2 percent difference cannot be explained with the available variables .
Although statistically significant , the remaining difference is small compared to sources of errors such as the tendency to round salaries to the nearest $ 1,000 , and the possible effect of factors not covered by the survey .
Limitations of the Analysis
The proxy for experience in this study would overstate the experience of those who may have temporarily left the workforce since graduating from college .
Thus , if women�s participation in the engineering workforce is more intermittent than men�s , this analysis would underestimate that difference . [ 8 ]
Further research in this area needs to consider other circumstantial factors that could enhance explanation of the gender salary gap in engineering .
These factors include , but are not limited to , degree combinations , [ 9 ] worker productivity , quality of the school or department from which the individual received degree(s ) , quality of the employer , and lifestyle or family - related choices . [ 10 ]
We could not fully explore why there are fewer older women in the engineering workforce .
One factor is a lower proportion of female engineering graduates 30 years ago than in recent years .
However , the analysis also showed that women with engineering degrees were working in occupations other than engineering more often than men .
Further analysis is needed to explore these issues .

It takes cleanser , moisturiser , make - up and a favourite lipstick to ensure the average woman is ready to face the world .
But a daily routine like this leaves her with more than a polished appearance .
She also absorbs almost 5lb of chemicals through her skin every year .
Some of the man -made compounds have been linked to cancer , while others may irritate the skin or even cause it to age prematurely .
Biochemist Richard Bence warned that the chemicals found in everyday beauty products could be doing untold damage .
Mr Bence , who has spent three years studying the ingredients in cosmetics and toiletries , said : " There is a growing amount of research questioning the ingredients found in conventional beauty products .
" We really need to start questioning the products we are putting on our skin and not just assume that the chemicals in them are safe .
" We have no idea what these chemicals do when they are mixed together .
The effect could be much greater than the sum of the individual parts . "
Scroll down for more ...
Among the chief chemical suspects are parabens - preservatives widely used in skin and hair products , including soap , shampoo , deodorant and baby lotion .
Capable of stopping bacterial growth , parabens are also thought to mimic the effects of the female sex hormone oestrogen , which is known to help tumours grow .
Traces of the chemical have been found in breast tumour samples but the link with cancer is , however , hotly disputed .
Sodium lauryl sulphate , which helps soap , shampoo , shaving foam , toothpaste and bubble bath lather up , can irritate skin .
Other potential irritants include benzyl alcohols , which are used to scent and preserve perfume , makeup and hair dyes .
Cocamide MEA , which binds the ingredients of many moisturisers , is also a suspect .
The average woman absorbs 4lb 6 oz of chemicals from toiletries and make - up every year , the industry magazine In - Cosmetics recently reported .
Mr Bence , who last year founded a website which specialises in organic beauty products , said absorbing such chemicals is more dangerous than swallowing them .
" If your lipstick gets into your mouth , it is broken down by the enzymes in saliva and in the stomach .
" But if the chemicals get straight into your bloodstream , there is no protection . "
Sodium lauryl sulphate is among chemicals banned from health and beauty products certified as organic by the Soil Association .
Soil Association spokeswoman Clio Turton suggested beauty enthusiasts should try to reduce the number of products they use each day .
" Many women are using over 20 different products a day , bombarding themselves with hundreds of different chemicals - is that eyelash conditioner really essential ? " she said .
The warning follows research showing nine out of ten women apply make - up past its use - by date .
The Royal College of Optometrists warned that old ipstick or mascara could be a " hothouse " for bacteria .
Cosmetic and toiletry manufacturers insisted that their products are safe .
Dr Christopher Flower , of the Cosmetic , Toiletry and Perfumery Association , said : " There is no reason at all to be worried about the safety of any products .
" They are all covered by EU - wide regulation which requires them to be safe - there are no ifs and buts about it .
" The cocktail effect of chemicals is an urban myth .
" We do know how different chemicals react individually and can predict how they interact with each other and this is taken into account when the safety of products is assessed . "
Bell 206 JetRanger Helicopter Simulator
For those that have an interest , I have put together these few pages of pictures to help show the ever changing process of building this helicopter simulator .
The Bell 206BII flight deck was salvaged from a roll over accident that had caused some damage to the helicopter 's front left side .
All of the original flight controls , gauges , instrument panel , doors , seats , and windscreens had already been removed before I acquired the front section of the JetRanger helicopter .
The floor pan had also been removed , so 3/ 4 " plywood was used for the base and floor , and to stiffen the flight deck at the back .
I fabricated a few aluminum panels for the inner and outer bottom door sills and repaired the left side damage somewhat with fiberglass cloth and resin .
The simulator has all the functioning real buttons and switches needed for a realistic 206 turbine engine start and warm - up , complete with realistic associated sounds , accurate flight characteristics , and shutdown procedures .
The simulator can now be used effectively for Bell 206 turbine transition training , as well as general familiarization with helicopter flight and procedures .
For the most part this has been made possible by the DodoSim 206 FSX helicopter simulator software from Dodosim Flight Simulation .
( www.dodosim.com)
A lot of time has past since this webpage was first started and I continue to refine the flight controls and computer related components .
The simulator is used for testing new flight simulator software and hardware , and as a result , I 've been able to incorporate my dual - control flight controllers as you will see in the photos below .
These days most of my " simulator time " has gone into building flight controls for commercial type simulators as well as other simulator builders , which has left little time for my own .
Below is a breakdown and description of some of the components that make up the simulator , hopefully some of the following will be of use to someone just starting out and looking for ideas .
Display
The scenery is displayed by three identical 23 " IPS monitors connected to a digital Matrox TripleHead2Go
Gauges and Instruments Panel
The Bell 206 instrument panel is simple and compact , which makes it convenient to display the gauges from a single LCD monitor .
The panel overlay allows the computer generated gauges and instruments on the LCD to show through .
The black gauge face rings are sections of 2 " I.D. and 3 " I.D. ABS plastic pipe turned on a lathe and glued to the panel with epoxy .
Push button momentary switches have been installed for the TOT light test , warning horn mute , and caution light test .
The push button switches are mounted in contoured aluminum rings that have been turned on the lathe to accommodate the length of the switch .
The panel has working rotary encoders ( rotational knobs ) for the altimeter , attitude indicator , and directional gyro instruments .
The rotary switches are from GoFlight and are wired to a GoFlight remote RP - 48 USB interface .
A red metal Bell 206 safety latch is installed on the toggle switch that is used to control the main fuel valve .
The instrument panel overlay is made from 1/8 " thick Masonite and t he connecting wires to the switches are strands of ribbon cable that have been hot glued to the back of the board to keep them in place .
The rotary and button switches are recessed and " flush " with the surface on the back of the board .
The monitor 's LCD screen was stripped of all plastic parts , ( stand , back , and front bezel ) so that the panel overlay would fit as close as possible .
Essentially the depth of the wire is the space between the panel and the monitor , about 1/16 of an inch .
Although not shown in this photo , 1/16 " thick self adhesive foam pads were placed on the back of the overlay panel near the push buttons in order to provide more cushioning and protect the LCD screen .
Annunciator Panel
The JetRanger type annunciator warning panel has 20 caution lights and a momentary push button switch to test the lights .
More information on the construction of the annunciator panel can be found here .
GPS , Radios , Console Switches
GPS screen is displaying the Reality XP Garmin 530
Center console mounted switches for hydraulics , anti-icing , and caution light brightness control .
Overhead Panel
[ Switches and Circuit Breakers ]
All of the switches needed for startup and flight of the 206 helicopter are operational and function like the real thing .
In this case , the circuit breakers will not actually trip ( as there is not enough current in the line ) , but they do act as standard " on-off " switches .
For example , the overhead hydraulic circuit breaker is " in line " with the main hydraulic switch , so pulling this breaker gives the same results as flipping the hydraulic switch to the " off " position .
This is made possible in FSX by using the Dodosim 206 FSX helicopter software , and FSUIPC4 for switch assignments .
Having a breaker " in line " with a circuit will let you do proper emergency procedures for a system failure of that circuit , an important feature for real world helicopter training .
This Plasma - Lite V2 and Ace - 4X expansion card handles all of the overhead switch and circuit breaker inputs .
Collective Controller
Bell 206 type dual - control collective
The main collective lever incorporates a twist grip throttle and a spring loaded mechanical idle release button .
The throttle grip has a detent position that interacts with the idle release button for realistic simulated Bell 206 startup and shutdown procedures .
Accurate turbine engine starts are made possible in FSX with the Dodosim 206 FSX software add - on from Dodosim Flight Simulations .
The collective switch head has working starter , governor RPM , and landing light switches .
The Dodosim 206 FSX , along with FSUIPC4 , allows for the dual landing light switch to operate the dual landing lights correctly .
Photo showing collective friction control knob and Delrin friction brake .
The secondary collective lever is connected to the main collective with a 1 1/4 " O.D. aluminum tube .
A 5/16 " plated steel rod with adjustable spherical rod ends connects the throttle linkage to each collective lever .
Dual flight controls allow pilot input from either seat .
More information on single and dual control collectives can be found here .
Cyclic Controller
The cyclic sticks are 1 1/4 " O.D. tempered aluminum tube .
The two cyclic sticks are connected by a 1 5/16 " O.D. 6061 aluminum torque tube on the pitch axis ,
and a 3/8 " plated steel connecting rod on the roll axis .
The cyclic base is fabricated from 6061 - T6 aluminum and is secured to the floor under the seat enclosure .
The cyclic base incorporates ball bearings on each axis for strength and smoothness .
Two Honeywell SS495
Hall effect sensors are used to keep track of each axis position and are connected to a 12 - bit USB joystick controller .
Shown here is the " simulated hydraulic system " on the dual control cyclic torque tube which resides under the left seat base .
When the main hydraulic switch on the center console is in the " off " position , extra force applied to the cyclic stick is needed and simulated by using relay driven electromagnet solenoid damping to generate cyclic resistance .
The electromagnet solenoids and levers produce a brake like action simulating " off " of the cyclic hydraulic actuator system when 12V power is applied to the solenoids .
When the main hydraulic switch is in the " on " position the relay cuts the power to the solenoids and allows the cyclic to move freely as if the hydraulic actuators were working .
More information on single and dual control cyclic controllers can be found here .
Pedals
The pedals shown here are made from 6061 - T6 aluminum .
The two pedal sets are connected by a 5/16 " plated steel rod with adjustable spherical rod ends .
More information on Bell 206 style pedals can be found here .
Although it is not specifically needed for flight operations , from time to time a keyboard is necessary to make changes to the computer .
Finding a spot in such a confined space is challenging , but the problem was solved with a hinged drop down shelf with the keyboard attached .
The shelf is mounted to the center column between the seats .
When not needed , it just folds up and out of the way .
Spring loaded Bell 206 check list and emergency procedures board is located on the right side of the main panel ,
and folds out of way when not in use .
Doors
The two doors , one real , one homemade The real Bell 206 right side door ( shown on the right ) was salvaged from another wrecked 206 .
The door was damaged and had to be repaired and painted to match the existing paint .
A 1/8 " white Masonite panel was used to replace the broken window .
Due to the curves involved , the left side door was fabricated with a piece of 1/8 " hard Masonite , bent and glued to oak hardwood strips ( precut to shape ) .
A homemade sliding door latch and fabricated Bell type hinges keeps the door in place .

Continuations
Noel Welsh February 13 , 2003
1 Introduction
These notes cover continuations and their applications , with a particular emphasis on web applications using continuations .
We start by looking the basics of continuations , touch on a few classic uses of continuations and then dive into their application to web applications .
There is n't the space to cover everything about continuations .
At the end of the document are a number of references to papers that explore topics in more depth .
2 Setting Up
To use continuations in DrScheme you much change your language setting to one of the languages listed under the PLT tab .
3 What Is A Continuation ?
A continuation is simply ``what happens next '' .
Consider a simple scheme expression :
( + 1 ( + 2 3 ) )
Scheme is an eager language , which means the expression (+ 2 3 ) gets evaluated first , yielding
( + 1 5 )
which is then evaluated to
6
At the time when we are evaluating (+ 2 3 ) the continuation is (+ 1 # ) , where the # indicates that the continuation is waiting for a value in that place to complete its computation .
Scheme allows us to capture the current continuation using call - with - current - continuation often abbreviated to call / cc . call / cc takes a procedure of a single argument , and calls this procedure with a continuation .
The continuation is itself a procedure of one argument .
A typical use of call / cc looks like :
( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ... k ... ) )
It 's often more convenient to use let / cc which simply binds a name to the current continuation
( let / cc k ... k ... )
3.1 Exercises
What is the continuation that is captured below ?
What is the value the program ?
( + 1 ( let / cc k ( k 5 ) ) )
What about
( + 1 ( let / cc k 5 ) )
where we do n't call the captured continuation ?
4 Escaping Procedures
Lets consider a slightly more involved example :
( + 1 ( let / cc k ( - 5 ( k 5 ) ) ) )
The continuation k is ( lambda ( # ) (+ 1 # ) ) .
When we evaluate this code the continuation is called with the value 5 and the result of the entire expression is (+ 1 5 ) or 6 .
However if we substitute in the continuation , we get
( + 1 ( - 5 ( ( lambda ( # ) ( + 1 # ) ) 5 ) ) )
which evaluates to 0 .
When k finishes evaluating it halts the computation , instead of returning a value to the surrounding expression .
This type of procedure is called an escaping procedure .
If we denote escaping procedures with lambda^ we can use substitution to write
( + 1 ( - 5 ( ( lambda^ ( # ) ( + 1 # ) ) 5 ) ) )
which evalutes to 6 as it should do .
5 Classic Uses of Continuations
5.1 Loops
Using continuations we can write an infinite loop that allows its body expression to exit :
( define ( cycle body ) ( let / cc k ( define ( loop ) ( body k ) ( loop ) ) ( loop ) ) )
We call it like this :
( cycle ( lambda ( exit ) ( if ( = ( random 3 ) 0 ) ( exit ' done ) ) ) )
5.2 Coroutines
Many computations have a producer - consumer model , in which one process generates data , while another consumes the data .
Web sites are a good example of this : the users create inputs that the web server consumes to turn into web pages ( more on this later ) .
Many text processing tasks also have this form .
We want to write a procedure similar to
( define ( number - producer send ) ( begin ( send 1 ) ( send 2 ) ( send 3 ) ) )
where the first time we call number - producer is returns 1 , the next time it returns 2 , and the third time 3 .
The procedure make - producer takes a function of one argument , and returns a coroutine that returns values to a given continuation .
Note that we use a box .
This is a location in which we can store a value using set - box !
and retrieve the value using unbox .
( define ( make - producer body ) ( define resume ( box #f ) ) ( lambda ( real - send ) ( define send - to ( box real - send ) ) ( define ( send value - to - send ) ( set - box ! send - to ( let / cc k ( begin ( set - box ! resume k ) ( ( unbox send - to ) value - to - send ) ) ) ) ) ( if ( unbox resume ) ( ( unbox resume ) real - send ) ( body send ) ) ) )
We can now define number - producer and get
( define number - producer ( make - producer ( lambda ( send ) ( begin ( send 1 ) ( send 2 ) ( send 3 ) ) ) ) ) ( define get call / cc )
( get number - producer )
1
( get number - producer )
2
( get number - producer )
3
Space precludes discussion of the derivation of make - producer .
Luckily I ripped it straight out of Shriram Krishnamurthi's lecture notes on Continuations , which have far more discussion .
They are referenced at the end of this document .
Some languages have special support for coroutines .
The Icon language is one .
Python added a yield keyword in version 2.x , to allow people to write coroutines .
Scheme requires no special support for coroutines , as we have seen .
5.3 Other Uses of Exceptions
Continuations are useful wherever we want to alter the control flow of a computation .
Examples include :
Exceptions , including exceptions that allow you to resume the computation having fixed the problem
Backtracking as in Prolog
Non-deterministic programming
Cooperative Threading
See section 9.1 for links to papers that discuss these uses .
5.4 Continuations vs Goto
Continuations are similar to goto statements , as both allow arbitrary control flow .
However there are important differences .
Continuations jump to program states , whereas goto statements jump to labelled positions in code .
Goto statements can thus jump into non-sensical program states where variables have n't been initialised and so forth .
Continuations do n't allow this - you can only go back to an already visited program state .
In this way continuations are more controlled than goto statements .
6 Continuation Passing Style
Do we really need continuations ?
We can write in a programming style called continuation passing style ( CPS ) where every function takes an extra argument , a function to call with its result .
In CPS no function ever returns ; it always calls its continuation .
If we write code in this style we do n't need continuations .
However it is n't very convenient to write in CPS .
7 Web Applications Using Continuations
Web applications are essentially coroutines between the user and the web server .
Lots has already been written about the use of continuations in web applications .
To save my wrists I refer you to the existing literature .
See section 9.2
8 Implementing Continuations
There are three main implementation strategies for continuations .
Heap - allocated continuations .
Fast continuations but slow function calls .
Used by SIC , the SML / NJ compiler , and the Ruby language .
Stack - allocated continuations .
Fast function calls but slow continuations .
Used by just about every Scheme system that compiles to C. Segmented - stack approaches .
Fast function calls and continuations .
Used by Chex Scheme .

This modal transfer trades about 20 BTUs ( or joules ) of diesel for 1 BTU ( joule ) of electricity .
The massive gain in efficiency makes electrified railroads sustainable if social order can be maintained .
The history of railroads in the 1800s shows that oil is not essential for railroad operation and maintenance .
Some " doomers " have suggested that " running the railroads " with their essential freight and passenger service may be a key to maintaining social order .
Liquid transportation fuels are not the only option for transportation .
There is a general consensus on The Oil Drum that shifting long and medium distance inter-city freight from heavy trucks to electrified railroads is an essential " silver BB " with an implied expansion of inter-city passenger rail service on these electrified tracks .
This consensus contrasts with two competing and overlapping memes for urban transportation ; electrified urban rail and personal electric vehicles .
Thus the " and / or " in the title .
Bicycling has been largely overlooked in the discussions so far .
My formal position is at :
http://www.lightrailnow.org/features/f_lrt_2006-05a.htm
Walking and bicycling are the ideal post - Peak Oil urban transportation modes .
But they are suitable for only a few urban trips ( 0.5 % commuted by bicycle in 2000 ) and almost never used for suburban trips .
And many Americans simply cannot imagine walking to the grocery store or bicycling to the post office or work due to the post - WW II changes in our urban form and habits .
Thus the most appealing alternative for most ( but not all ) Americans contemplating post - Peak Oil is a car or SUV that pulls up to an E85 pump or just plugs in at home or work .
But I question if this is the best or even a workable solution for our society .
Suburban and exurban living requires a high energy support system for maintaining roads , providing police and postal service , package deliveries , home repair , home health care , garbage pickup , and utilities .
Police can bicycle an urban beat but not a suburban one .
Postal workers can walk an urban route but not a suburban one .
Garbage trucks , plumber vans , UPS , and every other service and support simply travel much further over many more miles of concrete and asphalt roads to service people in suburbia .
And the daily use profile for many of these service vehicles will resist electrification in suburbia .
An electric garbage truck in Phoenix ?
In addition , newer suburban & exurban construction is larger ( requiring more energy to heat , cool , and illuminate ) and lower quality ( major repairs can start in just 20 years ) .
Preserving over half of Americans in suburbia by giving them an EV to plug in at home may be feasible in the early years of post - Peak Oil ( with very adverse impacts on Global Warming ) but it will create a second crisis in a generation as oil supply shrinks further and perhaps as the US enters the early stages of Peak Coal .
In my opinion , which is still evolving , the magic bullet of an all EV solution to urban transportation is politically popular and leads to a trap .
There is also some political support for the list of urban rails appended below but this support lacks the passion of a Suburbanite desperately searching for the easiest possible way to preserve his or her way of life and property values .
The " secret " of Urban Rail is not its direct energy savings ( although excellent ) but the indirect savings by changing the urban form ( with smaller homes ) that makes walking and bicycling ( the best modes ) easier .
Ed Tennyson has estimated that US cities with Urban Rail systems ( more than one line ) use 159 gallons of gasoline less per capita per year than those without .
He also noted the declines in Washington DC Metro gasoline consumption relative to the rest of the US as line and line of DC Metro opened .
And this observed difference is with the generally minimal Urban Rail systems that US cities have .
I live in an ideal example of a walkable neighborhood supported by a streetcar line , the Lower Garden District of New Orleans .
5 grocery stores within 6 blocks ( 4 reopened ) , my tailor and insurance agent both 4 blocks away , bank 3 blocks away and the St. Charles Streetcar Line 2.5 blocks away .
We had at least 3 , perhaps 4 , GEMs ( http://www.gemcar.com ) in use in my neighborhood or nearby .
EV supporters point to the growing renewable generation and say " This is where our sustainable energy will be coming from .
What is wrong with that ? "
Were it not for the new demand from electrified transportation ( rail and EV ) this new renewable ( mainly wind ) generation would largely displace natural gas and some minimal coal generation .
New demand for electrified transportation in the next decade will run off of the marginal generation sources , which will be coal , natural gas , and conservation ( driven by cost ) for at least a decade .
Of course , more gasoline and diesel would be burned ( if available ) in a non-electrified transportation future so a no electrified transportation future is the worst of all worlds .
A crash program ( war time effort ) of HV DC lines , pumped storage and massive wind turbine installation MIGHT have North America running 100 % off of renewables and nuclear power plants for 1,000 hours / year ( out of 8.760 or 8,784 ) in a decade .
2025 would be an optimistic date for an urgent commercial effort .
Until then , we will be trading fossil fuel generated electricity for gasoline and diesel via electrification .
~ 20 to 1 gains in efficiency available from Urban Rail ( direct & indirect ) should have priority over lower gains from large EVs .
Compressed natural gas or propane vehicles would be " almost as good " as EVs at that stage .
When the marginal electrical power source comes from non-Green House Gas sources ( nuclear plus wind turbine plus other renewable ) , those 1,000 hours ( 11.4 % of the time ) will largely be late at night when there is minimal Urban Rail demand .
EVs could recharge then , for a positive improvement in reducing Green House Gases ( GHG ) and fossil fuel consumption .
My concept is that Urban Rail , bicycling , walkable neighborhoods , and massive wind turbine installations are the Phase I solution to post - Peak Oil and EVs larger than GEM will lead to a second crisis .
In Phase II , once a non-GHG grid is in place and suburbia is largely ( but not completely ) depopulated or reformed around rail stations , EVs and trolley freight may be critical in displacing the residual liquid transportation fuel use as supplies get ever tighter .
Electrified rail ( inter- city and Urban ) has a positive feedback with post - Peak Oil .
The worse things get , the more people and freight they can carry and the more efficient they become .
A crush load on a subway car or streetcar is extraordinarily energy efficient if uncomfortable .
A healthy person can bicycle six miles in the rain instead of driving if they absolutely have to .
This is far less true of EVs , coal - to - liquids , tar sands and other potential silver BBs .
A post -Peak
Oil future needs this elasticity of transportation supply which only electrified rail and bicycles can supply .
No one can precisely predict the future quantity and availability of liquid transportation fuels so crisis alternatives will be needed periodically to quickly make up shortfalls in supply .
Urban Rail can expand ridership easily , EVs can only carpool sporadically .
An odd position , Phase I - EVs not good .
Phase II - EVs good .
My policy preference for the next decade is that all public subsidies and incentives go towards electrified freight railroads , Urban Rail , bicycling , high efficiency Transit Orientated Development , solar space & water heat , and building a renewable grid , with EVs and nuclear power left to market forces .
Once a renewable + nuclear grid is in place , with a growing electrified rail system in operation , EVs should be encouraged .
This delay will also allow EV technology to mature .
My views are still evolving and I have made several conceptual jumps to get to my current nuanced position .
There are shades of grey in reality and I want aggressive but realistic approach to dealing with post - Peak Oil transportation and overall energy use .
What say you ?

Show humor : Cheney claims he 's member of Supreme Court David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This The Daily Show offered its take Tuesday night on the swirling controversy about Vice President Dick Cheney 's efforts to define his own role in our government with no consideration paid to centuries of constitutional precedent .
Referencing Cheney 's insistence he does not exist within the executive or legislative branches of government , Host Jon Stewart introduced him as " part vice president , part legislator , half she - wolf , if you will .
How else to explain those eight teats ? "
The Washington Post on Sunday revealed that Cheney keeps man-sized safes in his office for paperwork .
" Unless workaday business includes needing someplace large enough to stuff a body , why the vice president needs a man-sized safe is unclear , " Stewart said .
" Unless he says , hey Johnson , put the papers in this safe , and then stay in there with them . "
In an interview with correspondent Samantha Bee , Stewart argued the Supreme Court may not be as conservative as many fear because Justice Anthony Kennedy , who sided with conservatives on several recent 5 - 4 decisions , could just as easily side with the four liberal members of the court .
In that case , Bee said , the vote would be " 5 - 5 " because " if Kennedy were to rule on the liberal side , then Justice Cheney would cast the tie - making vote .
" The vice president is not only in both and neither of the executive and legislative branches , he 's also a member of the Supreme Court , " she tells Stewart .
" Have you read the constitution ? "
Stewart said he had read the constitution , but not that day .
" Check it again , " Bee advises .
" Article 28 , it 's in red .
I think it 's sheep 's blood . "
Dear Cecil :
Are human beings still evolving ?
Or are we devolving ?
Are our genes , when passed on to our kids , copied faithfully like a digital recording ?
Or is the process more like a photocopy of a photocopy , deteriorating more and more with each generation ?
I hope it's not the latter , because if the results are anything like those from the self - serve copy place down the street , we 're in big trouble .
David Westwood , Santa Monica , California
Cecil replies :
David , it ’s obvious you not only slept through Intro to Biology , you were a little groggy during a couple key college bull sessions , too .
We covered this topic a little after 2 AM the second month of freshman year .
The prevailing view was that humans were n’t evolving , because what with the welfare state and the miracle of modern medicine and all , natural selection ( i.e. , survival of the fittest ) had ceased to operate .
Nonsense , I argued ( correctly , of course , because even then I could see I was never wrong ) — natural selection by definition is always at work .
If nobody dies before reaching reproductive age , well , that merely meant that everybody got naturally selected .
You do n’t get it , said my opponents .
If there are n’t any differences in mortality among genotypes ( is n’t it great the way I sling these words around like you know what I ’m talking about ? ) , that means the gene pool is static and we are n’t evolving .
Sure we are , sez I .
The fundamental question is n’t whether people die young , it ’s whether they fail to reproduce , or reproduce less abundantly than others .
On this basis we can say that the genes for the following physical types or traits are slowly disappearing from the population :
(1) People so lacking in sex appeal that nobody could stand to get close enough for long enough to beget children with them .
We may thus anticipate that in the distant future people will be extremely good looking and sociable , but nobody will know how to operate the computers .
(2) Yuppieness , since yuppies typically have fewer children later than other population groups .
The people of the future , in all likelihood , will drink Bud , eat jalapenos , and believe that Cleopatra was … well , let ’s not get into it .
But you wo n’t have your parking space stolen by some sphincter in a Beamer , either .
(3) Certain other well known spiritual and physical callings , shall we say .
You know who you are .
OK , so maybe Cecil is kidding around a little .
We ca n’t assume any of the alleged traits above have a genetic basis .
What ’s more , widespread interbreeding among population groups has a leveling effect .
You generally only see noticeable changes when a group is reproductively isolated and key genes get passed around by inbreeding , as with sickle - cell anemia in blacks and Tay - Sachs disease in Jews .
But you get the idea : as long as some folks reproduce more than others for reasons related however tenuously to their genes , the gene pool is n’t completely static .
As for whether our genes are accurately reproduced , you silly goose , the genes always accurately reproduce .
Except sometimes .
On the latter occasions one of several things results : one , monsters — that is , grossly malformed babies resulting from a genetic mistake .
Years ago most monsters died , but now many can be saved .
This has made possible the National Football League .
Two , useful mutations increasing one ’s chances of reproductive success .
Think of the first little mutant to discover he could comb his hair in a ducktail .
Or , to bring up a more sober possibility , the first to become resistant to AIDS .
Three , maladaptive but not immediately fatal mutations , such as those causing certain diseases .
So yes , we ’re still evolving .
But not very quickly .
Most students of the subject say we have n’t changed much in the past 30 - 50,000 years , except that we ’re now willing to eat head cheese .
As for that sci - fi stuff about evolving giant brains … well , modesty prevents me from saying much about it .
But it sure does make it a bitch to buy hats .

In a recent issue of The American Enterprise magazine devoted to the War between the States ( see my LRC article , " AEI is Still Fighting the Civil War " ) Victor Hanson , a visiting professor at the U.S. Naval Academy , defends and makes excuses for Lincoln ’s intentional waging of war on Southern civilians .
This included the bombing , pillaging and plundering of their cities and towns , the burning of their homes , total destruction of farms and livestock , gang rape , and the killing of thousands , including women and children of all races .
( See Merchant of Terror : General Sherman and Total War by John Bennett Walters or The Hard Hand of War by Mark Grimsley ) .
It was all justified , says Hanson , because General Sherman and his men were supposedly motivated by the belief that it was necessary " to guarantee the American proposition that each man is as good as another . "
Sherman ’s " bummers , " as they were called , were " political avenging angels " who were offended by racial inequalities in the South .
They were driven by " an ideological furor , to destroy the nature of Southern aristocracy . "
The " tyrannical Southern ruling class " needed to be taught a lesson .
( Besides , he writes , " rapes during [ Sherman ’s ] march were almost unknown ) . "
In reality , neither Sherman nor his soldiers believed any of these things .
( And rapes were not as " unknown " to the Southern people as they are to Hanson ) .
In the Northern states at the time , myriad Black Codes existed that prohibited blacks from migrating into most Northern states and kept them from entering into contracts , voting , marrying whites , testifying in court against whites ( which invited criminal abuse ) , or sending their children to public schools .
They were excluded altogether from all forms of transportation or required to sit in special " Jim Crow sections . "
They were prohibited from entering hotels , restaurants or resorts except as servants , and were segregated in churches , prisons , and even cemeteries .
Free blacks in the North in the 1860s were cruelly discriminated against in every aspect of their existence , and were denied the most fundamental of citizenship rights
Sherman himself certainly did not believe that " each man is as good as another . "
For example , in 1862 Sherman was bothered that " the country " was " swarming with dishonest Jews " ( see Michael Fellman , Citizen Sherman , p. 153 ) .
He got his close friend , General Grant , to expel all Jews from his army .
As Fellman writes , " On December 17 , 1862 , Grant . . . , like a medieval monarch . . . expelled u2018 The Jews , as a class , ’ from his department . "
Sherman biographer Fellman further writes that to Sherman , the Jews were " like niggers " and " like greasers ( Mexicans ) or Indians " in that they were " classes or races permanently inferior to his own . "
The notion that Sherman ’s army was motivated by a belief that all men are created equal is belied by the further fact that just three months after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox the very same army commenced a campaign of ethnic genocide against the Plains Indians .
In July of 1865 Sherman was put in charge of the Military District of the Missouri ( all land west of the Mississippi ) and given the assignment to eradicate the Plains Indians in order to make way for the federally subsidized transcontinental railroad .
Like Lincoln , Sherman was a friend of Grenville Dodge , the chief engineer of the project .
He was also a railroad investor and he lobbied his brother , Senator John Sherman , to allocate federal funds for the transcontinental railroad .
" We are not going to let a few thieving , ragged Indians stop and check the progress of the railroad , " he wrote to General Grant in 1867 ( Fellman , p. 264 ) .
As Fellman writes :
[ T ]he great triumvirate of the Union Civil War effort [ Grant , Sherman and Sheridan ] formulated and enacted military Indian policy until reaching , by The 1880s , what Sherman sometimes referred to as " the final solution of the Indian problem , " which he defined as killing hostile Indians and segregating their pauperized survivors in remote places . . . .
These men applied their shared ruthlessness , born of their Civil War experiences , against a people all three despised , in the name of Civilization and Progress ( emphasis added ) .
Another Sherman biographer , John F. Marszalek , points out in Sherman : A Soldier ’s Passion for Order , that " Sherman viewed Indians as he viewed recalcitrant Southerners during the war and newly freed people after the war : resisters to the legitimate forces of an orderly society , " by which he meant the central government .
Moreover , writes Marszalek , Sherman ’s philosophy was that " since the inferior Indians refused to step aside so superior American culture could create success and progress , they had to be driven out of the way as the Confederates had been driven back into the Union . "
" Most of the other generals who took a direct role in the Indian wars , writes Marszalek , " were , like Sherman , [ Union ] Civil War luminaries . "
This included " John Pope , O.O. Howard , Nelson A. Miles , Alfred H. Terry , E.O.C .
Ord , C.C. Augeur , and R.S. Canby .
General Winfield Scott Hancock should be added to this list of " luminaries . "
Among the colonels , " George Armstrong Custer and Benjamin Grierson were the most famous . "
Sherman and General Phillip Sheridan were associated with the statement that " the only good Indian is a dead Indian . "
The problem with the Indians , Sherman said , was that " they did not make allowance for the rapid growth of the white race " ( Marszalek , p. 390 ) .
And , " both races cannot use this country in common " ( Fellman , p. 263 ) .
Sherman ’s theory of white racial superiority is what led him to the policy of waging war against the Indians " till the Indians are all killed or taken to a country where they can be watched . "
As Fellman ( p. 264 ) writes :
Sherman planted a racist tautology : Some Indians are thieving , killing rascals fit for death ; all Indians look alike ; therefore , to get some we must eliminate all . . . deduced from this racist tautology . . . the less destructive policy would be racial cleansing of the land . . .
Accordingly , Sherman wrote to Grant : " We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux , even to their extermination , men , women and children . "
Writing two days later to his brother John , General Sherman said : " I suppose the Sioux must be exterminated . . . " ( Fellman , p. 264 ) .
This was Sherman ’s attitude toward Southerners during the War for Southern Independence as well .
In a July 31 , 1862 letter to his wife ( from his Collected Works ) he wrote that his purpose in the war was : " Extermination , not of soldiers alone , that is the least part of the trouble , but the [ Southern ] people . "
His charming and nurturing wife Ellen wrote back that her fondest wish was for a war " of extermination and that all [ Southerners ] would be driven like the Swine into the sea . "
With this attitude , Sherman issued the following order to his troops at the beginning of the Indian Wars : " During an assault , the soldiers cannot pause to distinguish between male and female , or even discriminate as to age .
As long as resistance is made , death must be meted out . . . " ( Marszalek , p. 379 ) .
Most of the raids on Indian camps were conducted in the winter , when families would be together and could therefore all be killed at once .
Sherman gave Sheridan " authorization to slaughter as many women and children as well as men Sheridan or his subordinates felt was necessary when they attacked Indian villages " ( Fellman , p. 271 ) .
All livestock was also killed so that any survivors would be more likely to starve to death .
Sherman was once brought before a congressional committee after federal Indian agents , who were supposed to be supervising the Indians who were on reservations , witnessed " the horror of women and children under military attack . "
Nothing came of the hearings , however .
Sherman ordered his subordinates to kill the Indians without restraint to achieve what he called " the final solution of the Indian problem , " and promised that if the newspapers found out about it he would " run interference against any complaints about atrocities back East " ( Fellman , p. 271 ) .
Eight years into his war of " extermination " Sherman was bursting with pride over his accomplishments .
" I am charmed at the handsome conduct of our troops in the field , " he wrote Sheridan in 1874 .
" They go in with the relish that used to make our hearts glad in 1864 - 5 " ( Fellman , p. 272 ) .
Another part of Sherman ’s " final solution " strategy against this " inferior race " was the massive slaughter of buffalo , a primary source of food for the Indians .
If there were no longer any buffalo near where the railroad traveled , he reasoned , then the Indians would not go there either .
By 1882 the American buffalo was essentially extinct .
Ironically , some ex-slaves took part in the Indian wars .
Known as the " Buffalo Soldiers , " they assisted in the federal army ’s campaign of extermination against another colored race .
By 1890 Sherman ’s " final solution " had been achieved : The Plains Indians were all either killed or placed on reservations " where they can be watched . "
In a December 18 , 1890 letter to the New York Times Sherman expressed his deep disappointment over the fact that , were it not for " civilian interference , " his army would have " gotten rid of them all " and killed every last Indian in the U.S. ( Marszalek , p. 400 ) .
To Victor Hanson and the American Enterprise Institute this is the kind of man who " deserves a place on the roll call of great liberators in human history . "
Native Americans would undoubtedly disagree .

The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
The Poor Would Have More in a Libertarian Society ( Part II )
In a Libertarian society , what will keep the poor from starving in the streets ?
What about the homeless and the people who are handicapped ?
What proof is there that private charity will be sufficient ?
In the last month 's Libertarian Solutions , we learned how a libertarian society would provide more help to the needy than they have today .
Private charities would weed out the large number of people who choose welfare as a way of life .
Overhead would be cut in half .
Finally , the high cost of collecting taxes ( two - thirds of a dollar for every dollar collected ) would be avoided .
With these savings , contributions could be a tenth of current welfare funding - and the poor would still come out ahead !
Providing help more efficiently to those who can't help themselves is only the beginning , however .
Studies show that free markets , on average , create about ten times as much wealth as unfree ones .
Not surprisingly , the needy in a wealthy society ( e.g. , the United States ) are always better off than the needy in a poor country ( e.g. , India ) .
Thus , deregulation , which stimulates wealth creation , helps the poor even more !
A libertarian society would minimize the regulations which strangle the economy , thereby raising the standard of living for those on the bottom rungs of the ladder .
Ironically , free societies have a more even distribution of wealth than those which try to redistribute wealth forcibly !
The reason is simple : free societies provide the best opportunities for the poor to work and grow rich .
Conversely , a highly - regulated society creates poverty by destroying jobs , especially those of the disadvantaged .
During the 1980s , I gained first - hand experience of how government destroys opportunities for the poor to earn while they learn .
For example , while rehabilitating a dilapidated apartment building , a young man who wanted to better himself came by hoping for employment .
He had some disabilities that made him less than an ideal worker , but suggested that I hire him for about half of the current minimum wage .
With experience , he hoped that I would pay him more or recommend him to others .
Fearful that our arrangement would come to the attention of the ever - present building inspectors , I declined .
I only lost a potentially good worker , but the young man lost a chance to earn while he learned -- thanks to the aggression of minimum wage laws .
The very laws that were supposed to protect this young man from exploitation actually impaired his ability to get ahead .
While well - to - do youths simply pay educators to train them , the disadvantaged are shut out of the work force , sometimes permanently .
Some of my low - income tenants made their living by providing child care in their apartments or taking in mending .
One ambitious woman was able to get work sewing curtains for stores and offices .
The city regulators started calling me to complain that these women had n't paid expensive fees to register their business .
The regulators threatened to serve me with zoning violations if I did n't evict these unfortunates and destroy their livelihood .
This time I refused to be intimidated and assured my tenants that they had my support .
Unfortunately , most of them buckled under the pressure .
They could n't afford the hassle and the registration fees , so most went on welfare instead .
Licensing laws destroy jobs - especially jobs for the disadvantaged and the minorities .
Recently , Afro-American women in several states have started boutiques that braid hair exclusively .
Cosmetology licensing boards have forced many out of work by demanding that these ladies attend a year - long program , costing an average of $ 5000 , that does n't even teach braiding !
In many cities , would - be taxi and van drivers can't conduct business without paying exorbitant fees ( over $ 200,000 in New York City ) for the medallions ( licenses ) .
In some cases , the city or county wo n't grant new licenses at any price .
Such government intervention creates a great deal of poverty by putting people out of work !
Thankfully , the Institute of Justice , a libertarian law foundation , is fighting City Hall - and winning -- on behalf of the braid brigade and the would - be drivers .
The Institute 's pro bono service helps the poor help themselves .
While big government caters to the special interests who benefit from high hurdles to self - employment , libertarians are defending the rights of the working poor .
Such cases demonstrate that liberty , not government , is the true friend of the disadvantaged .
Government regulations not only put the poor out of work ; they create homelessness as well !
William Tucker , using statistical analysis , found that 42 % of homelessness could be explained by the high median price of homes in the 50 cities studied .
The median housing price , the best single predictor of homelessness , increased as zoning regulations and stringent building or housing codes did .
As a result , rents skyrocketed , pricing the poor out of the market .
When cities tried to protect the poor with rent control , the plight of the poor worsened .
Rent controls drive landlords out of business .
The few remaining landlords can pick and choose among applicants , so naturally they rent to people who are middle - class and most likely to pay .
As a result , the poor have no place to go and often end up on the streets .
Government regulations , meant to help the disadvantaged , create poverty for them instead .
On the other hand , liberty promotes prosperity , especially for the needy .
Liberty empowers the poor with the opportunity to work and grow rich , just as penniless immigrants did in the early days of our nation .
Of course , a few people will still be unable to create enough wealth to support themselves .
A libertarian nation , with its prosperity and better employment opportunities , will be much better equipped than today 's society to care for such individuals .
Government licencing , minimum wages , and welfare harm , not help , the disadvantaged .
If we truly want to help the unfortunate , we must give them the gift of liberty .
Nothing else will do .

In an exclusive interview with CNBC's Becky Quick last night ( Wednesday ) in Omaha , Warren Buffett says the current market chaos and turmoil will probably create buying opportunities for him and Berkshire Hathaway :
" You get more excited when there 's a lot going on , you can't help it .
And frankly , it will probably present more opportunity to us because when dislocations occur things get more mispriced and that sort of thing ...
" So it can be a time of opportunity .
It wo n't be for sure , but generally speaking , when there 's a certain amount of chaos in certain sections , the fallout , and its unpredictable where the fallout will be , but the fallout sometimes offers some real opportunites . "

US shot or killed 429 Iraqi civilians in the last year -- not even on raids RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 12 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get breaking politics headlines with RSS .
US soldiers in Iraq killed or wounded 429 Iraqi civilians at checkpoints or near patrols just in the last year -- according to military statistics leaked to a McClatchy Newspaper reporter .
" The numbers cover what the military calls escalation - of - force incidents , in which American troops fire at civilians who 've come too close or have approached checkpoints too quickly , " writes Nancy A. Youssef for McClatchy .
" In the months since U.S. commanders have dispatched more troops to the field  ostensibly to secure Iraqi communities  the number of Iraqis killed and injured in such incidents has spiked , the statistics show . "
" The escalation - of - force statistics , however , were part of a recent briefing given to Army Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of coalition forces in Iraq , she continues .
" They cover 3,200 incidents since July 2006 in which U.S. troops fired warning shots at Iraqi civilians .
Such incidents led to injury or death 36 times a month on average more than once a day .
" Last August , for example , 26 Iraqi civilians were killed or injured in such incidents .
The number rose to 41 the following month , as the U.S. began moving troops into some of Baghdad 's most troubled neighborhoods as part of Operation Forward Together , last year 's Baghdad security plan .
" The statistics do n't include instances of American soldiers killing civilians during raids , arrests or in the midst of battle with armed groups , and it remains unclear how the U.S. military tracks such information .
Often rotating units use their own systems , and there have been several incidents of soldiers not reporting the deaths of civilians , most notably the November 2005 shooting of 24 civilians in the northern Iraqi town of Haditha .

In my efforts to learn more about Web development and what it is like for startups adopting Web platforms I 've decided to build an application on the Facebook platform .
I have n't yet decided on an application but for the sake of argument let 's say it is a Favorite Comic Books application which allows me to store my favorite comic books and shows me to most popular comic books among my friends .
The platform requirements for the application seems pretty straightforward .
I 'll need a database and some RESTful Web services which provide access to the database from the widget which can be written in my language of choice .
I 'll also need to write the widget in FBML which will likely mean I 'll have to host images and CSS files as well .
So far nothing seems particularly esoteric .
Since I did n't want my little experiment eventually costing me a lot of money , I thought this was an excellent time to try out Amazon 's Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) and Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) services since I 'll only pay for as much resources as I use instead of paying a flat hosting fee ..
However it seems supporting this fairly straightforward application is beyond the current capabilities of EC2 + S3 .
S3 is primarily geared towards file storage so although it makes a good choice for cheaply hosting images and CSS stylesheets , it 's a not a good choice for storing relational or structured data .
If it was just searching within a single user 's data ( e.g. just searching within my favorite comics )
I could store it all in single XML file then use XPath to find what I was looking for .
However my application will need to perform aggregated queries across multiple user 's data ( i.e. looking at the favorite comics of all of my friends then fetching the most popular ones ) so a file based solution is n't a good fit .
I really want a relational database .
EC2 seemed really promising because I could create a virtual server running in Amazon 's cloud and load it up with my choice of operating system , database and Web development tools .
Unfortunately , there was a fly in the ointment .
There is no persistent storage in EC2 so if your virtual server goes down for any reason such as taking it down to install security patches or a system crash , all your data is lost .
This is a well known problem within the EC2 community which has resulted in a bunch of clever hacks being proposed by a number of parties .
In his post entitled Amazon EC2 , MySQL , Amazon S3 Jeff Barr of Amazon writes
I was on a conference call yesterday and the topic of ways to store persistent data when using Amazon EC2 came up a couple of times .
It would be really cool to have a persistent instance of a relational database like MySQL but there 's nothing like that around at the moment .
An instance can have a copy of MySQL installed and can store as much data as it would like ( subject to the 160 GB size limit for the virtual disk drive ) but there 's no way to ensure that the data is backed up in case the instance terminates without warning .
Or is there ?
It is fairly easy to configure multiple instances of MySQL in a number of master - slave , master - master , and other topologies .
The master instances produce a transaction log each time a change is made to a database record .
The slaves or co-masters keep an open connection to the master , reading the changes as they are logged and mimicing the change on the local copy .
There can be some replication delay for various reasons , but the slaves have all of the information needed to maintain exact copies of the database tables on the master .
Besides the added complexity this places on the application , it still is n't fool proof as is pointed out in the various comments in response to Jeff 's post .
Demitrious Kelly who also realizes the problems with relying on replication to solve the persistence problem proposed an alternate solution in his post MySQL on Amazon EC2 ( my thoughts ) where he writes
Step # 2 : I ’m half the instance I used to be !
With each AMI you get 160 GB of ( mutable ) disk space , and almost 2GB of ram , and the equivalent of a Xeon 1.75 Ghz processor .
Now divide that , roughly , in half .
You ’ve done that little math exercise because your one AMI is going to act as 2 AMI 's .
Thats right .
I ’m recommending running two separate instances of MySQL on the single server .
Before you start shouting at the heretic , hear me out !
+-----------+
+-----------+
| Server A | | Server B |
+-----------+
+-----------+
| My | My | | My | My |
| sQ | sQ | | sQ | sQ |
| l | l | | l | l |
| | | | | |
| #2<=== # 1 <=== > # 1 ===>#2 |
| | | | | |
+ - - - - - + + - - - - - +
On each of our servers , MySQL # 1 and # 2 both occupy a max of 70 Gb of space .
The MySQL # 1 instances of all the servers are setup in a master - master topography .
And the # 2 instance is setup as a slave only of the # 1 instance on the same server .
so on server A MySQL # 2 is a copy ( one way ) of # 1 on server A .
With the above setup * if * server B were to get restarted for some reason you could : A ) shut down the MySQL instance # 2 on server A. Copy that MySQL # 2 over to Both slots on server B. Bring up # 1 on server B ( there should be no need to reconfigure its replication relationship because # 2 pointed at # 1 on server A already ) .
Bring up # 2 on server B , and reconfigure replication to pull from # 1 on ServerB .
This whole time # 1 on Server A never went down .
Your services were never disrupted .
Also with the setup above it is possible ( and advised ) to regularly shut down # 2 and copy it into S3 .
This gives you one more layer of fault tollerance ( and , I might add , the ability to backup without going down . )
Both solutions are fairly complicated , error prone and still do n't give you as much reliability as you would get if you simply had a hard disk that did n't lose all its data when you rebooted the server goes down .
At this point it is clear that a traditional hosted service solution is the route to go .
Any good suggestions for server - side LAMP or WISC hosting that wo n't cost an arm and a leg ?
Is Joyent any good ?
PS : It is clear this is a significant problem for Amazon 's grid computing play and one that has to be fixed if the company is serious about getting into the grid computing game and providing a viable alternative to startups looking for a platform to build the next " Web 2.0 " hit .
Building a large scale , distributed , relational database then making it available to developers as a platform is unprecedented so they have their work cut out for them .
I 'd incorrectly assumed that BigTable was the precedent for this but I 've since learned that BigTable is more like a large scale , distributed , spreadsheet table as opposed to a relational database .
This explains a lot of the characteristics of the query API of Google Base .

The New York Times on Sunday revealed that Trump paid just $ 750 in federal income taxes in 2016 , the year he won the presidency , and in 2017 , his first year in office .
To see the problem , imagine playing God with the cosmos .
Before you is a designer machine that lets you tinker with the basics of physics .
Twiddle this knob and you make all electrons a bit lighter , twiddle that one and you make gravity a bit stronger , and so on .
It happens that you need to set thirtysomething knobs to fully describe the world about us .
The crucial point is that some of those metaphorical knobs must be tuned very precisely , or the universe would be sterile .
Example : neutrons are just a tad heavier than protons .
If it were the other way around , atoms could n't exist , because all the protons in the universe would have decayed into neutrons shortly after the big bang .
No protons , then no atomic nucleuses and no atoms .
No atoms , no chemistry , no life .
Like Baby Bear 's porridge in the story of Goldilocks , the universe seems to be just right for life .
So what 's going on ?
The intelligent design movement has inevitably seized on the Goldilocks enigma as evidence of divine providence , prompting a scientific backlash and boosting the recent spate of God- bashing bestsellers .
Fuelling the controversy is an unanswered question lurking at the very heart of science - the origin of the laws of physics .
Where do they come from ?
Why do they have the form that they do ?
Traditionally , scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply " given " , elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth , and fixed thereafter .
Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science .
But the embarrassment of the Goldilocks enigma has prompted a rethink .
The Cambridge cosmologist Martin Rees , president of The Royal Society , suggests the laws of physics are n't absolute and universal but more akin to local bylaws , varying from place to place on a mega - cosmic scale .
A God 's - eye view would show our universe as merely a single representative amid a vast assemblage of universes , each with its own bylaws .
Rees calls this system " the multiverse " , and it is an increasingly popular idea among cosmologists .
Only rarely within the variegated cosmic quilt will a universe possess bio-friendly laws and spawn life .
It would then be no surprise that we find ourselves in a universe apparently customised for habitation ; we could hardly exist in one where life is impossible .
If Rees is right , the impression of design is illusory : our universe has simply hit the jackpot in a gigantic cosmic lottery .
The multiverse theory certainly cuts the ground from beneath intelligent design , but it falls short of a complete explanation of existence .
For a start , there has to be a physical mechanism to make all those universes and allocate bylaws to them .
This process demands its own laws , or meta - laws .
Where do they come from ?
The problem has simply been shifted up a level from the laws of the universe to the meta - laws of the multiverse .
The root cause of all the difficulty can be traced to the fact that both religion and science appeal to some agency outside the universe to explain its lawlike order .
Dumping the problem in the lap of a pre-existing designer is no explanation at all , as it merely begs the question of who designed the designer .
But appealing to a host of unseen universes and a set of unexplained meta - laws is scarcely any better .
This shared failing is no surprise , because the very notion of physical law has its origins in theology .
The idea of absolute , universal , perfect , immutable laws comes straight out of monotheism , which was the dominant influence in Europe at the time science as we know it was being formulated by Isaac Newton and his contemporaries .
Just as classical Christianity presents
God as upholding the natural order from beyond the universe , so physicists envisage their laws as inhabiting an abstract transcendent realm of perfect mathematical relationships .
Furthermore , Christians believe the world depends utterly on God for its existence , while the converse is not the case .
Correspondingly , physicists declare that the universe is governed by eternal laws , but the laws remain impervious to events in the universe .
I think this entire line of reasoning is now outdated and simplistic .
We will never fully explain the world by appealing to something outside it that must simply be accepted on faith , be it an unexplained God or an unexplained set of mathematical laws .
Can we do better ?
Yes , but only by relinquishing the traditional idea of physical laws as fixed , perfect relationships .
I propose instead that the laws are more like computer software : programs being run on the great cosmic computer .
They emerge with the universe at the big bang and are inherent in it , not stamped on it from without like a maker 's mark .
Man -made computers are limited in their performance by finite processing speed and memory .
So , too , the cosmic computer is limited in power by its age and the finite speed of light .
Seth Lloyd , an engineer at MIT , has calculated how many bits of information the observable universe has processed since the big bang .
The answer is one followed by 122 zeros .
Crucially , however , the limit was smaller in the past because the universe was younger .
Just after the big bang , when the basic properties of the universe were being forged , its information capacity was so restricted that the consequences would have been profound .
Here 's why .
If a law is a truly exact mathematical relationship , it requires infinite information to specify it .
In my opinion , however , no law can apply to a level of precision finer than all the information in the universe can express .
Infinitely precise laws are an extreme idealisation with no shred of real world justification .
In the first split second of cosmic existence , the laws must therefore have been seriously fuzzy .
Then , as the information content of the universe climbed , the laws focused and homed in on the life - encouraging form we observe today .
But the flaws in the laws left enough wiggle room for the universe to engineer its own bio-friendliness .
Thus , three centuries after Newton , symmetry is restored : the laws explain the universe even as the universe explains the laws .
If there is an ultimate meaning to existence , as I believe is the case , the answer is to be found within nature , not beyond it .
The universe might indeed be a fix , but if so , it has fixed itself .

RICHES do not necessarily make happiness , but a poll of 130 countries by Gallup found more people in wealthy places ( America , Europe , Japan , Saudi Arabia ) consider themselves happy , while those in poor countries ( in Africa especially ) generally do not .
A map of the results , therefore , looks rather like an income plot of the world .
There are a few exceptions .
Mid-income Costa Ricans and Venezuelans are among the happiest on the planet .
Georgians and Armenians , although not terribly poor , are among the glummest .
Researchers using nanotechnology have taken a step toward creating an " optical cloaking " device that could render objects invisible by guiding light around anything placed inside this " cloak . "
The Purdue University engineers , following mathematical guidelines devised in 2006 by physicists in the United Kingdom , have created a theoretical design that uses an array of tiny needles radiating outward from a central spoke .
The design , which resembles a round hairbrush , would bend light around the object being cloaked .
Background objects would be visible but not the object surrounded by the cylindrical array of nano - needles , said Vladimir Shalaev , Purdue 's Robert and Anne Burnett Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
These two images ( Cloak off , top .
Cloak on , bottom ) were taken from corresponding videos depicting scientific simulations performed at Purdue to show how objects might be " cloaked " to render them invisible .
The new findings demonstrate how to cloak objects for any single wavelength , not for the entire frequency range of the visible spectrum .
But the research represent a step toward creating an optical cloaking device that might work one day for all wavelengths of visible light .
The videos show how light interacts with an uncloaked and cloaked object .
When uncloaked , as depicted in the first image , light waves strike the object and bounce backward .
As depicted in the second image , a cloaking device designed using nanotechnology guides light around anything placed inside this cloak .

The design does , however , have a major limitation :
It works only for any single wavelength , and not for the entire frequency range of the visible spectrum , Shalaev said .
" But this is a first design step toward creating an optical cloaking device that might work for all wavelengths of visible light , " he said .
Research findings are detailed in a paper appearing this month in the journal Nature Photonics .
The paper , which is appearing online this week , was co-authored by doctoral students Wenshan Cai and Uday K. Chettiar , research scientist Alexander V. Kildishev and Shalaev , all in Purdue 's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
Calculations indicate the device would make an object invisible in a wavelength of 632.8 nanometers , which corresponds to the color red .
The same design , however , could be used to create a cloak for any other single wavelength in the visible spectrum , Shalaev said .
" How to create a design that works for all colors of visible light at the same time will be a big technical challenge , but we believe it 's possible , " he said .
" It is clearly doable .
In principle , this cloak could be arbitrarily large , as large as a person or an aircraft . "
The research is based at the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Purdue 's Discovery Park .
Other researchers published findings in 2006 describing the mathematics generally required for the optical cloaking device .
Those researchers include : John Pendry at the Imperial College in London , along with David Schurig and David R. Smith at Duke University , and simultaneously , Ulf Leonhardt at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
" These mathematical requirements were very general , and then we determined how to fulfill the requirements with a specific design , " Shalaev said .
Leonhardt , a professor of theoretical physics , wrote a commentary piece about the Purdue paper appearing in the same issue of Nature Photonics .
In the commentary , he compares the Purdue design to the Roman creation of " the first optical metamaterial , " a type of glass containing nanometer - scale particles of gold .
In ordinary daylight , a cup made of the glass appeared green , but then it glowed ruby when illuminated from the inside .
The Purdue research , Leonhardt writes , represents " ... theoretical simulations that show that a modified Roman cup based on modern nanofabrication technology will act as an invisibility device ...
Any object you put inside will disappear as if dissolved in air , provided it is viewed through polarizing tinted glasses of precisely that colour . "
Other researchers have developed concepts for cloaking objects smaller than the wavelengths of visible light and for objects detected in the microwave range of the spectrum , which are much larger than the wavelengths of visible light .
But the new design is the first for cloaking an arbitrary object in the range of light visible to humans .
" What we propose is the cloaking of objects of any shape and size , " Shalaev said .
Two requirements are needed to render an object invisible : Light must not reflect off of the object , and the light must bend around the object so that people would see only the background and not the cloaked object itself .
" If you satisfied only the first requirement of preventing light from reflecting off of the object , you would still see the dark shadowlike shape of the object , so you would know something was there , " Shalaev said .
" The most difficult requirement is to bend light around the cloaked object so that the background is visible but not the object being cloaked .
The viewer would , in effect , be seeing around , or through , the object . "
The device would be made of so - called " non-magnetic metamaterials . "
Meta in Greek means beyond , so the term metamaterial means to create something that does n't exist in nature .
Unlike designs for invisibility in the microwave range , the new design has no magnetic properties .
Having no magnetic properties makes it much easier to cloak objects in the visible range but also causes a small amount of light to reflect off of the cloaked object .
" But this could , in principle , be offset by other means , for example , with antireflective coatings , " Shalaev said .
" The big challenge is how to make rays bend around the object , which we have described how to do in this paper . "
A key factor in the design is the ability to reduce the " index of refraction " to less than 1 .
Refraction occurs as electromagnetic waves , including light , bend when passing from one material into another .
Refraction causes the bent - stick - in - water effect , which occurs when a stick placed in a glass of water appears bent when viewed from the outside .
Each material has its own refraction index , which describes how much light will bend in that particular material and defines how much the speed of light slows down while passing through a material .
Natural materials typically have refractive indices greater than 1 .
The new design reduces a refractive index to values gradually varying from zero at the inner surface of the cloak , to 1 at the outer surface of the cloak , which is required to guide light around the cloaked object .
Creating the tiny needles would require the same sort of equipment already used to fabricate nanotech devices .
The needles in the theoretical design are about as wide as 10 nanometers , or billionths of a meter , and as long as hundreds of nanometers .
They would be arranged in layers emanating from a central spoke in a cylindrical shape .
A single nanometer is roughly the size of 20 hydrogen atoms strung together .
Although the design would work only for one frequency , it still might have applications , such as producing a cloaking system to make soldiers invisible to night - vision goggles .
" Because night - imaging systems detect only a specific wavelength , you could , in theory , design something that cloaks in that narrow band of light , " Shalaev said .
Another possible application is to cloak objects from " laser designators " used by the military to illuminate a target , he said .
Leonhardt says in his commentary that creating a cloak for rendering total invisibility in the entire visible spectrum would require " further advances in optical metamaterials , new combinations of nanotechnology with highly abstract ideas ... "

Remote control cameras have been installed in Sita 's paddock
Sita the rhino
Sita , a one - tonne black rhino , is due to give birth this month at Paignton Zoo , in Devon , where cameras are being trained on her paddock 24 hours a day .
The zoo said there was no existing footage of a black rhino being born in a zoo anywhere in the world .
The birth , the zoo 's first rhino calf , is part of its on - going endangered species programme .
A first - time mother , 16 - year - old Sita was moved from the Berlin Zoo to Devon in 2002 .
Her mate , Kingo , is 23 years old , weighs in at 1.8 tonnes , and lives in an adjacent paddock .
It 's good educational material and scientists will learn a lot from it
Philip Knowling , Paignton Zoo spokesman
Sita is expected to give birth later this month or in early February , following a 15 - month gestation period .
She will stay with her calf until it is able to look after itself , but the zoo is also preparing to hand - rear it .
Senior keeper Jason Knight said : " We hope it will all go smoothly , but there is a chance that the calf could be rejected by its mother , or it could be still - born .
" We are hoping for the best but we must be prepared for any eventuality . "
Scientific research
Zookeepers and animal scientists worldwide are expected to watch the images to learn more about the births , the zoo said .
The zoo is preparing to hand - rear the calf if it is rejected by Sita
Philip Knowling , spokesman said : " It 's good educational material and scientists will learn a lot from it . "
The BBC has installed remote control and infrared cameras in the rhino house and British Telecom has sponsored a high - speed broadband line so the images can be streamed on - demand on the BBC Devon website .
Paignton
Zoo is one of only four zoos in the UK with black rhinos and supports rhino conservation work in Zimbabwe and Malawi .
All five species of rhino are endangered , with black rhinos suffering a huge population decline of 96 % during the 1970s and 80s .
Sita 's story will be screened during the upcoming series of BBC1's Inside Out on Fridays from Friday .
Claim : A man soared three miles above Los Angeles in an “ aircraft ” consisting of an aluminum lawn chair tethered to helium weather balloons .
Status : True .
Origins :
In 1997 , a story about a lawnchair balloonist named Larry Walters began to circulate all over the Internet as a tale about another putative winner of the “ Darwin Award ” for stupidity above and beyond the call of duty .
The story was essentially true , although Larry had actually made his flight fifteen years earlier , and many of the details presented in the 1997 version were made - up or greatly embellished .
First , the account of Larry ’s flight as it appeared on the Internet in 1997 :
Larry ’s boyhood dream was to fly .
When he graduated from high school , he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot .
Unfortunately , poor eyesight disqualified him .
When he was finally discharged , he had to satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard .
Larry ’s boyhood dream was to fly .
When he graduated from high school , he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot .
Unfortunately , poor eyesight disqualified him .
When he was finally discharged , he had to satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard .
One day , Larry , had a bright idea .
He decided to fly .
He went to the local Army - Navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and several tanks of helium .
The weather balloons , when fully inflated , would measure more than four feet across .
Back home , Larry securely strapped the balloons to his sturdy lawn chair .
He anchored the chair to the bumper of his jeep and inflated the balloons with the helium .
He climbed on for a test while it was still only a few feet above the ground .
Satisfied it would work , Larry packed several sandwiches and a six - pack of Miller Lite , loaded his pellet gun-figuring he could pop a few balloons when it was time to descend - and went back to the floating lawn chair .
He tied himself in along with his pellet gun and provisions .
Larry ’s plan was to lazily float up to a height of about 30 feet above his back yard after severing the anchor and in a few hours come back down .
Things did n’t quite work out that way .
When he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep , he did n’t float lazily up to 30 or so feet .
Instead he streaked into the LA sky as if shot from a cannon .
He did n’t level of at 30 feet , nor did he level off at 100 feet .
After climbing and climbing , he leveled off at 11,000 feet .
At that height he could n’t risk shooting any of the balloons , lest he unbalance the load and really find himself in trouble .
So he stayed there , drifting , cold and frightened , for more than 14 hours .
Then he really got in trouble .
He found himself drifting into the primary approach corridor of Los Angeles International Airport .
A United pilot first spotted Larry .
He radioed the tower and described passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun .
Radar confirmed the existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above the airport .
LAX emergency procedures swung into full alert and a helicopter was dispatched to investigate .
LAX is right on the ocean .
Night was falling and the offshore breeze began to flow .
It carried Larry out to sea with the helicopter in hot pursuit .
Several miles out , the helicopter caught up with Larry .
Once the crew determined that Larry was not dangerous , they attempted to close in for a rescue but the draft from the blades would push Larry away whenever they neared .
Finally , the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred feet above Larry and lowered a rescue line .
Larry snagged the line and was hauled back to shore .
The difficult maneuver was flawlessly executed by the helicopter crew .
As soon as Larry was hauled to earth , he was arrested by waiting members of the LAPD for violating LAX airspace .
As he was led away in handcuffs , a reporter dispatched to cover the daring rescue asked why he had done it .
Larry stopped , turned and replied nonchalantly , “ A man ca n’t just sit around . ”
The incredible flight of Larry Walters , a 33 - year - old Vietnam veteran and North Hollywood truck driver with no pilot or balloon training , took place on 2 July 1982 .
Larry filled 45 weather balloons with helium and tethered them in four tiers to an aluminum lawn chair he purchased at Sears for $ 110 , loading his makeshift aircraft ( dubbed the “ Inspiration I ” ) with a large bottle of soda , milk jugs full of water for ballast , a pellet gun , a portable CB radio , an altimeter , and a
camera .
Donning a parachute , Larry climbed into his chair from the roof of his girlfriend ’s home in San Pedro while two friends stood at the ready to untether the craft .
He took off a little earlier than expected , however , when his mooring line was cut by the roof ’s sharp edges .
As friends , neighbors , reporters and cameramen looked on , Larry Walters rocketed into the sky above San Pedro .
A few minutes later Larry radioed the ground that he was sailing across Los Angeles Harbor towards Long Beach .
Walters had planned to fly 300 miles into the Mojave Desert , but the balloons took him up faster than expected and the wind did n’t cooperate , and Walters quickly found himself drifting 16,000 feet above Long Beach .
( He later reported that he was “ so amazed by the view ” that he “ did n’t even take one picture . ” )
As Larry and his lawnchair drifted into the approach path to Long Beach Municipal Airport , perplexed pilots from two passing Delta and TWA airliners alerted air traffic controllers about what appeared to be an unprotected man floating through the sky in a chair .
Meanwhile , Larry , feeling cold and dizzy in the thin air three miles above the ground , shot several of his balloons with the pellet gun to bring himself back down to earth .
He attempted to aim his descent at a large expanse of grass of a north Long Beach country club , but Larry came up short and ended up entangling his tethers in a set of high - voltage power lines in Long Beach about ten miles from his liftoff site .
The plastic tethers protected Walters from electrocution as he dangled above the ground until firemen and utility crews could cut the power to the lines ( blacking out a portion of Long Beach for twenty minutes ) .
Larry managed to maneuver his chair over a wall , step out , and cut the chair free .
( He gave away the chair to some admiring neighborhood children , a decision he later regretted when his impromptu flight brought him far more fame than he had anticipated . )
Larry , who had just set a new altitude record for a flight with gas - filled clustered balloons ( although his record was not officially recognized because he had not carried a proper altitude - recording device with him )
became an instant celebrity , but the Federal Aviation Administration was not amused .
Unable to revoke Walters ’ pilot ’s license because he did n’t have one , an FAA official announced that they would charge Walters “ as soon as we figure out which part [ of the FAA code ] he violated . ”
Larry hit the talk show circuit , appearing with Johnny Carson and David Letterman , hosting at a New York bar filled with lawn chairs for the occasion , and receiving an award from the Bonehead Club of Dallas while the FAA pondered his case .
After Walters ’ hearing before an agency panel , the FAA announced on 17 December 1982 that they were fining him $ 4,000 for violating four regulations : operating “ a civil aircraft for which there is not currently in effect an air - worthiness certificate , ” creating a collision danger to other aircraft , entering an airport traffic area “ without establishing and maintaining two - way communications with the control tower , ” and failing to take care to prevent hazards to the life and property of others .
Larry quickly indicated that he intended to challenge the fines , stating sardonically that if “ the FAA was around when the Wright Brothers were testing their aircraft , they would never have been able to make their first flight at Kitty Hawk . ”
He also informed the FAA ( and reporters ) that he could n’t possibly pay the fine , because he ’d put all the money he could save or borrow into his flight .
In April the FAA signalled their willingness to compromise by dropping one of the charges ( they ’d decided his lawnchair did n’t need an air - worthiness certificate after all ) and lowering the fine to $ 3,000 .
Walters countered by offering to admit to failing to maintain two - way radio contact with the airport and to pay a $ 1,000 penalty if the other two charges were dropped .
The FAA eventually agreed to accept a $ 1,500 payment because “ the flight was potentially unsafe , but Walters had not intended to endanger anyone . ”
After Larry told interviewers that he did n’t have a job or money and could use all the help he could get , patrons at Jumbo ’s Diner in Port Richmond , California , took up a collection for him .
Despite his punishment , Walters did n’t rule out the possibility of another flight .
“ We ’ve been looking at the Bahamas and a couple of other possibilities .
It depends on whether or not I can get somebody to finance it , because I sure can ’t , ” he stated .
Although Larry Walters never made another balloon flight , he did inspire someone else to try the same feat .
On 1 January 1984 , a licensed pilot , parachutist , and chute rigger named Kevin Walsh outfitted himself with 57 weather balloons , each six feet in diameter .
Armed with five knives and carrying a parachute , Walsh tethered himself to the helium - filled balloons ( no chair ) and took off from Minuteman Airfield in Stow , Massachusetts , at 7:00 AM on New Year ’s Day .
He shot into the sky even faster than Larry had , hitting the 1,000 - foot mark in twelve seconds , reaching 6,000 feet in two minutes , and peaking at 9,000 feet after four minutes .
When one of Walsh ’s balloons popped , he came back down to 6,000 feet and settled in to enjoy the view .
He had wrapped his tether lines in foil in the hope that they would show up on radar , and , sure enough , he was picked up on the screens of controllers at Boston ’s Logan airport , where he produced a radar blip the size of three stacked jetliners .
After a 45 - minute flight Walsh cut himself free of the balloons and parachuted to the ground , landing in Hudson and walking away .
Kevin claimed that he had been planning his flight for seven years and did it “ just to make a positive statement about mankind . ”
Walters had been his inspiration : “ I had to commend him for his ingenuity .
That ’s when my dream hooked up with reality . ”
Kevin Walsh soon found himself the recipient of the same kind of attention as his hero when he was cited with four violations of FAA regulations and fined $ 4,000 .
Although Walters ’ flight brought him instant fame , it never proved very lucrative for him .
He was paid a few hundred dollars here and there for television appearances and made a little money as a motivational speaker , but it was n’t until Timex paid him $ 1,000 in 1992 to appear in print advertisements featuring “ adventurous individuals wearing Timex watches ” that he saw any real payoff .
Even then , he still had n’t recouped the estimated $ 4,000 it had cost him to make the flight ten years earlier .
Not much else in life worked out for Larry , either — he broke up with his girlfriend of fifteen years , his speaking career did n’t pan out , and he worked only sporadically as a security guard .
On 6 October 1993 , Larry hiked to one of his favorite spots in Angeles National Forest and put a bullet through his heart .
It was a sad end for the man who had made one the most celebrated flights since Lindbergh , a man who said , “ It was something I had to do .
I had this dream for twenty years , and if I had n’t done it , I think I would have ended up in the funny farm .
I did n’t think that by fulfilling my goal in life — my dream — that I would create such a stir and make people laugh . ”
Remarkably , Walters seemingly original plan to float up into the sky in a chair tethered to balloons then shoot them down one by one when he wanted to return to terra firma was eerily presaged by an E. B . White piece which appeared in The New Yorker sometime between 1936 and 1954 .
As reprinted in a 1984 collection of E. B .
White tales , the pieces titled “ Professor Picard Before ” and “ Professor Picard After ” recount the saga of an adventurous professor who believed he could travel to the outer spheres in a basket attached to 2,000 toy balloons and would be able to bring himself back down by shooting out some of them .
This being a work of fiction , though Picard descends in flames , he emerges unhurt and choked with laughter .
Sightings : A fictionalized version of Larry Walters ’ story was the basis for the musical “ The Flight of the Lawn Chair Man , ” which played in Philadelphia in 2000 .

Swearing on the swingset
Batman is married and has kids
And only I know his true identity
( April 20th , 2008 / 25 comments )
Uncle Ricky was a bit off - kilter and wild most of the time .
I never knew him very well - most of my memories come from a caving trip I took with a group of youth from the church .
He was chosen to accompany the group as an adult / chaperone .
It seemed like an odd choice , given that most of us kids had more maturity in our boogers than Ricky , but none of us were about to complain .
Everybody loved Uncle Ricky
Uncle Ricky always had something goofy to say about everything .
It only took a few hours with him before you started to wonder if a word ever came out of his mouth that was n't some kind of double entendre or joke - gone - juvenile .
You could usually locate him by following the sounds of sodas spurting forth from the nostrils of the teenagers flocked around .
I should clear up that Ricky was n't my uncle .
In fact , I 'm not even sure if he was truly related by blood to anyone I know , but when you hang out with a bunch of Filipinos , you get used to calling everyone uncle , auntie , cousin , etc .
They called him Uncle Ricky , so I did too .
Into the bat cave
When we made it to the cave , it was already dark outside , so it did n't take long for any and all light from outside to be squashed by the weight of the enormous mountain looming inches above our hard hats .
I started to become rather troubled by the immersive blackness I was descending into .
The narrow wedges of dancing dust my head lamp made ahead did little to alleviate my fear , especially when every direction I pointed them in revealed the same cold , dripping rock .
I found myself near the back of the group , hesitant to be at the front of the exploration .
When the multi-headed demon monster from the depths of the earth attacked , I wanted to be the last person whose ribcage was collapsed and cracked by its crushing mandibles .
Batman to the rescue !
Uncle Ricky had been given the task of staying at the end of the line .
His job was to make sure the whole group stayed together and no one slipped too far behind or got disoriented and turned around .
As I fell farther and farther towards the back of the line , becoming more and more freaked out by the claustrophobia that was creeping into my brain , I heard him behind me , singing songs and speaking in silly voices about God knows what .
Then out of nowhere , he appeared in front of me , his head lamp shining directly into my eyes and mine in his .
The secret identity ... revealed !
" I have a secret for you , " Ricky whispered , his face as serious as full - blown genital herpes .
" You do n't need to be afraid of anything ... I'm Batman ! "
With that , he reached up , switched off his head lamp and leapt out of my beam of light , cackling like a madman and hopping wildly into the darkness .
I instantly forgot about the damp , thick air surrounding me and the endless black that lay in every direction .
I followed him with my light as he bounced from rock to rock , pausing atop each one in some kind of action - pose before springing off again , his arms and legs flailing in all directions .
Keeping Gotham safe
For the rest of the trip , Uncle Ricky kept me constant company at the end of the line , telling me jokes and making me laugh until it echoed from every direction .
I did n't realize it then , but he knew exactly what he was doing and because of him , I made it back to the surface without experiencing another moment of fear or anxiety .
Once a hero ...
After the caving trip ended , so did my contact with Uncle Ricky .
I heard his name from time to time , usually in the form of " OMFG , did you hear what Uncle Ricky did ? " or " Uncle Ricky is insane - you should have seen when he ... " but I never saw him again .
That was over ten years ago .
Today I learned that Uncle Ricky has two little boys now .
" God must have been sleeping on the job that day , allowing Ricky to have kids ! " someone joked .
Then a story was told about one of his sons who became upset when he learned that his father was Asian , because he had never seen him fly like the Asians in all the Kung - fu movies .
If he 's anything like I remember him , he might not be able to fly , but Uncle Ricky is still a super - hero and I 'll bet his boys will never be afraid of the dark .

America 's top spy says extensive domestic surveillance continues ; Leaves out great deal Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
An article in July 's edition of the journal Foreign Affairs gives Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell an opportunity to outline his plans for ' Overhauling Intelligence . '
The article is notable both for what it includes - a discussion of domestic intelligence gathering activities - as well as what it leaves out .
While earlier public statements and writings from McConnell have emphasized the need to modernize the laws governing intelligence gathering , the nation 's second National Intelligence Director excluded those issues from this article .
In McConnell 's 10 - page essay , he puts the threat of terrorist groups to US interests up front , and discusses the activities that are being conducted in the US to counter the danger .
One major challenge the Bush appointee focuses on " is determining how and when it is appropriate to conduct surveillance of a group of Americans who are , say , influenced by al Qaeda 's jihadist philosophy .
On one level , they are U.S. citizens engaging in free speech and associating freely with one another .
On another , they could be plotting terrorist attacks that could kill hundreds of people . "
Taking up this challenge , McConnell states that civil liberties watchdogs within his office are working to balance the privacy needs of Americans with the intelligence community 's efforts to sift through the data it collects .
" New technology being developed by the Office of the DNI 's chief information officer and chief technology officer to access and process vast amounts of digital data to find terrorist - related information is being overseen by the DNI 's Privacy and Civil Liberties Office , " he writes .
McConnell also discusses what he sees as a need to cooperate more with local law enforcement authorities in the United States .
" The way to do so would be to share threat information with state and local officials as well as members of the private sector .
The unique contribution made by men and women on the ground is vital to U.S. national security , " he writes , identifying some examples in which local authorities uncovered purported terrorists threats .
" State and local partners should no longer be treated as only first responders ; they are also the first lines of prevention . "
Perhaps more notable than what McConnell says in his article is what he leaves out .
He does not expand upon or echo the message he delivered in a May 21 op - ed in the Washington Post on the need to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" If we are to improve our ability to protect the country by gathering foreign intelligence , this law must be updated to reflect changes in technology and the ways our adversaries communicate with one another , " the National Intelligence Director wrote at the time .
These issues that McConnell left out from his article on ' Overhauling Intelligence ' produced significant criticism from intelligence watchdogs in Congress .
Rep. Silvestre Reyes , who chairs the House Intelligence Committee had before the Post op - ed was published told RAW STORY that he was ' deeply troubled ' by McConnell 's requests for freeing the government 's hand on wiretapping .
He expanded on his criticism in a response to the opinion piece .
" In his May 21 op - ed , Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , tried to make the case for the administration 's new proposal for rewriting FISA .
But his complaints about the current system were inaccurate , " wrote Rep. Reyes ( D - TX ) in the May 30 response .
" In fact , I believe it was the administration 's cumbersome , uncoordinated process and not the statutory requirements that led the president to authorize an end - run around FISA . "
McConnell also touched other subjects in his Foreign Affairs article .
For one , he discussed the new technology being used by the Federal Bureau of Intelligence overseas to identify individuals who are ' in custody . '
" [ The Rapid Technology Transition Initiative ] has already shown its value .
Since its deployment late last year , the FBI 's Biometric Quick Capture Platform - a portable database funded through RTTI - has facilitated the biometric identification of suspects in custody overseas .... the bureau 's field personnel were using this tool to identify whether individuals in custody overseas had criminal records or were dangerous threats to U.S. forces , " he wrote .
Notably , McConnell did not say in whose custody such detainees were being held at the time the FBI employed this tool .
Additionally , McConnell identified some of the major targets of the US intelligence community other than terrorists affiliated with al Qaida .
" The U.S. intelligence community also needs to know where collection gaps exist , where it needs greater specific intelligence , and on what areas it is overly focused , " he writes .
" Some gains have been made with the creation of mission managers - a recommendation of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission - who oversee and manage high - interest topics , such as North Korea , Iran , Cuba , and Venezuela , and counterterrorism , counterproliferation , and counterintelligence , for appropriate collection and analysis . "

Spring is in full swing now , and a number of the straphangers ( read : subway riders ) in New York City , as well as citizens in other locales , are getting new tubes and tires and dragging their bikes out of storage .
Bicycle riding is the skill you reportedly never forget , but there 's a raging debate about whether or not you should forget your helmet when you hop on your two - wheeler .
Last September a plucky psychologist at the University of Bath in England announced the results of a study in which he played both researcher and guinea pig .
An avid cyclist , Ian Walker had heard several complaints from fellow riders that wearing a helmet seemed to result in bike riders receiving far less room to maneuver — effectively increasing the chances of an accident .
So , Walker attached ultrasonic sensors to his bike and rode around Bath , allowing 2,300 vehicles to overtake him while he was either helmeted or naked - headed .
In the process , he was actually contacted by a truck and a bus , both while helmeted — though , miraculously , he did not fall off his bike either time .
His findings , published in the March 2007 issue of Accident Analysis & Prevention , state that when Walker wore a helmet drivers typically drove an average of 3.35 inches closer to his bike than when his noggin was n't covered .
But , if he wore a wig of long , brown locks — appearing to be a woman from behind — he was granted 2.2 inches more room to ride .
" The implication , " Walker says , " is that any protection helmets give is canceled out by other mechanisms , such as riders possibly taking more risks and / or changes in how other road users behave towards cyclists . "
The extra leeway granted to him when he pretended to be a woman , he explains , could result from several factors , including drivers ' perceptions that members of the fairer sex are less capable riders , more frail or just less frequent bikers than men .
Randy Swart , founder of the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute ( BHSI ) , says that studies such as Walker 's run the risk of misleading cyclists as to the effectiveness of helmets .
" The cars were giving him , on average , a very wide passing clearance already , " he explains , noting that most vehicles typically stayed well over three feet from the bikes , rendering the 3.35 - inch discrepancy to be insignificant .
" If you really want the greatest passing distance , you should wobble down the road , " looking as inept as possible , he adds .
Walker actually reanalyzed his data recently to counter this line of reasoning .
" I assessed the number of vehicles coming within one meter [ roughly 3.3 feet ] of the rider , on the principle that these are the ones that pose a risk , " he says .
" There were 23 percent more vehicles within this one - meter danger zone when a helmet was worn , suggesting a real risk . "
Dorothy Robinson , a patron of the Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation and a senior statistician at the University of New England in Armidale , Australia , published a 2006 review article in the BMJ ( British Medical Journal ) about regions in Australia , New Zealand and Canada that introduced legislation that spurred an over 40 percent increase in bicycle helmet use among their populaces .
The newly instituted laws , she found , did not have a significant effect on bicycle accidents resulting in head injuries , the primary purpose of the gear .
Her conclusion was " helmets are not designed for forces often encountered in collisions with motor vehicles " as well as that they " may encourage cyclists to take more risks or motorists to take less care when they encounter cyclists . "
Coincidentally , around the same time as Walker announced his results , New York City released a report on bicycle deaths and injuries : 225 cyclists died between 1996 and 2005 on New York streets ; 97 percent of them were not wearing helmets .
Of these deaths , 58 percent are known to involve head injury , but the actual number could be as high as 80 percent .
Comparing the helmet to a seat belt in a car , Swart of the BHSI says , " When you do have that crash , you better have it on . "
Walker , whose much - publicized report may inspire a new generation of bareheaded riders , wo n't make any specific recommendations to other cyclists ( and neither will Scientific American ) , though he notes that when it comes to riding in traffic , motorists are the real problem .
" If people read the research and decide a helmet makes them safer , they should wear one ; if they read the research and decide it does n't , perhaps they do n't need to , " Walker says , adding the caveat , " But they do need to read the research ! "
And watch out for cars .
Vermont ’s Progressive Party unanimously endorsed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush Saturday .
Fifty party members turned out in Montpelier for the Progressive ’s quarterly meeting .
They unanimously endorsed a resolution calling on Democratic Congressman Peter Welch to initiate impeachment proceedings of the President and Vice President .
It ’s similar to the impeachment resolutions approved at 35 town meetings in March and in the Vermont Senate two weeks ago .
But Welch has steadfastly opposed the request .

I get a lot of email about Getting Things Done ( GTD ) , mostly from people just starting out who have various questions about implementation , starting out , or sticking to the system .
I thought I ’d start a FAQ to help those with similar questions .
Now , let me first say that this is not a complete FAQ , but I ’ve taken some of the most common questions .
I ’d like you guys to help out by submitting other questions that I can add to the list when I update it .
Let me also say that I am not the absolute authority on GTD — I am but one blogger , one practitioner , and I am just sharing what I ’ve learned from experience and reading other sites .
But I hope it ’s of some use !
Overview
What is GTD ?
The official answer is given by David Allen , the author of Getting Things Done ( buy it here ) on his website , Davidco .
The full answer is here , but he ’s the most important snippet :
GTD embodies an easy , step - by - step and highly efficient method for achieving this relaxed , productive state .
It includes : Capturing anything and everything that has your attention
Defining actionable things discretely into outcomes and concrete next steps
Organizing reminders and information in the most streamlined way , in appropriate categories , based on
how and when you need to access them
Keeping current and “ on your game ” with appropriately frequent reviews of the six horizons of your
commitments ( purpose , vision , goals , areas of focus , projects , and actions )
Implementing GTD alleviates the feeling of overwhelm , instills confidence , and releases a flood of creative energy .
It provides structure without constraint , managing details with maximum flexibility .
Also see the Wikipedia entry on GTD .
How do I start ?
Well , the book gives you a step - by - step approach , but the most important steps for starting out are :
How long will it take to start ?
Well , the longest part for many people is processing all the papers on their desks and elsewhere and getting all their inboxes to zero .
This can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or three .
Next longest is setting up a filing system and your lists .
That can take an hour or two .
The other stuff does n’t take setup time , usually .
So altogether , you could be looking at a day or two ( or more if your life is super disorganized ) .
David Allen recommends you set aside a big chunk of your time for a day or two to clear everything off and get it set up .
Now , although this sounds like a big commitment ( and it is ) , I have to say that it is worth it .
This step alone is worth the price of the GTD book — getting everything cleared and organized is a huge accomplishment and an amazing feeling .
It ’s why so many people love GTD .
Is there an easier way to start ?
Yes .
You do n’t need to implement all of GTD at once .
Really , you should go with what works for you — there is no one way to do it .
A minimal starting point could be any of the following :
Just start with capture .
All you need is a notebook and a pen , and start writing everything down , so you never forget stuff again , and you get it out of your head .
If you feel like doing more , use the notebook to create some context lists — your next actions ( see below ) organized into the contexts in which you do them ( work , home , errands , calls , etc. ) so you can just look at the actions you can do right now .

Clear out your inbox .
The next step , if you ’re ready , would be to process all your papers .
Gather them in one pile , and work from top to bottom , disposing of each one until you ’re done .
This is an amazing feeling .
From here on out , get an inbox , and use it as your one point of entry for all papers ( including Post-its and phone messages and receipts and everything else ) .
If you ’re feeling ambitious , take the next step and do the same with your email inbox .

Filing .
A simple start could also include a simple filing system .
All you need is a filing cabinet ( or a drawer dedicated to your filing needs if that ’s all you need ) , some manila folders and some labels .
Have plenty of them on hand so you can create a folder quickly and easily .
Use a simple alphabetical system .
I ’m overwhelmed by my inbox and all the stuff I need to sort through !
This can be very overwhelming , especially if you ’ve got large piles of paper scattered all over your desk and in drawers and on the floor and in the car , etc .
But it ’s doable .
First of all , gather them all up and put them in one pile .
If it ’s too huge to put in one pile , make two , but do n’t start creating a whole bunch of piles .
The key is to start at the top of the pile and work your way down , one document at a time , so if you have two piles , consider the second pile just a continuation of the first .
Next , if you do n’t have time to process through all of them at once ( and you should try if you can ) , then just set aside the pile for now and process it in chunks .
I would recommend setting aside an hour a day to process your pile .
Again , start from the top , and dispose of each document .
When you get to the bottom , buy yourself a treat !
Is GTD a cult ?
Why is it so popular on the Internet ?
GTD is often accused of having a cult - like status , but in truth it just inspires a lot of passion .
Why ?
First of all , because of the feeling of getting your desk cleared and your inboxes to empty .
Seriously , as I said above , this is an amazing , awesome feeling .
Second , because of the simple power of concepts like next actions , context lists and the weekly review — they are not anything complicated , but they work extremely well , and people love that .
Third , because of the open - source nature of the tools — this is what gets so many geeks .
They love being able to use their favorite gadget , or computer program , or show off their programming skills by just using an automated text file , or the textile feeling of a good pen on good paper .
It ’s all about individual pleasures , and setting up your cool tools to create a setup that works for you .
It ’s the geek in us that loves GTD .
Tools
What tools do I need ?
As mentioned above , a minimal setup would include a notebook , pen , inbox , filing drawer , folders and labels .
However , there are many other tools you could use , including but not limited to :
a mobile device such as a PDA for everything – capture , lists , reminders
an electronic labeler for neat labels
a calendar or calendar program ( highly recommended )
computer software ( off - line or online ) to handle your lists or your capture
a tickler file , either using folders ( see next question ) or software
index cards for capture and lists
For more on tools , see the tools section of my Massive GTD Resource List .
What is a tickler file or 43 folders , and do I need it ?
A tickler file , as spelled out in the book , is a system of 43 folders : 12 folders labeled for each month , and 31 folders labeled for the days of the month .
So the way it works :
If you have a piece of paper ( or a concert ticket , etc. ) that you do n’t need to think about until later this month , put it in one of the daily folders ( let ’s say the folder labeled “ 20 ” if we want to look at it on the 20th of this month ) .
If you do n’t need to think about it until a later month , put it in that month ’s folder .
Each day , you look in the folder with today ’s date on it ( if today is the 20th , I ’ll look in “ 20 ” ) and see what you need to think about today .
If you want to postpone it until later , simply put the paper in a later folder .
In this way , you could have a recurring reminder .
Each day , the folder with today ’s date should be at the front of the pile — rotate yesterday ’s folder to the back of the pile .
At the end of each month , rotate the past month ’s folder to the back of the month folders pile , and look in the next month ’s folder — take out the papers in it and redistribute throughout the 31 day folders .
It ’s an ingenius system , and if it appeals to you , give it a try .
However , many people ( myself included ) find this system a bit cumbersome , especially given the ease - of - use of today ’s computer calendars ( I use Gcal ) .
Using a calendar program , you could just mark a reminder on the date in the calendar .
You can even set up recurring reminders .
Hi -tech vs. lo-tech ?
This is the real question for GTD users when it comes to tools : do you go with a paper system ( such as the Moleskine , the Hipster PDA , the PocketMod , etc. ) or with a digital system … or as many people do , a combination of both .
Of course the answer is that it ’s a highly personal question , and you should go with the tools that work for you — and especially the tools you love to use .
If that ’s a PDA , then go for it .
If that ’s a Moleskine , that ’s great too .
Usually it takes a little bit of experimentation to find the right tools — however , I would caution against obsessing over tools , as this is the biggest waste of time for most GTDers — pick your tools , and go with them .
Focus more on actually doing your tasks than what cool tools you ’re going to use .
You ’d think that geeks on the Internet would go with digital tools , especially online ones or with PDAs or smart phones .
And many do .
However , there is a large number of geeks ( myself included ) who end up using analog ( paper ) tools such as the ones mentioned above .
Why ?
That ’s an often debated topic , but the reasons usually have to do with simplicity , ease of use , portability , ease of expansion and modification , and especially the tactile pleasure of using paper and a good pen .
Ultimately , it ’s something you ’ll have to choose for yourself .
Here ’s one of the best papers on this , and one that opened my eyes to the possibility of paper a while back : GTD LoFi HiFi Whitepaper ( it ’s got more HiFi stuff since I first read it , I think , but still interesting ) .
What ’s the best GTD software ?
There are so many out there , it would be impossible to choose just one .
And it really depends on your needs and personal preferences .
A couple of things to read :
I ’m stuck with Outlook at work .
Can I set up Outlook for GTD ?
Absolutely — many people have .
I would recommend reading various implementations , including :
What about implementing GTD on a Mac ?
The Mac is a great GTD tool .
43 Folders blog is an excellent source for more information , or see this MeFi thread for some good stuff :
Ask Metafilter : Getting Things Done on a Macintosh
Is it OK to have multiple setups on my computer , PDA , and planner ?
Again , what works best for you is what you should go with .
But my recommendation ?
Simplify .
It ’s hard to continually check and update different lists and calendars on a computer , a PDA and a paper planner .
You are more likely to use and stick with the system if you just have one place to check and update .
Find the one that works best for you and stick with it .
Next Actions , Contexts , Projects
Next actions – what are they ?
Basically , for any project ( and a project is anything that takes more than 1 action ) , you need to ask yourself , “ What is the very next physical action necessary to move this project forward ? ”
It is this “ next action ” that you put on your to - do list .
The problem with many tasks that we put on our to - do lists is that they are not really something you can do , but a mini-project .
For example , “ Write report ” is a project where the next action might be “ Look on Internet for three sources for report ” or “ Call Larry to get stats for report ” .
See “ Why What ’s the Next Action is the Most Important Question ” for more .
I have too many next actions ( or projects ) — what should I do ?
It ’s true that having a long list of next actions can be overwhelming for many people .
Note : this advice also applies to too many projects .
There are a few ways to deal with this :
Realize that you do n’t need to do all of these next actions today or even over the next few days .
It ’s just good to know all of your commitments , instead of having them pop into your brain over and over at the wrong times .
If this list cannot be accomplished this week , move the less urgent ones to your Someday / Maybe list and just leave the ones you intend to accomplish this week .
Then , in your Weekly Review , move those tasks you can accomplish next week back up to the current context lists .
Simplify — eliminate or delegate those tasks that are n’t really essential , or that no longer need to be done .
Crank out as many of the smaller tasks as possible , to shorten the list .
You ’ll still never clear your list , but you can make it more manageable .
A few next actions seem to hang around on my lists .
Suggestions ?
If you have some stubborn next actions that stay on your lists for a long time , you should take a look at them in your Weekly Review .
Why are these actions so hard to remove from your lists ?
Here are a few suggestions :
Perhaps you do n’t want to do them — in that case , do them first thing in the morning , before you check email , and do n’t do anything until those tasks are done .
Or perhaps you do n’t need to do them — if they ’ve been on your list a few weeks , they probably are n’t that urgent .
See if you can eliminate them or delegate them .
Perhaps they are n’t really next actions .
Often there are projects on our list that are disguised as actions .
See if the task actually involves more than one step ( for example , “ Call Larry ” might actually be , “ Call Nina to get Larry ’s number ” ) , and then put the real next action on your list instead .
Perhaps the tasks are too intimidating .
In that case , break them down to smaller tasks .
“ Write Report ” could be “ Write first paragraph of report ” or “ Outline report ” or “ Write report for 10 minutes ” .
If it turns out this is something you need to do , but perhaps not right now , move it to your Someday / Maybe list .
How granular should a next action be ?
When a next action is intimidating , as I suggested in the previous question , you can break it down to a smaller level ( “ granularize it ” ) .
But how small do you break it down ?
That ’s really a personal preference — do you work better in 30 minute chunks , 2 hour chunks , or 10 minute chunks ?
Give it a little thought and experiment .
Some ideas to try :
Do the next action — write the report until you are done , or until you need a break .
Use a time chunk — again , the amount of the chunk depends on you , but it should be something you can do without taking a break .
If you can work 2 hours without a break , in one burst , then that should be your level .
If you can only work 10 minutes before needing a breather , that ’s your level .
Try a small unit — 5 pages , or 2 things on the outline , or 50 lines of code .
Try a larger unit – a chapter of a novel , for example .
How many next actions for one project should be on my lists ?
If you ’ve got a project that consists of multiple physical actions , how many of those actions should you write on your list ?
The answer is at least one — every active project should have at least one next action on an active context list .
If you ’d like to put more , that ’s really up to you , but be aware that having all of your project ’s actions on your context lists can be intimidating and overwhelming .
My recommendation is to go with one or two at the most .
And if you have 2 - 3 next actions from a project listed on your context lists , be sure that each of them can be accomplished without something else being done first .
For example , do n’t put “ Mail letter ” and “ Buy stamps ” on your list , as you cannot do the first without first doing the second .
The first action ( “ Mail letter ” ) is known as a dependent action — you ca n’t do it without doing something else first .
Do n’t list dependent actions on your context lists , as it wastes your time to look at actions you ca n’t actually do .
When you ’ve completed a project ’s next action , do n’t just check it off .
Be sure to write the project ’s next “ next action ” on your list , so the project continues to move forward .
If you forget , that ’s OK — during your Weekly Review , one of the most important parts of the process is making sure that each project on your projects list has a next action listed on your context lists .
How do I handle every day or every week actions ?
If you have tasks that recur every day or every week ( let ’s say laundry , or a daily report ) , there are a number of ways to handle this :
Put it in your calendar or tickler file as a recurring task .
Every day ( or every week , or however often the task needs to be done ) , you should see it in your calendar , and note it on your list as something that needs to be done today .
Today list — this is not actually a part of GTD , but if you want , you can have a Today list where you note the things that need to be done today — such as your daily report , or one of your Most Important Tasks ( MITs ) .
Do n’t put anything that does n’t absolutely need to be done today on your Today list , or it will become useless .
I suggest only having three things on this list .
Context list — you could just put the task at the top of the appropriate context list , and then every day , when you check your context list , you ’ll see it there .
Routines — this is also not explicitly a part of GTD , but you could create a separate list for Daily Routines and Weekly Routines where you make sure to check off items each day or each week .
Actually , GTD allows for other lists , such as checklists , so this could technically be a part of GTD .
What contexts should I use ?
This is a highly personal choice , and also takes experimentation to get it right .
The main idea is to group your next actions so that when you look at a context list , you are only looking at tasks that can actually be done right now , in the location you ’re in with the tools you have .
So if you look at your Home list , it should not contain items that can only be done from your work computer .
Similarly , your Work list should not contain your errands that can only be done on the road .
You can further break down a context such as Work if there are different contexts at work .
For example , if you use different work locations , and some tasks can only be done at one of the locations .
In that case , you should not be looking at those tasks if you ’re in the other location where the tasks ca n’t be done .
If you start to notice that there are next actions on your context list that you cannot actually do right now , that is either because 1 ) your contexts need to be re-examined ; 2 ) the task is not actually a next action but a dependent task or project ; or 3 ) the next action belongs on your Someday / Maybe list .
Sticking To It
I have trouble sticking to my Weekly Review .
Any suggestions ?
This is a toughie for most GTDers ( including myself ) .
It ’s best to analyze why you ’re having trouble , and address the reason .
Here are some suggestions :
If the weekly review is taking too long , shorten it by processing your inboxes to empty the day before , and making sure your process for the review is streamlined .
If you find that you get too busy and keep pushing the Weekly Review back , try first thing in the morning on Monday .
Schedule an appointment for two hours , and do n’t let anything interrupt it .
If that does n’t work , do it on Sunday afternoon , when you have more time .
Reward yourself for completing it .
Actually , completing the Weekly Review is in itself a reward , because it ’s nice to get your system organized , so remind yourself of that .
But also give yourself an external reward .
For more on this , see How to do the Weekly Review in under an hour .
Help !
I ’ve falllen off GTD and I ca n’t get back on .
This happens all the time — people get gung - ho about GTD and then a couple months later something comes up that gets them too busy to keep the system organized , and it falls apart .
Luckily , GTD is super easy to get back into — in fact it ’s easier to get back into it than it is to get started in the first place , because you already know the system and you probably still have all the right tools — it ’s just a matter of setting yourself up and getting updated .
It ’s actually fun to start again .
Some suggestions :
Try some cool tools that you love to use .
For me , that ’s the Moleskine notebook , as it is just a pleasure to use .

Try with a minimal version ( see the top of this FAQ for more ) .
You do n’t need to start full blast — just do a few things and then add later if necessary .
You may find that the minimal version is all you need .
How do you stick with it once you get started again ?
See the next question .
I have trouble sticking with GTD .
How do you stick with GTD if you keep falling off it ?
Try these suggestions :
First of all , I just want to say , on the record , that I 'm sorry .
We had no idea what was going to happen when we did the experiment .
Heck , that was why we were doing it .
I 'm sorry .
We 're not going to do it again , regardless of how improbable the results were last time we tried it .
Nor is anybody else .
Okay .
What basically happened was that one of the collisions we engineered produced two of the rarest particles known to physics .
Now , these are shortlived things so we 've seen one at a time on many occasions , but two existing alongside each other even for a matter of nanoseconds was pretty exceptional in itself , if scientifically uninteresting .
But what was amazing - the factor that we 've never been able to engineer again - was that these two particles curved around in the magnetic field and they collided as well .
And both of them totally vanished .
Not even a pulse of electromagnetic radiation marked their disappearance .
They completely vanished from the reaction chamber .
Now obviously the first thing you 're thinking and the first thing I thought is " this has got to be equipment fault " , but the trails of all the other particles in the experiment all came out fine .
How could the chamber record one set of trails but not others ?
Selective failure like that does n't happen .
Now obviously we spent some time investigating what theoretically should have happened when the two particles collided , but all the numbers went berserk and just added to the growing body of evidence that physics was in need of a totally new theory of everything .
So when numerous attempts to duplicate the experiment failed ( luckily ) , we hesitantly suggested that the particles might have decayed into neutrinos - a fudge of an explanation , they were both positively charged for heaven 's sake - and moved onto something else .
That all happened twelve years ago .
One year ago that new theory arrived , so we decided to dig up the results from that old experiment and run a simulation based on the new equations .
The numbers went berserk again , but this time in a quantifiable way .
We ended up with a particle that breaks pretty much all the conventional laws of physics .
Firstly , when it decays - after about a quintillionth of a second according to its personal timescale - it releases a quantity of energy so gargantuan it could annihilate a planet .
Or a star .
Secondly , in that quintillionth of a second it fires itself across the space at relativistic speeds , and homes in on the first point mass it comes near .
Like a star .
You see where I 'm going with this .
So we asked ourselves , if the energy was n't released inside our reaction chamber , then where was it released ?
Where did the particle end up when it decayed ?
Obviously not in our own Sun , as proven by the fact that it 's still there .
So we decide that the thing to do is predict and plot the particle 's instantaneous trajectory through space .
Its life - line .
The next bit was fun ; pulling out star charts , figuring out the orientation of the reaction chamber in space at the exact date and time of the experiment ... you can guess what we found .
It headed out of the solar system , towards another star .
It homed in on it , and after a quintillionth of a second by its personal timescale , but about six years by ours , it decayed .
Yeah .
Barnard 's Star .
Six light - years away .
Now Barnard 's Nova .
I said I was sorry .
Hundreds of mourners gathered at a funeral procession

Fifteen members of the team had been abducted last May in Anbar province , an al - Qaeda stronghold west of Baghdad , on their way to a training camp in Jordan .
The bodies were found in western Iraq , near the town of Ramadi .
Two of the team are still missing .
In the past two years many Iraqi sports officials have been seized in sectarian attacks or held for ransom .
Olympic hopes
Members of the Sunni Anbar Salvation Council , a group fighting al - Qaeda in the province , found the remains of the 13 taekwondo team members , Iraqi police said .
We were hoping that we would see them alive and competing for their country in international championships
Hussein al - Obeidi
Iraq Olympic Committee
The remains - including bones , skulls and shreds of uniforms - were taken to Imam Ali Hospital in the Shia neighbourhood of Sadr City , Baghdad .
DNA tests will be used to identify the athletes , a hospital official told Associated Press news agency .
The athletes were members of a club that aimed to send competitors to the Olympics , Hussein al - Obeidi , secretary - general of Iraq 's National Olympic Committee , told AP .
Many athletes and sports officials have been abducted in Iraq
" We were hoping that we would see them alive and competing for their country in international championships , " Mr Obeidi said .
Hundreds of mourners gathered in Sadr City on Saturday at a funeral procession for the athletes , who will be buried in the Shia holy city of Najaf .
Last year , an Iraqi international football referee , a member of the Iraqi Olympic football team and a national volleyball player were abducted .
Iraq 's national wrestling coach was killed in Baghdad , while 30 other Iraqi sports officials , including the chairman of Iraq 's Olympic Committee , were also seized from a sports conference in Baghdad .
Some were victims of sectarian attacks or held for ransom , others were targeted by radical Islamists who disapproved of their activities .
Senate Democrats and a few Republicans have called for Mr. Rove to testify publicly about the dismissals .
“ There is an issue of intrigue , and for better or worse , that surrounds Karl Rove , ” said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
“ It is in the president ’s interest and the country ’s interest to have it dispelled or verified , but let ’s hear it from him . ”
The White House , however , is offering only a private interview without a sworn oath .
Congressional Democrats said they were focusing on Mr. Rove in part because the administration appeared to have tried to hide his fingerprints .
In a February 23 letter to Senate Democratic leaders that was approved by the White House counsel ’s office , for example , the Justice Department said that no one in the White House had “ lobbied ” for any of the eight dismissals , and specifically denied that Mr. Rove had “ any role ” in the appointment of the protégé , J. Timothy Griffin , a former Bush campaign operative .
But the Justice Department officials who drafted the letter had corresponded with Mr. Rove ’s staff just weeks earlier about how to get the nomination done .
On Wednesday night , a department official apologized for inaccuracies in the letter .
White House officials said Mr. Rove was just one voice in the approval of federal prosecutors , whose selection is traditionally guided by the recommendations of senior members of the president ’s party in their states .
“ Our job is to find qualified nominees who can win confirmation and be good public servants , ” said Dana Perino , a White House spokeswoman .
After the United States attorneys are confirmed , she said , Mr. Rove and others at the White House show “ wide deference ” to the Justice Department about specific cases .
Some Republicans say they always understood that Mr. Rove had a say in prosecutor appointments .
“ I basically felt when I was talking to Karl I was talking to the president , ” said former Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald , an Illinois Republican .
Late Tuesday afternoon , Dow Jones
Indexes made a seemingly minor confession about a technical glitch that took place earlier that day .
Specifically , in the middle of Tuesdays market decline  beginning at 1:50 pm precisely 
Dow Jones Indexes began incorrectly reporting the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( Dow ) .
In other words , instead of displaying say 12,200 - the actual trading level of the 30 - Dow components - the Dow was showing 12,350 .
Ever vigilant , they eventually identified the problem and switched over to a back - up system at 3:00 PM .
Now there is no question that computers sometimes do err : instances of market miscalculation and / or miscommunication have dotted the financial ledger in the past - like between the futures and cash markets during the crash of 1987 .
However , and although a potentially innocent event , the interesting thing about Tuesdays computer malfunction is that it persisted without being recognized for 70 - minutes !
The question to ask , naturally enough , is what on earth was going on during this 70 - minute interval ?
70 - Minutes In The Dark
What is most puzzling about this incident is not that a tech - guy at Dow Jones Indexes may have went out to catch a movie in the middle of a trading - day , but that the media and regulatory bodies have failed to try and aggressively investigate whether anyone profited excessively during the 70 - minute period .
Market information is valuable , and if you knew that a 100 + point disparity existed between the listed Dow price and the actual Dow price you could have made a killing .
For its part , Dow Jones - which is supposedly still reviewing the situation - has chosen to focus on the contestable conclusions that the financial markets were not impacted by the unprecedented  price adjustment at 3:00 PM , and that no investors were hurt .
As for the possibility of malfeasance , nothing has been said .
Focusing on what they have said , the lawyers at Dow Jones are ready to insist that nothing untoward or unpleasant could possibly have happened :
 It is important to understand that Dow Jones has no role in trading stocks or pricing individual securities , including securities underlying our Indexes .
We are conducting a detailed review of yesterdays events and do not believe the calculation delay or the subsequent catch up in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) exacerbated the market decline , as the market was down sharply during the 70 - minute period and rebounded strongly soon after the DJIA was brought current .
We regret yesterdays unprecedented events and are taking remedial actions to prevent their recurrence , but we have no reason to believe any investors were harmed . 
Dow Jones , Feb 28 , 07
The Dow is the most influential index in the world , so the suggestion that not one single investor made an investment based upon the erroneous data and then lost money after the Dows startling 1 - minute plunge is , of course , surprising to say the least .
But first , there is an even more pressing matter at hand .
How About Those Back - Ups !
 the market 's extraordinarily heavy trading volume caused a delay in Dow Jones ' data systems .
As a result , the calculation of the Dow Jones Industrial Average temporarily lagged behind the market 's decline .
Dow Jones Indexes identified the problem and switched over to a back - up system . 
That the NYSE logged more than 4 billion in volume on February 27 would seem to support their contention that extraordinary  trading volume was the culprit behind the data delay .
Having said that , exactly how the system managed to cope with the 3.9 billion shares traded on February 28 , apparently without problem , remains a mystery .
Suffice to say , the investment media ( which is controlled largely by Dow Jones ) has yet to discuss one of the most puzzling elements of the above release :
Why and how were the back - up systems able to negotiate the ' extraordinary ' amount of volume ?
In other words , if volume really caused the delay why were the back - ups also not delayed ???
Ever the public servant , Dow Jones has put one person , the Global Head of Public Relations Sybille Reitz , on the job of discussing this ultra-important matter with the media .
Ms. Reitz * answered  eventually - the question above with the following :
 That is what we are actually investigating . 
Conclusions & Conspiracy Fodder
Given that corruption has been known to reside on Wall Street , is nt it remarkable that every time a computer starts choking on data everyone is quick to swallow the party line ?
In essence , we are being told to accept at face value that Dow Jones Index front - line computers take 70 - minute breaks because they are lazy , but that the trusty back - ups can effortlessly tabulate every second worth of trades .
Instead of forming a team to help investigate the event and punish those ( if any ) responsible , Fed Chairman Bernanke accepted the party line and tried to sooth investor apprehensions yesterday by claiming that the markets seem to be working well .
 In the minutes after Bernanke spoke , the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index rose as much as 1.2 percent before 
As the above quote aptly demonstrates , the financial press does in fact like to talk about the markets in seconds and minutes .
But , curiously , no one is calling for someones head over the most watched index in the world pumping out incorrect data for more than hour .
In short , computers sometimes do err .
But what is surprising , and what gives conspiracy theorists a leg to stand on , is that technical trading delays never seem to happen when prices are rising .
Computers do not know the difference between rising and falling stocks prices , do they ?
* We are not accusing Ms. Sybille Reitz of being unresponsive to our questions .
Rather , she has a mammoth job to respond to media inquiries .
In our opinion she could probably use a back - up .

Read with care !
I ’ve been cheating on my first love .
When I first started seriously JavaScripting and not CopyPasteScripting , my first framework was the Yahoo User Interface Library .
I was just beginning to realize the power of a JavaScript framework , but at the time I also thought that the Dom was an actor in Hollywood ’s The Cannonball Run .
Hey , everyone ’s gotta get their start somewhere .
But now I ’ve been learning advanced JavaScripting techniques .
I ’m not a bad person … but I ’ve been experimenting with new frameworks while YUI was out of town on business .
And ever since I ’ve been going behind YUI ’s back , I ’ve been feeling guilty because it feels so good to cheat .
I am experiencing all these new JavaScript programming ideas that I ’ve never felt before .
But at the same time , I feel regret .
We are still friends and I still hang out with YUI often , but I know she wants me back full time .
I am open to that possibility , but first I want her to change a few things .
CSS Selector Engine :
All the major frameworks are doing it .
cssQuery started it ( I think ? ) .
jQuery was built on it .
Ext revolutionized it .
Even Mootools , Prototype , and Dojo have their own implementations .
Where is my baby ?
An official community driven plug - in system :
No , I ’m not talking about yazaar.org , although it is a good idea .
I want something official , to give credibility to plug - in contributors .
You can still have control of your main components , but why not open it up ?
An iterator ?
I ’m of course talking about the each ( ) function in jQuery , which operates on both Array ’s and Object ’s without discretion .
Easier Databinding .
Why do I have to program my own logic to iterate through the XML returned in my Ajax call ?
At least something that allows me to query an XML document easier ( see CSS Selector Engine )
I know I probably should n’t be talking about the component controls , since those are really ancillary to the framework , but a DataTable that supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling while always showing the headers !
Form Validation Utility , or at least a few convenience functions to deal with forms , especially radios and checkboxes .
Of course , I would have said easier operations on HTMLElement ’s , but the new YUI Element ( Beta ) Utility is doing wonders there .
But how about some sort of DOM Creation class ?
Of course , I could n’t mention this without plugging the DOM Creation class I built for YUI called DOMDom .
Client Browser Detection .
While I would never encourage sniffing glue , sometimes sniffing the browser is unavoidable .
This would be a nice convenience when porting plug - in code from other libraries as well .
Some might say Chaining , one of jQuery ’s biggest features or a la Dustin Diaz ’s extension to YUI called DED| Chain .
But to be quite honest , that does n’t bother me too much .
Chaining might increase convenience a little bit , but perhaps at the sacrifice of a small amount of code readability .
Either way , it is n’t necessary to me .
So , there you have it .
YUI , you will always have a piece of my heart .
But for now , you only have a piece .
Do you want me back or not ?
I ’ll go over what I ’m looking for in the new library I ’ve been eyeing in a future article I ’m tentatively calling “ X Things jQuery Needs to Win Me Over . ”
Stay tuned .
PARIS 
The highest appeals court in France will decide today whether to ban a contemporary sequel to Victor Hugo's " Les Miserables " for betraying the spirit of the 19th - century classic .
The verdict could end years of wrangling between the author 's great - great - grandson , Pierre Hugo , and Francois Ceresa , whose two - volume sequel was derided as an insipid " Les Mis II " by the Hugo family .
" I hope to set a legal precedent for all descendants of celebrities , be they writers , artists , or musicians , to protect the spirit of their forebears , " Mr. Hugo , 59 , a writer and goldsmith , told the Daily Telegraph .
Intellectual property rights lawyers said the ruling could set a precedent in cases pitting literary works considered to be in the public domain 70 years after their author 's death against an author 's " moral rights "  which are by law timeless and guarded by his descendants .
The court battle began in 2001 , after the release of Mr. Ceresa 's book , " Cosette , or the Time of Illusions , " which Mr. Hugo claimed was a mere money - making operation that violated the " respect of the integrity " of Victor Hugo 's 1862 masterpiece .
Lawyers for Mr. Ceresa argued that to ban his novel would violate freedom of expression and deter artists from turning to great works for inspiration .
Literary lawyers worry that they will be swamped with real or fake descendants of celebrated authors seeking compensation .
" Les Miserables " has been adapted in books and plays and inspired the West End musical of the same name , which , Mr. Hugo said , his great - great - grandfather would have enjoyed thoroughly .
" I am not against adaptations . '
I have seen 10 of the 47 film versions , and they all respect the novel .
The latest hit musical in Paris based on  The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' is fine .
But I can not accept a novel being sold as if it were a  true ' sequel purely for commercial gain . "
Mr. Hugo initially sought $ 8.8 million in damages from the publisher , Plon , saying he would donate the money to charity .
The judges threw out the case because he had not proved that he was a relation of the French literary great and had no claim on the author 's rights .
They also quoted Victor Hugo , who , at a literary conference in 1878 , said , " The writer as a writer has but one heir : the public domain . "
But in 2004 , an appeals court overturned that verdict by proving the direct line between Victor and Pierre Hugo and ruling that an author 's rights were " transmissible to their heirs . "
The judges also agreed " the writer would not have accepted that a third party write a sequel to  Les Miserables , ' " which it described as a " veritable monument of world literature . "
The editor of the new work was ordered to pay the symbolic sum of $ 2 , but he appealed .
The book and a second installment , " Marius , or the Fugitive " were allowed to be published , but despite the printing of 250,000 , sales were disappointing .
If the Hugo family wins the case , the book will be pulled from stores and the editor ordered to pay legal fees .
" This is not about money , it 's symbolic , " said Mr. Hugo , who pledged to continue his court battle if he loses .
Blue green algae are significant species in the global carbon cycle because they transform nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into a useable nutrient , enabling photosynthesis in nutrient - poor waters .
Using NanoSIMS
( high - resolution secondary ion mass spectrometer ) , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , USC and Portland State University scientists showed that they could image and track nutrient uptake in blue green algae at the nanoscale .
The new method should help to clear up the age - old puzzle of how different species of blue green algae can “ fix ” or take up atmospheric nitrogen and carbon in a single cell organism .
Carbon fixation during photosynthesis produces oxygen , which inhibits nitrogen fixation .
Different species of blue green algae solve the problem in different ways and scientists still do n’t understand how some of the most important species can get both of these jobs done .
To develop the new method , the researchers studied the freshwater algae , Anabaena oscillarioides , which separates the two processes into adjacent cells that share the products .
LLNL researchers Peter Weber , Jennifer Pett - Ridge , Stewart Fallon and Ian Hutcheon used NanoSIMS to track the uptake and movement of carbon and nitrogen inside two types of cells in the algae : vegetative cells , which perform carbon fixation , and heterocysts , thick - walled relatives that pull in nitrogen .
NanoSIMS provides the ability to map distributions of elements and isotopes with 50 - 100 - nanometer resolution .
The device allowed the scientists to measure the carbon and nitrogen uptake and subsequent distribution at the cellular and subcellular level .
“ The method shows the dynamics of resource uptake and redistribution down to the level of sub-micron nitrogen storage and cell wall formation during cell division , ” Weber said .
The researchers used stable isotope tracers in nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases to track nitrogen and carbon fixation .
After a few hours of incubation , vegetative cells exhibited a large enrichment in carbon and nitrogen isotopes because of active carbon and nitrogen uptake and intercellular exchange .
During photosynthesis , most of the newly fixed carbon was allocated to vegetative cells because they are rapidly dividing , while heterocysts require very little carbon because they are non-growing cells .
The NanoSIMS images showed that mature heterocysts are distinguishable from the vegetative cells based on their size , shape and intercellular distance .
The method also showed that newly fixed nitrogen levels are higher in vegetative cells than in mature heterocysts .
“ We were able to see on a cell by cell basis how newly fixed nitrogen is rapidly exported from the heterocysts to vegetative cells , keeping pace with the nitrogen demands of the growing and dividing vegetative cells , ” Weber said .
“ Now we can take these results and apply them to poorly understood species . ”
USC ’s Kenneth Nealson predicts that NanoSIMS opens up a whole new field of study .
“ You can use this technology to look at things going on inside the cell , ” he said .
“ This is going to change the way that we do a lot of microbiology . ”
The research appears in the latest issue of The International Society for Microbial Ecology ( ISME ) Journal .

Is there a future for serious sci-fi ?

Is there a future for serious sci-fi ?
1 / 9 Back to Gallery
Science fiction is dead .
Long live science fiction .
For those of us who care ( and no , we do not live in our parents ' basements ) , the future of futurism is an urgent matter indeed .
Is science fiction thriving amid the pyrotechnics , or is it dying a slow and hideous death , suffocated by publishing - industry group - think and unimaginative movie execs drunk on sequels ?
I speak as a fan with opinions — as though there 's any other kind — when I pronounce the sound health and shining future of 21st - century speculative fiction .
I 'm less concerned with Monday 's release of the megabudget Transformers movie , with its gargantuan alien robots and shiny cast , than a prevailing cultural shift that seems to embrace the expansive narrative frontiers of sci-fi .
And I 'm not even counting the genre 's recent successes on television ( Battlestar Galactica , Heroes , The4400 , Lost ) or world - domination in games ( take your pick ) .
" It 's everywhere now .
Everybody has some exposure to it — it 's much more respectable than it used to be , " says David Wellington , a sci- fi / horror author ( Monster Island , Thirteen Bullets ) and aficionado who recalls the bad old days of fandom .
" Back in the ' 80s , when I was a huge science - fiction fan , it was very marginalized .
And we always complained about that : ' Why ca n't other people understand why we like this stuff so much ? ' "
Wellington is one of several devotees who , given the chance to vent , expresses enthusiasm as well as skepticism at the current state of the genre .
Many view the landscape ahead with caution , fearing a post - apocalyptic vista mottled by computer - giddy graphics and the blunt force of mainstream taste .
Some see it fragmenting .
Others see it thrive .
But fans reach consensus — sort of — on a few key issues .
One is that fantasy novels , once joined at the hip with science fiction , have enjoyed huge success since venturing into their own sizeable niche .
A second is that the film and publishing industries should take more artistic risks .
A third : Blade Runner rocks .
Fourth : so do Pan 's Labryinth and Children of Men .
A fifth point , expressed with varying degrees of disappointment and annoyance , is that advances in digital technology have made for gob - stopping eye candy that does n't always satisfy the mind or the heart .
From a visual standpoint , " there 's no better time in the history of films for science fiction , " says Dave Dorman , an in - demand sci-fi / fantasy painter based in Florida best known for his Star Wars renderings .
" On the other hand , I think the writing of science - fiction films is not up to what it was back in , say , the ' 40s , '50s and ' 60s . "
Craig Elliott , an animator for Disney ( Treasure Planet ) and DreamWorks ( the upcoming The Princess and the Frog ) , puts it even more succinctly : " There 's too much bling on the screen . "
In publishing , contemporary science fiction has splintered into a zillion little sub-sets , running from alternate history and space opera to hardcore , urban fantasy , movie and TV tie-ins , cyberpunk and the boundary - stretching " New Weird . "
Call it what you will , but great science fiction can be cosmic or minimalist , outward - looking or inward .
It expands or contracts , pushing humanity into the farthest reaches of space or reducing it to cinders .
From the start , it 's never been about the rubber - faced aliens , not really .
Edwin A. Abbott 's Flatland ( written in 1884 and adapted repeatedly for film ) is set in a two - dimensional world that skewers Victorian class distinctions .
H.G. Wells and Jules Verne both injected the acid of satire into the pulp of sci-fi , and even the dated strangeness that is Karel Capek's R.U.R. ( or Rossum 's Universal Robots , the play that coined the word ) was more concerned with sentience and civil rights than the construction of humanoid workers .
Do we watch Fritz Lang 's Metropolis for the sexy android , or the Marxist parallels ?
Is The Day the Earth Stood Still about a guy in a soup can or a world poised on self - destruction ?
Sci -fi can offer visions of a humankind freed from poverty , racism and the horrors of war ( see Star Trek 's first two series ) or ravaged by violence in a post - nuclear wasteland ( Mad Maxes 1 through 3 ) .
You can feel good or bum out , depending on your mood .
Lately , a lot of folks are bumming .
During the past few years dystopian yarns have surged in popularity , prophesying tomorrows wracked by terrorism ( V for Vendetta ) , zombie germs ( 28 Days Later , 28 Weeks Later ) and infertility ( Children of Men ) .
All three of those films are set in London , the new vogue setting for ashen pessimism .
In literary fiction , Kazuo Ishiguro 's Never Let Me Go moved dystopia to the English countryside .
Margaret Atwood moved it stateside ( The Handmaid 's Tale , Oryx and Crake ) , while Cormac McCarthy pushed it even farther with The Road .
Not everyone calls his Pulitzer Prize - winning novel science fiction , but that 's what it is : Man and boy wade through the soot of an annihilated landscape .
Sci-fi / fantasy marketer and publicist Colleen Lindsay has high praise for McCarthy 's book , but she 's vexed by the perception that it 's anything new .
" It 's post - apocalyptic fantasy for people who do n't read fantasy . "
Look at David Brin's The Postman and S.M. Stirling 's Dies the Fire , she says : similar books written by ( gasp ) genre authors and read by ( gasp ) geeks .
Or consider Richard Matheson 's classic 1954 I Am Legend , the original zombie - germ novel , adapted to film in 1964 ( The Last Man on Earth ) , 1971 ( The Omega Man ) and now 2007 ( I Am Legend , scheduled for Dec. 14 ) .
Kfir Luzzatto , a science - fiction author who lives in Israel , mentions John Christopher 's The Death of Grass ( 1956 ) and Mary Shelley 's The Last Man ( 1826 ) , which foresees a late - 21st century devastated by plague .
" Post - apocalyptic culture has become to modern people what ghost stories were to our fathers , " he says .
" ( It 's ) a way to air your fears of the unknown and to deal with them . "
On the flip side , the more gung - ho element of sci - fi continues to pit good against evil , and good continues to win — after an extremely noisy fight .
Consider those Transformers .
" Do we believe that we 're alone in this constant struggle , or do we believe that we can help each other ? " asks Jamie Hari , who founded and runs the Marvel Database Project out of Toronto .
Hari , who says " Marvel is my world " without embarrassment , sees the appeal of Transformers and robots in general " as another extension of the human desire for technology . "
A figure well familiar with this idea is Lawrence Krauss , a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and the author of The Physics of Star Trek .
If you watch How William Shatner Changed the World , he 's the one making pizza with the Shat .
" People like the idea of a hopeful future , " Krauss says , later admitting that " the utopian view is harder for me to believe . "
Generally , the genre grabs his attention when it 's smartly done but lost him at Starship Troopers : " The pooping insects , that sort of did it for me . "
Otherwise , he says that science , like art , considers our place in the cosmic scheme .
" The reason that we 're scientists is not because we want to build a better toaster , " he contends , " but because we 're interested in what 's possible in the universe . "
Judging from anticipated movie releases , this is what 's possible in the universe .
Earth might be invaded by alien body snatchers ( Invasion , Aug. 17 ) .
It might face planetary death from a dying sun ( Sunshine , July 20 ) .
It might be torn by global terrorism ( Day Zero , upcoming ) .
It might , in the field of engineering , produce super - powered exoskeletal armor ( Iron Man , 2008 ) , or it might form intergalactic relations with pointy - eared E.T. 's ( Star Trek , 2008 ) .
Alternately , a race of tiny aliens might tour the cosmos inside Eddie Murphy , who might then fall in love with an Earth babe ( Starship Dave , 2008 ) .
All of this looking forward strikes Houston 's John Moore , an " unrepentant geek " and sci-fi / fantasy author ( A Fate Worse than Dragons ) , as old news .
" Science fiction is the present .
We live in a science - fiction society , and I do n't just mean the gadgetization of society . "
Instead , he means that " projecting into the future , once the province of the science - fiction writer , has become our dominant way of thought . "
This , he says , is science fiction 's influence on modern thinking — on the broad intellectual questing that invites us ever onward .
Pat LoBrutto , a book doctor and longtime editor in the field , cites the 1969 moon shot and the 1977 Voyager probe as transformative events that brought the realm of science fiction down to Earth .
" Fantasy has become a part of the mainstream , " he says , " but in a different way , a mythic way . "
And myths endure .
This is why the genre will survive all the scattershot sub-genres , underwritten screenplays and over - exploding climaxes of a franchise mentality gone mad .
For every Matrix Revolutions , there is a Matrix .
For every Jar Jar Binks , there is a Yoda .
Wellington invokes '' Sturgeon 's Law , " an apocryphal maxim attributed to sci- fi author Theodore Sturgeon ( Venus Plus X , which imagines a genderless society ) .
It states , rather delicately , that " Ninety percent of everything is crud . "
" It 's up to 99 at this point , " Wellington estimates .
But in the end we have to count him among the optimists , because he remembers the olden days , so many far - side - of - the - moons ago , when science - fiction fanatics were personae non gratae in the world at large .

" At one time , science fiction was Lesbians of Venus — you would read it with a brown - paper cover on the subway , because you did n't want anybody to see you with it . "
But in an age defined by the Internet , designed by software technicians and dominated by fan - driven campaigns in the blogosphere , science fiction and its fanatics have at last nestled into the mainstream .
Not only that :
They own it .

ROLLA , Mo. — Camp Winnigootchee was never like this .
A group of high school students stood at the edge of a limestone quarry last month as three air horn blasts warned that something big was about to go boom .
Across the quarry , with a roar and a cloud of dust and smoke , a 50 - foot - high wall of rock sloughed away with a shudder and a long crashing fall , and 20,000 tons of rock was suddenly on the ground .
The campers laughed .
“ That ’s cool ! ” said Ian Dalton , a student from Camdenton , Mo .
Austin Shoemaker , a student from Macon , Mo. , concurred .
“ It was baad ! ” he said .
“ Do it again ! ”
There are n’t many wholesome explosions in the news these day , but those are what Summer Explosives Camp provides .
It is just a louder , and arguably more exciting , version of the kind of summer experiences designed to recruit students to the quieter academic disciplines .
The University of Iowa , for example , has a summer program in microbiology ; Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie , Mich. , offers a one - week program in robotics ; Northwestern College in Orange City , Iowa , offers Neuroscience Camp , which includes a trip to a cadaver laboratory to see a brain and spinal cord .
But do those programs , whatever their merits , let the participants blow things up ?
No , they do not .
This program , which does , is set up to draw students to a program at the University of Missouri - Rolla engineering school that feeds industries like mining and demolition .
In theory , a markedly improved method of lie detection could have as profound an impact as DNA evidence .

The most egregious liar I ever knew was someone I never suspected until the day that , suddenly and irrevocably , I did .
Twelve years ago , a young man named Stephen Glass began writing for The New Republic , where I was an editor .
He quickly established himself as someone who was always onto an amusingly outlandish story — like the time he met some Young Republican types at a convention , gathered them around a hotel - room minibar , then , with guileless ferocity , captured their boorishness in print .
I liked Steve ; most of us who worked with him did .
A baby - faced guy from suburban Chicago , he padded around the office in his socks .
Before going on an errand , Steve would ask if I wanted a muffin or a sandwich ; he always noticed a new scarf or a clever turn of phrase , and asked after a colleague ’s baby or spouse .
When he met with editors to talk about his latest reporting triumph , he was self - effacing and sincere .
He ’d look us in the eye , wait for us to press him for details , and then , without fidgeting or mumbling , supply them .
One day , the magazine published an article by Steve about a teen - ager so diabolically gifted at hacking into corporate computer networks that C.E.O.s paid him huge sums just to stop messing with them .
A reporter for the online edition of Forbes was assigned to chase down the story .
You can see how Steve ’s journalism career unravelled if you watch the movie “ Shattered Glass ” : Forbes challenged the story ’s veracity , and Steve — after denying the charges , concocting a fake Web site , and enlisting his brother to pose as a victimized C.E.O. — finally confessed that he ’d made up the whole thing .
Editors and reporters at the magazine investigated , and found that Steve had been inventing stories for at least a year .
The magazine disavowed twenty - seven articles .
After Steve ’s unmasking , my colleagues and I felt ashamed of our gullibility .
But maybe we should n’t have .
Human beings are terrible lie detectors .
In academic studies , subjects asked to distinguish truth from lies answer correctly , on average , fifty - four per cent of the time .
They are better at guessing when they are being told the truth than when they are being lied to , accurately classifying only forty - seven per cent of lies , according to a recent meta- analysis of some two hundred deception studies , published by Bella DePaulo , of the University of California at Santa Barbara , and Charles Bond , Jr. , of Texas Christian University .
Subjects are often led astray by an erroneous sense of how a liar behaves .
“ People hold a stereotype of the liar — as tormented , anxious , and conscience - stricken , ” DePaulo and Bond write .
( The idea that a liar ’s anxiety will inevitably become manifest can be found as far back as the ancient Greeks , Demosthenes in particular . )
In fact , many liars experience what deception researchers call “ duping delight . ”
Aldert Vrij , a psychologist at the University of Portsmouth , in England , argues that there is no such thing as “ typical ” deceptive behavior — “ nothing as obvious as Pinocchio ’s growing nose . ”
When people tell complicated lies , they frequently pause longer and more often , and speak more slowly ; but if the lie is simple , or highly polished , they tend to do the opposite .
Clumsy deceivers are sometimes visibly agitated , but , over all , liars are less likely to blink , to move their hands and feet , or to make elaborate gestures — perhaps they deliberately inhibit their movements .
As DePaulo says , “ To be a good liar , you do n’t need to know what behaviors really separate liars from truthtellers , but what behaviors people think separate them . ”
A liar ’s testimony is often more persuasive than a truthteller ’s .
Liars are more likely to tell a story in chronological order , whereas honest people often present accounts in an improvised jumble .
Similarly , according to DePaulo and Bond , subjects who spontaneously corrected themselves , or said that there were details that they could n’t recall , were more likely to be truthful than those who did not — though , in the real world , memory lapses arouse suspicion .
People who are afraid of being disbelieved , even when they are telling the truth , may well look more nervous than people who are lying .
This is bad news for the falsely accused , especially given that influential manuals of interrogation reinforce the myth of the twitchy liar .
“ Criminal Interrogation and Confessions ” ( 1986 ) , by Fred Inbau , John Reid , and Joseph Buckley , claims that shifts in posture and nervous “ grooming gestures , ” such as “ straightening hair ” and “ picking lint from clothing , ” often signal lying .
David Zulawski and Douglas Wicklander ’s “ Practical Aspects of Interview and Interrogation ” ( 1992 ) asserts that a liar ’s movements tend to be “ jerky and abrupt ” and his hands “ cold and clammy . ”
Bunching Kleenex in a sweaty hand is another damning sign — one more reason for a sweaty - palmed , Kleenex - bunching person like me to hope that she ’s never interrogated .
Maureen O’Sullivan , a deception researcher at the University of San Francisco , studies why humans are so bad at recognizing lies .
Many people , she says , base assessments of truthfulness on irrelevant factors , such as personality or appearance .
“ Baby - faced , non-weird , and extroverted people are more likely to be judged truthful , ” she says .
( Maybe this explains my trust in Steve Glass . )
People are also blinkered by the “ truthfulness bias ” : the vast majority of questions we ask of other people — the time , the price of the breakfast special — are answered honestly , and truth is therefore our default expectation .
Then , there ’s the “ learning - curve problem . ”
We do n’t have a refined idea of what a successful lie looks and sounds like , since we almost never receive feedback on the fibs that we ’ve been told ; the co-worker who , at the corporate retreat , assured you that she loved your presentation does n’t usually reveal later that she hated it .
As O’Sullivan puts it , “ By definition , the most convincing lies go undetected . ”
Maybe it ’s because we ’re such poor lie detectors that we have kept alive the dream of a foolproof lie- detecting machine .
This February , at a conference on deception research , in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Steven Hyman , a psychiatrist and the provost of Harvard , spoke of “ the incredible hunger to have some test that separates truth from deception — in some sense , the science be damned . ”
This hunger has kept the polygraph , for example , in widespread use .
The federal government still performs tens of thousands of polygraph tests a year — even though an exhaustive 2003 National Academy of Sciences report concluded that research on the polygraph ’s efficacy was inadequate , and that when it was used to investigate a specific incident after the fact it performed “ well above chance , though well below perfection . ”
Polygraph advocates cite accuracy estimates of ninety per cent — which sounds impressive until you think of the people whose lives might be ruined by a machine that fails one out of ten times .
The polygraph was judged thoroughly unreliable as a screening tool ; its accuracy in “ distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers ” was deemed “ insufficient to justify reliance on its use . ”
And its success in criminal investigations can be credited , in no small part , to the intimidation factor .
People who believe that they are in the presence of an infallible machine sometimes confess , and this is counted as an achievement of the polygraph .
( According to law - enforcement lore , the police have used copy machines in much the same way :
They tell a suspect to place his hand on a “ truth machine ” — a copier in which the paper has “ LIE ” printed on it .
When the photocopy emerges , it shows the suspect ’s hand with “ LIE ” stamped on it . )
Ted Stevens & Corruption : Move Over Duke Cunningham 8/24/06 Kodiak , Alaska - The Anchorage Daily News ran a story titled , " Attorney selection steams Stevens . "
The appointment of Nelson Cohen as the new United States Attorney General for Alaska has greatly upset U.S. Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) .
Ted 's probably upset for good reasons : Adak Pollock , real estate deals , earmarks , and legislative end - runs in fisheries management and rights allocations ( crab rationalization and other nefarious giveaways ) .
Cohen was the chief of the White Collar Crime Division when he served as the assistant attorney general for the United States in Pennsylvania .
For many years , Groundswell has been asking federal special agents from multiple agencies for assistance in ensuring that Alaska gets a new US AG who is not part of the Alaska crony and political damage control system .
We suspected something was seriously wrong when former U.S. attorney general Timothy Burgess failed to prosecute the Adak Crab Allocation perjury charges , after Larry Davison and I filed a federal petition in 2003 .
And amazingly , Burgess soon got a judgeship .
Anytime Burgess wants to provide answers to this situation , he can start ( please ) by answering publicly " Why did the US AG office fail to prosecute the Adak Crab Allocation perjury and the multiple counts ? "
And , " Why , once the federal agents found the plan in writing to break through the crab caps , did the US AG office not prosecute Dr. Terry L. Leitzell , chief counsel for Icicle Seafoods ? "
An earlier Groundswell article mentions Burgess ' close association with Alaska 's powerful Republicans , and how crooked we feel those powerhouse players have been .
No wonder
Ted is deeply upset that the White House has begun to correct that " inside " bias , and ensure that Ted Stevens is no longer " in control of " the Justice department here , too .
It 's enough he headed the fourth branch of government , Appropriations , and still runs the Senate Commerce show .
Our Writ of Mandamus , an extraordinary writ to command the National Marine Fisheries Service 's general counsel office to properly handle a perjury ( false testimony ) before the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council was filed on January 13 , 2003 , in the Western District of the United States Court in Seattle , Washington .
We served the pro se ( we wrote it and filed it ) writ ( for injunctive relief ) on then U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in Washington D.C.
The NOAA Office of Law Enforcement soon began a criminal investigation regarding Adak .
Eventually , the largest fine in NOAA history was levied against Icicle Seafoods , Adak Fisheries and related parties , yet the $ 3.44 million Notice of Violation and Assessment has still not been finalized .
We are awaiting word from the government , after an appeal occurred this past January before an administrative judge , in Seattle .
What was remarkable , though , was the number of counts left on the table when only the crab cap violation ( breaking rules under the American Fisheries Act ) was handled .
And you 've read from John Enge 's pieces that crab fishermen have talked with federal agents who were upset , too , that the other counts went nowhere .
Here 's a reminder of how to properly deal with institutionalized corruption : " March 3 , 2006 , SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) -- Former GOP Congressman Randy " Duke " Cunningham was sentenced Friday to eight years and four months in federal prison for taking $ 2.4 million in bribes from at least three defense contractors .
" House Speaker and fellow Republican Dennis Hastert issued a statement after Cunningham 's sentencing stating that he hopes the congressman 's prison term sends " a strong message " that nobody is above the law .
" It is my hope that Congressman Cunningham will spend his incarceration thinking long and hard about how he broke the trust of the voters that elected him and those on Capitol Hill who served with him , " Hastert said . "
Groundswell 's advice is that Ted should be out buying new stationary , and the return address should say Cellblock 666 , Leavenworth County , Kansas .

A month after firing shock jock Don Imus for racist comments , CBS Radio has fired the Doghouse , a former San Francisco and San Jose morning team , for a prank phone call making fun of workers at a Chinese restaurant .
The Doghouse , with J.V. and Elvis ( Jeff Vandergrift and Dan Lay ) , had been working at CBS Radio ’s New York affiliate , WFNY -FM ( 92.3 ) .
The pair was fired Friday .
Two years ago , the two were fired in San Francisco for making sexual comments off the air to a woman who was in the studio to promote a charity event for a local drum and bugle corps .
“ This is huge news .
It shows we do n’t have to tolerate this kind of racism , ” said Frank Lee of the Organization for Justice and Equality in the East Bay , one of seven groups that petitioned the network and protested outside its New York headquarters .
The group had gathered 10,000 signatures in four days after Vandergrift and Dan Lay played the prank phone call on the air .
During the call they made sexual comments to a woman who answered the phone at a Chinese restaurant and made fun of another man ’s accent and driving skills .
The duo , which used to work at San Jose ’s Hot 97.7 and San Francisco ’s Wild 94.9 and Free FM 106.9 , played the offensive call April 21 , a week after former CBS morning show host Don Imus was fired for calling the Rutgers University women ’s basketball team “ nappy - headed hos . ”
Lee said his group was notified of the firing of Vandergrift and Lay and their producer late Friday .
The two had been suspended after the group complained to the network April 24 .
“ This case should have alerted the media that programs with such racist and sexist content will not be tolerated and that racial discrimination and sexual harassment must be stopped , ” Lee said in a news release .
Doghouse fans have supported the pair on its Web site and suggested that the network has infringed on freedom of speech .
The fans are continually playing the prank call on the site with a segment from Fox TV’s ` Hannity and Colmes . ”
Both Sean Hannity , a conservative , and Alan Colmes , a liberal , have defended the Doghouse .

Ms Chauhan 's supporters say it was a protest of last resort
Her in - laws were questioned by the police and have been released on bail .
The Hindu woman shocked residents of the normally conservative city of Rajkot in Gujarat state , by her half - naked parade through the street .
Women 's groups say her case highlights the plight of women who continue to face abuse at the hands of males .
' Extreme steps '
There are reports that the 22 - year - old tried to set herself on fire a few days ago demanding the police take immediate action against her husband and in - laws , who she alleged had been physically torturing her for a dowry .
In an interview to a local TV channel , Pooja Chauhan justified her action saying she did it to embarrass her husband and in - laws .
Although paying and accepting a dowry has been illegal in India for more than 40 years , it still goes on .
Official estimates show that every year almost 7,000 women are killed by their spouses and in - laws because of inadequate dowry payments .
Ranjana Kumari - who runs a refuge for victims of dowry and domestic abuse - says the law enforcement authorities need to be more active in tackling the problem .
" It 's a shame that women are driven to take such extreme steps .
The law enforcing agencies must be more active , " she told the BBC News website .
A police inspector in Rajkot , SS Jhala , told the BBC that " swift action " had been taken against Ms Chauhan 's family , who had been arrested and were now on bail .
Police have denied reports that they charged her for indecent behaviour .
The U.S. Department of Energy has committed $ 125 million to an aggressive effort called Joint BioEnergy Institute ( JBEI , pronounced Jay Bay ) , that will develop fuels from plant material .
It 's a five - year partnership between three national laboratories and three universities .
Working at a central lab facility in the San Francisco Bay Area , researchers will create new forms of life that will produce ethanol with unprecedented efficiency .
This field of science – synthetic biology – will be used to make crops that are extremely tough and productive .
Optimized plants will push the limit of fuel production per acre of land .
The same laboratory techniques will be used to design organisms that convert plant material into fuel in the most cost - effective manner possible .
Biodiesel and ethanol are currently the two leading types of liquid biofuel .
Ethanol can be blended with gasoline to make a somewhat clean - burning fuel called E85 .
Fermenting sugar is the easiest part of making ethanol .
Humanity has been adept at this for millennia , but there is still a lot of room for improvement .
Most microbes die when the alcohol concentration in a tank gets too high .
Stronger microbes will be able to work longer and possibly break down a wider variety of substances to make fuel .
Brazil is far ahead of the United States in biofuel production .
In Brazil , ethanol is easy to make because the juice of sugarcane crops can be directly fermented .
Many crops in the United States are low in sugar but very high in the carbohydrate cellulose , which must be turned into fermentable sugar .
That transformation is a costly and expensive process .
Researchers at JBEI will design new organisms and enzymes to convert cellulose to sugar as efficiently as possible .
For quite a while , the Joint Genome Institute , in Walnut Creek , California , has been actively sequencing the genomes of microbes and insects that are adept at converting cellulose to sugar .
JGI has also sequenced the genomes of plants that produce large amounts of cellulose .
Researchers at the new BioEnergy center may use the information gathered JGI as a starting point to overcome each of the three sugar production bottlenecks – sustainable agriculture , improved fermentation , and efficient breakdown of cellulose to sugar .
Jay Keasling , the head of the new center , says it will be run like a startup company and will partner with industry .
The institute will be in the West Berkeley Biocenter – a building central to all six partners , Stanford , Berkeley , U.C. Davis , Lawrence Livermore , Sandia , and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories .
It will eventually lease a larger facility in the same area .
Earlier this year , the energy giant BP gave $ 500 million to Berkeley , Lawrence Berkeley lab , and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign for similar alternative energy research .
That gift will fund the Energy Biosciences Institute , which will operate separately from the JBEI .

The toilet is in a prime site
The toilet block in historic St Andrews has sold at auction for about four times the guide price .
The stone block , in the Fife town 's City Road , has been sold to a mystery developer from the west of Scotland who plans to convert it into a house .
Fife Council put the block on the market , along with other properties , after closing it to the public .
Golfing mecca
St Andrews already boasts the most expensive street in Scotland - overlooking the Old Course .
An unexpected bidding war broke out when the toilet block went under the hammer at a property sale in the Quality Central Hotel in Glasgow .
Three rooms
The listed stone building , which still boasts its male and female toilets , attracted about 15 potential buyers .
The three - room building is located in a prime site near the town 's historic West Port , is on one level and originally had a guide price of £ 50,000 .
It has three doors onto the street and was described by the sellers as being in need of extensive renovation .
About 15 bidders showed interest
Auctioneer Shaun Vigers , director of SVA Property , said : " It was a hugely successful sale .
We try to give some sort of guide as to what each property is going to get but we had n't sold any public toilets for at least 10 years so we had no comparison .
" There were lots of different ideas for it , people were talking about food use , a gallery , retail and office use .
" But I think we were helped by the fact Fife Council planning department indicated they would not be averse to considering a scheme for residential conversion . "
The property was one of two public conveniences among the Fife Council properties being auctioned with a similar block in Kirkcaldy fetching £ 38,000 .
In total , the sale netted the council about £ 750,000 .
It is always sad to see people do this .
Everone must justify their decision of owning either PC or Mac by sticking up for everything on " Their side " and bashing everything on the other side .
My side is better because of ...
The iPhone was interesting , I will not buy one , but it had some interesting things to it .
The Surface is interesting , not buying one of these either , but I still find it having potential for the future .
Enough making yourself feel better because of your past gadget purchases and just accept that your enemies are who you make them and finding what works on both sides can only benefit everyone .
In a recent experiment , our research team has shown that even infants — at around their first birthdays , before language acquisition has begun — tend to follow the direction of another person ’s eyes , not their heads .
Thus , when an adult looked to the ceiling with her eyes only , head remaining straight ahead , infants looked to the ceiling in turn .
However , when the adult closed her eyes and pointed her head to the ceiling , infants did not very often follow .
Our nearest primate relatives , the African great apes ( chimpanzees , bonobos and gorillas ) showed precisely the opposite pattern of gaze following .
When the human pointed her eyes only to the ceiling ( head remaining straight ahead ) , they followed only rarely .
But when she pointed her head only ( eyes closed ) to the ceiling , they followed much more often .
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that all great apes , including humans , follow the gaze direction of others .
But in previous studies the head and eyes were always pointed in the same direction .
Only when we made the head and eyes point in different directions did we find a species difference : humans are sensitive to the direction of the eyes specifically in a way that our nearest primate relatives are not .
This is the first demonstration of an actual behavioral function for humans ’ uniquely visible eyes .
Why might it have been advantageous for some early humans to advertise their eye direction in a way that enabled others to determine what they were looking at more easily ?
One possible answer , what we have called the cooperative eye hypothesis , is that especially visible eyes made it easier to coordinate close - range collaborative activities in which discerning where the other was looking and perhaps what she was planning , benefited both participants .
If we are gathering berries to share , with one of us pulling down a branch and the other harvesting the fruit , it would be useful — especially before language evolved — for us to coordinate our activities and communicate our plans , using our eyes and perhaps other visually based gestures .
Infant research , too , suggests that coordinating visual attention may have provided the foundation for the evolution of human language .
Babies begin to acquire language through joint activities with others , in which both parties are focused on the same object or task .
That ’s the best time for an infant to learn the word for the object or activity in question .
We are still a long way from figuring out why humans evolved to do so many complicated things together — from building houses to creating universities to fighting wars .
But the simple fact that we have evolved highly visible eyes , to which infants attune even before language , supplies at least one small piece of the puzzle of how .
May 14th is the official deadline for cable modem companies , DSL providers , broadband over powerline , satellite internet companies and some universities to finish wiring up their networks with FBI - friendly surveillance gear , to comply with the FCC 's expanded interpretation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act .
Congress passed CALEA in 1994 to help FBI eavesdroppers deal with digital telecom technology .
The law required phone companies to make their networks easier to wiretap .
The results : on mobile phone networks , where CALEA tech has 100 % penetration , it 's credited with boosting the number of court - approved wiretaps a carrier can handle simultaneously , and greatly shortening the time it takes to get a wiretap going .
Cops can now start listening in less than a day .
Now that speed and efficiency is coming to internet surveillance .
While CALEA is all about phones , the Justice Department began lobbying the FCC in 2002 to reinterpret the law as applying to the internet as well .
The commission obliged , and last June a divided federal appeals court upheld the expansion 2 - 1 .
( The dissenting judge called the FCC 's position " gobbledygook . "
But he was outnumbered . )
So , if you 're a broadband provider ( separately , some VOIP companies are covered too ) …
Hurry !
The deadline has already passed to file an FCC form 445 ( .pdf ) , certifying that you 're on schedule , or explaining why you 're not .
You can also find the 68 - page official industry spec for internet surveillance here .
It 'll cost you $ 164.00 to download , but then you 'll know exactly what format to use when delivering customer packets to federal or local law enforcement , including " e- mail , instant messaging records , web - browsing information and other information sent or received through a user 's broadband connection , including on - line banking activity . "
There are also third party brokers who will handle all this for you for a fee .
It 's worth noting that the new requirements do n't alter the legal standards for law enforcement to win court orders for internet wiretaps .
Fans of CALEA expansion argue that it therefore wo n't increase the number of Americans under surveillance .
That 's wrong , of course .
Making surveillance easier and faster gives law enforcement agencies of all stripes more reason to eschew old - fashioned police work in favor of spying .
The telephone CALEA compliance deadline was in 2002 , and since then the amount of court - ordered surveillance has nearly doubled from 2,586 applications granted that year , to 4,015 orders in 2006 .

Old Lyme , Conn .
THE other day at a Los Angeles race track , a comedian named Eddie Griffin took a meeting with a concrete barrier and left a borrowed bright - red $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo looking like bad origami .
Just to be clear , this was a different bright - red $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo from the one a Swedish businessman crumpled up and threw away last year on the Pacific Coast Highway .
I mention this only because it ’s easy to get confused by the vast and highly repetitious category “ Rich and Famous People Acting Like Total Idiots . ”
Mr. Griffin walked away uninjured , and everybody offered wise counsel about how this was n’t really such a bad day after all .
So what exactly constitutes a bad day in this rarefied little world ?
Did the casino owner Steve Wynn cross the mark when he put his elbow through a Picasso he was about to sell for $ 139 million ?
Did Mel ( “ I Own Malibu ” ) Gibson sense bad - day emanations when he started on a bigoted tirade while seated drunk in the back of a sheriff ’s car ?
And if dumb stuff like this comes so easy to these people , how is it that they ’re the ones with all the money ?
Modern science has the answer , with a little help from the poet Hilaire Belloc .
Let ’s begin with what I call the “ Cookie Monster Experiment , ” devised to test the hypothesis that power makes people stupid and insensitive — or , as the scientists at the University of California at Berkeley put it , “ disinhibited . ”
Researchers led by the psychologist Dacher Keltner took groups of three ordinary volunteers and randomly put one of them in charge .
Each trio had a half - hour to work through a boring social survey .
Then a researcher came in and left a plateful of precisely five cookies .
Care to guess which volunteer typically grabbed an extra cookie ?
The volunteer who had randomly been assigned the power role was also more likely to eat it with his mouth open , spew crumbs on partners and get cookie detritus on his face and on the table .

The story of a 6 - year - old Afghan boy who says he thwarted an effort by Taliban militants to trick him into being a suicide bomber provoked tears and anger at a meeting of tribal leaders .
The account from Juma Gul , a dirt - caked child who collects scrap metal for money , left American soldiers dumb - founded that a youngster could be sent on such a mission .
Afghan troops crowded around the boy to call him a hero .
Though the Taliban dismissed the story as propaganda , at a time when US and NATO forces are under increasing criticism over civilian casualties , both Afghan tribal elders and US military officers said they were convinced by his dramatic account .
Juma said that sometime last month Taliban fighters forced him to wear a vest they said would spray out flowers when he touched a button .
He said they told him that when he saw American soldiers , " throw your body at them . "
The militants cornered Juma in a Taliban - controlled district in southern Afghanistan 's Ghazni province .
Their target was an impoverished youngster being raised by an older sister - but also one who proved too street - smart for their plan .
" When they first put the vest on my body I did n't know what to think , but then I felt the bomb , " Juma told The Associated Press as he ate lamb and rice after being introduced to the elders at this joint US - Afghan base in Ghazni .
" After I figured out it was a bomb , I went to the Afghan soldiers for help . "
While Juma 's story could not be independently verified , local government leaders backed his account and the US and NATO military missions said they believed his story .
Abdul Rahim Deciwal , the chief administrator for Juma 's village of Athul , brought the boy and an older brother , Dad Gul , to a weekend meeting between Afghan elders and US Army Colonel Martin P Schweitzer .
Schweitzer called the Taliban 's attempt " a cowardly act . "
As Deciwal told Juma 's story , 20 Afghan elders repeatedly clicked their tongues in sadness and disapproval .
When the boy and his brother were brought in , several of the turban - wearing men welled up , wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs .
" If anybody has a heart , then how can you control yourself ( before ) these kids ? "
Deciwal said in broken English .
Wallets quickly opened , and the boys were handed US $ 60 in American and Afghan currency - a good chunk of money in a country where teachers and police earn US $ 70 a month .
Afghan officials described the boys as extremely poor , and Juma said he is being raised by his sister because his father works in a bakery in Pakistan and his mother lives and does domestic work in another village .
" I think the boy is intelligent , " Deciwal said .
" When he comes from the enemy he found a checkpoint of the ANA ( Afghan National Army ) , and he asked the ANA : ' Hey , can you help me ?
Somebody gave me this jacket and I do n't know what 's inside but maybe something bad . ' "
Lt Col George Graff , a father of five who attended the meeting , also teared up .
" Relating to them as a father and trying to fathom somebody using one of my children for that kind of a purpose , jeez , it just tore me up , " said Graff , a National Guard soldier from St. George , Utah .
" The depths that these people will go to get what they want , which is power for themselves - it 's just disgusting . "
A Taliban spokesman , Qari Yousef Ahmadi , denied the militant group uses child fighters , saying it has hundreds of adults ready for suicide missions .
" We do n't need to use a child , " Ahmadi said by satellite phone .
" It 's against Islamic law , it 's against humanitarian law .
This is just propaganda against the Taliban . "
However , a gory Taliban video that surfaced in April showed militants instructing a boy of about 12 as he beheaded an alleged traitor with a large knife .
UN officials condemned the act as a war crime .
Fidgety but smiling during all the attention , Juma said he had been scared when he was surrounded by Taliban fighters .
He cupped his hands together to show the size of the bomb , then ran his hands along his waist to show where it was on his body .
A fan of soccer , Juma said his favorite subject in school is Pashto , his native language , but he also showed off a little English , shyly counting " 1 , 2 , 3 " before breaking out in an oversize smile .
Raised in a country where birthdays are not always carefully tracked , Juma said he is 4 .
But he looks older and Afghan officials said he is about 6 .
His brother appears to be a year or so older .
Their village lies in Ghazni province 's Andar district , a Taliban stronghold targeted this month in a joint Afghan - U.S. operation .
The region remains dangerous and Afghan elders worry for Juma 's safety .
Major John Thomas , a spokesman for NATO 's International Security Assistance Force , said he was " a bit skeptical " about Juma 's story at first , " but everything I 've heard makes me more and more comfortable . "
Thomas said the case would force soldiers to think twice before assuming children are safe .
" This is one incident .
We hope it does n't repeat itself .
But it gives us reason to pause , to be extra careful , " he said .
" We want to publicize this as much as we can to the Afghan people so that they can protect their children from these killers . "
Colonel Sayed Waqef
Shah , a religious and cultural affairs officer for the Afghan army , wiped away tears after seeing Juma .
" Whenever I see this kind of action from the Taliban , if I am able to arrest them , I 'll kill them on the spot , " he said .
Haji Niaz Mohammad , one of the elders at the gathering , said he hoped " God makes the Afghan government strong " so it can defeat the Taliban .
" They are the enemy of Muslims and the enemy of the children , " he said , shaking his fists in anger .
LOWELL — Darren Sawyer was given a choice at the beginning of school yesterday : Change out of his brown clothes or go home .
Brown clothing was recently banned at the Molloy Alternative High School , where Sawyer is a sophomore .
The ban came about from the emergence of the Brown Mafia , a new teenage gang in Lowell whose members wear the color brown , school officials said .
When Sawyer refused to change into a school - issued T - shirt or call home to have other clothes brought to the school , he was sent home , said Molloy Principal Kathy Akashian .
“ It ’s ridiculous , ” said Sawyer ’s mother , Lisa Motard .
“ I ’ve heard of banning red and black .
Now brown ?
What other colors are they going to come up with ? ”
Akashian deemed Sawyer ’s chocolate Aeropostale hooded sweatshirt and American Eagle T - shirt to be in violation of the school handbook , which prohibits students from wearing gang - related clothing .
Akashian said students were verbally warned “ several months ago ” not to wear brown to school .
“ We try to make the school as accepting and welcoming as possible for these kids , ” said Akashian .
The Brown Mafia emerged several months ago in the city , according to School Resource Officer Tim Crowley .
It was formed by black and Hispanic teenagers , but also accepts members from other ethnic backgrounds , Crowley said .
“ When we identify a color a gang is associated with , and we find a person who may be associated with that gang , we do n’t let them wear it to school , ” said Crowley .
Sawyer , 17 , who is Caucasian , claims to have never heard of the Brown Mafia and insists he is not a gang member .
“ It made me feel like crap because almost half of my clothes have brown on them , ” said Sawyer .
Both shirts were Christmas gifts , Sawyer said , adding that several other articles of clothing he got for Christmas are also brown .
“ I ca n’t wear my new clothes now , ” said Sawyer .
“ What ’s going to be next ?
Red , white and blue ?
Soon kids are going to be going to school wearing nothing because everything is gang . ”
Lowell High School Headmaster Bill Samaras said students are allowed to wear brown clothing unless it appears they are making a gang statement by donning the color .
The policy is especially strict at the Alternative School , said Samaras , where many students have a history of disciplinary problems .
“ We have a very strong position on gang apparel , ” said Samaras .
“ We ’re not talking about someone who innocently wears a color .
When a color is worn in such a way to represent a gang , they ’re told to change their clothes or they ’re out of the school .
It ’s of absolute zero tolerance in that school .
They know what they ’re responsible for . ”
Motard said her son attends the Alternative School because he has ADHD and does better with smaller class sizes .
She said he will continue to wear his brown sweatshirt to school .
If he is sent home again , she plans to hire a lawyer .
“ There goes my son ’s education for the day all because of a brown T - shirt and a brown sweatshirt , ” said Motard .
“ They stare at everybody ’s clothing instead of worrying about their education . ”
According to Akashian , another student was also sent home yesterday for wearing a brown and refusing to change into other clothing .

The “ telomere clock ” — the progressive shortening of telomeres at every cell division — limits replicative capacity in culture and ( judging from the progressive generational deterioration of telomerase knockout mouse lines ) in vivo as well .
Telomere length shows an inverse relationship with both chronological age and stress ( though this latter point is controversial : it is based on measurements of peripheral blood leukocytes , in which stress - associated infection may cause hyperproliferation ; some consider this a potential trivial explanation of the observations ) .
Telomere length is heterogeneous , both among cell lineages within an individual and between individuals .
Given that telomere length governs replicative ( and therefore tissue - regenerative ) capacity and has some ( negative ) correlation with stress , it seems logical to ask whether telomere length is associated with lifespan .
Njajou et al. address this question by looking at the heritability of telomere length in a genetically homogeneous population ( the Amish , who eschew much modern technology but are apparently kind enough to share their blood samples with those who do not ) .
They find that telomere length is indeed heritable , but asymmetrically between parents : Dad ’s telomeres matter more than Mom’s .
Telomere length is paternally inherited and is associated with parental lifespan Telomere length ( TL ) is emerging as a biomarker for aging and survival .
To evaluate factors influencing this trait , we measured TL in a large homogeneous population , estimated the heritability ( h( 2 ) ) , and tested for parental effects on TL variation .
Our sample included 356 men and 551 women , aged 18 - 92 years , from large Amish families .
Mean TL in leukocytes was measured by quantitative PCR ( mean : 6,198 +/- 1,696 bp ) .
The h ( 2 ) of TL was 0.44 +/- 0.06 ( P < 0.001 ) , after adjusting for age , sex , and TL assay batch .
As expected , TL was negatively correlated with age ( r = - 0.40 ; P < 0.001 ) .
There was no significant difference in TL between men and women , consistent with our previous findings that Amish men lived as long as Amish women .
There was a stronger and positive correlation and association between TL in the offspring and paternal TL ( r = 0.46 , P < 0.001 ; beta = 0.22 , P = 0.006 ) than offspring and maternal TL ( r = 0.18 , P = 0.04 ; beta = - 0.02 , P = 0.4 ) .
Furthermore , we observed a positive correlation and association between daughter ’s TL and paternal lifespan ( r = 0.20 , P < 0.001 ; beta = 0.21 , P = 0.04 ) , but not between daughter ’s TL and maternal lifespan ( r = - 0.01 , beta = 0.04 ; both P = not significant ) .
Our data , which are based on one of the largest family studies of human TL , support a link between TL and aging and lifespan and suggest a strong genetic influence , possibly via an imprinting mechanism , on TL regulation .
The authors use DNA samples from , which are more than a few cell divisions removed from the germ line .
Thus the heritability of telomere length is an important finding all by itself , because it suggests that blood leukocyte telomere length is representative of the “ inherent ” telomere length of an individual .
The paper ’s key finding ( from my perspective , at least ) did n’t make it into the title : Telomere length is positively correlated with lifespan .
While I ’m aware of studies linking telomerase activity in animal species to lifespan , the growing consensus seems to be that this is a corollary of the relationship between telomerase and body mass , which in turn is correlated with lifespan ; furthermore , the relationship is the opposite of the one here ( larger , longer - lived animals tend to have lower telomerase activity than smaller , shorter - lived animals with a similar body plan ; see our earlier article Telomerase correlates negatively with body mass ) .
This is the first study I ’m aware of in which human - to - human variation in telomere length ( which occupies a concept space somewhere between the strictly genetic and the strictly epigenetic ) has been shown to correlate with lifespan .
The key issue now , of course :
Where are the causal links , if any , between the telomeres a person inherits and their life expectancy ?
In 2016 , after receiving feedback from about 150 free software community members , the High Priority Projects committee recommended extensive updates to the FSF High Priority Projects list .
The High Priority Projects initiative , first launched in 2005 , draws attention to a relatively small number of projects of great strategic importance to the goal of freedom for all computer users .
The list serves to foster work on projects that are important for increasing the adoption and use of free software applications and free software operating systems .
The list helps guide volunteers , supporters , and companies to projects where their skills and resources can be utilized , whether they be in coding , graphic design , writing , financial contributions , or activism .
We hope that you can find a project here where your skill , energy , money , and time can be put to good use .
The FSF does not ask to run or control these projects ; some of them are GNU projects ( and all are welcome to apply ) , but we are happy to encourage them whether they are done under our auspices or not .
In March 2016 , the committee identified criteria that qualify a project for inclusion on the list .
The list focuses on broad areas of need , highlighting projects within each area of need that are particularly promising .
The committee also publicly discussed the update to the list at LibrePlanet 2016 .
A separate changelog for the list is available , starting in 2017 .
The FSF is committed to ongoing evaluation of and updates to the High Priority Projects list .
Please email any suggestions you have about the list to hpp-feedback@gnu.org so that they can be incorporated by the review committee in the future .
High Priority Free Software areas :
Smart phones are the most widely used form of personal computer today .
Thus , the need for a fully free phone operating system is crucial to the proliferation of software freedom .

This large and fragmented space deals with increased centralization of Web activities , and user reliance on servers they do n't control ( Service as a Software Substitute ( SaaSS ) ) .
The free software community provided extensive feedback regarding many projects that fall under this initiative .

Drivers , firmware , and hardware are integral parts of the computers we use and the devices that interact with them -- and when these things are proprietary , they are incompatible with free software .
Therefore , drivers , firmware , and hardware that can be fully used with free software are crucial to the operation of free systems .

Many widely used voice - over - IP programs , like Skype and FaceTime , use proprietary protocols and nonfree implementations .
These programs seduce free software users into using proprietary software , often two users at a time .
Using proprietary voice and video chat software means that we can't be sure who is listening in , because we can't see the code .
Unfortunately , Google Hangouts is also not a solution here , because it still requires users to run proprietary software .

Free software relies on contributions from community members .
But systemic barriers often prevent interested individuals from becoming contributors , especially when those individuals are from groups that have been historically marginalized .

Accessibility is the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with , or access to software programs by people with disabilities or impairments , or those using assistive , adaptive , or rehabilitative technologies .
This includes adding features and building tools , including screen readers , keyboard shortcuts , and more , to increase access to software programs .

Internationalization is the process of designing software so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes .
Internationalization is a feature ethically tied to the values of free software , and is often a strength of free software .
But we can do better :
Free software can accept translation contributions from anyone who submits them , whereas proprietary software companies historically only bother with languages it serves their profit and other interests to include .
When we internationalize free software , we make it easier for others to adapt and spread it in other languages and regions .

Security is a concern for all computing and all computer users .
Although users cannot ever be truly certain of their security when using proprietary software , that does not mean free software is automatically secure .
Free software developers and users must take steps to improve the security of free software projects .

Apple 's Siri , Google Now , Cortana , Amazon Echo's Alexa , and other intelligent personal assistants ( IPAs ) are becoming more pervasive .
Whatever convenience they provide comes with unacceptable tradeoffs :
The breadth of access to users ' data they take in order to operate is enormous , and both the client and server accessing such data are not distributed , posing Service as a Software Substitute issues .
Read more ...
Projects like those on the FSF Licensing and Compliance Lab 's list of free distros are dedicated to distributing a complete GNU / Linux operating system that contains only free software .
They are high - quality distributions that create a complete free operating system without any binary - only blobs or package trees that contain proprietary software .
Read more ...
Government adoption of free software has the potential for a huge effect on the proliferation of free software , given that government employs many people , funds millions in software contracts each year , and most people interact with their government in various ways .
We must demand that government not be held hostage to proprietary software .

Two excellent recent reviews by Matt Kaeberlein and colleagues address issues in the budding yeast model of aging .
The first covers the history of yeast as a model system of aging ( and Prof .
Kaeberlein would know , inasmuch as he ’s been involved in the field for a decade , and has broke some of its earliest stories ) , and provides a thorough background on a matter that might seem to require some explanation : specifically , why we believe that a single - celled fungus can teach us about the genetic control of aging in the metazoans .
From the article in PLoS Genetics ( with co-author Brian Kennedy , himself an old hand in yeast lifespan ) :
In the last decade , research into the molecular determinants of aging has progressed rapidly and much of this progress can be attributed to studies in invertebrate eukaryotic model organisms .
Of these , single - celled yeast is the least complicated and most amenable to genetic and molecular manipulations .
Supporting the use of this organism for aging research , increasing evidence has accumulated that a subset of pathways influencing longevity in yeast are conserved in other eukaryotes , including mammals .
Here we briefly outline aging in yeast and describe recent findings that continue to keep this “ simple ” eukaryote at the forefront of aging research .
That review is required reading before you jump into this next one , in which Matt takes on the question of whether Sir2 ( the founding member of the sirtuins , which certainly do regulate lifespan in yeast , and possibly in other organisms ) is involved in the life extension resulting from calorie restriction ( CR ) in yeast .
From Kaeberlein & Powers :
Activation of Sir2 - family proteins in response to calorie restriction ( CR ) has been proposed as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for life span extension .
This idea has been called into question with the discovery that Sir2 - family proteins are not required for life span extension from CR in yeast .
We present here a historical perspective and critical evaluation of the model that CR acts through Sir2 in yeast , and interpret prior reports in light of more recent discoveries .
Several specific cases where the Sir2 model of CR is inconsistent with experimental data are noted .
These shortcomings must be considered along with evidence supporting a role for Sir2 in CR in order to fully evaluate the validity of this model .
The article is valuable not only as a treatment of a controversy ( on which Kaeberlein definitely falls on one side ) , but also as an exemplar of the types of genetic reasoning ( and associated challenges ) involved in lifespan studies of many kinds in all types of organisms .
Reprimand is a warning against actions that are considered wrong .
Conversely , rebuke does not need to be done angrily .
Of course , everyone has been reprimanded and reprimanded , especially when children still do not understand that certain actions cannot be done .
Teachers or parents have reprimanded their children because they played tap water and were not turned off , because they fought with friends , came to school late , because it was difficult to wake up in the morning , did not want to wash their hands before eating , and so on .
Usually , reprimand has a good purpose .
However , sometimes the way to reprimand him is not understanding , so the results are not good enough .
There are ways to avoid adverse consequences , for example if someone is reprimanded , the person concerned is willing to accept sincerely .
For example , if someone is reprimanded , the person concerned is willing to accept sincerely .
For example , the kindergarten teacher grumbled in his heart because he was improperly reprimanded by the principal .
He was very embarrassed because he was reprimanded in front of his parents , so that he felt embarrassed and irritated in his heart .
The teacher ’s mother is an adult , but what about children ?
In general , almost all the same .
At that time in class held a meal together .
Before children are welcome to enjoy the food that has been served at each table , Rika has already overtaken the meal .
His next friend , Dini , immediately rebuked him by shouting , “ Teacher , Rika has eaten first ! ”
The child immediately cried and sulked .
Because Rika also already has a feeling of shame when reprimanded in front of her friends .
The teacher ’s right to approach Rika with love and full of advice so that Rika will do that again .
And the child responds unashamedly to accepting his mistakes .
Sometimes , we find children who do not work , if reprimanded .
For example , Dito is a bad guy in class and likes to be ignorant , hits his friends , and ignores the words of his teacher .
Dito is indeed an extraordinary rogue , there is a high probability that he will often be beaten by his parents so that he is no longer reluctant to the teacher or his parents .
If he grows up and has broader relationships , it will be troublesome for educators .
Actually , the reprimand to Dito was effective , but because he was often beaten , he just stopped doing something if he was hurt .
It is not too late to change the way the child is .
If only his parents were more patient with more subtle and punch - free words , then it would work .
Actually , the child is also like an adult , if the rebuke is not about the target , then the child will repeat the actual action wrong .
As a result of the act or made of the child the authority of parents will disappear .
As experienced by Ina , who is still in Level B. Kindergarten , she broke down not wanting to do the assignments given by her teacher , namely folding paper to make clothes .
As a teacher , you should not need to yell or scold , but the child is quite patiently approached and given a warning .
For example , by saying , “ Ina will be embarrassed , if you do n’t get a star rating and ca n’t go up to class 1SD .
And this will be left behind by his friends , forced his friend to be new again . ”
Believe me , for this reason , Ina will work on the activities in class attentively .
The important thing is not to let the child feel that his parents , or the teacher , is not angry , so his feelings will be relieved .
And he wants to receive advice from parents and teachers easily .
The advice should be candid .
Because , the child has not been able to interpret tortuous advice .
With patience , love , and a smile , then the goal of these reproof will be achieved .

Taliban insurgents fighting in Afghanistan and Pakistan have been hit by a wave of defections and betrayals that has resulted in a witch - hunt within the militant movement .
The news has boosted morale among commanders of the Nato operation in Afghanistan , which includes more than 6,000 British soldiers .
The British contingent has struggled to contain the insurgency in the country 's southern provinces over the past 18 months .
Last week saw renewed violence with a series of suicide bombings .
However , two of the Taliban 's most senior commanders have now been killed after being betrayed by close associates .
Up to a dozen middle - ranking commanders have died in airstrikes or other operations by Afghan , Nato or Pakistani forces based on precise details of their movements received from informers .
Few details have been publicly released , but senior military sources speak of ' major hits ' that they wish they could talk about openly .
The successes may be the result of the more sophisticated strategy now employed by coalition , Afghan and Pakistani forces , say observers .
' There have been desultory efforts over several years to penetrate the Taliban and to play off the various factions within the militancy and along the frontier against each other , but now that has become the keystone of the intelligence effort , ' said one Pakistan - based source .
' That 's paying off . '
Last week three Central Asian militants were killed in a Pakistani army operation against makeshift training camps and Nato airstrikes in western Afghanistan are thought to have wiped out a dozen mid-ranking Taliban members returning from a meeting .
' There is a feeling that there are spies everywhere , ' said one tribal leader speaking by telephone from the violent and anarchic North Waziristan ' tribal agency ' along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan .
' People are very worried and no one is trusting anyone any more . '
One suspected spy in North Waziristan , Saidur Rehman , 50 , was shot dead 10 days ago after being tortured .
A note pinned to his body accused the victim of ' working for the Americans ' .
Taliban sources have confirmed that two men had been arrested for betraying Mullah Dadullah Akhund , a brutal and powerful military commander who was killed earlier this month .
' We have captured the spy who helped US forces kill Mullah Dadullah , said Shahabuddin Atal , a Taliban spokesman speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location .
Atal said Dadullah had stopped at the suspect 's house in the Bahramcha district of Afghanistan 's Helmand province when he came under attack from coalition forces .
Those accused of spying are brutally executed .
One suspected traitor accused of betraying senior commander Mullah Akhtar Mohammed Osmani last December was decapitated with a knife by a 12 - year - old boy before cameras .
Such scenes revolted even some members of the Taliban as well as local tribesmen who try to navigate a careful path between the Pakistani army and government and local Afghan , Central Asian and Arab militants .
However , Hassan Abbas , a retired police chief on the Northwest Frontier and an expert on radical Islam , said that many were unjustly accused of spying .
' A lot of those killed are just local maliks [ chiefs ] who have had contact with the government , ' he said .
' They are not spies . '
According to Taliban sources , Dadullah 's body was recovered by his fighters after the airstrike , but further information passed to coalition forces by a spy allowed the corpse , later displayed to the media , to be retrieved .
' Each time there was a [ coalition ] strike the man would disappear and then reappear after the bombing was over , ' Atal said .
' He has now confessed . '
The Afghan national intelligence department in Kabul said that Dadullah had been tracked ' with [ the ] most modern intelligence technology from the Pakistani border before being killed ' .
Three Taliban prisoners , among five senior militant commanders controversially freed early this year in return for the release of a kidnapped Italian journalist , died alongside Dadullah , Afghanistan security officials said .
The continual attrition of high - level commanders has hindered efforts by the Taliban to launch a major ' spring offensive ' .
However , it has successfully maintained a relatively high rate of suicide bombings and similar attacks and has maintained its hold over large portions of southern and southeastern Afghanistan .
According to Rahimullah Yusufzai , a senior Pakistani journalist and expert on the Taliban , ' suspicion is now falling even on trusted men and is creating tension in Taliban ranks ' .
Dadullah Mansoor , brother and replacement of Mullah Dadullah , on Friday pledged to continue fighting the ' Western occupation ' of Afghanistan .

If you 're a busy mum with people to meet and places to see then an Austrian designer may have come up with the perfect solution to get you from A to B - in the form of the Roller Buggy .
It may look like a normal buggy but design team Pix Studio claim it 's the only pushchair , come transport vehicle , to own .
A multi-functional baby carriage , the Roller Buggy , can transform into a personal scooter with a simple pull of the lower body .
Capable of speeding over any terrain it wo n't be long before you and your baby are zipping all over the place .
Valentin Vodev , the designer behind the concept , who 's also created a pair of duck - like shoes for swimming and a laser lighter , believes converting ideas into products is an adventure .
The question is , just who will be adventurous enough to take their child for a spin in the Roller Buggy ?
Before I start on the list , I feel that I should advise that a couple of the items here are quite horrific and I would recommend that those who are weak of heart or who have a nervous disposition avoid them .
The items I am referring to are marked in the text .
The items are not in any particular order as it is very hard to rate the historical importance versus the just plain weird value .
SEE ALSO : Top 10 Eerie Recordings
10 Alessandro Moreschi , Only Recorded True Castrato
The Castrati were men who were forcibly castrated at an early age in order to ensure that they would not experience the hormonal changes of puberty that lead to the lowering of the male voice .
This meant that as adult men they sang like a modern soprano ( they retained their boy soprano voices ) .
After the Catholic Church ensured that all nations banned the practise , Pope Leo XIII took the remaining Castrati into the care of the Sistine Chapel Choir to guarantee them a quiet life ( at the time they had become the subject of ridicule ) .
Moreschi is the only castrato to be recorded solo .
In this recording he is over 50 years old and had lost much of the quality of his voice – nevertheless the resulting recording is incredibly eerie .
9 Mado Robin , Stratospheric Coloratura
Advertisement
This amazing French singer has one of the highest recorded notes in classical music .
You must listen to the whole song – the last note is unbelievable !
Put your crystal in a safe place !
I have done some research and various sources give her highest note as either a B above Top C , or a D above top C , which , if I recall my theory classes correctly , would be B7 and D7 respectively .
This is the last octave on a classical piano and is only three octaves lower than G10 ( dog whistle pitch ) , the point at which humans can no longer hear the note .
The highest recorded singer is Georgia Brown who is reported ( by the Guiness Book of Records ) to have reached G10 .
8 Florence Foster Jenkins , Worst Singer Ever
Believe it or not , Florence managed , despite being famously awful , to sell out an entire concert at Carnegie Hall .
She had many admirers ( among them Enrico Caruso ) .
This has to be heard to be believed .
As a particular point of interest , after she recorded this song , she told the sound engineer that no second try was needed as it was perfect .
See for yourself .
( She is singing Queen of the Night by Mozart , incidentally ) .
7 Pope Leo XIII , First Recorded Pope — 1903
Pope Leo XIII ( patron of Moreschi ) was the first Pope in history to be recorded .
He was the 256th Pope and reigned from 1878 – 1903 and is probably most famous as the Pope who declared Anglican religious orders invalid ( ie , he said Anglican priests and Bishops are laymen ) .
He also strongly promoted the study of the Bible in the home and was known as the Pope of the People .
In this recording he chants the Ave Maria ( Hail Mary ) .
6 Lord Hawhaw ( William Joyce ) , Executed For Treason
William Joyce ( or Lord Hawhaw has he more well known ) was a fascist politician who worked for the Nazi ’s during the war as a propagandist .
His distinctly “ posh ” English accent is the cause of him receiving his mocking nickname .
Joyce broadcast propaganda from radio stations in Berlin , Hamburg , and Luxembourg .
Whilst it was not illegal to listen to his broadcasts in England , it was frowned upon .
Nevertheless his recordings were very popular with the public as a source of amusement .
He became a hated and ridiculed figure .
He escaped after the war but an English soldier overheard him talking at a cafe and recognised his voice .
He was arrested and executed for treason .
This recording is a snippet of one of his propaganda broadcasts and it begins with his signature “ Germany calling , Germany calling ” .
5 Number Stations , Mysterious Codes
Number Stations ( shortwave radio stations of unknown origin ) have been reported since World War I and continue to this day .
No one knows what their reason is though many people suspect they are coded messages used for espionage ( though no country has admitted this ) .
The broadcasts are usually a female voice ( though male voices have been heard ) and they generally broadcast streams of numbers , words , or letters .
They are sometimes apparently random , and other times organised .
In the 90’s , amateur radio enthusiasts tracked the source of one number station to a US military base .
The FCC refused to comment .
4 Florence Nightingale , Inventor of Modern Nursing
Florence Nightingale was the first person to recognise that hygiene and food were important in the care of patients ( up until her time , hospitals did not worry about hygienic conditions ) .
She is considered to be the mother of modern nursing .
She lived from 1820 – 1910 .
She is also sometimes referred to as the Lady of the Lamp .
This recording is one of three she made in 1890 to people she had known during her work in the war effort .
3 Russian Exorcism , Casting Out Devils
Exorcism is the ritual used by the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church to cast devils out of a possessed person .
Throughout this Russian exorcism you can hear the voice of the priest reciting the prayers of the ritual while the afflicted ( I can not tell if it is a male or female ) person screams in a variety of voices .
It is quite horrifying to listen to and I would not advise it for people who have a nervous disposition .
2 Jonestown , Mass Suicide
Youtube has banned recordings of this audio due to its disturbing nature .
You can , instead , listen to the full suicide tape here .
Jim Jones was the American founder of the People ’s Temple group .
The group became infamous after the November 18 1978 mass suicide / murder in Guyana where the group had moved after rising tensions in the USA .
Nine - hundred - and - nine people drank cyanide after Jim Jones ordered his men to kill visiting Congressman Leo Ryan and numerous members of his entourage .
In this horrifying recording you hear the last 30 - 45 minutes of Jones directing his followers to poison their children and then themselves .
At one point one of the female voices on the tape is heard to say “ It ’s okay – they are n’t crying because of pain – it is just because of the bitter taste ) .
Some of the bodies found had died of forced cyanide injection or gunshots .
Jones was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head .
Discretion is advised in listening to this recording .
If the recording piques your interest , I would recommend buying the excellent recent documentary on the tragedy called Jonestown – The Life & Death of Peoples Temple .
The DVD was released in April , 2007 .
1 Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville , First Recording of a Human in 1857
Previously this record was held by Frank Lambert ( bonus item 2 below ) for his phonograph recordings , but in 2008 the Phonautogram recordings of Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville from 1857 were finally able to be played back for the first time .
Even Monsieur de Martinville never had the ability to play back the sounds he recorded .
The Phonautogram was a machine that sketched a diagram of sound waves – effectively the first recording device – though lacking a playback ability .
Édouard - Léon was born in 1817 .
That means the voice you are hearing on the recording above was born two hundred years ago .
George III ( the Mad King ) was King of England , Louis XVIII was King of France , and Servant of God Pope Pius VII was pope .
+ The Sounds of Hell , Hoax Or Not ?
Okay , I know this is a top ten list , but there has been so much demand from reddit to add the Sounds of Hell recording that I have added it .
The background is that a group of Russian scientists were digging in Siberia when their drill started spinning wildly ( usually indicative of hitting a pocket of air ) .
They lowered microphones into the hole ( apparently this is normal as the sounds can help to determine what the physiological makeup is of the area they have drilled to ) .
When they listened to the resulting recording , it appeared to be sounds coming straight from Hell .
This is , in fact , a hoax .
It has gained great popularity on the internet and does have some basis in fact – but the bit about hell is , well , not true .
++ First recording On a Phonograph , Frank Lambert
This item has been demoted from position 1 to bonus item 2 due to the fact that a year after its publication , an older recording was discovered .
That now replaces this in position 1 but for the sake of the integrity of this list , I am keeping this item here .
Frank Lambert was a French – American inventor .
Lambert was born in Lyon , France and then moved to the United States in 1876 and became a citizen in 1893 .
Lambert is currently in the Guinness World Book of Records for the oldest playable recording on a machine called the Phonograph .
Lambert was also famous for inventing the modern typewriter .
This is one of the earliest recordings of a human voice in history from 1878 .

As everyone in China knows , food prices have risen sharply over the past year .
If it gives any comfort to anyone , China is not the only country .
Rising food prices are a worldwide phenomenon .
The story goes back to the days after World War II .
The Western industrial nations went about developing their economy at a fast pace .
The basis for this development was cheap oil .
From 1945 all the way to the present day , cheap oil seemed to be a bonanza with no end in sight .
As a consequence of cheap oil , the society that developed was based on the internal combustion engine - the motor car .
Even though some Americans have been aware of oil running out sometime in the future , the country still consumes oil as if the supply will last forever .
In the US , transport is based on the individual automobile rather than public transport like subways , trains .
Even freight is carried by large trucks instead of trains .
Petroleum is fundamental to our modern life .
From oil we make plastics , fertilizers , medicine and chemicals .
We burn oil to produce electricity .
When countries like China and India began to industrialize , the global scene changed because of increasing demand for oil .
In 2005 , easily extracted oil from the oilfields peaked .
From now on , the flow will be at a reduced rate , eventually running dry .
Oil extracted from the more difficult oilfields , requiring more technology and consequently more expense , is expected to peak in four years , according to some experts in the United Kingdom .
Since the global demand for oil exceeds supply , oil prices are going to continue rising .
In the US , there is growing awareness that the country should not depend on foreign oil from unstable regions like the Middle East .
More importantly investors have realized there is profit to be made by converting corn into ethanol which can be used as motor fuel .
As more and more ethanol production distilleries come on line , 30 percent of the US corn harvest next year will go into ethanol production .
The US is the world 's biggest grain producer and exporter .
Almost 70 percent of all the grain imported by many nations around the world comes from the US .

A 16 - line hack to make the JS DOM API a tad more humane .
… absolutely amazing .
I ’ve yet to find a smaller and yet more astounding example of how you can encapsulate functionality within JavaScript and create brand new APIs on the fly .
Ian Smith , 3 must read JavaScript articles
Web pages are written in HTML WP but as they have become more and more complex , they now tend to be written , clientside , through Javascript WP , which can manipulate and insert HTML .
Google Images , for instance , uses Javascript to write the HTML that displays your image results .
Yes , it ’s roundabout , but it ’s due to the nature of the languages : Javascript does stuff , HTML displays stuff .
When you want the browser to do things ( instead of merely displaying dumbly what it receives ) and when these things themselves involve a lot of displaying , you end up writing HTML through Javascript .
It ’s a little like writing French through English ( André went to Marie and said : “ Bonjour ! Ça va , ma chérie ? ” ) and just as frustrating , particularly because you sometimes have to narrate whole scenes in French ( pidgin tends to be painfully verbose ) and your English self is left completely in the dark — so you end up naming things in both French and English and it gets as ugly as you can imagine .
HyperScript is a bizarre and quixotic attempt to write French in English ; that is , HTML in Javascript .
Basically , you do what went on in the Norman conquest of England WP : you anglicize as many French words as you can ; that is , you turn into Javascript as many HTML words as you can .
The lark itself takes gratefully ( and rather surpisingly ) only 16 paltry lines of Javascript code ( highlighting thanks to Mark “ Tarquin ” Wilton - Jones . ) :
function each ( a , f ) ) { for ( var i = 0 , l = a .
length ; i < l ; i + + ) ) f ( a [ i ] ) ) } ; each ( ' a big blockquote br b center code div em form h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 hr img iframe input i li ol option pre p script select small span strong style sub sup table tbody td textarea tr ul u '. split ( ' ' ) ) , function ( label ) { window [ label ] = function ( ) { var tag = document .
createElement ( label ) ) ; each ( arguments , function ( arg ) { if ( arg . nodeType ) ) tag .
appendChild ( arg ) ) ; else if ( typeof arg = = ' string ' | | typeof arg = = ' number ' ) ) tag .
innerHTML + = arg ; else for ( var attr in arg ) { if ( attr = = ' style ' ) ) for ( var sty in arg [ attr ] ) ) tag [ attr ] [ sty ] = arg [ attr ] [ sty ] ; else tag [ attr ] = arg [ attr ] ; } ; } ) ) ; return tag ; } ; } ) ) ;
div (( {style :{background :' lavender ' , padding : ' 10 px ' , fontSize : ' 130 % ' , textAlign : ' center '}} , b ( ' Hello ') , span ( ' world ' , { className : ' pink'} ) , '!' , br ( ) , br ( ) , table ( ( { style : { margin : '0 auto ' , width : '300 px '}} , tbody ( ( tr ( ( td(( {style : {background :'#ccc'}} , a ( {href : ' http://javascript.crockford.com/'}, ' A link ! ' ) ) ) , td(( {style :{background :'#fff'}} , img ( {src : '/images/blog/logos/elzr.gif'} ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Test Area :
and you can play with it right here , right now :
does it work now ?
The translation between HTML and Hyperscript is straightforward , where you would have written
< b> Hello world !</b> ,
you now write ,
b(‘ Hello World ! ’ ) .
Instead of
< em style= “ background-color : yellow ” >
Hello world !</em > ,
now it ’s ,
em({style:{backgroundColor :’yellow’}} , ‘ Hello World !’ ) .
And so on .
HTML in a Javascript syntax .
Enjoy !
Garnet
It 's still something I plan on doing sooner rather than later .
There ended up being a lot of issues we wanted to tackle first , and we have n't get got back to working on Garnet ( the new name for Cuby ) .
There were no particular problems yet , but I 'm sure well find some .
Garnet looks like ruby at first glance , but the semantics of what things mean have been rewired .
For example , in garnet code 'd = c.to_ref ' appears to call a method called to_ref on c , but garnet will translate that into 'd = &c ' , which is C code .
One way to think about it is as a really advanced C preprocessor .
It tries to map as much as it can to C constructs .
The idea is something that looks like ruby , but behaves like C .
primitives
They 're small chunks of C code that can be called to from Ruby .
They 're used to implement things that really can not be done in Ruby .
A great example is the ability to allocate an object .
On the backend , this interacts with the garbage collector to find enough memory to allocate the specific object in .
That operation can not be in Ruby , it 's an operation at the bottom of the stack , thus a primitive operation .
Rubinius primitives are exactly the same as Smalltalk 's primitives .
If a method is assigned a primitive operation number , then when the method is run , the primitive is invoked instead of the normal ruby code .
If the primitive fails ( the primitive itself indicates that it has failed ) , then the ruby code is run , as fallback behavior .
This ruby code can do things like raise an exception about why it failed , convert the arguments and try again , or any number of things .
def fixnum_size (_ = fixnum )
<<-CODE
stack_push ( I2N(sizeof( int ) ) ) ;
CODE
end
The primitives and instructions use a kind of funny format to make maintaining them easier .
All the operations are just ruby methods , where the body is a string that contains C code .
At build time , these files are run and some code calls each method , collecting the C code and then spitting it out do a file which is #include 'd into other C code .
One of the primary reasons for this is primitives and instructions are wrapped in a huge switch statement in C , which is a pain to maintain by hand .
Also , it gives us some preprocessor capabilities .
For example , here you see that we 've put a little magic sauce in the argument definition the fixnum_size primitive .
First , the point of that code is to automatically register that the C code " POP ( self , FIXNUM_P ) " should be run before code in the method .
The code that runs the methods and outputs C code will notice that and write that out properly .
We use this form to make the primitives easier to write .
I should note that not all primitives use this form currently .
Soon , we 'll be doing an audit and switching out all of them to use it .
The core VM ( which is really just the opcodes ) is currently written in C , as are the primitives .
The primitives are the first thing I want to use Garnet on .
Both garbage collectors are also written in C ( though the amount of code they consume is small ) .
Other than that , everything is in Ruby .
Everything from parsing the interpreter command line arguments ( things like rubinius - d - v , which turn on debugging and warnings ) to all the methods on String .
The complete runtime environment of code is can easily be manipulated , as it's just Ruby .
We 're really work hard to make the process more transparent .
Currently , the IRC channel is the primary way we communicate , and we 're actually working to integrate IRC logs into http://rubini.us.
We also encourage people to use the forums on http://rubini.us to ask questions .
The forum has RSS feeds setup and most of the devs watch them for discussions ( though I have to admit , this has n't really caught on yet ) .
Any suggestions people have about making the project more transparent , I 'm all ears .
We can always use people writing specs .
Once we have a complete spec suite , the rest falls in place pretty easily .
A few weeks ago Evan Phoenix was hired by EngineYard , with the task to spend half his day working on rubinius .
We caught up with Evan and talked about the state of the project , VM internals and ( in Part 2 of the interview ) about the implementation of the latest features .
Whereas other alternative Ruby implementations such as JRuby , XRuby , Gardens Point Ruby .
NET , IronRuby , target existing VMs or , as Ruby 1.x , are written in C , rubinius uses another approach , taking ideas from the Smalltalk VMs , particularly Squeak Smalltalk Squeak is written in a subset of itself .
This subset , called Slang , is basically C with a Smalltalk syntax and a few restrictions .
One of the goals of rubinius is to use this approach throughout the project as well .
The language for this is called ( formerly called " Cuby " ) , and work on it is under way .
Evan explains the current status : Currently , basic pieces of the VM are written in C , also using an approach from Smalltalk .
Evan explains the idea behindTo show how this actually looks , here an example of a rubinius primitive :
Evan runs us through the code :
As can be seen , the borders between Ruby and C code are fuzzy and are going to shift in the future , as more of Garnet becomes available .
Further up the stack , Ruby is used for implementing standard libraries .
Rubinius has made great strides in the past .
To keep this up and to get more developers to start coding or testers / users to start banging away at the existing VM , some more information about the project is needed .
At the moment , the IRC channelis the best source for information ( besides , of course , the source ) .
Some historic digests of this channel can be found online too .
Evan details the plans to improve the transparency of the project :
Watch out for part two of this interview , which will feature a more technical look behind the scenes of the new debugging іmplementation , GC and ObjectSpace and threading .

なかなか難しい質問です。一冊あるいは一サイト、決定版と言えるようなものは思い当たりません。しかし関数型言語やそのアプローチについては最近関心が高まりつつあるようで、ギャップを埋める入門書が徐々に出てくると思われます
( 例えば青木さんの 「 ふつう のHaskellプログラミング 」 http://i.loveruby.net/d/20060323.html#p02
。5月末出版だそうです)。というわけで、「これ！」という一冊の本で勉強したいのならもう少し待ってみるというのも手です。
さて、現在ある材料で勉強するとして、higeponさんのリクエストを考えてみます。
[ とっかか り ]
関数型言語の難しさは、既に手続き型言語を使いこなしている人と、関数型言語で初めてプログラミングに触れる人とで違うのではないかと思われます。既に手続き型言語を知っている場合、その知識が関数型言語を使うにあたって邪魔になる可能性があります。そこで、どんな材料で勉強するにしても、まず一度、手続き型言語でマスターした概念をわきに置いてみることをお薦めします。具体的には…
「 こう書くと余分なメモリを食うのでは」とか「ここでコピーするともったいないな」とか「同じ計算を何度もしてるんじゃ?」みたいな、貧民的発想をいったん捨てましょう。無限の速度と無限のメモリを手にしているのだと思い込み
( あるいは、処理系がものすごく賢くてうまいことやってくれるんだと信じて )
**最初は** ナイーブなコードでいいと開きなおります 手続き型言語でループを書くとき、アセンブラででもなければ条件分岐とgotoは使いませんよね。forやwhileなどを使うと思います。定型的な処理にはイディオムがあるわけです。関数型言語にもイディオムがあり、それは手続き型言語のものとかなり異なります。手続き型言語の知識をあてはめようとするのではなく、例を読んだり課題を解いたりする過程で関数型言語のイディオムを意識的に覚えるようにします。
変数は値を入れる箱ではありません。値、あるいは式そのものに便宜的に名前をつけているだけです。
計算は、つねに関数に値を渡し、その戻り値を使うことで進行します。戻り値は複数あるかもしれません。
構造を持つデータの各要素に対して処理をしたい場合には、( a)その構造全体を一気に処理できる関数(例:map , fold等 ) を使うか 、( b ) その構造を「頭 」 と「 残り」に分解し、「頭」を処理して、「残り」は自分自身を再帰で呼んで処理させ、最後に結果を合成します。
まあこんな感じのことを頭において、
独習 Scheme 三週 間 http://www.sampou.org/scheme/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.htm...
How to Design Programs ( HtDP ) http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/
などに練習問題も含めてトライしてみたらいかがでしょうか
( Schemeの例ばかりですが、他の関数型言語にも似たようなものがあると思います)。確かにこれらは言語の習得
( HtDPはもっと一般的ですが ) に重点を置いていますが、上に挙げたような「違う見方を得る」ことに注意していると、得られるものが違ってくると思います。
[ 舞台裏 ]
富豪的とは言われても、裏でプログラムがどう動いているかは気になるもの。特に手続き型言語でがりがりプログラムを書いていた人にとっては、関数型言語のプログラムが実際にどのような手順で実行されているかを知ることによって、関数型言語への理解が深まることもあります。
それには処理系を読んでみるのが一番なのですが、フルセットの処理系はコードベースも大きくなりがちなうえ、色々なおまけがついていて本質的なところが見えにくいかもしれません。サブセットのMLコンパイラの実装を解説したこれなんかは参考になるかもしれません。
MinCaml コンパイラ概 説
http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/
コンパイラを読むことで、関数型言語であってもある程度どのような機械語に落ちているかを意識することができるようになります
( 関数型言語のイディオムを習得した後でこの段階に進んで下さい ) 。
[ 実用へ ]
最後に関数型のメリットですが、これは中規模以上の実用的なプログラムを書いてメンテナンスしてみないと肌で感じるのが難しい領域だと思います。大規模プログラミングで最も重要な要素はモジュラリティであり、それが関数型プログラミングの最大の利点のひとつでもあるからです。この論文はその点を簡潔に述べています：
ですが、この論文を 「そうだよな〜」と納得しながら読める人は、既に関数型言語をよく知っている人だけなのではないか、という気がします。ですので、関数型言語についてのメリットを本当に知りたいと思うなら、それによってプログラムを書いてみるしかないのではないかと思います。

Bush sanctions CIA torture program
By Jerry White
23 July 2007
President Bush signed an executive order Friday clearing the way for the Central Intelligence Agency to resume the use of “ enhanced interrogation measures ” against alleged terror suspects held in US facilities around the world .
The order , which was issued in conjunction with a classified list of approved interrogation techniques , is designed to provide a legal sanction for physical and psychological torture , and protect CIA operatives from being charged with war crimes for violating US and international laws against inhumane treatment .
The CIA reportedly suspended its program last year as the Bush administration ’s legal justifications for abusing detainees was dealt a blow by the US Supreme Court ruling in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , which stated that all prisoners in US custody — of any nationality , being held in any country — were granted minimal protections by the Geneva Conventions .
Last fall , in order to deflect growing international and domestic criticism , Congress passed , with substantial bipartisan support , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
The Act instructed the administration to issue an executive order stating that any further interrogations would comply with US and international law .
The Act also established , in law , a procedure of drumhead military commissions , after Hamdan invalidated the Bush administration ’s previous procedure .
The order publicly prohibits “ cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment ” as well as acts of sexual humiliation and those intended to denigrate religious beliefs — two widely used methods whose exposure provoked an international outcry .
However , the order places no restrictions on such notorious techniques as the use of stress positions , sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures and so - called water boarding , which simulates the sensation of drowning .
These techniques are expressly prohibited by the US military .
Moreover , administration officials admit there are no provisions for allowing the Red Cross to visit CIA facilities or for prisoners to be in contact with their families .
While the list of approved methods remains secret , the Bush administration has not ruled out any technique .
Administration officials have said that the new order will allow the CIA to continue with the same program that was in place before .
Noting that the written policies governing the CIA interrogation program remained classified and independent organizations such as the Red Cross were barred from monitoring the CIA ’s compliance with its guidelines , Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch told the Washington Post , “ All the order really does is to have the president say , ‘ Everything in that other document that I ’m not going showing you is legal — trust me . ’ ”
Moreover , as Human Rights Watch notes , the order seeks to sanction what is an explicitly illegal operation : the CIA ’s detention and interrogation program , which included the kidnapping and “ disappearing ” of dozens of terror suspects and their imprisonment for years inside secret facilities .
Some prisoners , including those “ renditioned ” to third countries where they are tortured under CIA supervision , remain “ disappeared . ”
In June , Human Rights Watch and five other human rights groups listed 39 people who remain missing , including one detainee , Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan , who recently reappeared in Pakistan .
The new order , the Human Rights Watch says , claims that the program “ fully complies ” with US obligations under the Geneva Conventions as long as the CIA follows a series of requirements in carrying out the program .
“ But enforced disappearance — the hallmark of the CIA program , involving secret , incommunicado detention — is itself inconsistent with the requirement under [ Geneva Conventions ]
Common Article 3 that detainees be treated humanely , ” the organization said in a statement on the new order .
“ By international human rights and humanitarian law standards , the CIA program is illegal to its core , ” said , Joanne Mariner , terrorism and counter - terrorism director at Human Rights Watch .
“ Although the new executive order bars torture and other abuse , the order still ca n’t purport to legalize a program that violates basic rights . ”
With the new order in hand , Bush administration officials have told the Washington Post that suspects in US custody could be moved immediately into the “ enhanced interrogation ” program and subjected to techniques that go beyond those allowed by the US military .
CIA detainees have alleged that they were left naked in cells for prolonged periods , subjected to sensory and sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures and sexually taunted .
In a briefing with reporters senior administration officials said that any future use of “ extremes of hot and cold ” would be subject to a ‘ reasonable interpretation ... we ’re not talking about forcibly induced hypothermia . ’
According to the Post the secret list of CIA techniques has been the subject of intense debate within the highest levels of the US government over the last several months , with the State Department seeking to deflect criticism of US torture and the Defense Department concerned that CIA methods could subject captured US soldiers to similar abuses .
At the same time , Bush and Vice President Cheney , along with CIA Director Michael Hayden have defended the brutal methods , saying the CIA program was one of the most effective tools in the so - called war on terror .
Referring to the secret list of approved torture techniques one intelligence official told the Post that , while Hayden did not get “ everything [ he ] might have wanted ” in the guidelines , they contained everything the CIA needed and “ more than was asked for . ”
The Bush administration is doing an end - run around the Supreme Court decision upholding the application of the Geneva Conventions to CIA prisoners , as well as widespread public and international opposition to torture .
In doing so , the administration is counting on the acquiescence and complicity of the Democratic Party , which played a key role in the passage of the Military Commissions
Act that sanctioned military tribunals and the indefinite detentions of prisoners , while giving the president explicit authority to “ interpret ” the Geneva Conventions .
The Democrats response to Bush ’s executive order was predictable cowardice , with their central concern being that the continued torture program be given an adequate legal and political fig leaf .
Democratic Senator John D. Rockefeller , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said it was difficult to “ determine what the Executive Order really means and how it will translate into actual conduct by the CIA . ”
The CIA , he said , had to come before the Intelligence Committee “ to explain in detail how it intends to apply the Executive Order ” and the Department of Justice had to provide a “ full legal analysis ” of the interrogation guidelines .
“ The stakes are too high and the issue too important to provide any comment until the Committee has been given the opportunity to fully evaluate the President ’s action , ” Rockefeller claimed about an administration that has consistently defended the use of torture methods .
“ This careful review , ” the senator concluded , “ will be part of the Committee ’s continuing effort to determine whether the CIA detention and interrogation program is necessary , lawful and in the best interests of the United States . ”
The MPs say firms should not aid web censorship in China
Proposals to set up a human rights committee which would review its policies around the world , specifically China , were also heavily defeated .
Yahoo has been criticized by human rights groups since 2005 for its role in turning over some political dissidents ' e-mails .
The materials were used to prosecute and imprison them .
But Yahoo insists it must comply with local laws in areas where it operates .
De-listed sites
At the company 's annual general meeting , the censorship proposal won only about 15 % of support while only 4 % backed the idea of a human rights committee .
Last year , Human Rights Watch , a New York based campaign group , accused Yahoo , Google and Microsoft for " carrying out censorship for the Chinese government " .
Whole websites - including media sources - are eliminated from Yahoo and Google in China .
De-listed sites are skipped over when the search engine trawls the web for results .
Neither Yahoo nor any other company has released a list of websites that have been de-listed for their political and religious content .
The internet firms argue it is better to offer Chinese users some information than none at all .

Have mankind ’s basic needs evolved to include time on the internet ?
From the results of a recent poll , it certainly seems that way !
According to a poll on The New Business Blog , nearly 65 % of us spend at least eight hours each day trolling the internet .
It does n’t take a math wizard to see that this represents , at minimum , 1 / 3rd of a day .
The results of the poll breakdown like this : 64 % of respondents stated they spent at least eight hours on the internet each day ; 20 % of respondents stated they spent between five and seven hours on the internet each day ; 14 % of respondents stated they spent between two and four hours on the internet each day ; and only 2 % of respondents stated they spend one hour or less on the internet each day .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , I ’m sure the results of this poll are slightly skewed for a couple of reasons , namely , the poll was conducted online and because The New Business Blog is n’t normally a site that a lot of people just come to ( people tend to stumble upon it while surfing the net ) it seems to me that the site ’s visitors are probably people who spend a decent amount of time online .
That being said , even for 65 % of the survey ’s respondents to state that they spend at least eight hours each day online really blows my mind .
I know that we have become accustomed to the internet and , on some levels , depend on it , but the fact that a majority of us are spending more time online than sleeping is a bit disconcerting .
Fortunately for those of us who run online businesses , this is pretty good news .
During the days of dial - up , when people did n’t spend a whole lot of time online , it was tough to make sales and get your site seen by lots of people .
But now that most people have high speed internet and spend lots of time online , the chances of you scoring sales or hits has really increased .
Now , get off the computer and go get some exercise !
Last week , both the House and Senate Judiciary committees approved the issuance of -- but have not yet issued -- subpoenas compelling the testimony of Karl Rove , Harriet Miers and others who are or were among George W. Bush 's inner circle during the decision - making on the firing of the eight dismissed U.S. Attorneys .
Bush , for his part , has signaled his intention to have his aides defy those subpoenas , saying he'd fight it out in court to the bitter end .
But what kind of battle can we expect over these subpoenas ?
How might such a fight turn out ?
What issues would be raised ?
And are the courts the only arena in which the questions might be settled ?
The AP's Matt Apuzzo examines the risks :
President Bush has tried for years to reassert a White House right to keep secrets from Congress .
Now he must decide how far he wants to go to keep aides from testifying about the firing of federal prosecutors .
If he claims executive privilege and the dispute ends up in court , the fight with Congress will be refereed by a judicial branch that recently has not been kind to the presidency in fights over subpoenas .
Lawmakers , meanwhile , risk seeing a judge permanently curtail their power to summon presidential aides to Capitol Hill .
That 's a high stakes game .
So high , in fact , that it 's precisely the sort of case the courts tend to punt , under the so - called " political question doctrine . "
Political questions are those the courts will -- at least initially -- refuse to decide , preferring to leave the outcome in the hands of the political branches ( the executive and legislative ) , on the theory that the power to decide them resides more properly with those who derive their authority from the voters .
Indeed , Apuzzo's article illustrates the point with this comment :
" I do n't think anyone would want this in court .
If anything is to be politically settled , it 's this one , " said Louis Fisher , a Library of Congress specialist on constitutional and an expert on presidential powers .
Fisher 's " anyone " could refer just as easily to any or all of the three branches .
Both the executive and the legislature have substantial powers at risk , while the judicial branch would simply want no part in settling the question .
How do we know this about the courts ?
Because that 's exactly what they did the last time such a case was brought .
And that case is instructive today .
The last time the Congress actually voted to hold an executive branch official in contempt of Congress was in the 1982 case of EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford .
Gorsuch ( who was later remarried , to Bureau of Land Management head Robert Burford ) was found in contempt by a House vote of 259- 105 ( with 55 Republicans voting in favor ) .
The charges were , in keeping with practice in statutory contempt cases , referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution .
And a lightbulb switches on !
The actual prosecution of contempt of Congress charges is the responsibility of a U.S. Attorney .
What an extraordinary piece of bad luck , given the current situation !
So now , obviously , the most recent case of contempt of Congress brought against a high - ranking administration official takes on added importance as precedent .
Does it not ?
And just what happened in that case ?
( PDF )
The Justice Department , anticipating the House vote , moved quickly : " Immediately after the House vote and prior to the delivery of the contempt citation , " the department chose not to prosecute the case .
[ Notes omitted ]
Surprise !
But that 's not all :
Instead , it asked a district court to declare the House action an unconstitutional intrusion into the President ’s authority to withhold information from Congress .
Stanley S. Harris , responsible for bringing the case to a grand jury , listed his name on the Justice Department complaint and advised Congress that " it would not be appropriate for me to consider bringing this matter before a grand jury until the civil action has been resolved . "
The Justice Department occupied an unusual ethical position .
First it had advised Gorsuch to withhold the documents , and now it decided not to prosecute her for adhering to the department ’s legal analysis .
In court , the department argued that the contempt action marked an " unwarranted burden on executive privilege " and an " interference with the executive ’s ability to carry out the laws . "
[ Notes omitted ]
So , what happened in court ?
The court dismissed the government ’s suit on the ground that judicial intervention in executive - legislative disputes " should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted . "
The court urged both parties to devote their energies to compromise and cooperation , not confrontation .
[ Notes omitted ]
Dismissed .
Because the case turned on a political question .
So Congress was right ?
Right ?
Not according to the Reagan administration :
Following the Gorsuch contempt , the Office of Legal Counsel wrote an opinion on May 30 , 1984 , concluding that as a matter of statutory interpretation and separation of powers analysis , a U.S. Attorney is not required to bring a congressional contempt citation to a grand jury when the citation is directed against an executive official who is carrying out the President ’s decision to invoke executive privilege .
[ Notes omitted , and emphasis supplied ]
Any questions , then , about what the current " administration " intends to do with respect to these subpoenas ?
Up next :
What the Congress can do about it , and which Members -- if any -- are thinking about how to deal with that conflict .
Dear Mr. Turing ,
We regret to inform you that your submission
" On Computable Numbers , With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem "
was not accepted to appear in FOCS 1936 .
The Program Committee received a record 4 submissions this year , many of them of high quality , and scheduling constraints unfortunately made it impossible to accept all of them .
Below please find some reviews on your submission .
The reviews are * not* intended as an explanation for why your paper was rejected .
This decision depended on many factors , including discussions at the PC meeting and competition from other papers .
Best wishes ,
FOCS 1936 Program Committee
---------------------------------------- review 1
----------------------------------------
seems like a trivial modification of godel 's result from STOC'31
---------------------------------------- review 2
----------------------------------------
The author shows that Hilbert 's Entscheidungsproblem ( given a mathematical statement , decide whether it admits a formal proof ) is unsolvable by any finite means .
While this seems like an important result , I have several concerns / criticisms :
1 . The author defines a new " Turing machine " model for the specific purpose of proving his result .
This model was not defined in any previous papers ; thus , the motivation is unclear .
2 . I doubt Hilbert 's goal of " automating mathematical thought " was ever really taken seriously by anyone ( including Hilbert himself ) .
Given this , the negative result comes as no surprise -- a positive result would have been much more interesting .
3 . It 's hard to find any technical " meat " in this paper .
Once the author sets up the problem , the main result follows immediately by a standard diagonalization argument .
4 . The whole philosophical discussion in Section 9 , about what it means to compute something , is out of place ( even slightly embarrassing ) and should be deleted entirely .
Summary :
While this paper deserves to be published somewhere -- SODA ?
ICALP ? FSTTCS ? -- it certainly is n't FOCS caliber .

merge with alonzo church 's submission ?
---------------------------------------- review 4
----------------------------------------
while i agree with the other reviewers ' concerns about triviality , i confess to liking this paper anyway .
one reason is that , along the way to the main result , the author proves a lemma stating that there exists a " universal machine " ( a machine able to simulate any other machine given a suitable choice of input ) .
the claim that this lemma could have " practical " applications is clearly exaggerated -- but even so , it seems like it could be a useful ingredient for other results .
Recommendation : Borderline Accept .
With its new iPhone , Apple pulled off two masterful feats : creating the machine and creating the buzz around it .
That machine , and that buzz , have inspired a lot of questions .
Just how much of a phone , an iPod and an Internet machine is this thing ?
Here are the answers to the most frequently asked iPhone questions .
Consider them a companion to my review yesterday , which covered the big points like the touch - screen keyboard ( adequate with practice ) , the AT&T Internet network ( painfully slow ) and the iPhone ’s overall character ( fun , powerful , amazing ) .
Before you dive in , though , a note about the “ Does it have ...? ” questions .
Apple has indicated that it intends to add features through free software updates , so the real , secret answer to some of the “ no ” answers is actually , “ Coming soon . ”
( Just for posting this article , McDonald ’s is probably going to sue me and have me thrown in Federal Pounding - in - the - Ass Prision .
If that happens , please consider McDonald ’s promoted to # 1 . )
Yes yes , McDonald ’s is not alone in its trans - fat strangle - hold on the hearts of people everywhere .
Our collective health would certainly be better off if Burger King , Taco Bell , Arby ’s , and all those other fast food joints closed up shop .
But as the first and largest fast food business , McDonald ’s has had plenty of time and money to help it stand out from its competitors … in all the wrong ways .
In case you ’re a little behind on the McDonald ’s Crimes Against Humanity news , here ’s a quick recap :
You know you ’ve arrived when people start complaining that you ’re too mean .
With the publication last week of my column “ The Judy Miller Media Hug - Fest , ” I received the customary Female Opinion Writer ’s Baptism by Fire .
Tucker Carlson , host of MSNBC ’s “ The Situation , ” accused me of being “ catty . ”
For the record , I am not mean .
I devote my free hours to cuddling small furry animals , and I only rarely eat them for dinner .
And catty ?
Please !
I did not say one word about Carlson ’s bow tie .
But Carlson ’s charge brought to mind last spring ’s media flap over women op - ed columnists , which began when commentator Susan Estrich attacked Michael Kinsley ( editorial and opinion editor of this newspaper ) for featuring too few women writers .
After that , opinion pages were briefly full of columns querying the mysterious nationwide dearth of women columnists .
Where were the women ?
Had their incisive and witty columns been suppressed by envious male colleagues , who replaced them surreptitiously with their own ponderous blather ?
Were they all in the federal witness protection program , so fearful of masculine retaliation that they were forced to disguise their true views and write only under pseudonyms like “ David Brooks ” and “ Robert Novak ” ?
( Think about it , readers : Have you ever actually met Robert Novak ?
If he ’s not a real person , it explains why he is n’t sharing a cell with Judith Miller . )
Advertisement
Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick observed that a lot of women “ avoid both the op - ed pages and the ‘ Crossfire ' - style ‘ screaming shows ’ because that is simply not the type of discourse they seek out or value . ”
The Boston Globe ’s Ellen Goodman agreed and then opined that for many women “ writing out loud ... requires a little hide - toughening . ”
Others pointed to the old double standard .
In the Nation , Katha Pollitt noted that she ’s “ seen men advance professionally on levels of aggression , self - promotion and hostility that would have a woman carted off to a loony bin . ”
And the New York Times ’ Maureen Dowd dryly observed that she ’s frequently asked “ how I can be so ‘ mean . ’ ”
It ’s an honor to join such a club .
Complaining about my “ cattiness ” in describing Miller ’s rapid transformation from the reporter journalists loved to hate into a 1st Amendment heroine , Carlson objected that “ if [ Miller ] were a man , you would n’t have written that , would you ? ”
Happily , I was able to assure him that I am catty in an equal - opportunity way .
But is he ?
Would Carlson have used the word “ catty ” about a male columnist ?
Sexism lives !
Still , there may be another reason we ’re not likely to see a substantial increase in women columnists .
Pollitt hints at it , listing numerous excellent current and potential female columnists , “ mostly ... liberals and feminists . ”
She goes on : “ I ’m sure there are good women writers on the right out there , too ” -- though she seems unable to come up with any -- and concludes that “ their job prospects are probably a lot rosier . ”

Could politics be the culprit , as much as gender ?
As the right ’s mythmakers continue their assault on the so - called “ left - wing media ” -- the attack on public broadcasting being only the most recent example -- many media outlets have caved in to the pressure and redoubled their efforts to avoid that liberal taint .
Consider this :
On CNN and MSNBC , presumably the most liberal cable news channels , conservative commentators outnumbered liberals 10 to 1 ( CNN ) and 13 to 2 ( MSNBC ) during the Jan. 20 coverage of President Bush ’s inauguration .
And if adopting protective conservative coloring is the media ’s goal , then women might as well toss their keyboards out the window .
That ’s because women are n’t necessarily nicer , or less interested in science , or more interested in recipes than men , but we are more liberal .
Study after study has documented a persistent “ gender gap ” in American politics .
If only women ’s votes had been counted in the last two elections , Al Gore and John Kerry would have won hands down .
On issues from domestic policy to foreign policy , any cross-section of American women will prove significantly more liberal than a similar cross-section of American men .
As a result , short of looking under every rock for another Ann Coulter , it could be hard for the male - dominated media to showcase more women columnists without -- eek ! -- showcasing more liberals .

So if you ’re wondering why women columnists are thin on the ground , save a little condemnation for the media ’s craven fear of looking too liberal .
And , uh , guys ?
When the right ’s out hunting the so - called “ liberal media , ” do n’t just roll over and die .
You heard the lady .
Toughen those hides .
Besides the Bush administration 's imperial aims and permanent war on the world , add the one at home below the radar .
Its weapons include the WTO , NAFTA , Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , FBI , CIA , NSA , NORTHCOM , militarized state and local police , National Guard forces , paramilitary mercenaries like Blackwater USA , and all other repressive instruments of state power and control .
They target the people of three nations slowly becoming one headquartered in Washington .
That 's the apparent aim of those in power here wanting one continent , " indivisible " minus old - fashioned ideas like " liberty and justice for all " we used to believe in when , as kids , we recited our " Pledge of Allegiance . "
They now have a whole new meaning .
They 're just words drummed into young minds hoping they 'll still believe them when they 're old enough to know better .
There may be a greater scheme for the planet ahead , but this article only focuses on what we know about and how it 's unfolding so far .
It has a name , in fact , several , but they all aim for the same thing - one nation , indivisible , where three sovereign ones once stood , headquartered in Washington .
The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) or " Deep Integration " North American Union
SPP was formerly launched at a March 23 , 2005 meeting in Waco , Texas attended by George Bush , Mexico 's President Vincente Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin .
It 's a tri-national agreement hatched below the radar in Washington containing the recommendations of the Independent Task Force of North America .
That 's a group organized by the powerful US Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , Canadian Council of Chief Executives ( CCCE ) , and Mexican Council on Foreign Relations .
It advocates greater US , Canadian and Mexican economic , political , social , and security integration with secretive working groups formed to devise non-debatable agreements that , when completed , will be binding beyond the power of legislatures to change .
It 's also taking shape without public knowledge or consideration .
> From what 's already known , SPP unmasked is n't pretty .
It 's a corporate - led coup d'etat against the sovereignty of three nations enforced by a common hard line security strategy already in play separately in each country .
It 's a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants , mainly US ones .
It 's also to insure America gets free and unlimited access to Canadian and Mexican resources , mainly oil , and in the case of Canada water as well .
It 's to assure US energy security as a top priority while denying Canada and Mexico preferential access to their own resources henceforth earmarked for US markets .
It 's also to create a fortress - North American security zone encompassing the whole continent under US control in the name of " national ( and continental ) security " with US borders effectively extended to the far reaches of the continent .
The scheme , in short , is NAFTA on steroids combined with Pox Americana homeland security enforcement .
It 's the worst of all possible worlds headed for an unmasked police state , and it's the Bush administration 's notion of " deep integration " or the " Big Idea " meaning we 're boss , what we say goes , no outliers will be tolerated , public interest is off the table , and the people of three nations be damned .
It 's also the next step in what GHW Bush had in mind when he delivered his " Toward a New World Order " speech to a joint session of Congress on another September 11 in 1990 .
At the onset of the " crisis in the Persian Gulf , " he said " We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment ( offering ) a rare opportunity to move toward .... a new world order " free from " the threat of terror .... and more secure .... "
He spoke of a " new world .... struggling to be born .... quite different from the one we 've known . "
He masked his intentions in language of peace and the pursuit of justice while preparing for war on Iraq and the region that 's gone on for over 16 years with no end in sight .
A new Bush administration is bringing that " New World Order " to the North American continent .
Unless it can be stopped , the streets of Boston , Baltimore and Buffalo may one day look like occupied Baghdad or Bogota when drug barons clash and Colombia 's US - financed military and paramilitaries step in .
SPP Unmasked
Establishing hard line security initiatives is key to making SPP's " deep integration " trade agenda work .
It 's being planned at a time of Washington 's cooked up " war on terrorism " scheme unleashing imperial dreams not possible without the public traumatized enough to go along .
Intended is a ramped up militarized police state of enhanced border and homeland security .
It 's based on the phony notion that doing business and protecting the national interest and public welfare require tough measures in place to secure them at a time of threatening global terrorism .
As outlandish as it sounds , the scheme is moving ahead toward implementation .
It threatens Canadian , Mexican and US national sovereignty and priorities , and their people and ours are none the wiser about it .
NAFTA is a glimpse of what 's ahead .
It 's record in 12.5 years has been disastrous with huge numbers of job losses and growing insecurity in three countries .
SPP guarantees more of the same on steroids with small businesses hurt as well .
They continue being trampled by corporate giants they 're no match for .
Many go under or are bought out if they survive .
They and working people are n't part of the SPP process , and their concerns are n't being addressed and are guaranteed to worsen as this initiative advances .
Its doing it at secret meetings like the one from September 12 - 14 , 2006 in Banff , Alberta , Canada .
It was co-chaired by three former high officials of the participating nations including a leading US cold warrior as Reagan Secretary of State , George Shultz .
He has all the credentials SPP needs as a former Bechtel president and current board member also holding memberships at the hard right Hoover Institution and American Enterprise Institute , the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , and the Committee on the Present Danger military lobbying group .
They were part of a high - powered group of present and former government officials ; top military - industrial complex representatives , Big Oil and other corporate executives ; leading policy analysts ; high - ranking military brass ; and a single Wall Street Journal self - styled Latin American expert editorialist known never to let facts conflict with the state and corporate interests she represents .
She 's a frequent target of this writer , and by now likely knows it - Mary Anastasia O'Grady .
Except for O'Grady , no journalists attended , and no press releases followed the meeting with its carefully scripted agenda and controlled media blackout .
Yet veteran Canadian publisher , author , activist and former political candidate Mel Hurtig managed to get hold of the attendee list and published it online .
He also posted topics discussed including : " A Vision for North America " ( but not a people - friendly one ) , " A North American Energy Strategy " ( for US energy security at the expense of Canada and Mexico ) , " Demographic and Social Dimensions of North American Integration , " and " Opportunities for Security Cooperation " ( aka Pox Americana ) .
Washington dominates the planning at all meetings with its interests getting primary attention .
Along with what 's mentioned above , efforts are to create uniform business practices and standards , ease the flow of US products into Canada and Mexico , remove labor constraints , and eliminate unwelcome environmental standards or restrictions interfering with the primary consideration of profits .
Also on the agenda is getting Canada and Mexico to allow more privatization of state - run enterprises like Mexico 's nationalized oil company , PEMEX , and eventually open up Canada 's medicare health care system to private investment .
The US can't negotiate this way with its western European , Chinese or Japanese trading partners but can easily pressure most developing nations to go along with policies harming their own people , and neighboring accommodating ones like Canada , so long as their elite leading players share the benefits .
In February , 2007 , a set of SPP private sector priorities were laid out by the North American Competitiveness Council ( NACC ) that serves as an official tri-national SPP working group .
It was created at the March , 2006 second annual SPP summit in Cancun , Mexico .
The group is composed of representatives of 30 giant North American companies , with powerful US ones like GE , Ford , GM , Wal - Mart , Lockheed Martin , Merck and Chevron running things the way Orwell described in " Animal Farm " where " All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . "
NACC 's recommendations centered on " private sector involvement " being " a key step to enhancing North America 's competitive position in global markets and is the driving force behind innovation and growth . "
It mentioned " border - crossing facilitation , standards and regulatory cooperation , and energy integration ( with a top priority of ) improving the secure flow of goods and people within North America . "
These issues and others were discussed above explaining what they 're really all about , not the usual code language hiding their real purpose .
Without using the word , NACC stressed the importance establishing policies for maximum profits .
Its report said " Every measure that adds to the cost or time to cross borders within North America is in effect a tax on enterprise , a tax on investment ( fair taxes in both cases ) , or a tax on jobs ( a slap at high wages ) across the region , which ultimately results in incremental costs for the consumers in all three countries ( untrue as cost savings accrue to bottom lines , not consumer pockets ) . "
Also mentioned was the need to make the North American economy " work better ( and strengthen ) the security and well - being of citizens " without mentioning the " citizens " NACC has in mind are dominant corporate ones and the privileged only and doing it means hard line restraint on the public .
SPP wants " to cut red tape and give consumers better access to safe , less expensive , and innovative products " that only " red tape " can help assure .
Regulations , it says " impede the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses in all three countries " except ones giving them a competitive advantage and even though regulations , in fact , serve ( or should serve ) to protect consumers , not harm them .
Recommendations in the report call for specific action in these sectors in the order the report listed them .
It placed last the one of greatest importance , energy , but here 's the order priority given : food and agriculture , financial services , transportation , protection of intellectual property rights and lastly energy integration specifically emphasizing Canada 's vast oil sands that make its overall reserves second only to Saudi Arabia .
Canada aims to triple its oil sands production by 2015 to three million barrels daily to feed America 's insatiable energy appetite these resources are earmarked for .
Mexico's oil is also targeted , but the report hides NACC 's aim for state oil company PEMEX to be opened to private investment saying only while the country is " blessed with abundant reserves , ( it ) faces major challenges in attracting capital " needed to realize their potential .
NACC wants Mexico to " increase the competitiveness in ( its ) energy sector " without saying it wants it privatized so foreign investors can plunder them for profit .
It also wants governments and the private sector to " work together effectively in strengthening the competitive position of enterprises " in all three countries saying , in effect , end all restrictions on how we do business even if it harms your nations , people and environment .
It made 50 total recommendations it wants mostly accomplished before the end of 2008 with some longer range ones targeting 2010 .
They cover the range of issues discussed above and specific ones listed below :
-- developing " national critical infrastructure protection strategies " with rules providing for legal protection ;
-- enhancing emergency management and disaster planning ;
-- implementing planned land clearance projects , meaning less for the people and more for corporate predators ;
-- putting in place more business - friendly border security practices , meaning militarizing the border ;
-- further simplifying NAFTA rules - of - origin requirements , meaning no restrictions on regional trade even for unsafe products ;
-- simplifying the NAFTA certification process and requirements aiming at their total elimination ;
-- ending the consumer - protective US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) ;
-- removing regulatory standards and practices that impede trade even if doing it harms consumers ;
-- working toward a goal of uniform global regulatory standards and practices regardless of the consequences or concern about national sovereignty ;
-- easing cross - border tax burdens forcing consumers to pick up the difference ;
-- cooperating in identifying common financial regulatory concerns , then work to eliminate them ;
-- agreeing to unrestricted air cargo transport services between the US and Mexico ;
-- completing a coordinated Intellectual Property Rights ( IPR ) Strategy aimed at protecting them and keeping their prices high ;
-- developing an initiative against counterfeiting and piracy ; and
-- collaborating on expanding the supply of highly skilled people in the energy sector throughout North America and building a model to be applied to other knowledge - intensive sectors such as financial services .
NACC denies what 's pretty clear about about its aims .
Saying its recommendations are n't meant to " threaten the sovereign power of any of the three countries , " there 's no doubt that 's the central objective .
It wants a North American Union headquartered in Washington with policies in place benefitting corporate giants at the expense of working people .
They 'll be hammered by greater job losses , fewer social services , and a loss of personal security under militarized police state conditions in the name of " national ( continental ) security " in the age of concocted global terror threats .
North American Future 2025 Project
This is another secretive effort with the same objective run by the US - based conservative Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) .
It held closed - door meeting roundtables of Canadian business leaders in Calgary as part of a project by this name .
CSIS former American political heavyweights are involved including Sam Nunn , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Harold Brown , William Cohen , Henry Kissinger and others .
The agenda involves preparing a final report to the US , Canadian and Mexican governments by September 30 expected to recommend the benefits of integrating the three nations into a single political , economic and security bloc .
What 's known has activist groups upset including the Council of Canadians and Coalition for Water Aid .
They 're protesting what they say amounts to a sub rosa effort for corporate interests to control Canada 's huge fresh water supply , estimated at one - fifth of the world 's total .
They want Canadian energy and other resources , too .
LIke NACC , CSIS carefully states its aims in what it 's made public so far , showing the goals of both efforts are the same .
CSIS 's North America Future 2025
Project is its research effort to help policymakers " make sound , strategic , long - range policy decisions about North America , with emphasis on regional integration . "
It cites " six areas of critical importance to the trilateral relationship : labor mobility , energy , the environment , security , competitiveness and border infrastructure and logistics . "
This is all familiar terminology to be discussed in " seven closed - door roundtable sessions ( with ) 21 ( to ) 45 individuals - with an equal number from each nation . "
They kicked off in Roundtable I discussing " Methodology of Global and North American Projections " followed by each of the above listed six " critical " areas .
Protesters are planning to be at the third trilateral SPP summit Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper will host August 20 and 21 in Montebello , Quebec .
They 'll target SPP overall as well as the Harper government 's efforts to advance the corporate - friendly " Trade , Investment and Labour Mobility Agreement " ( TILMA ) as one more nail in the coffin of Canadian national sovereignty .
The agreement between Alberta and British Columbia took effect April 1 , 2007 and mandates harmonizing regulations and standards between the two provinces , removing barriers to economic development .
Saskatchewan is now being targeted to sign on as efforts advance overall for a borderless North America with schemes like TILMA being used as stepping stones along the way to achieve it .
TILMA for all Canada will allow Canadian companies the right to challenge any provincial laws conflicting the NAFTA provisions .
SPP North American integration will go much further , of course , and Joseph Watson reported " Globalists to Formally Propose Merger of US , Canada ( and ) Mexico " in his July 5 Prison Planet web site article .
In it , he says CSIS " political heavyweights " will formally propose a North American union to Congress at summer 's end after the conclusion of their seven secret roundtable meetings to devise it .
It will contain provisions explained above that spell doom for the sovereignty of the three participating nations .
Their leaders want them to become one in service to corporate giants ' strategy for greater profits at the public 's expense .
A further aim is to harmonize regulatory standards with the European Union ( EU ) in a new transatlantic economic partnership that moves things closer to corporate America 's dream of a militarized borderless world run by them .
The North American SuperCorridor Coalition ( NASCO )
This is another organization set up to facilitate the designs of NACC and the North American Future 2025 Project for continental integration .
It 's a trilateral provincial , state and local government coalition aligned with the goals of corporate giants in three countries .
As its name suggests , it aims to develop an international , integrated , secure superhighway running the length of the continent .
If built , it would extend from Winnipeg , Manitoba ; Edmonton , Alberta ; and Windsor , Ontario , Canada through Kansas City , San Antonio and Laredo , Texas into Neuvo Laredo , Guadalajara , and the ports of Manzanillo , Colima and Lazaro Cardenas , Mexico .
It 's planned to be a comprehensive energy and commerce - related jugular vein - sized artery for transportation , trade and strategic resources like energy .
According to NASCO documents , DHS will be in charge of monitoring the entire system through high - tech sensors and trackers as a further step to securing the continent for business at taxpayers expense .
This is part of the massive infrastructure planned for North American integration .
If completed , it 'll be a boon to business at the expense of the environment and working people throughout the continent , always the ones to lose from grandiose schemes like this one .
Plan Puebla - Panama ( PPP )
Mexican President Felipe Calderon wishes to revive former President Vincente Fox 's PPP that flopped but did n't die .
It 's a multi-billion dollar development scheme to turn Southern Mexico and Central America , all the way to Panama , into a colossal free trade paradise displacing indigenous people , destroying their culture and sacred corn , and harming the environment for profit .
Fox earlier and Calderon now want to induce private investment by shamelessly handing over to them the region 's natural resources , including its oil , water , minerals , timber and ecological biodiversity .
The idea is to rip into the area with new ports , airports , bullet trains , bridges , superhighways , 25 hydroelectric dams , new telecommunication facilities , electrical grids , and a new Panama Canal - for starters , with more development to follow .
Also envisioned is opening the country 's wildlife reserves for bioprospecting with a huge giveaway to giant seed , chemical and drug companies and connect everything with new highways linking Mexico to Central America and no doubt would connect to the proposed NASCO superhighway .
The idea is to develop and facilitate business throughout the region - meaning indigenous people have to leave to make way for it , like it or not , which they do n't and will fight it .
The area planned for development is enormous and so far stalled .
It covers 102 million hectares with 64 million inhabitants in eight countries , few of whom will benefit from a naked scheme to exploit .
It masquerades as infrastructure , private development and more without consent of the people the way it 's always done .
It 's the reason the plan went nowhere so far .
It 's irrelevant to the poor , rural South who'll lose everything so corporate predators can take their land and livelihoods for private gain .
They then want to sell back to the people what 's already theirs like Chiapas ' fresh water .
It 's 40 % of Mexico 's total and the reason Coca - Cola is dying to get hold of it .
It would also destroy the last significant tropical rain forest in Chiapas ' Montes Azules Integral Biosphere in the Lacandon jungle where the government wants to remove native Mayans from lands belonging to them .
Enter Felipe Calderon .
On April 9 , he held a one - day conference in Campeche , Mexico attended by the presidents of all Central American countries except Belize and Nicaragua , who sent their prime minister and vice - president respectively .
Washington no doubt is pushing this scheme as it would be a development bonanza for US corporations if implemented and a huge opportunity for many others if ever completed .
Militarizing A Continent As A First Step
No nation is more militarized today than America .
It spends more on national defense and homeland security than all other nations combined .
Add to those budgets all others related to defense , still others for intelligence and covert actions , plus the net interest cost attributable to past debt - financed defense outlays and it totals over $ 1 trillion for FY 2007 according to one analyst 's estimate and heading way above that in FY 2008 if current budget proposals pass and become law which is almost certain .
Canada and Mexico are expected to share the load as part of Washington 's " war on terrorism " and are doing it .
Supporting Washington is central for Canada 's Stephen Harper conservative administration .
It includes adhering to the 2002 Binational Planning Agreement allowing US military forces to enter Canada on its own discretion , set up shop , and exercise authority over Canadians in their own country .
Harper 's more hard line than his predecessors .
He believes Canadian political and business interests depend on it , and he 's committed to serving them no matter how ordinary Canadians feel about it .
He 's submissive to Washington and has been massively ramping up military spending with plans to increase it over 50 % above 2005 levels to $ 21.5 billion annually by 2010 .
That 's chump change by US standards but a major commitment for a nation traditionally spending at far lower levels .
Canada faces no outside threat so spending hugely on its military , unlike in the past , defies tradition and public consensus favoring social spending that 's being cut to pay for it .
It 's also contrary to Canada 's traditionally eschewing militarism and foreign wars unlike its southern neighbor 's thriving on them since the nation 's founding .
Business interests , not national security or the public welfare , drive Harper 's agenda .
America accounts for 87 % of Canada 's exports , and Canadian businesses are closely allied with US ones .
In many instances , it 's as subsidiaries with US corporations owning 20 % of Canada 's non-financial sector , 33 % of its oil and gas industry , and many Canadian defense companies linked to US ones as subsidiaries or in a sub- contracting capacity .
Canada 's influential Department of National Defense ( DND ) , its new Chief of Defence Staff , General Rick Hillier and defence minister Gordon O'Connor are on board with Harper as well .
They 're committed to ramping up the nation 's military spending and linking with America 's " war on terrorism . "
It gives them more power to lock in even more as SPP advances and outlines a plan for it across the continent .
Mexico has its part to play as well .
With threats and fear - mongering , it 's using drug - related violence as a pretext for cracking down on simmering unrest wherever it surfaces with plenty of US military aid to do it .
The scheme is to quiet and cow millions in the country opposing democracy , Mexican - style .
It made National Action Party ( PAN ) Felipe Calderon president in a process decided before people ever voted last July 2 the way it 's always worked in Mexican politics .
It 's got parts of the country , like Oaxaca , in open rebellion against its state governor , Ulises Ruiz Ortiz ( known as URO ) .
It also made the country a tinderbox of discontent with growing numbers in it fed up with sham elections , decades of repression , deepening poverty and an entrenched system of privilege for the rich and powerful .
Mega - billionaire Carlos Slim just passed Bill Gates by $ 8.6 billion to become the world 's richest man in a country with the second largest number of billionaires in Latin America after Brazil and among the top ten in the world with the greatest number of them .
The US tops all nations by a wide margin with far more in New York and Los Angeles alone than anywhere else .
Calderon to their rescue to make his own richer .
He 's got 30,000 troops stomping on the people and fighting Washington 's wars on Mexico 's streets and along its near - 2000 mile northern border .
He also has to protect state oil company Pemex after a series of July explosions attacked the company 's gas pipelines in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato .
It affected 800 companies incurring losses of $ 5 - 10 million a day and caused 5000 people to be evacuated from 20 surrounding communities .
A group called the Popular or People 's Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) claimed responsibility saying it demands release of two men detained unjustly in Oaxaca in May and held as political prisoners .
The group 's communique also said the attacks were part of a " national campaign against the interests of the oligarchy and of this illegitimate government ( in power from the stolen 2006 election ) that has been put in motion . "
It 's another sign how polarized Mexican society is with those losing out in it striking back .
In the US , poverty is growing and the wealth disparity is unprecedented .
However , things are much worse in Mexico .
It has the world 's fourth largest number of millionaires , but poverty 's been rising since the 1970s , and since the mid-1980s the nation 's poor have been reeling under the affects of IMF - imposed structural adjustment policies mandating large - scale privatizations and wage restraints .
Then came NAFTA in 1994 .
It devastated millions of Mexicans , forced many north to survive , and may by one estimate eventually displace 10 million small farmers from their land ( plus their families ) into poverty assuring they 'll head north in desperation .
Today nearly one - third of Mexicans live on $ 2 or less a day , and millions can't afford basic needs like enough food , decent shelter and medical care when sick .
It did n't help that Felipe Calderon allowed staple corn prices to skyrocket causing tortilla prices to spike by 50 % in most regions devastating impoverished consumers .
They can't afford the staple they rely on , and small Mexican corn producers are even less able to compete with subsidized imports that was n't possible post - NAFTA .
These are the issues generating mass civil unrest and disobedience that simmer beneath the surface when they 're not visible on the streets like in Oaxaca since last May , 2006 .
It 's gone on in spite of harsh efforts to crush it violently with Federal Preventative Police ( PFP ) and military forces launched against it on the pretext of fighting drugs traffickers and terrorism .
Calderon 's 30,000 Mexican troops are also in a third or more of the nation 's states , civil rights are suspended and widespread abuses are reported because the military got a mandate to " use all necessary force to resolve disturbances and return peace to society . "
That 's just a hint of what 's coming across Mexico and the continent under full implementation of SPP that wo n't tolerate opposition and will crack down hard against it .
Mexican law now allows it after passage of the draconian " International Terrorism Law " criminalizing dissent , calling it terrorism , and imposing harsh sentences for using " violence against persons , things , or public services that spread ( enough ) alarm or fear in the population .... to threaten national security or pressure authorities to take certain determinations . "
The press is also targeted with prohibitions against " publish ( ing ) or distribut ( ing ) .... photos or images without the express consent of those featured , " a condition impossible to meet .
Social protests may be criminalized as well with resistance movements like the Zapatistas and Oaxacan Popular Peoples ' Assembly ( APPO ) labeled terrorist organizations and their leaders subject to 40 year mandated prison terms if charged and convicted .
And President Calderon wants Mexico's Congress to pass an amendment giving him constitutional powers to tap phones and search private residences without first obtaining court - ordered approval under any conditions he claims is " urgent . "
Mexico's hard right Supreme Court of Nacional Justice ( SCJN ) is supportive .
Last year it declared Mexico 's military can aid police in cases of public security that can be anything the state says it is .
The Court also ruled law enforcement officials need no court - ordered warrants to search and seize in " flagrant situations " that can also mean anything and that violates the American Convention of Human Rights adopted as Mexican law .
Then there 's Calderon 's war on drugs and the cartels that 's , in fact , a war no different than Colombia 's war on dissident resistance groups like the FARC and ELN .
Like Plan Colombia , Washington has a similar one for Mexico , so call it what it is - Plan Mexico with tens of millions in funding , equipment and technology to back it up .
Also call it US - supported and funded state terrorism in a grand scheme to militarize the country and crack down on dissent and resistance to authoritarian rule at the federal , state and local levels .
It 's partnered with Washington in its phony " war on terrorism " to maintain order , crush opposition and incarcerate anyone interfering or in the way .
US military elements already operate inside Mexico freely and covertly , and a 1994 Pentagon briefing paper , declassified under FOIA , hinted at a US invasion if the country became destabilized or the government faced the threat of being overthrown because of " widespread economic and social chaos " that would jeopardize US investments , access to oil , overall trade , and would create great numbers of immigrants heading north .
Plans are in place and are playing out to snuff out trouble before it spirals out of control , and the proposed US immigration bill was to provide funding for it through stepped up militarization .
But even with the bill defeated , the money 's coming and US forces will follow if needed .
Congressional budgeting calls for millions in Mexican military aid and massive new border detention centers for up to 30,000 detainees for starters with two notorious ones discussed below already operating .
What 's planned on the border will also likely show up anywhere in all three SPP countries to defuse social discontent by disappearing a large new political prisoner population into black holes of repressive incarceration .
That 's SPP 's promise and scheme to create police state North America making the continent safe for corporate interests by revoking ours .
Raymondville and Hutto Texas Immigrant Prison Detention Centers
The Willacy immigrant detention center at Raymondville , Texas , is oppressive enough to be called " Ritmo . "
It 's run by the private for - profit MTC Corporation and is currently the largest immigrant prison in the country in the remote southern tip of the state .
It cost $ 65 million to build , is a " tent city , " and is ringed by barbed wire and 14 - foot high chain - link fences .
It currently holds over 2000 immigrant detainees under repressive conditions including 23 hour a day lockdowns in 10 windowless hothouses .
Entire families are incarcerated there , fed poor or insufficient food , given inadequate and delayed medical care , and treated inhumanely in unsafe conditions for extended periods lasting months .
Conditions overall are abusive , disciplinary punishment harsh , with detainees having to put up with no partitions or doors separating five toilets , five sinks , five shower heads and eating areas where some days detainees lack utensils and eat with their hands .
Lights are kept on round the clock , clothing is inadequate , and on cold days detainees are kept outside for an allowed daily hour in short - sleeved uniforms with no warm protective clothing like blankets , sweat shirts or jackets .
The Hutto Residential Center is another immigrant detention center in Taylor , Texas currently holding around 400 prisoners including 200 children and infants .
Few detainees here or at other immigrant prisons committed crimes or were charged with any , yet they 're treated like criminals because they were forced here to survive NAFTA and DR - CAFTA inflicted job losses .
They 're victims of US repressive trade policies but are treated like criminals made to suffer retribution for exploitative state practices committed against them .
Post 9/11 , the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was passed establishing the repressive Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and in March , 2003 its largest investigative and enforcement arm - the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ( ICE ) .
It 's charged with protecting public safety by identifying and targeting " criminal " and " terrorist " threats to the country that include Latino and other desperate for work undocumented immigrants forced to come here to survive .
ICE was established to apprehend them at the border or hunt them down relentlessly once here .
It has four integrated divisions , one of which is policing our southern border and conducting terror - raid undocumented immigrant worker roundups with those apprehended headed for abusive detention at facilities like Raymondville and Hutto .
There and at other facilities like them , ICE - detained immigrants number around 28,000 on an average day with totals heading for 30,000 or more by year end .
Hutto is run by Corrections Corporation of American , the largest for - profit private prison operator in the country .
It has 64 facilities in 19 states and the District of Columbia with a capacity for incarcerating over 69,000 inmates .
It 's reputation is unsavory based on former prisoner accounts of severe abuse , inadequate medical and educational services , poor or noxious food and overall inhumane conditions including rat and roach - infested cramped centers , inadequate basic hygiene , rapes , beatings and deaths at their facilities .
The Hutto facility in Taylor , Texas houses immigrant detainees .
It 's particularly notorious for treating young children no differently than adults , including some too young to know where they are or why and older ones with no idea why they 're detained at all .
Conditions are made worse by abusive guards and uncaring officials .
The daily routine is stultifying and cruel .
Families are awakened at 5:30 AM and allowed 30 minutes to bathe and dress .
They then get 20 minutes to eat food that 's often poor quality , inedible , and / or inadequate .
If children have n't finished in time , their food is thrown out and they 're left to go hungry .
Following meals , prisoners are returned to their cells , are n't allowed out , denied sleep during the day , and forced to sit and endure boredom to pass the time .
No books are allowed , and frequent head counts are taken throughout the day to assure no one escaped .
Educational facilities for children are pathetically inadequate at one hour a day in which practically nothing is taught , and conditions and treatment overall are so bad the ACLU sued DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff on March 6 on behalf of 10 abused children at Hutto .
The US District Court judge hearing the case , Sam Sparks , set an expedited trial date for August , agreeing with the plaintiff that detainee treatment at Hutto fails to meet federal standards .
Homeland Security Police State Justice for Everyone
Post - 9/11 , Muslims and Latino immigrants have been targeted by the Bush administration , falsely charged with terrorism and other crimes , and subjected to abusive harassment and persecution .
They 've been victimized by mass roundups , detentions , prosecutions and deportations the result of baseless claims they threaten national security .
If full - blown SPP security measures are implemented , anyone challenging , or seen threatening , state authority may henceforth be subjected to similar harsh treatment .
It 's practically that way now , but expect lots worse ahead .
The rule of law will be weakened or ignored , civil liberties and essential human needs further eroded , and state and corporate power tightened enough to be in full control .
Dissent no longer will be tolerated , and anyone seen as a threat in an age of a " war on terrorism " will be targeted , just as Muslims and immigrants are today .
Preparations are in progress for mass detentions with Halliburton the beneficiary of a DHS contingency contract worth up to $ 385 million to build US - based detention centers .
Their stated purpose is for " detention and processing " in case of an " emergency influx of immigrants .... or to support the rapid development of new programs ( for planned ) expansion facilities ( able to hold 5000 or more persons ) . "
This language provides cover for planned concentration camps targeting anyone for indefinite detention as a perceived enemy of the state or threat to national security any time henceforth .
The idea is to have facilities ready in case martial law is declared for any reason .
It might include the kind of major " terrorist " attack DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff practically signaled is coming later this summer to a Chicago Tribune editorial board July 10 .
ABC
News also hyped the story citing a new FBI analysis of Al - Queda messages warning of " continued messages that convey their strategic intent to strike the US homeland and US interests worldwide ( that ) should not be discounted as merely deceptive noise . "
The rest of the corporate media jumped on the story as well to prepare the public for full militarization of the country if what Chertoff and a number of intelligence analysts believe is virtually certain ahead .
The Pentagon is ready if it comes with an action plan prepared in a DOD document called " Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support . "
It envisions an " active , layered defense " both within and outside the US pledging to " transform US military forces to execute homeland defense missions in the .... US homeland . "
It lays out a strategy for increased reconnaissance and surveillance to " defeat potential challengers before they threaten the United States . "
It also " maximizes threat awareness and seizes the initiative from those who would harm us . "
These are ominous developments signaled with very dangerous language .
It suggests the likelihood of an impending terror attack severe enough to warrant suspension of the Constitution followed by martial law .
It means anyone may be considered a threat to national security and detained indefinitely with or without evidence to prove it .
It further empowers the state , through the military , to act preventively through mass roundups and detentions .
No one will be safe or spared if targeted and will be subject to police state justice granting them none .
A full - scale militarization of the country can be implemented any time on what a 1988 Reagan era Executive Order 12656 called any " national security emergency " defined as " Any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . "
Other repressive legislation 's already in place as well .
Under Patriot and Military Commission
Acts justice , constitutional rights are severely weakened , and we 're all " enemy combatants " stripped of our habeas and due process rights , subject to indefinite detentions , denied our right to counsel and at the mercy of military tribunal justice with no right of appeal .
Welcome to North America 's Security and Prosperity Partnership guaranteeing it to elitist interests by denying it to the people of three nations .
They 're to be parts of the new " united continent of America , " or North American Union , run by dark forces in Washington that wo n't move out when a new president moves in January 20 , 2009 .

While Bush administration officials had reluctantly endorsed the cease - fire as part of their effort to prop up the Pakistani leader , they expressed relief on Tuesday that General Musharraf may have to abandon that approach , because the accord seems to have unraveled .
But American officials make little secret of their skepticism that General Musharraf has the capability to be effective in the mountainous territory along the Afghan border , where his troops have been bloodied before by a mix of Qaeda leaders and tribes that view the territory as their own , not part of Pakistan .
“ We ’ve seen in the past that he ’s sent people in and they get wiped out , ” said one senior official involved in the internal debate .
“ You can tell from the language today that we take the threat from the tribal areas incredibly seriously .
It has to be dealt with .
If he can deal with it , amen .
But if he can ’t , he ’s got to build and borrow the capability . ”
The bleak intelligence assessment was made public in the middle of a bitter Congressional debate about the future of American policy in Iraq .
White House officials said it bolstered the Bush administration ’s argument that Iraq was the “ central front ” in the war on terror , because that was where Qaeda operatives were directly attacking American forces .

The report nevertheless left the White House fending off accusations that it had been distracted by the war in Iraq and that the deals it had made with President Musharraf had resulted in lost time and lost ground .
I first became aware of how much I despised homosexuality when I worked at a savings and loan in 1981 .
Don [ not his real name ] , referred to as a " queer " in our small town , shoved his savings passbook across the counter for a large cash withdrawal .
He glanced over his shoulder and spoke to his companion , a good - looking boy of about eighteen .
The boy laughed and his eyes met mine , full of mockery and challenge .
I swallowed hard and shuddered , then handed Don the wad of bills , and they walked out arm - in-arm .
At home that night , I described the incident to my family in a voice tinged with disgust .
" Thank God there 's none of that in our family . "
In fact , people thought our family had it all good marriage , comfortable home , successful careers .
Our oldest son , Rick , was happily married with three children .
Tim , our younger son , sang with his girlfriend in the high school choir .
Few people knew of my husband 's chameleonlike personality .
But one night seven years later , I feared for my life in the throes of my husband 's drunken rage .
The next day I confronted him .
I could n't live with his drinking problem any longer , and I urged him to seek help .
Instead , he moved out .
Several months later , he divorced me .
To pay off our debts , I sold our home , moved into an apartment , and started rebuilding my life .
I 'd been through hell and survived .
Nothing would ever again shake me like that .
The end of our thirty - year marriage created an upheaval in my sons ' lives .
Rick and his wife divorced about a year later .
Tim abandoned college and joined the U.S. Marine Corps , going first to San Diego , then to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War .
I prayed for his safety , not knowing a greater battle in spiritual warfare awaited his return .
After his discharge in May 1991 , Tim remained in San Diego .
Then , on January 3 , 1992 , an emotional earthquake shattered my world .
The pages of Tim 's letter trembled in my hand as I read : " My sexual orientation has bothered me since I was twelve .
Please , Mom , listen to me .
I feel a strong attraction for men .
I understand how you must feel . "
Coffee splashed as I slammed my cup on the table and threw down the letter .
No , Tim could n't possibly understand , or he'd never have written this .
I lurched up from the sofa , his words scorching my mind .
" I am who I am , and it 's taken me thirteen years to be able to accept this . "
Thirteen years ?
No .
No , I 'd have known .
What about his girlfriends in high school and college ?
How could he be gay ?
What happened ?
Where had I failed ?
I fell to my knees sobbing .
Then pulling myself off the floor , I grabbed my keys , snatched up Tim 's letter , and ran to my car , taking off in the winter night .
As the speedometer reached 80 mph , a snow - covered guardrail suddenly rushed toward me .
Terrified , I twisted the steering wheel .
The car skidded , then held on the graveled shoulder .
Peering into the darkness , I searched for familiar landmarks .
Finally , I recognized a farmhouse .
I 'd gone more than fifty miles from home .
I pulled off the deserted highway onto a side road and stopped the car .
Punching open the car 's moon roof , I tilted the seat back and gulped clean , cold air .
After a long while , I sighed .
Okay , Lord , I give up .
What do you want me to do ?
Switching on the map light , I picked up Tim 's letter .
This time I heard his pain : " I feel alone .
I 'm so afraid of my family rejecting me .
You 're still my mom , and I still love you .
I always will . "
I had to hear Tim 's voice , so I drove back to my apartment and dialed his number .
When Tim answered , tears flooded my eyes .
I told him I loved him , no matter what .
But , I said , homosexuality is a sin .
" You 're not alone , Tim .
I 'm here and Jesus is too .
God loves you .
Remember Romans 8:38 - 39 ?
Nothing can separate you from God 's love in Christ Jesus .
But you must renounce this lifestyle . "
Tim sobbed , unable to speak .
After a few moments I said , " I 'll call you tomorrow .
I love you , Tim . "
Sorrow filled my heart as I hung up .
Over the next few weeks , we talked on the phone or through letters .
I needed answers .
" Tim , why ?
Was it the war ?
Did something happen over there ?
Or when you were little ? "
Eventually , he opened up .
" Remember the older boy in my third grade class ?
The bully ? "
Tim said .
" Well , he cornered me one day after school - - " his voice broke .
" After that , he told everyone I was a fag .
Nobody wanted to be around me . "
He told me of a couple more childhood incidents when older boys had threatened or bribed him into cooperating with their sexual indulgences .
Then came another shock .
" Did I ever tell you about the time Dad took me to a gay community in Massachusetts right before I joined the Marines ? "
The phone turned to lead in my hand .
" No , " I whispered .
" It was a business trip .
When the business was done , that 's where we went , to a town on Cape Cod .
It 's a gay community . "
He paused .
" Well , maybe you did n't know .
You guys were n't divorced yet , but Dad had moved out . "
As Tim described the incident , it became clear his father had been to this place before .
My heart raced .
" Did anything happen ?
I mean --"
" No , Mom , nothing happened .
Dad wanted to go to this gay bar .
He laughed and joked with these guys .
I kept my eyes glued to the TV and did n't talk to anybody .
I did n't know what to do .
I just wanted to die . "
Bitterness laced his words .
" I do n't think I 've ever come so close to hating him . "
I recalled other business trips when Tim was nine or ten .
At the time , I was pleased my husband was spending time with this younger son .
Did something happen then ?
I tried to question Tim , but he refused to talk about it .
He did n't remember .
He thought he'd had a happy childhood .
I let it go .
As the weeks went by , I felt ashamed and afraid .
My prayers seemed inadequate .
Desperate , I called my dear friend Dory , a nurse .
Her nonjudgmental , no - nonsense voice offered strength .
She told me about Barbara Johnson 's book , Where Does a Mother Go to Resign ?
I read it and called Barbara .
This dynamic woman shared hope , encouragement , and the names of two other women in similar circumstances .
I was n't alone .
I learned about Exodus International , a worldwide Christian ministry dedicated to helping men and women who want to overcome homosexuality and turn to Christ .
From Exodus , I received the names of two Christian men in San Diego who had renounced homosexuality and were available to counsel others .
Excited , I called Tim with the good news , convinced he would grab this opportunity to be free from bondage .
I was wrong .
He said he was n't in bondage .
He did n't want to be free from homosexuality .
He said he was born this way , and Jesus knew .
How could he be so deceived ?
From the beginning , I 'd taught him about Jesus , whom he had invited into his life at the age of five .
Through the years , I 'd had no inkling something was wrong .
Did Tim ever hint at trouble ?
Did I really listen ?
Were there dark secrets in our household ?
I do n't know .
After Tim 's letter in 1992 , I regarded my adult son as a victim .
" They " had caught and trapped him .
" They " were faceless , nameless , evil people .
Homosexuals .
Enemies .
But God was n't finished with me yet .
That spring , Tim brought a friend home a homosexual .
The enemy had arrived on my doorstep .
I was tense but quickly realized Tim 's friend was even more nervous .
I sensed his fear of rejection .
Mothering instincts surged , and my heart reached out to him .
He was n't an enemy he was a wounded soul .
My quiet times with the Lord changed from selfish pain and anger to genuine grief for Tim and others like him .
Satan blinds them to the truth and deceives them .
The change in my attitude toward homosexuals was tested in my workplace where some of my colleagues apparently are gay or bisexual ; I no longer avoid them .
They 're real people , just like me .
The Lord has softened my heart , and I 've learned to hate the sin while I love , or at least care for , the sinner .
Tim often brings homosexual friends when he comes to visit me and my new husband , Chuck .
He once told me , " You guys are living proof to my friends that heterosexual marriage can work . "
Perhaps he , too , is seeking proof and hope for himself .
When Chuck proposed a few years ago , I told him about Tim and about my commitment to the Lord to be available to Tim and his friends .
Chuck regards
Tim as his own son and together we 've opened our home to these wounded souls , many of whom have been rejected by parents and siblings .
Tim never asks to stay overnight when he has a companion .
Their conduct is above reproach in our home .
Often an arrogant attitude masks their pain , but it soon dissolves .
Some of them jokingly call me Mom .
When the opportunity arrives to present the gospel , I do , usually in the form of my own testimony .
This opens the door for them to express their views of Christianity .
I hear anger .
These young men say they 've been rejected by their own churches and therefore , they imply , by God .
They 've turned their backs and buried themselves in resentment and fear .
How can we reach these hardened hearts ?
For me , evangelism begins with friendship .
I am one small part of God 's whole planperhaps I can plant one tiny seed , and the next one will plant the garden , and others will nourish it .
As I write , Tim seems resigned to being homosexual , but he gives clues that he 's not a practicing homosexual .
It 's a fine line of distinction , perhaps even a rationalization .
Only God knows the heart ( 1 Kings 8:39 ) .
Jesus ,
Tim says , is his best friend .
I believe him .
But I also know Jesus is more than a friend he is the Savior and Lord .
God heard that five year old 's prayer inviting Jesus into his life .
Even if Tim has strayed away , God has n't moved .
He 'll be there when Tim chooses to resist the devil and listen to the Holy Spirit .
My heart still hurts .
My son's life is far from happy , his future uncertain .
The New King James version of Psalms 56:8 says God puts my tears in his bottle .
My hope rests with the Lord .
" They will return from the land of the enemy [ Satan ] .
Your children will return to their own land " ( Jeremiah 31:16 - 17 ) .
In the meantime , God has called me to pray for and love Tim , and to be available .

The investigating officers ( IO ) for LtCol Chessani and LCpl Sharratt have returned with their recommendations .
In LtCol Chessani ’s case the recommendation is to continue to a court - martial for dereliction of duty .
In LCpl Sharratt ’s case it is recommended that no charged be sent to court - martial .
The charges against LtCol Chessani stem from his alleged failure to investigate the deaths in Haditha .
The report stated that LtCol Chessani “ failed to thoroughly and accurately report and investigate a combat engagement that clearly needed scrutiny . ”
His Article 32 investigation was filled with some interesting events .
Including the chief - of - staff invoking his 5th Amendment privilege and refusing to testify .
LtCol Chessani explained that he did not feel a need to investigate , because his “ men are not murderers ! ”
The case against LCpl Sharratt could be over if the commanding general , Gen Mattis , accepts the recommendations of the investigating officer .
The investigating officer indicated that he deemed the Marines more credible than the residents of Haditha , who said the killings were executions .
There were numerous problems with the evidence in this case , including NCIS losing a briefcase seized at the scene that contained AK - 47 rifles and Jordanian passports .
Thus far in the Haditha matter , we have had the following Article 32 investigations :
Capt Stone – IO recommends no charges and superiors failed to act on the same information .
LCpl Sharratt – IO recommends no charges .
LtCol Chessani – IO recommends charges for dereliction of duty .
It is interesting to compare the outcomes with the investigating officers .
In the case of Capt Stone and LCpl Sharratt , the investigating officers , Maj Mann and LtCol Ware were both judge advocates ( lawyers in the Marine Corps ) .
In the case of LtCol Chessani , the IO was Col Conlin , an infantry officer and former battalion commander .
Take this into consideration before comparing this to the Duke case .

SciView : scientific interviews , part 1
Trying to generate content that would appeal to a wider range of scientists , I decided to do some email interviews with prominent scientists , in order to get their opinions on different aspects of science and research .
The first interview was done with Joe Felsenstein , from the University of Washington .
I would like to thank him for taking the time to answer my ( sometimes ) dull questions .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
How do you see the “ publish or perish ” in science , with the increasing number of retracted papers , fake results , rushed publications and sometimes publication of extremely similar results in different papers and journals ?
JF : As you imply , “ publish or perish ” is a Bad Thing , which leads to all these negative results .
We should all be given a lifetime stipend with freely available grant funds , in hopes that before retirement we will produce at least one passable paper .
Phylip is a great piece of software , in most cases better than PAUP and other similar applications .
Can this be linked to the fact that it is open source and freely available ?
Have this helped to keep the software updated and portable to any system ?
JF : You will find that opinions vary greatly as to which is better , PHYLIP or PAUP *.
More people find PAUP * better than find PHYLIP better .
So your premise may be wrong , which leaves us without a need to find the reason .
The availability of the source code allows people to suggest changes that increase robustness and portability .
But another reason is simply that I tend to write ( and urge my programmers to write ) in a “ paranoid ” style of C which deliberately avoids local features of one operating system or features of C that are sometimes not implemented correctly .
One correction : PHYLIP is * not* Open Source .
It is copyrighted to the University of Washington , and resale of it is potentially subject to a license fee .
Actually PHYLIP is not the result of a large community of users .
Mostly it ’s me and my student programmers , with some important pieces added by others .
So it is not an example of the strength of the Open Source or GNU approach .
Recently , I have focused on improving my interface design skills , trying to make the bioinformatics software - user interaction more friendly .
Do you think that due to the fact that Phylip does not have a graphical interface was an obstacle to make it more widespread ?
JF : People often ask me why it does n’t have a GUI .
They also frequently request the opposite : a command - line interface with all options invoked from the command line .
The problem is not having some GUI , it is having a good , intuitive GUI .
That is a matter of design ( Intelligent Design , I guess ) .
I once assigned a very good programmer to make a demonstration GUI for one of my programs , mimicking the menu that we already had ( and actually then doing nothing , just showing what it would look like ) .
The result was so totally boring that it alerted me that the issue was not a GUI but what kind of GUI .
How do you see that some bioinformatics companies create proprietary packages that are mere wrappers of open source academic software ?
And what about academic software that is sold ?
Most of them are funded by public agencies and tax money .
JF : In the USA in the 1970s the standard assumption was that publicly funded research should not be exploited commercially without a royalty coming back to the funding agency and the researcher .
Under the Reagan administration in the 1980s the view changed to being that the duty of the government was to subsidize the private sector by having their results used without compensation .
The very same administrators who , in the 1970s , checked to see that you had not secretly privatized the products of research were now assigned to make sure that these results did get used privately ( without compensation ) .
So it is hard to say what the legal status of research products such as software is .
( There is an older tradition that books written by faculty members at universities can result in royalties to the author , without the university getting any payment ) .
One problem with Open Source ( and with GNU licenses ) is that they permit and encourage commercial exploitation without compensating anyone .
They love this but I would rather see some of the money made getting back to the original software authors .
That is one reason we are n’t licensed under Open Source or under any of the GNU licenses .
I also have questions about whether these licenses permit the original author to say yea or nay to a proposed added feature — I would prefer to maintain that degree of control .
Your seminal work in 1981 , introduced the maximum likelihood method for the calculation of phylogenetic trees .
I do believe that a scientist ’s work has to be evaluated in its entirety , but that Journal of Molecular Evolution publication has influenced thousands of researchers for almost 26 years .
Would you consider it your most important publication ?
JF : The maximum likelihood method for phylogenies was introduced by Edwards and Cavalli - Sforza in 1964 , and for molecular sequences it was first done by the great statistician Jerzy Neyman in 1971 .
My 1981 paper did cite Neyman ( it did n’t credit Edwards and Cavalli - Sforza but at least I have cited their pioneering work on this many times before and since ) .
What I did that was new was to make it practical to do multi-species cases by introducing the pruning algorithm .
I also promoted and explained ML for years .
In the 1980s I gave many talks at universities .
I usually had to explain what likelihood was because the statistics courses that biologists took did n’t bother to teach them this .
I also wrote a number of review articles and made programs available to do ML .
Of my papers , the 1981 ML paper is the third most cited so far ( after the 1985 bootstrap paper , a paper in 1989 in Cladistics describing PHYLIP , and just ahead of my 1985 paper on phylogenetic comparative methods ) .
Basically they are all part of the process of promoting a statistical modelling approach to phylogenies , so it is hard to label one as more important .
Possibly my most important paper in the long run will be my 1978 paper on a model of macroevolution , which has had no citations in the past 22 years .
Sometime ago I attended a Hennig Society meeting , mainly because it was organized by the same institute where I was doing my PhD and because I was curious to meet the researchers behind some of the papers I was reading at the time .
Later when I was doing part of my work at the National Museum of Natural History , I attended a lecture by James Farris and what happened in that presentation made me coin ( for my own usage ) the term “ cult ” for cladists and cladistics .
What is your take on the usual “ cult ” - followers narrow - minded scientific views , where no method is better than them and sometimes even alignment software is demonized .
JF : Now you have some sense of what the atmosphere was like in morphological systematics in the early 1980s .
At that time most young systematists had joined the Hennig Society in a fit of enthusiasm for phylogenetic systematics , and work coming from any other intellectual source stood a good chance of being rejected out of hand as “ not being science ” .
My own guess is that this level of excessive zeal was a reaction to the inertia in systematics , as all the main professorships and curatorships then were in the hands of followers of Mayr and Simpson , the “ evolutionary systematists ” , who would not make their methods explicit .
The way to intimidate them was to up the temperature of the debate .
This attracted people with certain kinds of personalities .
You are n’t the first person to analogize the behavior of this group to an evangelical religion .
The Hennig Society types have always wanted to be seen as having a key to understanding everything phylogenetic , a key that everyone else lacked .
In the longer run , their behavior alienated their own base , and there were internal conflicts .
Most young systematists deserted the Hennig Society and started coming to the Evolution Meetings , where the discussion is fairly normal in tone , personal attacks are discouraged , and there is a lot of good - natured discussion among people with different views .
( I do n’t think the issue is whether or not one uses cladistic approaches to classification , as most of the reasonable young systematists at the Evolution meetings take that position ) .
What interests me is that the hard core of the Hennig Society has not mellowed or compromised .
I was expecting that they would , but they have not only remained as ferocious , but continued to hold views very distinct from everyone else ’s .
They have circled the wagons and are still holding out , though they must be getting a bit lonely by now .
Lately two big projects related to phylogenetics are getting some steam : the Tree of Life and the DNA barcoding .
I am more aware of the latter , due to the fact that I attended a presentation about it and through a friend that woks on the project .
I think that the goals of the
DNA barcoding are great for the field , wet - lab and theoretical scientists .
What is your opinion about this type of project that tries to address all subjects in a big umbrella ?
Would n’t the support of a larger number of small projects be better ?
JF : I do n’t really object to big projects as long as they do n’t suck up the money for everything else .
I was on the Genbank Advisory Committee some years ago , and I think the DNA and protein databases and Pubmed are examples of important and necessary large - scale projects .
So although I worry about money for small projects being soaked up by the big ones , I do n’t object to the latter in principle .
In Canada they used to have a system of giving out small amounts of money to everybody .
They are moving away from that now , but I do n’t think it should disappear entirely .
You have in Phylip ’s grant webpage a “ no thanks ” section listing everyone that refused supporting the program along the years .
In my opinion this is a bold statement and not very common in the scientific environment ( at least not online ) .
What would be your advice for the young scientist that is searching for financial support for his / her research ?
Should s/he be vocal when a strong application is rejected ?
JF : Generally , no .
I could do this because I felt confident enough in my reputation .
It was fun .
These granting agencies can say all sorts of fatuous things in their evaluations and they are never called on this .
A web page is editor - free publication so I had fun with that .
I had a hope that it might cause grant reviewers to think twice about getting themselves on that list by coming up with arbitrary and ill - thought - out objections .
( Based on our lab ’s experience since then , alas , this is n’t working ) .
But for a vulnerable young researcher I would say no , do n’t succumb to that temptation .
You may get a reputation as a sorehead .
I know a few young scientists who are quite combative about any negative evaluation , and they do get a reputation as someone you do n’t want to deal with .
However in these days of increasing difficulty in finding funds , it is tough for newcomers as the agencies are looking for any reason to say no .
Background :
This is the first of three anti-Semitic children ’s books published by Julius Streicher ’s Stürmer Publishing House .
They are among the nastier productions of the Third Reich .
Around 100,000 copies were printed , and the book was used in many schools .
The author , Elvira Bauer , was an 18 - year - old art student .
The title comes from a phrase by Martin Luther , whose anti-Jewish remarks the Nazis were happy to use .
For more information on the Stürmer and its editor , see my book on Julius Streicher .
For more information on Nazi material aimed at children , see an interesting article by Mary Mills titled “ Propaganda and Children during the Hitler Years . ”
I ’m using an anonymous translation from the University of South Florida library , to which I ’ve made some corrections .
The source : Elvira Bauer , Trau keinem Fuchs auf grüner Heid und keinem Jud auf seinem Eid ( Nuremberg : Stürmer Verlag , 1936 ) .
Trust No Fox on his Green Heath And No Jew on his Oath by Elvira Bauer The Cover The Father of the Jews is the Devil
At the creation of the world
The Lord God conceived the races :
Red Indians , Negroes , and Chinese ,
And Jew , too , the rotten crew .
And we were also on the scene :
We Germans midst this motley medley -
He gave them all a piece of earth
To work with the sweat of their brow .
But the Jew went on strike at once !
For the devil rode him from the first .
Cheating , not working , was his aim ;
For lying , he got first prize
In less than no time from the Father of Lies .
Then he wrote it in the Talmud .
By the banks of Pharaoh ’s Nile
Pharaoh saw this folk , and said :
“ I ’ll torment the lazy blighters ,
These people shall make bricks for me . ”
The Jew did this all wailing and whining ,
Never was there such cursing and swearing ,
With bent backs and over - big slippers .
Even today we see them shambling
With lip hanging down and great red noses
And looking daggers , flashing hate .
They owe Pharaoh thanks ,
Who trounced them soundly for their pranks .
The Jews soon had enough of that !
The Devil brought them to Germany .
Like thieves they stole into our land
Hoping to get the upper hand .
But the Germans — they stand foursquare .
Look , children , and the two compare ,
The German and the Jew .
Take a good look at the two
In the picture drawn for you .
A joke — you think it is only that ?
Easy to guess which is which , I say :
The German stands up , the Jew gives way .
The German is a proud young man ,
Able to work and able to fight .
Because he is a fine big chap ,
For danger does not care a rap ,
The Jew has always hated him !
Here is the Jew , as all can see ,
Biggest ruffian in our country ;
He thinks himself the greatest beau
And yet is the ugliest , you know !
The Eternal Jew
From the start the Jew has been
A murderer , said Jesus Christ .
And as Our Lord died on the cross
God the Father knew no other race
To torment His Son to death ,
He chose the Jews for this .
That is why the Jews now claim
To be the chosen people .
When Christ the burden of the cross
Too heavy found ,
He sought to rest
One moment ‘ gainst a door .
But from the house a Jew came out
Cursed Him and upbraided Him ,
Telling
Him to move on further .
For ‘ twas a Jew that owned that house .
It was the Jew Ahasuerus .............
Since then that Jew has borne a curse .
Two thousand years he has sought rest ,
That wretched Jew Ahasuerus ,
The curse has passed to all his race ,
Restless he wanders far and wide ,
One land to another .
He has no home to call his own ,
The alien Jew , that scurvy knave .
His nomad soul finds nowhere rest ,
Everywhere he ’s just a pest .
Four centuries have come and gone ,
Ahasuerus crops up everywhere
Now in Hamburg , next Berlin ,
In Denmark and in Danzig too .
Dresden , Paris have seen that Jew .
Believe me , children , it is quite clear ,
Ahasuerus haunts us still
Under the skin of every Jew .
Now , children , keep a good look out
Whenever you see a Jew about .
The Jew creeps round , a regular fox ,
Keep your eyes open , or you ’ll be on the rocks .
Jewish Names
So that the Jew you sha n’t recognize
His name turns up in other guise .
Herr Nathan calls himself Jonathan ,
While Levin becomes Levinson .
Abraham loses two of his “ a’s ’
And now his name reads simply Brahm --
Others are even more cunning still !
They drop their foreign names at once
And you will find high - sounding names ,
Bluehdorn and Siegenreich ,
And Veilchenblau and Loewenstein
And Rosenstolz and Rosenhayn
And Lindenstein and Blumenfeld .
The Jew goes even further still --
He chooses names of animals .
He calls himself Katz , Hirsch or Strauss .
Others there are , who dub themselves
Fischbein , Herz , and Mond and Stern ,
And Dreifuss , Block and Fels and Stein
And Schloss and Grossmann and Klein , too .
More modest still are those Jews
Who call themselves by the name of Blum .
The Rabbi , he is very wise :
He calls himself Markus Ehrenpreis !
And a Baron named Rothschild
Even calls his daughter Kriemhild .
Once a Jew , always a Jew
Jew Itzig had a brainwave :
“ I know what , I ’ll be baptized . ”
These stupid folk will surely say :
“ Look , there goes a Christian man . ”
Itzig Iphraim one fine day
Called on the local village priest ,
Asked to be sprinkled from the font .
The priest was all agog to please him .
“ Hear my words , Jew Iphraim , ” he said ,
“ Thee I baptize : Gotthilf Joachim
Fridericus Christian Itzig .
Now hear what I say :
Once a Jew , now a Christian you are ,
And obedience is required of you .
Promise never to forget
To eat no meat on Friday ,
For that would be a sin
Hardly to be pardoned ! ”
When next Friday he came to see
Our Itzig in great glee
Was making short work of a goose .
“ Itzig , my man , what does that mean ? ”
Cries reverend father in furious spleen .
“ You ought to know that on your plate
There should be no meat today !
Strict penance you must pay for this ! ”
The sinner said : “ ei waich ei waich !
Why make such trouble all at once ?
What you upon my plate do see ,
It is no goose :
It ’s just a fish !
I bought myself a goosie - gander ,
Bethought myself to christen it ! ”
On this fried morsel I pronounced :
“ You were a goose , now you are a fish ! ”
Now children , on the other page
The Jew you ’ll see .
Can you believe
Since baptism he ’s really changed 7
Five pails of water o’er his head
Makes no changes in his heart .
One thing always keep in view ,
Once a Jew , always a Jew !!
The Cattle Jew
Most revolting in a Jew
Is his peculiar greed for gold .
Always with him is first in mind
By hook or crook a deal to find .
There was once a Jew called Kohn
With 100,000 talers all his own
From cutting offers to the bone .
Greed of gold had sullied his soul .
Came a farmer in greatest need ,
Cows and pigs he offered the Jew
For 120 Gulden new
To free himself from binding debt .
The Jew , however , was not ashamed
To pay him half the price he named .
Away went cattle with grinning Jew ,
The farmer was heartbroken , too .
Misfortune dogs him more and more ;
In Jewish hands there ’s death in store .
So listen , you people , wherever you are :
“ Do n’t trust a fox on the greensward
And never a Jew on his plighted word ! ”
The Sabbath
Jew Ikey comes on Friday home .
A perfect gentleman he seems ;
A week of swindling stupid “ goys ”
And telling lies bring Sabbath joys .
He rattles with his money bag ,
Cries : “ Becky , woman , look at that ! ”
Then he takes his roll of prayer
And then he mumbles to and fro
Yiddish praises to Jehovah .
( Oh boy !
What fun ! )
Along he goes to water tap
For Sabbath joys demand a wash .
But there he does not scrape too hard ;
The rest can stay for years and years .
Now see him when the Sabbath comes ,
Resplendant in a tall top -hat !
Velvet and silk adorn her form ,
For that is quite her special taste !
On Sabbath he wo n’t move a finger ;
The stupid “ goy ” does all the work !
And even to put out the light
He calls the “ goy ” to do the job .
Did you know that , my dear friends ?
Folks , look at this rare twister , too .
It is old Aaron Kahn , the Jew .
Owner of a store is he .
And all his precious merchandise
Is sold by means of rotten lies .
Just rubbish worked off on dumb goys .
Aaron Kahn has a purse quite full .
He ’s emptied that of many a fool .
These suckers come most willingly
To spend their money at his store .
But when a hungry man appears
And begs for bread with melting tears ,
Look at the picture over there
And see a Jewish sould laid bare .
So listen folks , wherever you are :
“ Do n’t trust a fox on the greensward ,
And never a Jew on his plighted word ! ”
Here Isaac Blumenfeld we see ;
As butcher he makes good money .
But take a closer look , look closely ,
A rogue this Yid is mostly .
Isaac sells you meat ‘ Tis said ,
But he gives you filth instead .
See that piece upon the floor ,
Another the cat has in its paw .
The Jewish butcher never fails ;
Dirty meat weighs more in the scales .
And — please just keep this in your mind
He does not eat it , nor his kind .
Only Jews , to their dire shame ,
Could play you such a dirty game !
So listen , you folk , wherever you are :
“ Do n’t trust a fox on the greensward ,
And never a Jew on his plighted word ! ”
The Jewish Lawyer
Just as children have their fights ,
Grown-ups have their quarrels , too .
Parents judge in children ’s squabbles ,
Judges settle grown - ups ’ disputes .
A good lawyer must before the judge
Lay bare all the details of the case
When the trial once begins .
The lawyer gets his money .
So it is in the whole wide world ...
Our farmer Michael goes to town .
He ’s got a date with the sharp attorney .
See him in the sketch I ’ve drawn ,
With handsome wife in fine attire .
Next them the lawyer may be seen ,
He ’s looking very poor and mean .
Just now his trade is very slack ,
From farmer Michael he expects a whack !
To the farmer he makes a plea :
“ Dear rich Michael be kind to me .
Could n’t you bring me butter , wine ,
Flour and eggs ?
That would be fine !
Just give me time with this tricky suit ;
We ’ll win the case and money to boot ! ”
Here ’s good prospect , I surmise ,
But all he said was a pack of lies .
The peasant folk from Dummelsbrumm
Believe it all : they are so dumb !
They bring him every kind of food .
And , Boy !
that lawyer ’s feeling good .
The end is sad to this long tale :
The farmer had to go to court ,
So long the Jewish lawyer fought ,
Primed with the farmers butter and eggs .
Now round and plump and plump and round ,
Jew lawyer weighs 240 pound .
Only when there was nothing left
Did , strangely enough , the trial end .
The farmer , true , had won the case ;
Now he wonders with long face
Who his goods and money took .
They were stolen all by the Jewish crook .
The Servant Girl
Rosy leaves the countryside .
Up to town , there to bide :
She wants to earn a living there .
And so she buys a newspaper ;
Looking its advertising through .
She finds a post with Katz , the Jew .
Three bouncing daughters has this Yid ;
His wife , Oh My ! is sure no kid .
All four are idle lazybones ,
Doing nothing all day long .
“ So Rosy cleans and sweeps and cooks ,
For such is shame and not a blessing , ”
Says Jewish master , “ in our station . ”
German girls from the country ,
He takes and treats them properly
As understood in Jewish fancy .
Look at Rosy from the country !
Working hard like any slavey .
Yet they drive her harder still :
She lives a live , a dog would kill .
Her plight is worse than many a beast ;
The Jew should pay her well , at least .
“ To the Christian you may give
Carrion meat , that he may live .
But you yourself must ne ’er forget ,
That by a Jew it ’s never ate .
For Holy is the Jew .
The Talmud says it , too . ”
What a creature is the Jew .
Not even his own women he likes .
To share himself a German wife
He thinks just cute .
You bet your life !
Look at Jew and girl right here :
‘ Tis sure he ca n’t be thought her peer !
Compare him with this German Frau .
He cuts a pitiable figure now !
I would the Jew had sense to own
He ’d best leave German girls alone .
Try his own “ kalle ” instead .
The father says to his daughter dear :
“ You cause me great distress , I fear !
The blood of all of us is pure ,
But for the sake of selfish gain
For fine dresses and money , too ,
You ’re always with Sol Rosenfeld , the Jew ,
Thinking maybe to become his wife !
This means no good .
I wo n’t have it , d’ye hear ?
A dachshund is never put between the shafts
Of a wagon where a cow belongs !
That ’s just impossible , I say .
So mark my words for once and all :
‘ Do n’t trust a fox on the greensward
And never a Jew on his plighted word ! ’ ”
The Jewish Doctor
A Jew once lay at point of death
So sent at once for Dr. Wehdir ( or “ woe to thee ” )
To save his life at once ,
For death was his great dread .
So when the Jewish doctor comes ,
He cries : “ Death lies in wait for me !
Please , oh please , drive him away ;
Prescribed the proper medicine ! ”
Since none but he this secret knows ,
Doctor Wehdir , full of spunk ,
Runs to a German hospital
And tries it out on patients there .
When three have died of its effects ,
The health of many more been ruined ,
No Jew risks taking it !—
For fear ’ twould mean his death —
Doctor Wehdir wo n’t despair
Till the bane ’s on others tried .
When the stuff all tests has passed
Safely , to the Jew it ’s given at last .
Thus Dr. Wehdir makes sure as well
That one more Jew is saved from Hell .
If on “ goys ” twas tried at first
For Christians that is none the worse .
This is the moral of this story true :
Never trust Jewish Doctors , You !
“ The Christian ( Akum ) is really like a dog ,
So it ’s our job to do him in .
Love only Jews . ”
Even so is it written in the Book of Laws .
Other tricks performs the Jew ,
Inspired by his Satanic blood .
Urged on by just this meanness .
He ’s fooled the lot of us Germans ,
But he sha n’t do that any more .
A valiant man stood up for us ,
Hailing from Germany ’s heart , Franconia .
To him we owe our deepest thanks
That German stock remains so sound .
The Jews in turn he ’s taught a lesson ,
The value of a healthy folk .
He ’s let them feel the German spirit
Twixt Jew and us he ’s shown the difference .
That is Streicher !!
He ’s had the “ Stuermer ” printed ;
That ’s why all Jews detest our Streicher .
My , do n’t they make an uproar !
To Streicher it is all the same .
He ’s fought his way for many a year .
All round the world he is renowned .
The newspaper in America ,
It writes of him from time to time .
The Jewish hate and Jewish pest
Is shouted abroad both East and West ,
Throughout the whole wide world .
It ’s no wonder the Jews start trembling !
“ We do not buy from Jewish shops ! ”
Says the mother to the child .
“ ‘ Tis only German goods we buy ;
Remember that , my darling . ”
German women should only buy
What ’s been made by German hands ,
By German industry and strength .
That ’s why we only go
To those stores with German goods ,
Here also we save more ,
For their wares are cheap and good .
From Jews you get bad value !
Hence take note of mother ’s words ,
Be sure you never buy from Jews .
It ’s going to be fine in the schools at last ,
For all the Jews must leave .
For big and small it ’s all alike .
Anger and rage do not avail
Nor utmost Jewish whine nor wail .
Away with all the Jewish breed .
‘ Tis the German teacher we desire .
Now he leads the way to cleverness ,
Wanders and plays with us , but yet
Keeps us children in good order .
He makes jokes with us and laughs
So going to school is quite a joy .
In our far - flung Fatherland
Many a bit of earth is famous
For its beauty and its strength
The wealth of health bestows .
That ’s why it ’s so frequented
By people from far and near .
As on this picture may be seen
A notice - board is erected here ,
Telling for all the world to know
Here Jews are not wanted .
The German is the owner here ,
So , friend Yid , best disappear !
The Führer ’s Youth
The boys who are true Germans
To Hitler ’s Youth belong .
They want to live for their Führer ,
Their eyes are fixed on the future .
Bigger and stronger they have become .
The German heritage is theirs .
The great and sacred Fatherland
Stands today as it ever stood .
From this picture may be seen ,
Hitler Youth in splendid mien ,
From smallest to the biggest boy .
All are husky , tough , and strong .
They love their German Führer
And God in Heaven they fear .
But the Jews they must despise !
They ’re not like these boys ,
So Jews must just give way !
In far - off South is the country
Which cradled Jewish ancestry .
Let them go back there with wife and child
As quickly as they came ! —
What a disgusting picture
Is shown by these Jews , so dirty and wild :
Abraham , Solomon ,
Blumenfeld , Levinson ,
Rebecca with little Jonathan ,
Then Simon and also Aaron Kahn .
How they roll their eyes
As they march along ...................
( On the signpost : “ One - way road .
Hurry , Hurry .
The Jews are our misfortune . ” )

Researchers announced last week that they had slowed down faint pulses of laser light and retrieved an image from that light after speeding it back up .
In principle such " slow - light " technology might be used to build a kind of traffic stop for light signals , called an optical buffer , that would be cheaper , more powerful and faster than converting light beams into electrical signals .
That is why the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , an arm of the Department of Defense , asked a group at the University of Rochester to explore the technology , says group leader , quantum optics researcher John Howell .
So naturally Howell was bemused that some media outlets focused in on one aspect of the report : that an entire image was somehow produced from a single photon , the smallest unit of light .
" A lot of people are getting excited about the single photon , " he says .
A statement from the University of Rochester said that Howell 's team made their image using a single pulse of light .
To those familiar with the rudiments of quantum physics , the claim was , well , odd , to say the least .
" The people that are more aware of this are wondering how we 're measuring an image from a photon — and we 're not , " Howell says .
So what 's the story ?
Consider the famous double - slit experiment , in which individual photons are beamed through a pair of adjacent gaps ( slits ) in a screen .
As long as researchers do not try to determine which of the two slits each photon is passing through , light shined through the screen will create a so - called diffraction pattern of alternating bright and dark spots .
The double - slit experiment demonstrates that a photon can in some sense " feel " both slits , just like a wave passing through both at once .
Like a wave , each individual photon propagates away from the screen spread out and carrying the whole diffraction pattern — but that does not mean each photon creates a weak image of the whole diffraction pattern when it hits the far wall .
Instead , each photon lands in just one spot , and many photons together create the pattern .
The new technique worked similarly .
The group prepared weak pulses of light that on average contained less than one photon .
( That 's possible because the pulses were each in a superposition , or mixture of quantum states ; some pulses did not contain any photons and others contained one photon , Howell says . )
The researchers shined the pulses through a stencil of the initials " UR " and into a four - inch - long cavity filled with hot cesium vapor , which acted as a drag on the light , slowing it down .
After emerging from this cavity , the pulses struck a four - square - millimeter region in a single pinpoint location .
Each pulse struck the region somewhere in the " UR " shape carved out of the light pulses by the stencil .
But generating the whole image required up to 100 million pulses , in part because a single photon detector had to scan back and forth over the whole detection region , as described in the January 26 edition of Physical Review Letters .
One can imagine the photons as bulletlike cylinders fired at the target , Howell says , only each cylinder is two - to - three millimeters in diameter and up to a meter long .
As the cylinders pass through the stencil , the parts that hit the opaque material are absorbed and no longer represent locations at which the photon can potentially be measured .
" It 's just like when you put Play - Doh through one of those stencils , " Howell says .
Like the Play - Doh , each pulse that passes through the stencil does carry the whole " UR " shape , but , as with the two - slit diffraction pattern , one photon does not produce the whole image on being detected .
Howell says the experiment is the first demonstration that optical buffering , or delaying of light , can reliably transmit two - dimensional information — in this case an image .
The kind of information sent down optical fibers is normally encoded along the length of the pulse , he says .
For now , optical buffering is a " hammer without a nail , " meaning its exact applications are unclear , Howell says .
But he adds , " I 'm pretty excited about it .
I 'm looking for something to hit on really hard . "

PlusNet has taken the difficult decision to close its webmail platform after an investigation related to this weeks e-mail theft and SPAM problem ( here ) revealed serious security flaws :
The fact these vulnerabilities have not been exploited suggest that they are n't related to the recent theft of customers e-mails and subsequent SPAMMING .
More details on that particular investigation are due tomorrow .
Meanwhile the current webmail platform may have to be replaced with something different , although PlusNet has yet to fully clarify its intentions .
The European Council of Skeptical Organisations ( ECSO ) presents its 13th bi-annual congress bringing together delegates from across Europe to discuss ideas of particular interest to skeptics .
This year ’s conference , hosted by the Irish Skeptics Society in Dublin , Ireland , is on the theme of “ The Assault on Science : constructing a response . ”
Richard Dawkins ’
The God Delusion has been a runaway bestseller and garnered much attention for his passionate plea for atheists to stand up and be heard .
But there is so much more in that book about religion that has drawn considerably less attention , most notably his theory on the evolutionary origins and development of religion , which is a technical field of study among a small band of scientists , one of whom , evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson , has penned the following analysis of Dawkins ’ theory of religion , which he feels is wide of the mark based on the evidence .
Wilson is the author of Unto Others : The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior , Darwin ’s Cathedral : Evolution , Religion , and the Nature of Society , and his latest book , Evolution for Everyone : How Darwin ’s Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives .
Beyond Demonic Memes
Why Richard Dawkins is Wrong About Religion
by David Sloan Wilson
Richard Dawkins and I share much in common .
We are both biologists by training who have written widely about evolutionary theory .
We share an interest in culture as an evolutionary process in its own right .
We are both atheists in our personal convictions who have written books on religion .
In Darwin ’s Cathedral I attempted to contribute to the relatively new field of evolutionary religious studies .
When Dawkins ’
The God Delusion was published I naturally assumed that he was basing his critique of religion on the scientific study of religion from an evolutionary perspective .
I regret to report otherwise .
He has not done any original work on the subject and he has not fairly represented the work of his colleagues .
Hence this critique of The God Delusion and the larger issues at stake .
Where We Agree and Where We Part Company
In The God Delusion Dawkins makes it clear that he loathes religion for its intolerance , blind faith , cruelty , extremism , abuse , and prejudice .
He attributes these problems to religion and thinks that the world would be a better place without it .
Given recent events in the Middle East and even here in America , it is understandable why he might draw such a conclusion , but the question is :
What ’s evolution got to do with it ?
Dawkins and I agree that evolutionary theory provides a powerful framework for studying religion , and we even agree on some of the details , so it is important to pinpoint exactly where we part company .
Evolutionists employ a number of hypotheses to study any trait , even something as mundane as the spots on a guppy .
Is it an adaptation that evolved by natural selection ?
If so , did it evolve by benefiting whole groups , compared to other groups , or individuals compared to other individuals within groups ?
With cultural evolution there is a third possibility .
Since cultural traits pass from person to person , they bear an intriguing resemblance to disease organisms .
Perhaps they evolve to enhance their own transmission without benefiting human individuals or groups .
If the trait is not an adaptation , then it can nevertheless persist in the population for a variety of reasons .
Perhaps it was adaptive in the past but not the present , such as our eating habits , which make sense in the food - scarce environment of our ancestors but not with a McDonald ’s on every corner .
Perhaps the trait is a byproduct of another adaptation .
For example , moths use celestial light sources to orient their flight ( an adaptation ) , but this causes them to spiral toward earthly light sources such as a streetlamp or a flame ( a costly byproduct ) , as Dawkins so beautifully recounts in The God Delusion .
Finally , the trait might be selectively neutral and persist in the population by genetic or cultural drift .
Dawkins and I agree that these major hypotheses provide an excellent framework for organizing the study of religion , which by itself is an important achievement .
We also agree that the hypotheses are not mutually exclusive .
Evolution is a messy , complicated process , like the creation of laws and sausages , and all of the major hypotheses might be relevant to some degree .
Nevertheless , real progress requires determining which hypotheses are most important for the evolution of particular traits .
The spots on a guppy might seem parochial , but they are famous among biologists as a case study of evolutionary analysis .
They can be explained primarily as adaptations in response to two powerful selective forces : predators remove the most conspicuous males from the population , whereas female guppies mate with the most conspicuous males .
The interaction between these two selection pressures explains an impressive amount of detail about guppy spots — why males have them and females do n’t , why males are more colorful in habitats without predators , and even why the spots are primarily red when the predators are crustaceans ( whose visual system is blind to the color red ) , as opposed to fish ( whose visual system is sensitive to the color red ) .
Guppy spots could have been selectively neutral or a byproduct of some other trait , but that ’s not the way the facts fell .
Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould : Strange Bedfellows
The late Harvard evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould famously criticized his colleagues for seeing adaptations where they do n’t exist .
His metaphor for a byproduct was the spandrel , the triangular space that inevitably results when arches are placed next to each other .
Arches have a function but spandrels do not , even though they can acquire a secondary function , such as providing a decorative space .
Gould accused his colleagues of inventing “ just - so stories ” about traits as adaptations , without good proof , and being blind to the possibility of byproducts and other non-adaptive outcomes of evolution .
Gould had a point , but he failed to give equal time to the opposite problem of failing to see adaptations where they do exist .
Suppose that you are a biologist who becomes interested in explaining the bump on the nose of a certain species of shark .
Perhaps it is just a byproduct of the way that shark noses develop , as Gould speculated for the human chin .
Perhaps it is a callous that forms when the sharks root around in the sand .
If so , then it would be an adaptation but not a very complicated one .
Perhaps it is a wart , formed by a virus .
If so , then it might be an adaptation for the virus but not the shark .
Or perhaps it is an organ for detecting the weak electrical signals of prey hidden in the sand .
If so , then it would be a complex adaptation .
Few experiences are more thrilling for a biologist than to discover a complex adaptation .
Myriad details that previously defied explanation become interpretable as an interlocking system with a purpose .
Non-adaptive traits can also be complex , but the functional nature of a complex adaptation guides its analysis from beginning to end .
Failing to recognize complex adaptations when they exist is as big a mistake as seeing them where they do n’t exist .
Only hard empirical work — something equivalent to the hundreds of person - years spent studying guppy spots from an evolutionary perspective — can settle the issue .
Dawkins argued on behalf of adaptationism in his debates with Gould and would probably agree with everything I have said so far .
For religion , however , he argues primarily on behalf of non-adaptation .
As he sees it , people are attracted to religion the way that moths are attracted to flames .
Perhaps religious impulses were adapted to the tiny social groups of our ancestral past , but not the mega - societies of the present .
If current religious beliefs are adaptive at all , it is only for the beliefs themselves as cultural parasites on their human hosts , like the demons of old that were thought to possess people .
That is why Dawkins calls God a delusion .
The least likely possibility for Dawkins is the group - level adaptation hypothesis .
Religions are emphatically not elaborate systems of beliefs and practices that define , motivate , coordinate and police groups of people for their own good .
For the Good of the Group ?
To understand Dawkins ’ skepticism about the group - level benefits of religion , it is necessary to trace the history of “ for the good of the group ” thinking in evolutionary theory .
Groups can be adaptive only if their members perform services for each other , yet these services are often vulnerable to exploitation by more self - serving individuals within the same group .
Fortunately , groups of individuals who practice mutual aid can out - compete groups whose members do not .
According to this reasoning , traits that are “ for the good of the group ” require a process of between - group selection to evolve and tend to be undermined by selection within groups .
Darwin was the first person to reason this way about the evolution of human morality and self - sacrificial traits in other animals .
Unfortunately , his insight was not shared by many biologists during the first half of the 20th century , who uncritically assumed that adaptations evolve at all levels of the biological hierarchy — for the good of the individual , group , species , or ecosystem — without requiring a corresponding process of natural selection at each level .
When the need for group selection was acknowledged , it was often assumed that between - group selection easily prevailed against within - group selection .
This can be called The Age of Naïve Groupism , and it ended during the 1960s and 1970s , thanks largely to two books : George C. Williams ’ 1966 Adaptation and Natural Selection and Richard Dawkins ’ 1976 The Selfish Gene .
In Adaptation and Natural Selection , Williams affirmed the logic of multi- level selection but then added an empirical claim :
Even though between - group selection is theoretically possible , in the real world it is invariably trumped by within - group selection .
Virtually all adaptations evolve at the individual level and even examples of apparent altruism must be explained in terms of self - interest .
It was this empirical claim that ended The Age of Naïve Groupism and initiated what can be called The Age of Individualism , which lasted for the rest of the 20th century and in some respects is still with us .
Another theme developed by Williams was the concept of the gene as the fundamental unit of selection .
In sexually reproducing species , an individual is a unique collection of genes that will never occur again .
Individuals therefore lack the permanence to be acted upon by natural selection over multiple generations .
According to Williams , genes are the fundamental unit of natural selection because they have the permanence that individuals ( much less groups ) lack .
In many respects , and by his own account , Williams was interpreting ideas for a broader audience that began with Darwin and were refined by theoretical biologists such as Sewall Wright , Ronald Fisher , and J.B.S. Haldane .
The concept of the gene as the fundamental unit of selection , for example , is identical to the concept of average effects in population genetics theory , which averages the fitness of alternative genes across all of the individual genotypes and environmental contexts experienced by the genes .
A decade later , Dawkins played the role of interpreter for an even broader audience .
Average effects became selfish genes and individuals became lumbering robots controlled by their genes .
Group selection became a pariah concept , taught only as an example of how not to think .
As one eminent evolutionist advised a student in the 1980s , “ There are three ideas that you do not invoke in biology : Lamarkism , the phlogistron theory , and group selection . ”
Scientific Dogmatism
In retrospect , it is hard to fathom the zeal with which evolutionists such as Williams and Dawkins rejected group selection and developed a view of evolution as based entirely on self - interest .
Williams ended Adaptation and Natural Selection with the phrase “ I believe that it is the light and the way . ”
Here is how Dawkins recounts the period in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype :
The intervening years since Darwin have seen an astonishing retreat from his individual - centered stand , a lapse into sloppily unconscious group - selectionism …
We painfully struggled back , harassed by sniping from a Jesuitically sophisticated and dedicated neo - group - selectionist rearguard , until we finally regained Darwin ’s ground , the position that I am characterizing by the label ‘ the selfish organism … ”
This passage has all the earmarks of fundamentalist rhetoric , including appropriating the deity ( Darwin ) for one ’s own cause .
Never mind that Darwin was the first group selectionist .
Moreover , unlike The Selfish Gene , The Extended Phenotype was written by Dawkins for his scientific peers , not for a popular audience !
In reality , the case against group selection began to unravel almost immediately after the publication of Adaptation and Natural Selection , although it was difficult to tell , given the repressive social climate .
In the first place , calling genes “ replicators ” and “ the fundamental unit of selection ” is no argument at all against group selection .
The question has always been whether genes can evolve by virtue of benefiting whole groups and despite being selectively disadvantageous within groups .
When this happens , the gene favored by between - group selection replaces the gene favored by within - group selection in the total population .
In the parlance of population genetics theory , it has the highest average effect .
Re-labeling the gene selfish , just because it evolves , contributes nothing .
The “ gene ’s eye view ” of evolution can be insightful in some respects , but as an argument against group selection it is one of the greatest cases of comparing apples with oranges in the annals of evolutionary thought .
The same goes for the concept of extended phenotypes , which notes that genes have effects that extend beyond the bodies of individual organisms .
Examples of extended phenotypes include a bird ’s nest or a beaver ’s dam .
But there is a difference between these two examples ; the nest benefits only the individual builder , whereas the dam benefits all of the beavers in the pond , including those who do n’t contribute to building the dam .
The problem of within - group selection is present in the dam example and the concept of extended phenotypes does nothing to solve it .
More apples and oranges .
The Revival of Group Selection
Much has happened in the four decades following the rejection of group selection in the 1960s .
Naïve groupism is still a mistake that needs to be avoided , but between - group selection can no longer be categorically rejected .
Claims for group selection must be evaluated on a case - by - case basis , along with the other major evolutionary hypotheses .
Demonstrations of group selection appear regularly in the top scientific journals .
As one example reported in the July 6 , 2006 issue of Nature , a group of microbiologists headed by Benjamin Kerr cultured bacteria ( E. coli ) and their viral predator ( phage ) in 96 - well plates , which are commonly used for automated chemical analysis .
Each well was an isolated group of predators and their prey .
Within each well , natural selection favored the most rapacious viral strains , but these strains tended to drive their prey , and therefore themselves extinct .
More prudent viral strains were vulnerable to replacement by the rapacious strains within each well , but as groups they persisted longer and were more likely to colonize other wells .
Migration between wells was accomplished by robotically controlled pipettes .
Biologically plausible migration rates enabled the prudent viral strains to persist in the total population , despite their selective disadvantage within groups .
As a second example reported in the December 8 , 2006 issue of Science , economist Samuel Bowles estimated that between - group selection was strong enough to promote the genetic evolution of altruism in our own species , exactly as envisioned by Darwin .
These and many other examples , summarized by Edward O. Wilson and myself in a forthcoming review article , are ignored entirely by Dawkins , who continues to recite his mantra that the selective disadvantage of altruism within groups poses an insuperable problem for between - group selection .
Individuals as Groups
Not only can group selection be a significant evolutionary force , it can sometimes even be the dominating evolutionary force .
One of the most important advances in evolutionary biology is a concept called major transitions .
It turns out that evolution takes place not only by small mutational change , but also by social groups and multi-species communities becoming so integrated that they become higher - level organisms in their own right .
The cell biologist Lynn Margulis proposed this concept in the 1970s to explain the evolution of nucleated cells as symbiotic communities of bacterial cells .
The concept was then generalized to explain other major transitions , from the origin of life as communities of cooperating molecular reactions , to multi-cellular organisms and social insect colonies .
In each case , the balance between levels of selection is not fixed but can itself evolve .
A major transition occurs when selection within groups is suppressed , making it difficult for selfish elements to evolve at the expense of other members of their own groups .
Selection among groups becomes a dominating evolutionary force , turning the groups into super - organisms .
Ironically , during the Age of Individualism it became taboo to think about groups as organisms , but now it turns out that organisms are literally the groups of past ages .
Dawkins fully accepts the concept of major transitions , but he pretends that it does n’t require a revision in his ideas about group selection .
Most important , he does n’t pose the question that is most relevant to the study of religion :
Is it possible that human genetic and cultural evolution represents the newest example of a major transition , converting human groups into the equivalent of bodies and beehives ?
Selfish Memes and Other Theories of Cultural Evolution
Dawkins ’ third claim to fame , in addition to selfish genes and extended phenotypes , was to coin the term “ meme ” to think about cultural evolution .
In its most general usage , the word “ meme ” becomes newspeak for “ culture ” without adding anything new .
More specific usages suggest a variety of interesting possibilities ; that culture can be broken into atomistic bits like genes , that these bits are somehow represented inside the head , and especially that they can evolve to be organisms in their own right , often spreading at the expense of their human hosts , like the demons of old .
As with religion , Dawkins has not conducted empirical research on cultural evolution , preferring to play the role of Mycroft Holmes , who sat in his armchair and let his younger brother Sherlock do the legwork .
Two evolutionary Sherlocks of culture are Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd , authors of the 2005 book Not By Genes Alone : How Culture Transformed Human Evolution .
One of the sleights of hand performed by Dawkins in The God Delusion , which takes a practiced eye to detect , is to first dismiss group selection and then to respectfully cite the work of Richerson and Boyd without mentioning that their theory of cultural evolution is all about group selection .
Consider genetic evolution by itself .
When a new mutation arises , the total population consists of one group with a single mutant and many groups with no mutants .
There is not much variation among groups in this scenario for group selection to act upon .
Now imagine a species that has the ability to socially transmit information .
A new cultural mutation can rapidly spread to everyone in the same group , resulting in one group that is very different from the other groups in the total population .
This is one way that culture can radically shift the balance between levels of selection in favor of group selection .
Add to this the ability to monitor the behavior of others , communicate social transgressions through gossip , and easily punish or exclude transgressors at low cost to the punishers , and it becomes clear that human evolution represents a whole new ball game as far as group selection is concerned .
In this context , the human major transition probably began early in the evolution of our lineage , resulting in a genetically evolved psychological architecture that enables us to spontaneously cooperate in small face - to - face groups .
As the great social theorist Alexis de Tocqueville commented long ago in Democracy in America , “ the village or township is the only association which is so perfectly natural that , wherever a number of men are collected , it seems to constitute itself . ”
As the primate equivalent of a beehive or an ant colony , our lineage was able to eliminate less groupish competitors .
The ability to acquire and socially transmit new behaviors enabled our ancestors to spread over the globe , occupying hundreds of ecological niches .
Then the invention of agriculture enabled group sizes to increase by many orders of magnitude , but only through the cultural evolution of mechanisms that enable groups to hang together at such a large scale .
Defining , motivating , coordinating , and policing groups is not easy at any scale .
It requires an elaborate system of proximate mechanisms , something akin to the physiological mechanisms of an individual organism .
Might the elements of religion be part of the “ social physiology ” of the human group organism ?
Other than briefly acknowledging the abstract possibility that memes can form “ memeplexes , ” this possibility does not appear in Dawkins ’ analysis .
Bring on the Legwork
It is absurd , in retrospect , that evolutionists have spent much more time evaluating the major evolutionary hypotheses for guppy spots than for the elements of religion .
This situation is beginning to remedy itself as scholars and scientists from all backgrounds begin to adopt the evolutionary perspective in their study of religion .
An example from my own research will show how empirical legwork can take us beyond armchair theorizing .
Here is Dawkins on the subject of whether religion relieves or induces stress in the mind of the religious believer :
Is religion a placebo that prolongs life by reducing stress ?
Possibly , although the theory must run the gauntlet of skeptics who point out the many circumstances in which religion causes rather than relieves stress …
The American comedian Cathy Ladman observes that “ All religions are the same : religion is basically guilt , with different holidays . ”
One of my projects is a collaboration with the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ( pronounced shick - sent - me - hi ) , who is best known among general readers for his books on peak psychological experience , such as Flow and The Evolving Self .
Csikszentmihalyi pioneered the Experience Sampling Method ( ESM ) which involves signaling people at random times during the day , prompting them to record their external and internal experience — where they are , who they are with , what they are doing , and what they are thinking and feeling on a checklist of numerical scales .
The ESM is like an invisible observer , following people around as they go about their daily lives .
It is as close as psychological research gets to the careful field studies that evolutionary biologists are accustomed to performing on non-human species , which is why I teamed up with Csikszentmihalyi to analyze some of his past studies from an evolutionary perspective .
These studies were performed on such a massive scale and with so much background information that we can compare the psychological experience of religious believers vs. nonbelievers on a moment - by - moment basis .
We can even compare members of conservative vs. liberal protestant denominations , when they are alone vs. in the company of other people .
On average , religious believers are more prosocial than non-believers , feel better about themselves , use their time more constructively , and engage in long - term planning rather than gratifying their impulsive desires .
On a moment - by - moment basis , they report being more happy , active , sociable , involved and excited .
Some of these differences remain even when religious and non-religious believers are matched for their degree of prosociality .
More fine - grained comparisons reveal fascinating differences between liberal vs. conservative protestant denominations , with more anxiety among the liberals and conservatives feeling better in the company of others than when alone .
Religions are diverse , in the same way that species in ecosystems are diverse .
Rather than issuing monolithic statements about religion , evolutionists need to explain religious diversity in the same way that they explain biological diversity .
These results raise as many questions as they answer .
We did not evolve to feel good but rather to survive and reproduce .
Perhaps religious believers are happily unaware of the problems that nonbelievers are anxiously trying to solve .
As a more subtle point , people pass back and forth between the categories of “ nonbeliever ” and “ believer ” as they lose and regain faith .
Perhaps some nonbelievers are psychologically impaired because they are the recent casualties of religious belief .
Only more scientific legwork can resolve these issues , but one thing is sure : Dawkins ’ armchair speculation about the guilt - inducing effects of religion does n’t even get him to first base .
Natural Historians of Religion
Hypothesis testing does not always require quantification and the other trappings of modern science .
Darwin established his entire theory on the basis of descriptive information carefully gathered by the naturalists of his day , most of whom thought that they were studying the hand of God .
This kind of information exists in abundance for religions around the world and throughout history , which should be regarded as a fossil record of cultural evolution so detailed that it puts the biological fossil record to shame .
It should be possible to use this information to evaluate the major evolutionary hypotheses , which after all represent radically different conceptions of religion .
Engineering principles dictate that a religion designed to benefit the whole group will be different from one designed to benefit some individuals ( presumably the leaders ) at the expense of others within the same group , which in turn will be different from a cultural disease organism designed to benefit itself at the expense of both individuals and groups , which in turn will be different from a religion for which the term “ design ” is inappropriate .
It would be odd indeed if such different conceptions of religion could not be distinguished on the basis of carefully gathered descriptive information .
Of course , it is necessary to gather the information systematically rather than picking and choosing examples that fit one ’s pet theory .
In Darwin ’s Cathedral , I initiated a survey of religions drawn at random from the 16 - volume Encyclopedia of World Religions , edited by the great religious scholar Mircia Eliade .
The results are described in an article titled “ Testing Major Evolutionary Hypotheses about Religion with a Random Sample , ” which was published in the journal Human Nature and is available on my website .
The beauty of random sampling is that , barring a freak sampling accident , valid conclusions for the sample apply to all of the religions in the encyclopedia from which the sample was taken .
By my assessment , the majority of religions in the sample are centered on practical concerns , especially the definition of social groups and the regulation of social interactions within and between groups .
New religious movements usually form when a constituency is not being well served by current social organizations ( religious or secular ) in practical terms and is better served by the new movement .
The seemingly irrational and otherworldly elements of religions in the sample usually make excellent practical sense when judged by the only gold standard that matters from an evolutionary perspective — what they cause the religious believers to do .
The best way to illustrate these points is by describing one of the religions in the sample — Jainism — which initially appeared the most challenging for the group - level adaptation hypothesis .
Jainism is one of the oldest and most ascetic of all the eastern religions and is practiced by approximately three percent of the Indian population .
Jain ascetics filter the air they breathe , the water they drink , and sweep the path in front of them to avoid killing any creature no matter how small .
They are homeless , without possessions , and sometimes even fast themselves to death by taking a vow of “ santhara ” that is celebrated by the entire community .
How could such a religion benefit either individuals or groups in a practical sense ?
It is easy to conclude from the sight of an emaciated Jain ascetic that the religion is indeed a cultural disease — until one reads the scholarly literature .
It turns out that Jain ascetics comprise a tiny fraction of the religion , whose lay members are among the wealthiest merchants in India .
Throughout their long history , Jains have filled an economic niche similar to the Jews in Western Europe , Chinese in Southeast Asia , and other merchant societies .
In all cases , trading over long distances and plying volatile markets such as the gem trade requires a high degree of trust among trading partners , which is provided by the religion .
Even the most esoteric ( to outsiders ) elements of the religion are not superfluous byproducts but perform important practical work .
For example , the ascetics must obtain their food by begging but their religion includes so many food restrictions that they can only accept food from the most pious lay Jain households .
Moreover , the principle of non-action dictates that they can only accept small amounts of food from each household that was not prepared with the ascetics in mind .
When they enter a house , they inspect the premises and subject the occupants to sharp questions about their moral purity before accepting their food .
It is a mark of great honor to be visited but of great shame if the ascetics leave without food .
In effect , the food begging system of the ascetics functions as an important policing mechanism for the community .
This is only one of many examples , as summarized by Jainism scholar James Laidlaw in a 1995 book whose title says it all : Riches and Renunciation : Religion , Economy , and Society Among the Jains .
How then , is it possible to live by impossible ideals ?
The advantage for addressing this question to Jainism is that the problem is so very graphic there .
The demands of Jain asceticism have a pretty good claim to be the most uncompromising of any enduring historical tradition : the most aggressively impractical set of injunctions which any large number of diverse families and communities has ever tried to live by .
They have done so , albeit in a turbulent history of change , schism , and occasionally recriminatory “ reform , ” for well over two millennia .
This directs our attention to the fact that yawning gaps between hope and reality are not necessarily dysfunctions of social organization , or deviations from religious systems .
The fact that lay Jains make up what is — in thoroughly worldly material terms — one of the most conspicuously successful communities in India , only makes more striking and visible a question which must also arise in the case of the renouncers themselves .
This example illustrates a phenomenon that I call the transformation of the obvious .
Jainism appears obviously dysfunctional based on a little information , such as the sight of an emaciated acetic or beliefs that appear bizarre when taken out of context .
The same religion becomes obviously functional based on more information .
This is the kind of “ natural history ” information that enabled Darwin to build such a strong case for his theory of evolution , and it can be used to build an equally strong case for the group - functional nature of Jainism .
As for Jainism , so also for most of the other enduring religions of the world .
An Emerging Consensus ?
I recently attended a conference on evolution and religion in Hawaii that provided an opportunity to assess the state of the field .
It is not the case that everyone has reached a consensus on the relative importance of the major evolutionary hypotheses about religion .
My own talk included a slide with the words SHAME ON US !
in large block letters , chiding my colleagues for failing to reach at least a rough consensus , based on information that is already at hand .
This might seem discouraging , until we remember that all aspects of religion have so far received much less attention than guppy spots from an evolutionary perspective .
The entire enterprise is that new .
There was , I believe , a convergence taking place during the short period of the conference .
Richard Sosis , whose previous research includes a detailed comparison of religious vs. non-religious communal movements , presented new research on the recitation of psalms among Israeli women in response to terrorist attacks .
William Irons and several other participants developed the concept of hard - to - fake signals as a mechanism for insuring commitment in religious groups .
Dominic Johnson reminded us that inter - group conflict , as much as we might not like it and want to avoid it , has been an important selective force throughout human genetic and cultural evolution and that some elements of religion can be interpreted as adaptations for war .
In my response to this paper during the question period , I largely agreed with Johnson but pointed out that most of the religions in my random sample did not spread by violent conflict ( e.g. , Mormonism ) .
Johnson is currently examining the religions in my random sample in more detail with respect to warfare , a good example of cumulative , collaborative research .
Peter Richerson and I gave a tutorial on group selection , which was especially useful for participants whose understanding of evolution is grounded on the Age of Individualism .
Lee Kirkpatrick delivered a lecture titled “ Religion is Not an Adaptation ” that might seem to oppose the adaptationist accounts mentioned above .
What he meant , however , is that he doubts the existence of any genetic adaptations that evolved specifically in a religious context .
He is sympathetic to the possibility that more general genetically evolved psychological adaptations are co-opted by cultural evolution to form elaborately functional religious systems .
Similarly , other psychologically oriented talks about minimal counter - intuitiveness ( beliefs being memorable when they are weird but not too weird ) , hyperactive agent detection devices ( our tendency to assume agency , even when it does not exist ) , and the ease with which children develop beliefs about the afterlife , might be interpretable as non-adaptive byproducts , but they might also be the psychological building blocks of highly adaptive religions .
In evolutionary parlance , byproducts can become exaptations , which in turn can become adaptations .
No one at the conference presented a compelling example of a religious belief that spreads like a disease organism , to the detriment of both individuals and groups .
The demonic meme hypothesis is a theoretical possibility , but so far it lacks compelling evidence .
Much remains to be done , but it is this collective enterprise that deserves the attention of the scientific research community more than angry diatribes about the evils of religion .
Real - World Solutions Require a
Correct Diagnosis of the Problems
Explaining religions as primarily group - level adaptations does not make them benign in every respect .
The most that group selection can do is to turn groups into super - organisms .
Like organisms , super - organisms compete , prey upon each other , coexist without interacting , or engage in mutualistic interactions .
Sometimes they form cooperative federations that work so well that super - super - organisms emerge at an even larger spatial scale .
After all , even multi-cellular organisms are already groups of groups of groups .
In a remarkable recent book titled War and Peace and War , Peter Turchin analyzes the broad sweep of human history as a process of cultural multilevel selection that has increased the scale of human society , with many reversals along the way — the rise and fall of empires .
Religion is a large subject , but the explanatory scope of evolutionary theory is even larger .
American democracy can be regarded as a cultural super - super - organism .
The founding fathers realized that religions work well for their own members but become part of the problem at a larger social scale .
That is why they worked so hard to accomplish the separation of church and state , along with other checks and balances to prevent some members of the super - super - organism from benefiting at the expense of others .
In this context I share Dawkins ’ concern that some religions are seeking to end the separation of church and state in America .
I am equally concerned that the checks and balances are failing in other respects that have nothing do to with religion , such as unaccountable corporations and extreme income inequality .
I also share Dawkins ’ concern about other aspects of religions , even after they are understood as complex group - level adaptations .
Religions can be ruthless in the way that they enforce conformity within groups .
Most alarming for a scientist , religions can be wanton about distorting facts about the real world on their way toward motivating behaviors that are adaptive in the real world .
We should be equally concerned about other distortions of factual reality , such as patriotic histories of nations and other non-religious ideologies that I call “ stealth religions ” in my most recent book , Evolution for Everyone .
Finally , I agree with Dawkins that religions are fair game for criticism in a pluralistic society and that the stigma associated with atheism needs to be removed .
The problem with Dawkins ’ analysis , however , is that if he does n’t get the facts about religion right , his diagnosis of the problems and proffered solutions wo n’t be right either .
If the bump on the shark ’s nose is an organ , you wo n’t get very far by thinking of it as a wart .
That is why Dawkins ’ diatribe against religion , however well - intentioned , is so deeply misinformed .
On Scientific Open- Mindedness
Toward the end of The God Delusion , Dawkins waxes poetic about the open - mindedness of science compared to the closed - mindedness of religion .
He describes the heart - warming example of a scientist who changed his long - held beliefs on the basis of a single lecture , rushing up to his former opponent in front of everyone and declaring “ Sir !
I have been wrong all these years ! ”
This inspiring example represents one end of the scientific bell curve when it comes to open - mindedness .
At the other end are people such as Louis Agassiz , one of the greatest biologists of Darwin ’s day , who for all his brilliance and learning never accepted the theory of evolution .
Time will tell where Dawkins sits on the bell curve of open - mindedness concerning group selection in general and religion in particular .
At the moment , he is just another angry atheist , trading on his reputation as an evolutionist and spokesperson for science to vent his personal opinions about religion .
It is time now for us to roll up our sleeves and get to work on understanding one of the most important and enigmatic aspects of the human condition .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Taliban leaders said on Sunday their fighters would kill 22 remaining South Korean hostages if the Afghan government did not release rebel prisoners by a new deadline of 0730 GMT on Monday , a spokesman said .
Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad
Yousuf said the deadline had been set by the Taliban leadership council , headed by elusive leader Mullah Mohammad Omar , giving the threat added weight .
The kidnappers killed the leader of the Korean group on Wednesday , but several further deadlines have passed without the rebels carrying out their threat to kill the remaining hostages .
“ Since the talks between us , the Kabul administration and Korean government have reached deadlock and they are not honest ... hence , we will start killing the hostages if they do not start releasing our prisoners by tomorrow at 12 o’clock , ” Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an unknown location .
Sporadic talks between the Afghan government and South Korean diplomats on one side and Taliban rebels on the other have continually snagged over the rebel demand for Kabul to swap jailed insurgents for the Koreans .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has previously ruled out any deal with the Taliban after coming under harsh criticism for freeing five rebel prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage in March .
In his first comments on the latest hostage case , Karzai condemned the kidnapping , but did not say whether any deal might be possible .
“ Hostage - taking and the abuse of foreign guests , especially women , is against Islam and Afghan culture and the perpetration of this heinous act on our soil is in total contempt of our Islamic and Afghan values , ” a spokesman quoted him as saying .
An Afghan minister said on Saturday force might be used if talks fail .
Pope Benedict on Sunday called the kidnapping a “ grave violation of human dignity that clashes with every elementary norm of civility and rights and gravely offends divine law ” .
Eighteen of the remaining hostages are women .
Yousuf said some of the captives -- being held in small groups at different locations -- were sick .
Ghazni ’s governor , Mirajuddin Pathan , said medicines the Korean government had wanted to send could not be delivered on Saturday because the Afghan team could not establish contact with the Taliban .
Pathan said the government did not want to use force to rescue the hostages .
“ We have no plan of attack .
We are trying to send the delegation for more talks , ” he told Reuters .

In addition to Afghan forces , foreign troops are also stationed in Ghazni .
South Korean special envoy Baek Jong - chun met Karzai on Sunday to discuss ways to end the hostages ’ ordeal .
“ We are well aware of Afghan culture and the difficulties the Afghan government and people are faced with in their fight against terrorism , and will respect their decision to end the hostage crisis , ” a statement by Karzai ’s office quoted the Korean chief national security advisor as saying .

The Taliban are also holding one German and four of his Afghan colleagues , abducted from a neighboring province a day before the Koreans .
Another German seized alongside them was later found dead with gunshot wounds .
The abduction of the Koreans is the largest kidnapping of foreigners by the Taliban since U.S. - led and Afghan forces overthrew the movement ’s radical Islamic government in 2001 .
It comes amid an increase of violence in the past 18 months , the bloodiest period since Taliban ’s removal .
Religious scholars in Pakistan have awarded their highest honour to Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in reaction to Britain 's knighthood for Salman Rushdie .
The tit - for - tat recognition was given by a private body that claims to represent 2,000 religious scholars in Pakistan .
It said it was bestowing the title ' Sword of Allah ' on bin Laden , in response to Britain giving a knighthood to the author of The Satanic Verses .
Meanwhile , Britain has expressed " deep concern " at remarks by the Pakistani Religious Affairs Minister who said the award given to Rushdie justified suicide attacks .
Poll shows 39 % of Americans support impeachment

Published : Tuesday May 8 , 2007 Print This Email This
A poll published Tuesday shows that close to 40 % of Americans favor the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , according to an article at Townhall.com .
" Few serious observers think things will ever get to actual impeachment .
And yet the American public seems more open to the concept than many imagine , according to a new national poll , " wrote Matt Towery , CEO of InsiderAdvantage , which commissioned the poll .
" The implications of this public sentiment could be huge for the 2008 presidential elections . "
The poll from InsiderAdvantage / Majority Opinion asked a sample of 621 Americans , " Would you favor or oppose the impeachment by Congress of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney ? "
A total of 39 % who answered said they favored impeachment , according to Towery .
In opposition were 55 % of respondents , with 6 % answering undecided or do n't know .
There was a 4 % margin of error .
Towery noted that a high proportion of independent voters , who traditionally decide elections , favored impeachment .
" Forty - two percent of independents want Bush and Cheney impeached .
These are n't just voters who disapprove of the White House .
Instead , they 're for initiating a process that could remove them from office , " he wrote .
InsiderAdvantage 's polls have " been praised by national media ranging from CNNs Judy Woodruff to Fox Newss Bill OReilly , and have appeared in Knight - Ridder newspapers , The Washington Post , Washington Times , New York Post , Business Week , US News and World Report , and CBS News / CBS Marketwatch , " according to the company 's website .

Four Principles for Compensation Decisions
I think compensation decisions are one of the toughest parts of running a software company .
In fact , I 'll just admit it : I hate this part of my job .
I got into this business for the joy of building software .
Suddenly I found myself making decisions that affect how big of a mortgage somebody is allowed to have .
That 's just not any fun .
For most people , the touchiest and most sensitive topics are money and sex .
I 'm not expected to decide how often everybody gets laid .
Why do I have to decide how much everybody gets paid ?
Well anyway .
Compensation decisions are an important part of running a software company and they need to be done well .
So I 'll stop ranting ( for now ) and share four of the principles I try to use when working on these kinds of decisions .
1. Secrecy is for the benefit of the employee , not the company
Lots of companies have a policy which prohibits employees from discussing their compensation with each other .
In such environments , disclosing your salary to a coworker can be grounds for termination .
That is simply absurd .
The purpose of such policies is to hide things that are unfair or illegal , such as :
The person who makes more simply because he negotiated hard
The person who makes less because he never asks for a raise
The person who makes more simply because you hired her away from a high - paying job
The woman or minority who is doing the same job as a white male but getting paid less
If these kinds of discrepancies were visible to everyone , people would get upset .
So a company has two choices .
They can either keep their salary chart clean or they can keep it a secret .
Let me stop and define my terms :
A salary chart is simply a list of all the team members and their base salaries .
A salary chart is " clean " if it could be posted on the wall and most reasonable people would agree that all the differences are fair .
To be honest , keeping a salary chart clean is a lot of work .
Some kinds of discrepancies just tend to slip in .
It 's not that anybody wants to be unfair -- it 's just often more convenient to do .
So a lot of companies just allow their salary chart to get all dingy and then institute a policy to cover it up .
At the other extreme is the notion of completely open salaries .
In some organizations , salaries are public information .
The notion is tempting .
It 's a lot harder to be unfair if everybody can see you doing it .
But I do n't like this idea either .
People care about their privacy .
So I think secrecy about compensation is important , but it should be for the purpose of protecting the privacy of individuals , not for the purpose of obscuring the fact that management is doing things they know to be unfair .
Keep a clean salary chart .
Manage it as if all the numbers were publicly visible .
And then , for the sake of the privacy of the individuals , keep it secret .
2. Subjectivity is a necessary evil
Most people would probably agree that subjectivity in compensation decisions is a bad thing .
In an ideal world , compensation would always be tied to job performance in a purely objective and quantifiable manner .
I imagine that this ideal is actually available in many other professions .
For example , it must be relatively simple to measure the quantity and quality of the work done by a bricklayer with only two questions :
How many bricks were completed today ?
Are they level ?
But software developers are not like bricklayers .
Sometimes a developer spends ten days to fix a bug that ends up as a one - line change .
There are no situations where a bricklayer takes ten days to deal with a really difficult brick .
So how do we know what good performance is ?
When that developer fixed a bug on the tenth day , how do we know she did n't just play Far Cry for 9 days and then fix it quickly on the 10th ?
During that same 10 day period , one of her peers implemented 5 new dialog boxes .
Another person wrote 2,000 lines of code to implement a new algorithm .
Another person changed 200 lines of code and made a key feature twice as fast .
Which of these developers were the most productive ?
In general , it 's pretty difficult to be precise .
So if we can't measure productivity in any quantifiable terms , how do we know how well our development staff is performing ?
And how do we know how much each person should be paid ?
The answer is that we just know , because we 're developers too .
Subjectively , we can usually tell when someone is productive , regardless of how many lines of code are being checked in .
That subjective sense does n't give us a lot of precision , but it gives us enough .
So I claim that subjectivity cannot be eliminated and should not be eliminated .
But I also admit that it can cause problems .
When subjectivity is present in any amount , the possibility for unfairness or capriciousness is introduced .
Even when we mean well , we may be unconsciously basing our decisions on factors that should not matter :
Are better - looking developers making more than ugly ones ?
Are tall developers making more than short ones ?
Are people with a great sense of humor making more than those are quiet and serious ?
Is there anybody on your team who is making less simply because you do n't like them ?
For all these reasons , I prefer to have compensation decisions be made by a group of three people .
Two is n't enough , because ties happen .
Four is too many , because , well , it 's just not necessary .
Three is just right .
When you have multiple opinions , you get two big benefits :
The subjective part of the decision improves because the accuracy of the facts in play has gone up .
A group conscience appears and makes it much more difficult for any unfairness to creep into the process .
Make all compensation decisions in a group of three people .
3. Supply and demand still matter
The strongest factor in determining salaries is basic economics .
Although many other factors are in play , supply and demand are still the most important thing in determining how much each position gets paid .
Software developers get paid more than receptionists .
Why ?
Because , with no disrespect to receptionists , the fact is that there are more people in the world who know how to greet visitors at the front desk than there are people who know how to parallelize an algorithm so it will work on a quad - core CPU .
For each developer , the forces of supply and demand produce a " market rate " , which I will define as the base salary which could be reasonably expected by any developer with similar skills , similar experience , and similar education , in a similar position .
So I would like to make a claim that many people will consider obvious : I assert that we must never let a person 's salary get too far away from their market rate .
You should periodically be asking yourself two questions :
Could I replace this employee for a significantly lower salary ?
( Be realistic .
If you find yourself saying " yes " very quickly , you may be underestimating the challenges . )
Could this employee get a significantly higher salary if s/he left and worked somewhere else ?
Note that these questions seem somewhat cold .
I am not saying that you should ask yourself these questions and then immediately act on them in what appears to be the obvious way .
Just ask the questions .
They should serve as a reality check , never as a trigger for rash action .
I 'm just saying that you never want to find yourself in a situation where you know you could replace an employee with someone who is paid significantly less .
And this works both ways .
If you 're going to use supply and demand to justify a lower salary , you darn well oughttabe be using it to justify higher salaries as well .
You never want to find yourself in a situation where your employee knows they could work for somebody else and get paid significantly more .
Although I believe this principle to be very important , I 'll confess that its application is very difficult .
The problem is that there is no precise notion of " market rate " .
We know that programmers get paid more than receptionists .
But programmer salaries cover a very broad range , for many reasons .
If a software company wants to make sure they are paying competitive market salaries , how do they know what numbers to use ?
Beware : Bad salary data is easy to find .
I define " bad data " as salary data which was gathered outside my city and then adjusted for the cost - of - living index of my city .
I find that this kind of salary data often makes no intuitive sense .
I live in a twin -city in central Illinois .
Champaign and Urbana are legally separate cities , but they are really just one city with a line down the middle .
Folks who live here tend to talk and joke about the differences , but in most ways , these two cities are darn similar .
Nonetheless , the published cost - of - living indices suggest that living in Champaign is a lot more expensive than living in Urbana .
I just found a salary calculator on the web which says that a $ 100,000 salary in Urbana is equivalent to a Champaign salary of $ 121,445 .
That 's just patently false .
I concede that my situation is an anomaly because of the twin - city thing .
But my observation is that salaries computed with this method very often just do n't match up well with reality .
The only good salary data is actual salaries gathered for actual people in your area .
When I want to verify that our base salaries are competitive in our area , I just call my counterparts at other software companies in town and ask them to trade numbers .
Even then , it 's easy to end up with apples - to - oranges comparisons , but this kind of data is much better than taking national averages and adjusting them for cost - of - living numbers that somebody pulled out of their butt .
Anyway , understanding market rates for salaries can be hard , but I stick with my advice :
Do n't let your developer salaries get too far away from your best understanding of current market rates .
4. Profit sharing is not inherently wrong
Several people have observed the problems with incentive compensation :
Mary Poppendieck : " In the same way , once employees get used to receiving financial rewards for meeting goals , they begin to work for the rewards , not the intrinsic motivation that comes from doing a good job and helping their company be successful .
Many studies have shown that extrinsic rewards like grades and pay will , over time , destroy the intrinsic reward that comes from the work itself . "
Joel Spolsky : " Giving somebody positive reinforcement ( such as stupid company ceremonies where people get plaques ) implies that they only did it for the lucite plaque ; it implies that they are not independent enough to work unless they are going to get a cookie ; and it 's insulting and demeaning . "
reinforcement ( such as stupid company ceremonies where people get plaques ) implies that they only did it for the lucite plaque ; it implies that they are not independent enough to work unless they are going to get a cookie ; and it 's insulting and demeaning . "
Edward L. Deci :
" It appears that money -- perhaps because of its connotation and use in our culture -- may act as a stimulus which leads the subjects to a cognitive reevaluation of the activity from one which is intrinsically motivated to one which is motivated primarily by the expectation of financial rewards .
In short , money may work to ' buy off ' one 's intrinsic motivation for an activity .
And this decreased motivation appears ( from the results of the field experiment ) to be more than just a temporary phenomenon . "
Seth Godin : " Money , it 's been shown time and time again , is a demotivator .
I 'm not talking about a fair or even generous salary .
Being a cheapskate is no way to find a great employee .
But once people have joined your team , incremental money - - bonuses and the like -- usually demotivate people . "
These articles are kind of scary .
Intrinsic motivation is a precious thing .
It is sobering to think that well - intentioned employers can destroy it .
And yet , I believe articles like these can be misread .
As far as I can tell , these articles do not say any of the following :
Managers should never acknowledge the excellent efforts of someone on their team .
An employee should never be thanked or appreciated for their work .
A company should never give its staff any money beyond their base salaries , regardless of how profitable the company is .
So even after reading worrisome articles like these , we have thrown caution to the wind .
For the last several years , SourceGear has made a habit of paying quarterly bonuses to our staff .
The amounts of these bonuses vary with the quarterly profit of the company , but most people consider them substantial .
In a typical quarter , an average bonus for one individual might be $ 3,000 .
Sometimes they have been considerably higher .
The last thing we want to do is crush anybody 's intrinsic motivation .
I think we mostly do these bonuses in the right way and for the right reasons :
The bonuses are not incentive pay .
We do n't dangle them like a carrot to try and get people to do things .
So although we call them " bonuses " that 's not really the right word .
We are simply taking a share of the profits each quarter and distributing it to the staff .
These bonuses are not for the purpose of getting our staff 's compensation up to appropriate levels .
We try to make sure our base salaries are very competitive .
We could stop the bonuses at any time and our staff would still be compensated fairly .
We do not pay these bonuses because the staff deserves them or is entitled to them .
Like I said , we pay competitive base salaries .
Strictly speaking , that 's what employees are entitled to receive .
When the company makes a profit , the only people are strictly entitled to that profit are the stockholders who own that company .
Despite all this , I will acknowledge that these bonuses cause problems .
For example , even though we deliberately avoid using these bonuses to motivate people , we have occasionally observed people that seem less motivated right after we hand out the checks .
Furthermore , we know that once the ball is rolling it is going to be painful if it stops .
Even though we routinely remind everyone that these bonuses are not guaranteed , people have come to expect them .
Eventually there may come a quarter when we do n't pay a bonus .
When that happens , people are going to be disappointed .
So why do we do this ?
Why do we pay these bonuses when we have no obligation to pay them and they sometimes seem to cause problems ?
The simple answer is we do this because we want SourceGear to be the kind of company that is generous with its staff .
No matter how many articles about psychology I read , empirical data consistently tells me that people appreciate money . :-)
If , for some reason , you managed to make an egg stand on its end during the recent equinox , experimental physicists could do with your help .
An exquisitely sensitive experiment that can only be performed during equinoxes could test some of the theories that offer an alternative to dark matter .
Stars on the outskirts of galaxies are moving much faster than can be explained by the gravity of visible matter .
To account for the extra gravity , astronomers have proposed the existence of dark matter .
In the 1980s , Mordechai Milgrom , then at Princeton University , suggested that the observations could also be explained …

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar rebounded on Tuesday but remained near a record low against the euro as investors eyed central bank meetings this week in Europe which could keep overseas yields climbing .
A woman works in front of a monitor displaying the U.S. dollar rate against the yen at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo June 25 , 2007 .
The yen stayed near a 4 1/2 - year low against the dollar and an all - time trough versus the euro on Monday after a Bank of Japan business sentiment survey supported the view that Japanese interest rates will rise only gradually .

The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies , steadying after two sessions of sharp falls .
But the greenback hit another 26 - year low against the British pound , which has been steadily gaining ahead of an expected rise in interest rates by the Bank of England on Thursday .
The European Central Bank also meets Thursday , and is expected to keep rates on hold , but signal further monetary tightening is ahead .
Volume dwindled in early afternoon in New York ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday , analysts said .
Stock and bond markets closed earlier and will reopen on Thursday .
“ The dollar had a minor rebound against the euro today but with the holiday tomorrow , investors will wait until the central bank meetings and for the payrolls data on Friday to once again commit to larger positions , ” said Matthew Strauss , a senior foreign exchange strategist at RBC Capital in Toronto .
At 2 p.m. ( 1800 GMT ) in New York , the euro was down 0.15 percent at $ 1.3614 , still in sight of a record high just above $ 1.3680 hit in April .
The dollar was barely changed against the Japanese yen at 122.38 yen .
The dollar fared better against the Swiss franc , rising 0.4 percent to 1.2155 francs after a tame reading of Swiss consumer price inflation earlier in the session .
Sterling on Tuesday hit a 26 - year high versus the dollar at $ 2.0197 ahead of the BoE ’s policy meeting on Thursday .
A quarter point rate rise by the BoE would take British rates to 5.75 percent , half a percentage point above the Federal Reserve ’s federal funds rate .
Most analysts expect the Fed to leave interest rates on hold until late this year .
“ Interest rate and growth differentials continue to conspire against the dollar , ” said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist at Bank of New York .
“ We ’re seeing an acknowledgment this week that the ECB and Bank of England are , if they are not going to be hiking rates , at least going to be sounding warning bells about hikes . ”
In the thin trade ahead of the July 4 holiday the main focus on the economic front was an index of U.S. pending home sales , which slumped sharply in May to its lowest level since September 2001 .
The dollar showed little reaction , but coming in tandem with another report showing a modest drop in U.S. factory orders in May , the data did strengthen a view that the economy may be struggling to regain momentum in the second quarter .
Investors will get a further handle on the state of the U.S. economy on Friday with the government ’s nonfarm payrolls report , the most closely watched barometer of the health of the labor market .
A solid reading could lure investors back to the dollar .
“ The US dollar ’s weakness seems to be largely a reflection of yet another bout of speculation that the Federal Reserve might sanction a rate cut later this year after all , ” analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman wrote in a note to clients .
“ We expect this too shall pass ... again . ”

Hard disks are getting smaller with greater storage
The report examined 100,000 commercial hard drives , ranging from 80 GB to 400GB in capacity , used at Google since 2001 .
The firm uses " off - the - shelf " drives to store cached web pages and services .
" Our data indicate a much weaker correlation between utilisation levels and failures than previous work has suggested , " the authors noted .
A wide variety of manufacturers and models were included in the report , but a breakdown was not provided .
Widely - held belief
There is a widely held belief that hard disks which are subject to heavy use are more likely to fail than those used intermittently .
It was also thought that hard drives preferred cool temperatures to hotter environments .
The authors wrote : " We expected to notice a very strong and consistent correlation between high utilisation and higher failure rates .
" However our results appear to paint a more complex picture .
First , only very young and very old age groups appear to show the expected behaviour . "
A hard disk was described as having " failed " if it needed to be replaced .
The report was compiled by Eduardo Pinheiro , Wolf - Dietrich Weber and Luiz Andre Barroso , and was presented to a storage conference in California last week .
In the report the authors said Google had developed an infrastructure which collected " vital information " about all of the firm 's systems every few minutes .
' Essentially forever '
The firm then stores that information " essentially forever " .
Google employs its own file system to organise the storage of data , using inexpensive commercially available hard drives rather than bespoke systems .
Lower temperatures are associated with higher failure rates
Google report
" One possible explanation for this behaviour is the survival of the fittest theory , " said the authors , speculating that drives which failed early on in their lifetime had been removed from the overall sample leaving only the older , more robust units .
The report said that there was a clear trend showing " that lower temperatures are associated with higher failure rates " .
" Only at very high temperatures is there a slight reversal of this trend . "
But hard drives which are three years old and older were more likely to suffer a failure when used in warmer environments .
" This is a surprising result , which could indicate that data centre or server designers have more freedom than previously thought when setting operating temperatures for equipment containing disk drives , " said the authors .
The report also looked at the impact of scan errors - problems found on the surface of a disc - on hard drive failure .
" We find that the group of drives with scan errors are 10 times more likely to fail than the group with no errors , " said the authors .
They added : " After the first scan error , drives are 39 times more likely to fail within 60 days than drives without scan errors . "
In February we gave a sneak preview of our project to construct a home - built three dimensional fabricator .
Our design goals were ( 1 ) a low cost design leveraging recycled components ( 2 ) large printable volume emphasized over high resolution , and ( 3 ) ability to use low - cost printing media including granulated sugar .
We are extremely pleased to be able to report that it has been a success :
Our three dimensional fabricator is now fully operational and we have used it to print several large , low - resolution , objects out of pure sugar .
The general idea of our build process– that of stacking solid two - dimensional printed layers – is actually common to most solid freeform fabrication methods .
Our machine employs what we believe is a fairly novel low - cost technology to accomplish this : selective hot air sintering and melting ( SHASAM ) .
The printing process begins with a bed of a granular printing media that has a fairly low melting point .
Using a narrow , directed , low - velocity beam of hot air , we selectively fuse together the print media , forming a two - dimensional image out of the fused grains .
We then lower the bed by a small amount , add a thin flat layer of media to the top of the bed , and selectively fuse the media in the new layer , forming a two dimensional image that is also fused to any overlapping fused areas in the layer below .
By repeating this process , a three - dimensional object is slowly built up .
At the end of the build , the bed is raised to its original position , disinterring the fabricated model , while unused media is reclaimed for use in building the next object .
Our process is very much like a low - cost version of Selective Laser Sintering , or Selective Laser Melting , which are commercial processes used for plastic and direct metal printing .
Rather than using a high - power CO2 or YAG laser ( $ 5 k and up ) , we use hot air created with the help of a $ 10 heating element .
Trading off a laser for a heat gun gives us lower resolution but at much lower cost , and is typical of our approach to 3D fabrication .
We have taken a very different approach from most other fab projects ( e.g. , Fab@Home and RepRap ) in that we have a comparatively large printable volume , but less need for precision and high resolution .
Our fabricator is not designed for prototyping machine parts ; it ’s designed for fun , for large - scale 3D illustration , for sculpting , architectural models , and other applications where resolution is n’t the only important factor .
We estimate the total cost to build a machine with similar capability to be in the neighborhood of $ 500 .
Realistically , the cost of any project like this is not a fixed number , and since recycled components are involved , the actual cost could range up or down by a factor of two depending on how resourceful the builder is .
There are a number of different print media that may be suitable for use with SHASAM fabrication : many types of plastics and waxes have low melting points and are available in granular or powder form .
Beyond that , there are a number of interesting foods– chocolate chips come to mind– that can be used with the process
However , one of the most interesting possibilities is using table sugar .
Granulated Sugar : low cost print media
As we mentioned in our preview of the printer , our printing medium of choice is granulated sugar .
Sugar is a particularly good medium because it ’s non-hazardous , non-toxic , non-intimidating , kid friendly , water soluble , rigid despite having a low melting point , and as an organic , may be suitable for making forms for investment casting .
It ’s also very easy to obtain and very inexpensive : you can buy it at grocery stores , and in large bags at places like Costco for about $ 0.37 / pound .
The price of sugar compares quite favorably to the polycaprolactone ( a low melting point polyester ) used by the reprap project which costs about $ 4.00 a pound .
As it turns out , even $ 4.00 per pound is quite inexpensive compared to the media for many other solid freeform fabrication systems .
Beyond just lowering the media cost of a given fabricated object , using a low - cost medium can be leveraged to make large - volume printing both practical and economical .
Our fabricator has a maximum printable volume of 24 x 13.5 x 9 inches ( 61 x 34 x 23 cm ) – 2916 cubic inches , or 1.7 cubic feet , and holds a little more than 100 pounds of sugar , which costs about $ 37 retail .
Of course , the direct media cost in the models can also be an important consideration .
Consider this model of a wood screw that we fabricated out of sugar :
It ’s 20 inches long , with the head diameter of 4.5 inches , and it weighs about 2.5 pounds , so the total media cost is about $ 0.93 .
For a fun exercise , look up how much it would cost to make a similar model on a prototyping industry standard $ 20,000 Dimension ABS 3D printer– if it could print objects anywhere near that big .
( Hint : it ’s more than $ 0.93 . )
Mechanics and Electronics
The big idea of the mechanical system is that we take a hot air gun and move it around a bed of sugar , selectively fusing a set of points before lowering the bed of sugar and adding a new layer .
Our hot air gun is based upon the design of a hot air rework station .
However , we have heavily modified it , and learned how to make an equivalent system inexpensively .
The heater design now essentially consists of a 500 W , $ 10 air heating element and a small air pump– a $ 5 aquarium air pump works well .
At a minimum , use of the heater element requires a housing to be constructed , the air pump and a control system that can provide a the chosen amount of power to the heating element .
We have seen that the element can be driven directly from 120 V , with duty cycle controlled by an inexpensive digital relay .
The heater element is hardly new technology ; it ’s the baby sister of the one in your hair dryer .
None the less , it ’s well designed and quite suitable for this application .
Thus far , we are still using the bulky original housing from the hot - air station itself , but plan to design a replacement head and nozzle when time permits .
The existing housing has a slightly odd shape so we made this mount to attach it to the carriage of our X - Y motion control system .
The original head was not designed to operate at both high temperature and low air flow ; it tends to overheat easily .
One improvement that we made that has been hugely beneficial is to mount a cooling fan right next to this structure , keeping it cool on the outside while in use .
The X and Y axis motion control systems are based on belt drives and quadrature - encoded motors recycled from two old HP plotters , a large one and a small one .
This is one of those places that your resourcefulness can save you a lot of money :
The number of old - generation inkjets and plotters out there is truly stunning – go find a couple , and make them do something useful again .
In order to control the quadrature - encoded motors that came on our printer parts , we designed custom digital servo circuits that cost about $ 10 each to build .
The circuits are based around a high - power analog output stage and an AVR microcontroller that accept position commands .
The position commands are sent using a higher precision version of standard hobby servo PWM control code , where the position command is encoded in the width of a positive pulse between one and two milliseconds long .
We will be writing up and releasing the hardware design as well as the source code ( under the GPL ) for these servo controllers in the near future .
The hot air gun is mounted to the belt - driven carriage on the Y axis of the printer .
The Y - axis belt - drive system is mounted , on one end , to a linear bearing that slides along a steel rail .
That bearing is pushed by the belt - driven carriage on the X axis , through a rubber band low - cost flexible rubber coupling .
The other end of the Y - axis belt - drive system is supported by a free - rolling rubber wheel from the hardware store .
For our operational tests and a demonstration of the XY motion control system last month , we mounted the hot air gun to the system and placed a piece of bread where the sugar would normally go– allowing us to make CNC ( computer numerically controlled ) toast , demonstrating successful control of both the hot air gun and the X and Y motion control systems .
The fabricator primarily consists of a large wooden base , which was designed in Sketchup .
It was designed to hold the X - axis belt drive system on the front side and provide a back platform for the rubber wheel to roll along .
It also provides elevation above the floor and holds the box that defines the walls of the build region .
Here you can see the model as drawn in Sketchup , and the base that we constructed from that model .

Since the vertical axis must be able to easily raise up the bed containing all of the sugar– potentially more than 100 pounds – it needs to be a bit tougher than a printer carriage .
The vertical motion is constrained by a five - sided wooden box with a floor that can move up and down on a set of drawer slides .
The motor for the vertical motion , which pushes up on the floor of the wooden box , is actually a modified one - ton electric automotive jack that has been converted into a ( large scale ) hobby servo motor .
Besides the three motion axes , there is also a heater controller that is used to control the power delivered to the hot air heating element .
Together , the four controllers ( X , Y , Z , Temperature ) require four axes of computer control .
Canvas Liner
Wrapped around the wooden base is a flexible canvas liner that prevents sugar from leaking out in strange places and assists in recovering unused media .
Canvas is a good choice for this application because it is strong , durable , woven tightly enough to contain granular media like sugar , and washable .
We got ours at a fabric store for $ 7 / yard , in 60 - inch width , and we needed about five yards .
If you ’re trying to save costs , you might be able to do better elsewhere , e.g. , buying canvas drop cloths intended for painting .
The liner was designed to hold the sugar in place during forming , and to channel the excess into buckets for reuse after raising the platform .
The canvas liner fits snugly around the bin , and the inner part folds up accordion - style to accommodate raising and lowering the piston .
The pleats are reinforced with interfacing to assist with folding .
The upper edge and the bottom surface are attached to the bin with velcro .
The outer part of the canvas fits around the frame , and tapers in to meet the bin , forming funnels that catch sugar and feed it into buckets below .
Figuring the sizes for most of the pieces was straightforward working from the measurements from the sketchup model .
However , the tapering portions for the funnels were cut large , pinned in place , and then sewn and trimmed .
Seams were generally folded and reinforced in such a way that the sugar flows downward easily .
Sewing was done with a home sewing machine with heavy duty thread usually used for denim .
Software
There are several different layers to the software needed to control a three - dimensional fabricator , and they are implemented in our system with a variety of different techniques .
We begin with a 3D model generated in ( or imported into ) POV - Ray , and then render the POV - Ray image as a set of two - dimensional bitmaps of slices through the image .
The bitmaps are generated in such a way that they directly represent which points will , or will not , have the printing medium fused .
We then take the bitmaps and use them to “ draw ” with our hot air gun at all of the black points on the bitmap .
Here is one of our 3D models , along with one of the generated 2D bitmap slices through that object :
You can download the 3D model , both the POV - Ray document , the rendered and sliced versions here .
( 53 kB ZIP archive )
Operating the 3D fabricator requires precision motion control in three directions , which is potentially difficult .
Computer control and interface are provide through a MAKE Controller .
Presently we are using an old student version of LabVIEW to control the MAKE Controller– reading in a 2D bitmap , parsing it into a simple rastered toolpath , and converting that to position commands , sent to the MAKE Controller using UDP packets .
Labview is , of course , not free software , and any suggestions about open - source solutions that would do the job nicely are welcome .
( PD and Processing seem like possible directions , but we ’d like to hear what you think in the comments . )
While the Make Controller has many remarkable capabilities , we are hardly taking advantage of them here ; it is strictly acting as a computer - controlled device to output four servo- motor control code signals .
Budget conscious builders may want to instead consider using a dedicated servo controller , like this Micro Serial Servo Controller , from Pololu , a precision 8 - channel servo interface starting at $ 17.95 .
Making things with the fabricator
Now that we ’ve got all our parts together , let ’s fab some sugar objects .
The effective horizontal resolution of our fabricator is presently limited to around 2 mm by the very one - point - oh design of our hot air nozzles , but can in principle be made much higher even while using granulated sugar as the print medium .
The resolution is determined by a number of factors , including the air nozzle size , the air temperature and flow rate , and ( obviously ) the position step size in the three directions .
Printing at a higher resolution takes longer , so we have actually been operating it in a low - resolution mode in order to produce some sample objects – quickly– before the Maker Faire .
All of the objects on this page were made with pixel ( well , voxel ) size 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.7 mm ( 10 x 10 x 9 DPI ) , where the 3D models have been properly quantized to account for the larger vertical step size .
Even at this low resolution setting , the total number of printable points in our fabricator is over 2.6 megavoxels .
Here is the first step : Drawing a thin line with the heater element , fusing the sugar together .
The width of the line drawn in the picture here is about 3 mm , and so is a little wider than our minimum pixel width .
For each pixel that we want to fuse , we hold the hot air gun over that point for a period of time , typically between one and three seconds , depending on air temperature settings and the thickness of the layer that we want to fuse .
( We should be able to reduce that time with a better hot air nozzle design . )
This is how a newly melted spot looks in the middle of building up a 3D object .
The melted region is about 3 / 4 of an inch across , and has a glassy surface of amorphous sugar .
The top layer is about 1/8 of an inch ( 3 mm ) thick and is uniformly colored a light golden brown– caramelized in the melt process .
The right half of the spot appears darker because that half overlaps– and is fused to– the dot which is slightly to the side of our top dot but on the layer below .
It appears darker because we are looking into a deeper layer of colored sugar .
( Click through to see the image larger . )
Because the hot air gun blows air continuously , it leaves a shallow trail wherever it goes .
Here , you can see the trail indicate the dumb - as - a - rock toolpath of the heater over the sugar surface .
Excess fusion has not been an issue so long as we move quickly between the points where we stop to melt the sugar .
We are nearly done printing this layer , which is near the midpoint of our coil sculpture– very much like the bitmap slice that we ’ve shown above .
All of the spots have a glassy surface , but a few of them have been covered up by a dusting of granulated sugar .
The completed toroidal coil sculpture , one of the first objects that we made with our new 3D sugar printer .
We ’ve hardly begun to scratch the surface of how large of an object can be made in this machine ; four of these could be fabricated at once , fitting within the printable volume simultaneously .
If you look at all closely , you can see the pixelated nature of our fabricated object .
The bulk of the material is solid , glassy , lightly caramelized sugar .
It feels and acts very much like regular glass .
The outside surface is covered by loosely attached sintered sugar ( white ) , and can be removed or smoothed over by hand .
This shows the beginning of our making the model of a wood screw .
This is one of the early layers , where just the edges of the threads are visible .
This layer is nearly halfway through the model of the screw .
It ’s a philips - head screw , so the fact that we can only see a single slot indicates that we ’re not exactly at the middle yet .
Here is what it looks like after we finished printing the screw , and raised the bed of sugar up to be able to get at the model .
Even after raising the piston up , some digging is still required to get the last ten pounds of sugar off the top .
( This part is actually quite fun . )
Finally , here is a group of three objects that we ’ve made out of pure sugar :
A little dodecahedron , the toroidal coil , and the twenty - inch - long wood screw
So how does it taste ?
Like praline , no doubt .
While our process has incredible potential for making interesting food , we are still in the early stages of prototyping and we have not yet worked with the sugar under conditions that could be construed as proper food handling procedures .
We are instead at this point treating the sugar as a relatively safe ( but not edible ) industrial chemical and prototyping medium .
There is no fundamental obstacle to food - safe 3D fabrication– however we still need to carefully audit the system and make sure , for example , that the air pump for the hot air does not contain any substances that could contaminate food .
See it at the Maker Faire
Our completed fabricator will make its public debut next week at the 2007 Bay Area Maker Faire .
( Our Maker Faire program entry is here . )
We will be bringing the machine itself and some of our fabricated sugar objects .
We ’ve decided to spend our time at the faire showing off the printer and its parts , rather than actually using it to fabricate objects .
One reason is safety ; we have discovered that the First Law of Laboratory Work ( Hot glass looks exactly the same as cold glass ) holds true for molten hot sugar as well .
In order to make the fabricator look a little nicer for the Maker Faire , we made this combination front cover and sign that labels it the “ CandyFab 4000 . ”
Yes it ’s a silly touch– but there is a certain benefit to overnaming things .
( For example “ Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories ” sounds a lot better than “ Our Kitchen . ” )
We made the sign from recycled and scrap acrylic for a total cost of about $ 20 , cutting out the letters and segments on a laser cutter before cementing them in place .
You can find more pictures of the CandyFab 4000 in this flickr photoset .
Update 7/25/2007 :
We have just launched CandyFab.org .
If you ’re interested in designing , building , operating , or owning your own CandyFab , this is the place to start .

It 's times like these that the internet makes me most happy .
When respectable online publications publish entertaining and interesting stories about the world 's hardest Sudoku puzzle , you 'd at least expect them to give you a link to it , or a picture of it .
Oh , yes , you guessed it .
They do n't .
But I could n't find it anywhere !
So I undustriously hunted , and eventually found the secret formula hidden away in an ASCII - like tomb of Sudoku knowledge .
And now , for the first time in propper format , and luckily without any further ado ( read the real reporter 's background here ) , I give you AL Escargot , the hardest rated Sudoku puzzle to date :

( AP )  Certain health supplements and raisins imported from the United States failed to meet Chinese safety standards and have been returned or destroyed , the country 's food safety agency said Friday , turning the tables on the U.S. amid growing worries over dangerous Chinese products .
Inspectors in the ports of Ningbo and Shenzhen found bacteria and sulfur dioxide in products shipped by three American companies , said the General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine .
TRADE GAP : Narrows sharply in April " The products failed to meet the sanitary standards of China , " the agency said in a brief notice posted on its website .
No details were given on when or how the inspections were conducted .
Telephones at the administration 's office were not answered on Friday .
The companies were identified as K - Max Health Products , CMO Distribution Center of America and SuperValu International Division .
The administration said K - Max and CMO exported health capsules , including bee pollen and bacteria - fighting supplements .
SuperValu exported Sun-Maid Golden Raisins , it said .
The shipments from K - Max and SuperValu have been destroyed and CMO 's capsules were returned , the notice said .
The notice did not say which contaminants were found in which products , although sulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a preservative in dried fruit .
It said they were found in amounts that surpassed acceptable levels , but did not give any details .
" Local quality officials should step up the inspection and quarantine on imported food products from the U.S. , " the notice said .
" Chinese importers should also clarify food safety demands in contracts when importing U.S. food products , so as to lower the trade risk . "
The announcement was the second mention in recent days of China rejecting foreign food imports .
Late last month , France 's Groupe Danone said China seized five containers of Evian water in February because of concern over high bacteria levels .
Those came after concerns spiked over the safety of Chinese food exports following the deaths of cats and dogs in North America blamed on tainted pet food ingredients from China .
In recent months , U.S. inspectors have banned or turned away a growing number of Chinese exports , including monkfish containing life - threatening levels of pufferfish toxins , drug - laced frozen eel , and juice made with unsafe color additives .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also stopped all imports of Chinese toothpaste to test for a potentially deadly chemical reportedly found in tubes sold in Australia , the Dominican Republic and Panama .
SuperValu International is part of SuperValu USA , headquartered in Eden Prarie , Minn .
K Max is a subsidiary of Kang Long Group , which is based in San Bernadino , Calif .
The Food and Drug Administration said in 2000 that CMO Distribution Center of America was based in Sarasota , Fla . Copyright 2007 The Associated Press .

“ When you are born , you know nothing . ”
This is the kind of statement you expect to hear from a philosophy professor , not a Silicon Valley executive with a new company to pitch and money to make .
Yet Jeff Hawkins drops this epistemological axiom while sitting at a coffee shop downstairs from his latest startup .
A tall , rangy man who is almost implausibly cheerful , Hawkins created the Palm and Treo handhelds and cofounded Palm Computing and Handspring .
His is the consummate high tech success story , the brilliant , driven engineer who beat the critics to make it big .
Now he ’s about to unveil his entrepreneurial third act : a company called Numenta .
But what Hawkins , 49 , really wants to talk about — in fact , what he has really wanted to talk about for the past 30 years — is n’t gadgets or source codes or market niches .
It ’s the human brain .
Your brain .
And today , the most important thing he wants you to know is that , at birth , your brain is completely clueless .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
After a pause , he corrects himself .
“ You know a few basic things , like how to poop . ”
His point , though , is that your brain starts out with no actual understanding or even representation of the world or its objects .
“ You do n’t know anything about tables and language and buildings and cars and computers , ” he says , sweeping his hand to represent the world at large .
“ The brain has to , on its own , discover that these things are out there .
To me , ” he adds , “ that ’s a fascinating idea . ”
It ’s this fascination with the human mind that drove Hawkins , in the flush of his success with Palm , to create the nonprofit Redwood Neuroscience Institute and hire top neuroscientists to pursue a grand unifying theory of cognition .
It drove him to write On Intelligence , the 2004 book outlining his theory of how the brain works .
And it has driven him to what has been his intended destination all along : Numenta .
Here , with longtime business partner Donna Dubinsky and 12 engineers , Hawkins has created an artificial intelligence program that he believes is the first software truly based on the principles of the human brain .
Like your brain , the software is born knowing nothing .
And like your brain , it learns from what it senses , builds a model of the world , and then makes predictions based on that model .
The result , Hawkins says , is a thinking machine that will solve problems that humans find trivial but that have long confounded our computers — including , say , sight and robot locomotion .
Hawkins believes that his program , combined with the ever - faster computational power of digital processors , will also be able to solve massively complex problems by treating them just as an infant ’s brain treats the world : as a stream of new sensory data to interpret .
Feed information from an electrical power network into Numenta ’s system and it builds its own virtual model of how that network operates .
And just as a child learns that a glass dropped on concrete will break , the system learns to predict how that network will fail .
In a few years , Hawkins boasts , such systems could capture the subtleties of everything from the stock market to the weather in a way that computers now can’t .
Numenta is close to issuing a “ research release ” of its platform , which has three main components : the core problem - solving engine , which works sort of like an operating system based on Hawkins ’ theory of the cortex ; a set of open source software tools ; and the code for the learning algorithms themselves , which users can alter as long as they make their creations available to others .
Numenta will earn its money by owning and licensing the basic platform , and Hawkins hopes a new industry will grow up around it , with companies customizing and reselling the intelligence in unexpected and dazzling ways .
To Hawkins , the idea that we ’re born knowing nothing leads to a technology that will be vastly more important than his Palm or Treo — and perhaps as lucrative .
But wait , your no -longer clueless brain is warning you , does n’t this sound familiar ?
Indeed ,
Hawkins joins a long line of thinkers claiming to have unlocked the secrets of the mind and coded them into machines .
So thoroughly have such efforts failed that AI researchers have largely given up the quest for the kind of general , humanlike intelligence that Hawkins describes .
“ There have been all those others , ” he acknowledges , “ the Decade of the Brain , the 5th Generation Computing Project in Japan , fuzzy logic , neural networks , all flavors of AI .
Is this just another shot in the dark ? ”
He lets the question hang for a moment .
“ No , ” he says .
“ It ’s quite different , and I can explain why . ”

It ’s read by low - level nodes that each see a 4 x 4 - pixel section of the image .
2 ) The low - level nodes pass the pattern they see up to the next level .
3 ) Intermediate nodes aggregate input from the low - level nodes to form shapes .
4 ) The top - level node compares the shapes against a library of objects and selects the best match .
Predict and refine 5 ) That info is passed back down to the intermediate – level nodes so they can better predict what shape they ’ll see next .
6 ) Data from higher - up nodes allows the bottom nodes to clean up the image by ignoring pixels that do n’t match the expected pattern ( indicated above by an X ) .
This entire process repeats until the image is crisp .
— Greta Lorge
Jeff Hawkins grew up on Long Island , the son of a ceaseless inventor .
While working at a company called Sperry Gyroscope in the 1960s , Robert Hawkins created the Sceptron , a device that could be used to ( among other things ) decode the noises of marine animals .
It landed him on the cover of Weekly Reader magazine .
“ I was in the third grade , and there was my dad standing by this pool holding a microphone , ” Hawkins recalls .
“ And a dolphin is sticking its nose out of the water , speaking into it . ”
As a teenager , Hawkins became intrigued by the mysteries of human intelligence .
But as he recounts in On Intelligence , cowritten with New York Times reporter Sandra Blakeslee , for 25 years he pursued his dream to develop a theory of how the brain works and to create a machine that can mimic it as an amateur .
Rejected from graduate school at MIT , where he had hoped to enter the AI lab , he enrolled in the biophysics PhD program at UC Berkeley in the mid-1980s , only to drop out after the school refused to let him forgo lab work to pursue his own theories .
Instead , Hawkins found success in business at Intel , at Grid Computing , and eventually at Palm and then Handspring .
But all along , Hawkins says , his ultimate goal was to generate the resources to pursue his neuro - science research .
Even while raising the first investments for Palm , he says , “ I had to tell people , ‘ I really want to work on brains . ’”
In 2002 , he finally was able to focus on brain work .
He founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute , a small think tank that ’s now part of UC Berkeley , and settled in to write his book .
It was while he was in his PhD program that Hawkins stumbled upon the central premise of On Intelligence : that prediction is the fundamental component of intelligence .
In a flash of insight he had while wondering how he would react if a blue coffee cup suddenly appeared on his desk , he realized that the brain is not only constantly absorbing and storing information about its surroundings — the objects in a room , its sounds , brightness , temperature — but also making predictions about what it will encounter next .
On Intelligence elucidates this intelligence - as - prediction function , which Hawkins says derives almost entirely from the cortex , a portion of the brain that ’s basically layers of neurons stacked on top of one another .
In a highly simplified sense , the cortex acquires information ( about letters on this page , for example ) from our senses in fractional amounts , through a large number of neurons at the lowest level .
Those inputs are fed upward to a higher layer of neurons , which make wider interpretations ( about the patterns those letters form as words ) and are then passed higher up the pyramid .
Simultaneously , these interpretations travel back down , helping the lower - level neurons predict what they are about to experience next .
Eventually , the cortex decodes the sentence you are seeing and the article you are reading .
Considering it came from an outsider , On Intelligence received surprising accolades from neuroscientists .
What critics there were argued not that the book was wrong but that it rehashed old research .
“ Still , ” says Michael Merzenich , a neuroscientist at UC San Francisco , “ no one has expressed it in such a cogent way .
Hawkins is damn clever . ”
As Hawkins was writing On Intelligence , an electrical engineering graduate student named Dileep George was working part - time at the Redwood Neuro - science Institute , looking for a PhD topic involving the brain .
He heard Hawkins lecture about the cortex and immediately thought that he might be able to re-create its processes in software .
George built his original demonstration program , a basic representation of the process used in the human visual cortex , over several weekends .
Most modeling programs are linear ; they process data and make calculations in one direction .
But George designed multiple , parallel layers of nodes — each representing thousands of neurons in cortical columns and each a small program with its own ability to process information , remember patterns , and make predictions .
George and Hawkins called the new technology hierarchical temporal memory , or HTM .
An HTM consists of a pyramid of nodes , each encoded with a set of statistical formulas .
The whole HTM is pointed at a data set , and the nodes create representations of the world the data describes — whether a series of pictures or the temperature fluctuations of a river .
The temporal label reflects the fact that in order to learn , an HTM has to be fed information with a time component — say , pictures moving across a screen or temperatures rising and falling over a week .
Just as with the brain , the easiest way for an HTM to learn to identify an object is by recognizing that its elements — the four legs of a dog , the lines of a letter in the alphabet — are consistently found in similar arrangements .
Other than that , an HTM is agnostic ; it can form a model of just about any set of data it ’s exposed to .
And , just as your cortex can combine sound with vision to confirm that you are seeing a dog instead of a fox , HTMs can also be hooked together .
Most important , Hawkins says , an HTM can do what humans start doing from birth but that computers never have : not just learn , but generalize .
At Numenta ’s Menlo Park , California , offices one afternoon this winter , George showed off the latest version of his original picture - recognition demo .
He had trained the HTM by feeding it a series of simple black - and - white pictures — dogs , coffee cups , helicopters — classified for the HTM into 91 cate - gories and shown zigzagging all over the screen in randomly chosen directions .
The nodes at the bottom level of the HTM sense a small fraction of each image , a four - by four - pixel patch that the node might assess as a single line or curve .
That information is passed to the second - level node , which combines it with the output of other first - level nodes and calculates a probability , based on what it has seen before , that it is seeing a cockpit or a chopper blade .
The highest - level node combines these predictions and then , like a helpful parent , tells the lower - level nodes what they ’re seeing : a helicopter .
The lower - level nodes then know , for example , that the fuzzy things they can’t quite make out are landing skids and that the next thing they see is more apt to be a rear rotor than a tennis racket handle .
On his laptop , George had several pictures the HTM had never seen before , images of highly distorted helicopters oriented in various directions .
To human eyes , each was still easily recognizable .
Computers , however , have n’t traditionally been able to handle such deviations from what they ’ve been programmed to detect , which is why spambots are foiled by strings of fuzzy letters that humans easily type in .
George clicked on a picture , and after a few seconds the program spit out the correct identification : helicopter .
It also cleaned up the image , just as our visual cortex does when it turns the messy data arriving from our retinas into clear images in our mind .
The HTM even seems to handle optical illusions much like the human cortex .
When George showed his HTM a capital A without its central horizontal line , the software filled in the missing information , just as our brains would .
George ’s results with images are impressive .
But the challenge facing any machine intelligence is to expand such small - scale experiments to massively complex problems like complete visual scenes ( say , a helicopter rescuing someone on top of a building ) or the chaotic dynamics of weather .
Tomaso Poggio , a computational neuro - scientist at MIT ’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research , says he ’s intrigued by the theory but that “ it would be nice to see a demonstration on more challenging problems . ”
Similar criticism was aimed at the last promising AI technology supposedly based on the brain : neural networks .
That technology rose to prominence in the 1980s .
But despite some successes in pattern recognition , it never scaled to more complex problems .
Hawkins argues that such networks have traditionally lacked “ neuro - realism ” :
Although they use the basic principle of inter-connected neurons , they do n’t employ the information - processing hierarchy used by the cortex .
Whereas HTMs continually pass information up and down a hierarchy , from large collections of nodes at the bottom to a few at the top and back down again , neural networks typically send information through their layers of nodes in one direction — and if they send information in both directions , it ’s often just to train the system .
In other words , while HTMs attempt to mimic the way the brain learns — for instance , by recognizing that the common elements of a car occur together — neural networks use static input , which prevents prediction .
Hawkins is relying on his own fidelity to the brain to overcome the scale problems of the past .
“ If you believe this is the mechanism that ’s actually being used in the cortex — which I do , ” he says , “ then we know it can scale to a certain size because the cortex does .
Now , I have n’t proven that .
The proof comes in , you know , doing it . ”
Unlike most startups , Numenta has no marketing department , nor even a discernible strategy for recruiting customers .
But who needs marketing when you are deluged by daily emails — many from researchers , engineers , and executives who have read On Intelligence — asking for your technology ?
Already , Numenta is in discussion with automakers who want to use HTMs in smart cars .
Analyzing the data from a host of cameras and sensors inside and outside the car , the system would do what a human passenger can do if a driver ’s eyelids droop or a car drifts from its lane : realize the driver is too drowsy and sound a warning .
Numenta is also working with Edsa Micro , a company that designs software to monitor power supplies for operations like offshore oil platforms and air - traffic controllers .
The firm currently models a power system down to the smallest detail , ensuring it can continue operating during contingencies like power spikes and explosions .
Edsa ’s software also collects data from thousands of temperature , voltage , current , and other sensors .
If that information could be analyzed in real time , it could signal potential power failures .
That kind of analysis is what the company expects Numenta ’s software will do , and Edsa is now setting up customized HTMs for each of the electrical system ’s “ senses . ”
Engineers program the bottom - level nodes to accept information about the power system .
After that , the HTM is fed Edsa ’s historical sensory data , representing the electrical system ’s normal state of affairs .
When the system goes live , most likely in about a year , Edsa hopes it will be able to generalize the sensory data into an understanding of whether an electrical network is running smoothly or is overtaxed .
If the latter , an HTM might send out a signal : Explosion risk high .
“ We ’ve seen some incredible speed improvements , ” says Adib Nasle , Edsa ’s presi-dent , about the work done so far .
“ Some approaches , you give too many examples and they get dumber .
HTM seems not to suffer from that .
It ’s pretty impressive . ”
The graveyard of AI , of course , is littered with impressive technologies that died on the development table .
One ca n’t help thinking of the Sceptron and of Hawkins ’ father holding its microphone up to a dolphin ’s snout .
In 1964 , Sceptron makers promised it would be “ a self - programming , small - size , and potentially inexpensive device operating in real time to recognize complex frequency patterns ” — a device that could someday be used to translate the language of dolphins .
Asked whether , given the fate of past AI promises , he has even the smallest doubt about the theories behind Numenta , Hawkins is unflinching .
“ Is the platform that we are shipping going to be around in 10 years ?

Sandy Berger and the Clinton Cover - Up - Why It Matters
On May 17th , Sandy Berger , President Bill Clinton 's National Security Adviser , voluntarily gave up his law license and with it the right to practice law .
That is a stunning move for an accomplished lawyer , one of the nation 's most influential public officials .
Someone should take note .
In fact , everyone should .
Berger previously entered a deal with the Department of Justice after he was caught stealing and destroying highly sensitive classified material regarding the Clinton Administration 's handling of terrorism issues .
That deal allowed him to avoid jail time , pay a modest fine , and keep his law license .
It also allowed him to avoid full explanation of what he had taken and why he had taken it .
What information was worth risking his reputation , his career , and his freedom to keep hidden ?
And who was he risking that for ?
Recently , the Board of the DC Bar , which had granted Berger his license , began asking those questions .
There was only one way to stop that investigation , to keep from answering questions about what he did and why he did it , to keep the Bar from questioning his colleagues in the Clinton Administration about what had been in the documents Berger destroyed .
Berger took that step , surrendering his license , and stopping the investigation .
Ordinarily , anyone who has spent the time , effort , and money needed to master one of the " learned professions " fights with the utmost determination to keep his license .
That is not merely a ticket to practice your chosen profession - it is also a badge of honor and accomplishment .
Ask any doctor or lawyer , any architect or CPA , any professional at all , what it means to give that up .
That Berger did n't fight speaks volumes .
*******
President Clinton designated Berger as his representative to the 9/11 Commission and related hearings , which gave Berger special access to highly classified documents in the National Archives relating to the Clinton Administration 's handling of al - Qaeda and similar terror threats .
Berger got around rules requiring that the documents only be reviewed with Archives ' employees present , purposefully stole documents , destroyed them , and lied about it all .
When caught , he first blamed Archives employees for misplacing the documents , then admitted having taken them inadvertently ( this is the point at which he cut the plea deal ) , and finally acknowledged what was obvious from the facts that were emerging - he intentionally removed and destroyed documents .
Justice Department officials who investigated the missing documents initially were persuaded that Berger must , as he claimed , have taken documents by mistake and then destroyed them to avoid having sensitive material in his possession .
The plea agreement was based on the assumption that Berger was mishandling classified material - not manhandling it .
Now , however , it is clear that there was nothing innocent or inadvertent in Berger 's conduct .
He has something to hide and , whatever it is , he was terrified that at least some part of it would come out of a non-criminal hearing before the Bar .
With no possible criminal charges to face , he could not have claimed a right against self - incrimination .
He could no longer get away with saying that he took documents accidentally , took them only to prepare for up - coming hearings ( why , then , take five copies of one memo ? ) , or did n't intend to destroy them .
He would , in other words , have had to say more than he has so far .
*******
We do n't know with any certainty what is missing , which papers exactly are gone , or what notes - and whose notes - may have been on them .
Berger 's lawyer asserted that the 9/11 Commission had copies of all the material Berger stole and destroyed .
But if that is so , why would Berger risk so much to destroy it and be so keen today on avoiding any real inquiry into what he did ?
Berger had access to Archives documents that could be critical to understanding what information the Clinton Administration had , what options it considered , and what decisions it took on these sensitive subjects .
In addition to primary documents , Berger had access to copies , and the only plausible reason for taking five copies of a single memo is that some had original notes on them from key officials , maybe from Berger or President Clinton .
For Berger to risk jail and disgrace , to then give up the right to practice his profession merely in order to avoid having to answer questions , he must be hiding something important .
And if it is that important to him , it is also important to us .
The most likely explanation is that the material Berger destroyed points to a terrible mistake by Berger himself , by President Clinton , or by both .
In dealing with al - Qaeda , did they overlook a critical piece of information or miss a chance to stop 9/11 ?
Did the Administration 's failure to take a more aggressive posture encourage al - Qaeda 's later attacks ?
When Fox News ' Chris Wallace raised the possibility that Clinton 's Administration might have done something more to prevent 9/11 , Bill Clinton went into an inexplicable rage on national television .
Wallace touched a nerve .
So did the DC Bar .
Knowing what information Berger destroyed also might alter views of the current Bush Administration .
Was the early support from both Bill and Hillary Clinton for going to war against Saddam based on something we do n't know yet that was available to insiders in the Clinton Administration ?
Was it something that could come back to haunt Hillary and ruin her chances of winning Bill 's third term ?
Whatever it was , it 's likely that what Berger destroyed could have helped us understand what led to the most tragic terror attack in our nation 's history and perhaps also help us decide what course - and what Chief Executive - will best to protect our future .
The fact that Berger has been able to avoid revealing that information is a scandal of its own .
The only person who knows what information was lost is Sandy Berger .
And he is n't talking .
*******
What is at stake is more than what we think and say about Sandy Berger .
It is more than the legacy of Bill Clinton and of George W. Bush .
It is more than the prospects for Hillary Clinton becoming the Democrats ' presidential nominee and ultimately the President .
All of these , of course , are wrapped up in this story .
Our security and vitality of the rule of law in America are at stake as well .
That should concern all whose lives and loved ones may be at risk if our nation follows the wrong path , not knowing everything that should inform our judgments .
It should concern all who respect the law , all who have labored as lawyers and judges , as honorable government officials and voices for even - handed justice .
Sadly , this story does n't interest the Justice Department , which disposed of the criminal charges leniently based in part on false information from Berger .
When faced with the fact that Berger had access to original documents on two occasions before Archives ' employees became suspicious enough to start marking documents , the Justice Department declared with confidence that no documents had been taken - they asked Berger if he had taken anything during those visits , he said no , and they let the matter rest .
The story does n't interest the Democrats in Congress , who prefer spending time investigating why eight political - level appointees were fired - a misstep by the Bush Justice Department that provides more promising political fodder than one that might point back to the Clintons .
The Sandy Berger story does n't interest the mainstream news media , probably for the same reason .
The media elites , so keen in other settings on the people 's right to know , do n't want to know about this .
Maybe if this story involved a Karl instead of a Sandy . . .
Maybe some day someone will step back and wonder why a successful lawyer like Berger would take so drastic a step as surrendering his law license just to evade questions .
Someone will ask what could have been so terrible that it was worth that price to keep it hidden .
Someone will decide that it 's important to know what Mr. Berger is hiding .
Because , in truth , it could affect us all .

A secondary school is to allow pupils to swear at teachers - as long as they do n't do so more than five times in a lesson .
A running tally of how many times the f-word has been used will be kept on the board .
If a class goes over the limit , they will be ' spoken ' to at the end of the lesson .
The astonishing policy , which the school says will improve the behaviour of pupils , was condemned by parents ' groups and MPs yesterday .
They warned it would backfire .
Parents were advised of the plan , which comes into effect when term starts next week , in a letter from the Weavers School in Wellingborough , Northamptonshire .
Assistant headmaster Richard
White said the policy was aimed at 15 and 16 - year - olds in two classes which are considered troublesome .
' Tolerate but not condone '
" Within each lesson the teacher will initially tolerate ( although not condone ) the use of the f-word ( or derivatives ) five times and these will be tallied on the board so all students can see the running score , " he wrote in the letter
" Over this number the class will be spoken to by the teacher at the end of the lesson . "
Parents called the rule ' wholly irresponsible and ludicrous ' .
" This appears to be a misguided attempt to speak to kids on their own level , " said the father of one pupil .
Should have do's and don'ts
Nick Seaton , chairman of the Campaign for Real Education , said : " In these sort of situations teachers should be setting clear principles of ' do and do n't ' .
" They should not be compromising in an apparent attempt to please the pupils .
This will send out completely the wrong message .
" Youngsters will play up to this and ensure they use their five goes , demeaning the authority of the teacher . "
Tory MP
Ann Widdecombe said the policy was based on ' Alice in Wonderland reasoning ' .
" What next ? " she asked .
" Do we allow people to speed five times or burgle five times ?
You do n't improve something by allowing it , you improve something by discouraging it . "
' Praise postcards '
The 1,130 - pupil school , which was criticised as ' not effective ' by Ofsted inspectors last November , also plans to send ' praise postcards ' to the parents of children who do not swear and who turn up on time for lessons .
Headmaster Alan Large said he had received no complaints about the policy .
" The reality is that the fword is part of these young adults ' everyday language , " he said .
" As a temporary policy we are giving them a bit of leeway , but want them to think about the way they talk and how they might do better . "
WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 — The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying rules , overcoming bipartisan reluctance to ban many of the favors that lobbyists do for lawmakers and to illuminate the shadowy legislative practice of earmarking money for special projects .
The Senate ’s action makes the start of the 110th Congress a watershed moment in the history of K Street and Capitol Hill .
Interpreting the results of the Nov. 7 election as a reaction to corruption scandals when Congress was under Republican control , the Senate has joined the House in adopting broad new rules that go beyond the proposals Republicans introduced last year , the ones that Democrats campaigned on , or the extensive changes House Democrats recently passed .
The measure passed around 9 p.m. by a vote of 96 to 2 .
Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , both Republicans , were the only members to vote against the bill .
On Wednesday , Senate Republicans nearly derailed the bill in a dispute over when the Democrats would agree to vote on a Republican proposal , a version of the line - item veto .
At a news conference Thursday , a half - dozen Democratic senators competed to belittle the Republicans ’ line - item veto as “ an excuse , ” “ a ploy , ” “ a subterfuge , ” a “ rabbit out of a hat ” and “ a grand act of ethics hypocrisy . ”
Though not exactly gadget - related , this clip demonstrates just how advanced today ’s high - speed cameras are , with a nifty kernel explosion .

Washington Democrat adds voice to Cheney impeachment drive Michael Roston
Published : Friday June 29 , 2007 Print This Email This A Democratic Congressman from Washington state became the latest Member of Congress to add his voice to the calls for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
The move came the same night that House Democrats failed to unite their party around a measure to cut the funding for the Office of the Vice President in response to Cheney 's declaration that his office was not a part of the executive branch .
Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) declared in an address on the House floor Thursday night that he was in favor of impeaching the vice president .
" It is time for a new exit strategy , one that removes the Vice President of the United States from office , voluntarily , if he chooses , but by impeachment if he stonewalls , " said the Seattle Democrat and Progressive Caucus member .
" I have struggled mightily with this matter for a long time ... Since the President permits the flagrant disregard of the Constitution , it is up to the Congress to act and defend the American people .
With each new revelation , America has seen only glints of what has been done totally in secret . "
McDermott said that he was adding his name to H. Res. 333 , the Articles of Impeachment introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and already supported by nine additional Congress members .
But he also made it clear that he was concerned with crimes beyond those called out in the Ohio Democrat 's legislation .
" The Vice President holds himself accountable to no one , " Rep. McDermott argued .
" He ordered the Secret Service to destroy visitors logs , and we have learned in the Washington Post recently , that the Vice President circumvented every check and balance inside the White House to force through his own agenda , to spy on Americans through illegal wire traps , creating the gulag at Guantanamo , and subverting civil liberties and free speech at every turn . "
Note : Text and video of McDermott 's speech are available at the Congressman 's website .
In a conference call on Thursday afternoon , Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made it clear that the decisions of Democrats like McDermott were not enough to change her mind on impeachment , which she continued to insist was off the table .
" It 's a choice that has to be made , " she said .
" I made a decision ... one year ago that impeachment was something we could not be successful with , and that would take up the time we needed to do some positive things to establish a record of our priorities and their shortcomings .
The president is n't worth impeaching .
If it were the beginning of his term , people might think of it differently , but he's at the end of his term ... the last two years of his term , we just want to be rid of him . "
Rep. supports impeachment , but funded Cheney 's office While McDermott announced Thursday night that he was in favor of impeaching Cheney , he also lined up with 23 Democratic colleagues to defeat an amendment that would have cut all funds for the Vice President 's office in the next fiscal year .
RAW STORY had reported on Thursday that some Democratic leaders expected a party line vote on the amendment to the Financial Services Appropriations bill .
But a curious assortment of Blue Dog Democrats , Congressional Progressive Caucus members , House Committee chairs , and others banded together to produce the 209 - 217 vote against Rep. Rahm Emanuel 's ( D - IL ) amendment .
Reps. David Obey ( D - WI ) and John Murtha ( D - PA ) , powerful members of the House Appropriations Committee who cast a rare vote with Republican lawmakers on the measure , could not be reached for comment Friday .
But McDermott 's spokesman told RAW STORY that he did n't think the amendment was appropriate .
" Rep. McDermott shares the frustration of others with the vice president 's office , but there really was a constitutional question of whether that was possible , " said Mike DeCesare , the Seattle - based Communications Director for the Congressman .
A spokeswoman for Rep. Michael Capuano ( D - MA ) , another Progressive who voted with the Republicans on the measure , also questioned the usefulness of the measure .
" Congressman Capuano believes firmly that the Vice Presidents actions warrant investigation , " said spokeswoman Alison Mills in an e-mail .
" Nevertheless , he did not support eliminating funding for the Office of the Vice President .
He viewed this as merely a symbolic measure that would not produce the results we all desire .
Defunding would not make the Office of the Vice - President transparent or accountable . "
While the measure was defeated , a spokesperson for Rep. Emanuel , the Chairman of the Democratic Caucus , still claimed victory .
" Democrats forced the Vice President to abandon the assertion that he was not part of the executive branch , " the spokesperson told RAW STORY in a statement .
" Democrats will continue to hold the Vice President accountable and fight to ensure our government is open and honest . "
But while Emanuel 's office claimed the Illinois Democrat 's measure had whipped Cheney back into line , the Vice President 's office spun it as a bipartisan victory of their own .
" We are pleased to see a bipartisan majority reject this political stunt , " Cheney spokeswoman Megan McGinn told the Associated Press on Thursday night .
All the Buzz While Americans cheer the imprisonment of Paris Hilton , they have a deaf ear to talk of bombing Iran
by Doug French by Doug French
DIGG THIS
Sitting in a room full of well - educated Americans , I was dumbfounded by the unanimous outrage toward Paris Hilton .
They were actually cheering the fact that the judge was sending her back to jail , after the sheriff had sent her home because of her illness .
Even Democratic presidential hopeful , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , thrust himself into the Hilton limelight , telling the judge in a letter :  Early release from prison sends the message that drunk driving is acceptable , but we are also concerned that the early release of any drunk driver — high profile or not — poses a risk to the general public . 
This whole crazy media circus derives from Ms. Hilton ’s weakness for spirits combined with her eagerness to operate a vehicle .
Hilton , 26 , pleaded no contest in January to reckless driving stemming from a Sept. 7 arrest in Hollywood .
Police at the scene said she appeared intoxicated and failed a field sobriety test , blowing a blood - alcohol level of .08 percent , the minimum level at which an adult driver is in violation of the law .
She did n’t hurt anybody , but still was sentenced to 36 months probation , alcohol education and $ 1,500 in fines .
At the time that the .08 percent standard was put into law in 2000 by Bill Clinton , the National Restaurant Association argued correctly that the standard was absurdly low .
Reportedly , more than 20 percent of all traffic fatalities in the United States are caused by drunk drivers ; however , the average Blood Alcohol Concentration ( BAC ) of fatally injured drivers is 0.17 , with almost half of these having a BAC of 0.20 or higher .
Ms. Hilton can’t weigh 100 pounds .
If she has more than one drink an hour , she ’s defined as legally drunk .
Convicting her because the alcohol content of her blood was .08 rather than .079 , is what is criminal .
Besides , we must take the police department ’s word on this .
Drunk driving laws are arbitrary , capricious and contingent on the judgment of cops and cop technicians .
 Indeed , without the government ’s  Breathalyzer , ’ there is no way to tell for sure if we are breaking the law ,  notes Lew Rockwell .
But while boobus Americanus cheers the imprisonment of a young Hollywood socialite , that same public turns a blind eye and deaf ear to the idea of proposing that America should murder millions of innocent people in Iran if that government develops a nuclear program .
During the early June Republican presidential debate in South Carolina , nine of the 10 candidates supported making a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Iran , a country of 75 million people , which has not declared war on the United States , and has no nuclear weapons .
 Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power ,  Rudy Giuliani said in response to a Wolf Blitzer question .
 I think it could be done with conventional weapons , but you ca n’t rule out anything and you should n’t take any option off the table . 
When Blitzer asked Duncan Hunter ,  If it came down to a pre-emptive U.S. strike against Iran ’s nuclear facility , if necessary would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons ?
Hunter replied ,  I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to pre-empt those particular centrifuges . 
Mitt Romney said he would n’t take options off the table either , and none of the other candidates voiced opposition .
Except , of course , Congressman Ron Paul .
When asked later in the debate :  What is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now ? 
Paul seized the opportunity to express his outrage at his fellow candidates ’ position :  I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote pre-emptive war .
I do not believe that ’s part of the American tradition .
And now , tonight , we hear that we ’re not even willing to remove from the table a pre-emptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security ! 
But average folks are n’t buzzing about bombing Iran back to the Stone Age , the first use of nuclear weapons in war since Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
They have more important things to worry about , like how much time will Paris Hilton do behind bars .
The world would be a much safer place if Giuliani and those other eight bomb Iran candidates were behind bars , and police stopped harassing Paris Hilton and her girlfriends in Hollywood .

The Best of Douglas French
How do you explain to the thousands of American troops now being poured into Baghdad that they will have to wait until the summer for the protective armor that could easily mean the difference between life and death ?
It ’s bad enough that these soldiers are being asked to risk their lives without President Bush demanding that Iraq ’s leaders take any political risks that might give the military mission at least an outside chance of success .
But according to an article in The Washington Post this week , at least some of the troops will be sent out in Humvees not yet equipped with FRAG Kit 5 armor .
That ’s an advanced version designed to reduce deaths from roadside bombs , which now account for about 70 percent of United States casualties in Iraq .
The more flexible materials used in the FRAG Kit 5 make it particularly helpful in containing the damage done by the especially deadly weapon the Bush administration is now most concerned about : those explosively formed penetrators that Washington accuses Iran of supplying to Shiite militias for use against American troops .
Older versions of Humvee armor are shattered by these penetrators , showering additional shrapnel in the direction of a Humvee ’s occupants .
The FRAG Kit 5 helps slow the incoming projectile and contains some of the shrapnel , giving the soldiers a better chance of survival .

Whether free or not , these resources normally come with a license to ensure fair use .
For professionals , understanding the limitations of a license is critical ; with this knowledge , you ’d be surprised by what ’s available .
Understanding copyright and licenses allows us to do what we do best : be creative .
Quick disclaimer : I am not a lawyer !
This is not legal advice , only the results of my own research .
Please always read the entire license of any resource you use .

Copyright And Licensing
When we create something — let ’s say a photograph — we own the copyright , which is our exclusive right as the author to own that work .
We control who else can use our work and in what manner .
For example , I could allow someone to print my photograph or adapt it in a piece of art .
Rather than establishing verbal agreements , I can distribute my work with a license that sets the guidelines for use .
The things that are copyrighted are sometimes referred to as “ intellectual property . ”
Licenses are granted by an authority to allow a usage ; in my case , the use and distribution of resources by the copyright owner ( i.e. me ) .
I may decide to offer my photograph for free or charge a price ; either way , I can include a license to limit usage , and I maintain the copyright .
Just because someone pays money does n’t mean they have full control or rights to what they ’re buying .
Licenses can dictate the number or uses , the bounds of use and even the length of time until the license expires .
Moreover , under “ work for hire , ” the employer holds the copyright , not the author or creative ; in many cases , this is a company ( such as a creative agency ) or its client ( by contractual agreement ) .
In such cases , the creator retains “ moral rights ” to their work , including the right of attribution .
This is partly why published articles refer to the author , although moral rights can include anonymity .
Copyright laws are incredibly complex , but this should be a good start .
What Is “ Fair Use ”
“ Fair use ” is an exception to the exclusive rights held by the copyright owner .
It exists in some countries such as the US and UK .
Under it , in certain cases , using work without permission is possible .
If someone ’s usage is defined as fair use , then they do n’t need to obtain a license .
Essentially , using copyrighted material is a legal right .
Examples of fair use might include :
Educational purposes , such as teaching and student research ;
Making commentary and criticism as part of a news report or published article .
There ’s a misconception that noncommercial or nonprofit use is always acceptable .
It is n’t .
Fair use is a legal term and is judged case by case .
Always research thoroughly if you think your use of copyrighted material is legal .
What Is “ Public Domain ”
Work that falls in the “ public domain ” basically has no copyright owner .
You can use , modify and redistribute it to your heart ’s content .
An author can forfeit their copyright and , thus , put their work in the public domain ( although it ’s not quite that easy , as we ’ll see later ) .
Copyright ownership expires after the author ’s death ( generally 50 to 70 years after death in most countries ) .
Legal Jurisdiction
Every country has its own interpretation of copyright law , but there are many agreements between nations .
Licenses are enforced under copyright law , which is different than contract law .
The distinction here is questionable within certain jurisdictions , each of which applies the law differently .
The Berne Convention ( for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works ) was established in 1886 and is an international agreement that governs copyright .
It states that each member state must recognize the copyright of work from other countries , and it must extend the same rights to foreign work that it gives to those of its own citizens .
It also makes clear a minium standard of protection for copyright owners .
To date , 164 countries have signed this agreement .
Licenses can be limited to certain jurisdictions .
So , while something may be free in one country , the copyright owner could reserve all rights in other countries .
If you ’re reading this , I can guess pretty confidently that you work on the Web and that you are , or will be , purchasing licenses from copyright owners in different countries .
These licenses are bound by the laws of those countries , and you must respect them .
We ’re getting into political and legal territory here .
Remember : if in doubt , get legal advice .
License Terminology
A license can be written from scratch , but most people choose a well - known one .
We ’ll cover the common licenses that relate to our industry of website design and development , specifically those that allow for free usage — “ free , ” meaning that no money is required .
Generally , licenses that govern paid resources are written individually , but all licenses have commonalities .
There is obviously a fundamental difference between , say , development code and stock photography .
So , it should come as no surprise that a range of licenses exist .
Each is tailored to the usage .
Before we dive into them , let ’s go over some common terminology :
“ Copy ” A simple copy of the original work .
” A simple copy of the original work .
“ Modify ” To alter copyrighted work in some way before using it .
” To alter copyrighted work in some way before using it .
“ Derivative work ” The result of modifying copyrighted work to produce new work .
” The result of modifying copyrighted work to produce new work .
“ Distribute ” The act of giving someone your work under a license .
” The act of giving someone your work under a license .
“ Redistribute ” The act of distributing work and its license after obtaining it under license from the original copyright owner .
” The act of distributing work and its license after obtaining it under license from the original copyright owner .
“ Share alike ” Permission to distribute derivative work under the same or a similar license .
” Permission to distribute derivative work under the same or a similar license .
“ Credit ” or “ attribution ” The act of identifying the original copyright owner .
” or “ ” The act of identifying the original copyright owner .
“ Copyright notice ” A written phrase or symbol ( © ) informing of copyright ownership ( not necessarily required by law ) .
” A written phrase or symbol ( © ) informing of copyright ownership ( not necessarily required by law ) .
“
All rights reserved ” A common copyright notice declaring that no usage rights exist ( again , not necessarily required ) .
” A common copyright notice declaring that no usage rights exist ( again , not necessarily required ) .
“ Warranty ” A written guarantee included with the license ( or , usually , not ) .
With this in mind , let ’s start with the creative licenses .
Creative Commons
Lawrence Lessig founded Creative Commons ( CC ) in 2001 to create a series of easy - to - understand copyright licenses for online creative work .
These licenses established the notion of “ some rights reserved . ”
The Creative Commons license has six variations .
It ’s really a collection of licenses that cover particular uses .
These include whether the licensed work can be used commercially , whether it can be modified , and whether derivative work can be redistributed under the same ( or a compatible ) license .
A Creative Commons license can be restricted to certain jurisdictions or apply internationally .
The basic Creative Commons license is CC Attribution .
It allows for all copying , modification and redistribution ( even commercially ) , provided that the original author is attributed ( with no implication of endorsement ) .
Work under CC Attribution is essentially free to use .
The CC Attribution license can be extended to CC Attribution - ShareAlike .
The same rules apply , except that all derivative work must be licensed the same way .
This distinction ensures that all resulting work remains free .
Wikipedia uses this license for its text .
Here are the four other Creative Commons licenses :
CC Attribution - NoDerivs .

As you can see , the Creative Commons licence has six separate versions , all of which at least require attribution to the copyright owner .
You should attribute by citing the title of the work , the copyright notice , the author ’s name and the license name .
For example :
This work includes the photo “ Photo ’s Title , ” available under a Creative Commons Attribution license , © Author ’s Name .
If the original work includes a copyright notice , it must be left intact .
Otherwise , you are free to attribute appropriately .
Also , link to the work and license if possible .
Informing the author is courteous but not required .
CC0 also exists .
It enables copyright owners to waive all of their rights .
It ’s essentially a way of saying that the work is in the public domain and that there are “ no rights reserved . ”
The concept exists because many jurisdictions do n’t have a clear process for putting work in the public domain , and many legal systems actually prohibit the surrendering of lawful rights such as copyright ownership .
The Creative Commons licenses are clear and readable .

Software Licenses
Written code is copyrighted : you own what you write .
Of course , the simplest line of code , like print ( ‘ Hello World ! ’ ) ; , can be rewritten totally independently , without knowledge of the original author , and both parties will own the copyright of their own version ( however worthless it may be ) .
But beyond a few lines , code does become valuable , and distributing it with a license is important .
Other intellectual property laws , such as patents , can also protect software .
Software patent laws are hotly debated in the US , where they are granted .
In many other countries , such as the UK and New Zealand , software cannot be patented .
While copyright is a right , patents must be granted .
Software licenses cover the use of programming code .
If you ’re using a third - party library or elements from an open - source project , your usage must respect the relevant license .
Development licenses generally cover the following points :
How the work and modifications of it can be distributed ,
Whether any derivative work must be made open source ,
What copyright and other notices are required for redistribution .
Software licenses can be defined as “ permissive ” or “ copyleft . ”
The latter removes the right to add further license restrictions upon redistribution .
Below is a quick rundown of common software licenses and how they ’ve evolved over the decades .
MIT License
The MIT license is perhaps the most open of all .
It effectively puts the work in the public domain .
It explicitly gives permission , “ without restriction , including without limitation the rights to use , copy , modify , merge , publish , distribute , sub license , and / or sell copies of the Software . ”
The only condition is that the full copyright notice ( which declares no warranty or liability ) be included .
Work released under the MIT license can be used for anything , including commercial and proprietary software .
BSD License
The BSD license is similar to the MIT license .
The original version , published in 1990 , had four clauses , the last being an “ advertising clause ” stating that all promotional material for derivative work had to refer to the original source .
This was later removed in 1999 in the “ New BSD ” or “ Modified BSD ” license .
What separates the newer three - clause BSD license from the MIT license is a clause stating that the name of the original copyright owner cannot be used to endorse any derivative work without prior permission .
This eliminates any doubt about the right to use the person or organization ’s name .
Whether this clause is even required is debatable , because copyright and trademark laws are separate issues .
Even though the MIT license does not declare this , we cannot assume permission of endorsement .
An additional two - clause “ FreeBSD ” or “ Simplified BSD ” license exists , which omits this endorsement clause and instead includes a disclaimer to disassociate any views made in derivative work from the original copyright owner .
This can be seen as explicitly stating the opposite of an endorsement .
Both the MIT and BSD licenses give us complete freedom to copy , distribute and modify work for any purpose , provided that the original license and copyright notice are included .
Derivative work can be released under another license or as proprietary software .
The Apache License
You can see from the BSD example just how difficult it is to word a license .
There are so many ambiguities and connections to other laws that getting the point across is nearly impossible .
Many more essentially “ free ” licenses have appeared in an attempt to make such intention clear .
The Apache License is a free software license that does not require the same license of derivative work .
This means that code under the license can be used in open , free and proprietary software ( like the MIT and BSD licenses ) .
It imposes the conditions that in any licensed file , all original copyright , attribution and trademark notices must be preserved .
Additionally , with any modified work , a notice of change must be included .
Any existing notices of change must also be kept .
All of these notices must be distributed in a text file and in the source code or documentation .
This requirement to preserve modification notices makes the Apache license different from the MIT and BSD licenses .
It also includes many more legal terms and conditions that ( among other purposes ) dissolves any liability of the original copyright owner .
The Apache license ( version 2 ) is said to be GPL - compatible , meaning that a project containing code licensed under both must also be licensed under GPL version 3 .
GNU General Public License
First written by Richard Stallman in 1989 , the General Public License ( GPL ) is now at version 3 as of 2007 .
It was founded on the principle that we should be free to use , change , share and share changes to free software .
No matter how the software is distributed , it remains free .
This concept is called “ copyleft . ”
The basic principles of the GPL mean that , unlike the MIT , BSD and Apache licenses , work under GPL must remain under this license .
GPL code can be sold , but no proprietary software can be derived from it .
If you distribute any derivative work , then your source code must be made available under the same license .
Essentially , once a work is released under the GPL , it remains GPL and no further restrictions can be applied .
Version 3 of the GPL specifically states that while code under the GPL can be used to implement digital rights management ( DRM ) , using GPL code does not count as effective “ protection , ” and as such , anyone who breaks it cannot be help accountable under digital rights law .
Where Licenses Are Used
We already know that Wikipedia uses the Creative Commons Attribute - ShareAlike license and that Flickr allows users to choose a Creative Commons license .
What else should we know ?
Most JavaScript libraries are available under license by nature .
jQuery , for example , is available under dual license : either MIT or GPL v2 .
Other libraries are available under MIT , such as Modernizr ( which is also under BSD ) , Raphaël and Respond.js ( also under GPL v2 ) .
You can use all of these libraries while reserving rights for your own derivative work , provided that you include the relevant copyright notices for these libraries .
Plug - Ins and Themes
WordPress and Drupal are important ones to note because they ’re available only under GPL v2 .
This means that any derivative work must also be licensed under GPL ; and according to the WordPress license page , this includes all plug-ins and themes :
Part of this license outlines requirements for derivative works , such as plugins or themes .
Derivatives of WordPress code inherit the GPL license . [… ]
There is some legal grey area regarding what is considered a derivative work , but we feel strongly that plugins and themes are derivative work and thus inherit the GPL license .
If you disagree , you might want to consider a non-GPL platform …
Drupal ’s licensing FAQ is more specific about this :
The GPL requires that if you make a derivative work of Drupal and distribute it to someone else , you must provide that person with the source code under the terms of the GPL so that they may modify and redistribute it under the terms of the GPL as well .
However , you are under no obligation to distribute the code to anyone else .
If you do not distribute the code but use it only within your organization , then you are not required to distribute it to anyone at all .
What does this mean ?
If you ’re developing a WordPress or Drupal theme , it must be under GPL .
You can distribute your work , should you choose .
If you ’re developing a theme for personal use or for a client , you have little to worry about because you are not technically “ distributing ” it .
Selling themes on the open market is a gray area , because distribution must be under the GPL .
The GPL allows you to sell this work , but it also allows others to redistribute and sell it , too ; you ca n’t do much about that .
However , theoretically , the only derivative work that falls under GPL is the PHP code ; any images , CSS and other content in your project remain yours .
On top of that , you are free to charge extra for technical support and so on .
Remember that while WordPress is open source and free under the GPL , it is still copyrighted .
You have to respect its chosen license .
Does My Work Need A License ?
If you ’re publishing content online — be it design work , photography , blog articles , audio or video — then the default is “ all rights reserved ” .
Unless you publish it under a license ( or through a Web service that reserves some rights for itself — and most do ) , then only you hold copyright .
That ’s great , but what do you gain by giving others permission ?
In his article “ Pick a License , Any License , ” Jeff Atwood highlights the interesting example of developers who publish code on their blogs .
Unless the developer states otherwise , no one has permission to use that code in their project .
Always consider the benefits of others using and attributing your work : it could be great self - promotion !
It ’s worth noting that you do not need to issue a license in order to give permission for someone to use your work .
Some areas of the law favor verbal and contractual agreements over copyright .
Additionally , when using services such as Twitter and Flickr , you are probably giving those websites full rights to your work as part of their terms of service .
These websites could n’t operate without your content , but they do take every advantage of reserving full rights over the content you publish .
This allows them to develop their service in different ways on the strength of your content .
Take this excerpt from Yahoo ’s terms of service , which Flickr uses :
[ …] you grant Yahoo !
the royalty - free , perpetual , irrevocable , non-exclusive and fully sub- licensable right and license to use , reproduce , modify , adapt , publish , translate , create derivative works from , distribute , perform and display such Content ( in whole or part ) worldwide and / or to incorporate it in other works in any form , media , or technology now known or later developed [… ]
That covers just about everything !
While Flickr allows you to upload photos under a Creative Commons license for others to use , you also grant Yahoo permission to do anything it likes with them .
I ’m not condemning Yahoo for this practice because it ’s common to all Web services .
I ’m just highlight the importance of reading the terms and conditions and understanding where you publish work and what rights you ’re giving away .
Final Thoughts
With this information , you should have a strong understanding of how copyright and licenses work , why they exist and what they achieve .
Ignorance of copyright — as of any law — is no excuse .
By understanding it , we can take advantage of the wealth of creative content across the Web .
If you ’re publishing work online , consider sharing it under a license .
You never know what interesting things people will do with it .
As mentioned , this article is the result of my own research and is not legal advice .
You ’ll need the latter if you ’re unsure about copyright licenses .

HURRICANE RITA : The Latest Storm Update
Before the 2005 hurricane season is done , you might read about Hurricane Alpha .
Each year , 21 common names are reserved for Atlantic Basin hurricanes , with the list arranged alphabetically and skipping certain letters .
Rita is the 17th named storm in the Atlantic Basin this year .
There are only four left .
So what will officials do after tropical storm Wilma develops , assuming it does ?
" We go to the Greek alphabet , " said Frank Lepore , spokesman for the National Hurricane Center .
This gives the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , the United Nations agency responsible for choosing hurricane names , 24 more names to work with , from Alpha to Omega , and including such names as Omicron and Upsilon .
Could happen
This season started out as the busiest ever , with 4 named storms by July 5 .
It never really let up .
" The August update to Atlantic hurricane season outlook called for 18 to 21 , so I would hope it does n't go any higher than that , but it's a possibility , " Lepore said .
The naming of Hurricanes has a long and interesting history .
For many centuries , hurricanes in the West Indies were named after particular Catholic saint 's days on which they occurred .
Hurricane " San Felipe " struck Puerto Rico on September 13 , 1876 .
When another hurricane struck Puerto Rico on the same day more than fifty years later , it was christianed " San Felipe the second . "
Later , latitude - longitude positions were used , but this method quickly proved cumbersome .
Military weather forecasters began giving women 's names to significant storms during WWII , then in 1950 the WMO agreed to an alphabetical naming system , using the military 's radio code .
The first named Atlantic hurricane was Able in 1950 .
Name change
Officials soon realized the naming convention would cause problems in the history books if more than one powerful Hurricane Able made landfall .
So , in 1953 the organization adopted a rotating series of women 's names , planning to retire names of significant storms .
Feminists urged the WMO to add men's names , which was done in 1979 .
The boy - girl - boy - girl naming convention evolved to include French and Spanish names in the Atlantic system , reflecting the languages of the nations affected by Carribean hurricanes .
The twenty - one names reserved each year ( the letters q , u , x , y and z are not used ) are recycled every six years , minus those retired ( such as Hugo and Andrew and , you can bet , Katrina ) .
When a name is retired , the WMO chooses a new name to replace it .
The year with the most documented tropical storms was 1933 , when there were 21 in the Atlantic Basin , but this was before hurricanes were routinely named .
Activity is known to wax and wane in cycles that last decades .
But some studies have suggested that global warming may be causing increases in hurricane intensity and frequency .
Many scientists are skeptical .
Hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 .

Top 10 U.S. Threats
A COUPLE of weeks ago I saw a new scientific paper from Clemson University that struck me as both pioneering and hilarious .
Accompanied by six graphs , two tables and equations whose terms include “ bologna ” and “ carpet , ” it ’s a thorough microbiological study of the five - second rule : the idea that if you pick up a dropped piece of food before you can count to five , it ’s O.K. to eat it .
I first heard about the rule from my then - young children and thought it was just a way of having fun at snack time and lunch .
My daughter now tells me that fun was part of it , but they knew they were playing with “ germs . ”
We ’re reminded about germs on food whenever there ’s an outbreak of E. coli or salmonella , and whenever we read the labels on packages of uncooked meat .
But we do n’t have much occasion to think about the everyday practice of retrieving and eating dropped pieces of food .
Hillary on homosexuality .
I also asked her about the comments by General Peter Pace that homosexulity is " immoral . "
Clinton has opposed the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military , so I asked her if that law -- signed by her husband in 1993 -- was a mistake , and if homosexuality is " immoral . "
" General Pace has clarified his remarks , but let 's not lose sight of the fact that ' Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ' is not working , " she said .
" We are being deprived of thousands of patriotic men and women who want to serve their country who are bringing skills into the armed services that we desparately need , like translation skills .
And one can argue whether it was a good idea when it was first implemented , but we know have evidence as to the fact that we are in a time of war -- when we really need as many people as we can to recruit and retain in an all - volunteer army -- we are turning people away or discharging them not because of what they 've done but because of who they are . "
But is it immoral ?
" Well I 'm going to leave that to others to conclude , " she said .
" I 'm very proud of the gays and lesbians I know who perform work that is essential to our country , who want to serve their country and I want make sure they can . "
SCOTTS VALLEY –
The cats and dogs still carry the stench of urine and feces a day after county Animal Services officers and sheriff ’s deputies rescued them from a filthy Ben Lomond house .
“ Imagine 83 cats living in a house with no litter boxes for two years , and you get the general idea , ” said Todd Stosuy , supervising field ranger for the county Animal Services Authority .
All together , Stosuy found 88 pets – the cats , three dogs and two iguanas – in the house Tuesday afternoon , an incident Animal Services officials have called one of the largest animal hoarding cases in recent memory .
“ This is the most animals we ’ve taken in a hoarding situation , ” said Animal Services spokeswoman Tricia Geisreiter as she surveyed some of the cats they ’ve relocated to the animal shelter in Scotts Valley .
Sheriff ’s deputies were tipped off to the potential problem Tuesday afternoon when someone called and asked that a deputy check on the welfare of the pets and their owner , a woman in her 40s .
Deputy Doug Smith found dozens of cats living throughout the small three - bedroom home on Glen Arbor Road .
“ He described the conditions as `deplorable , ' ” sheriff ’s Sgt. Dan Campos said Wednesday .
The pets lived in two of the bedrooms , the kitchen , bathroom and communal areas the house .
The woman had let the animals basically have run of the home and , in some places , the animal feces was piled 4 - feet deep , according to Animal Services officials .
“ It covered the TV .
It covered the sink , the toilet in the bathroom , ” Geisreiter said .
“ Every surface in the house was covered with feces and urine . ”
Stosuy said he threw away his clothes after spending four hours in the house Tuesday afternoon confiscating 33 cats , two of the dogs and the iguanas .
“ Today when I pulled up to the residence , I could still smell it from the road , ” he said , adding the woman is still living at the house and the building has not been red-tagged .
Fifty cats remain at the house or on the property , and Animal Services officers have set live traps to catch the animals and bring them to the shelter , Geisreiter said .
A family friend also took one of the dogs home .
The animals brought to the shelter were , for the most part , healthy and well - fed , officials said .
The woman told Stosuy she obtained the cats through her work with local animal rescue groups and that all the felines were spayed or neutered .
“ She was very well - intentioned .
These cats are not in poor , poor condition , ” Stosuy said .
The woman had not adopted any of the cats from the Scotts Valley shelter , officials said .
They described her as an “ animal hoarder , ” someone who has a mental illness or compulsion to collect pets .
“ The mind - set of collectors is they ’re the only ones who can care for the animals , ” Stosuy said .
Animal Control officials will keep the pets at the Scotts Valley shelter until their investigation is complete and are coordinating with the Watsonville shelter and the Santa Cruz SPCA to house all of the animals .
The woman could face misdemeanor animal neglect charges but had not been cited Wednesday afternoon , Stosuy said .

A major CIA effort launched last year to hunt down Osama bin Laden has produced no significant leads on his whereabouts , but has helped track an alarming increase in the movement of Al Qaeda operatives and money into Pakistan ’s tribal territories , according to senior U.S. intelligence officials familiar with the operation .
In one of the most troubling trends , U.S. officials said that Al Qaeda ’s command base in Pakistan is increasingly being funded by cash coming out of Iraq , where the terrorist network ’s operatives are raising substantial sums from donations to the anti-American insurgency as well as kidnappings of wealthy Iraqis and other criminal activity .
The influx of money has bolstered Al Qaeda ’s leadership ranks at a time when the core command is regrouping and reasserting influence over its far - flung network .
The trend also signals a reversal in the traditional flow of Al Qaeda funds , with the network ’s leadership surviving to a large extent on money coming in from its most profitable franchise , rather than distributing funds from headquarters to distant cells .
Al Qaeda ’s efforts were aided , intelligence officials said , by Pakistan ’s withdrawal in September of tens of thousands of troops from the tribal areas along the Afghanistan border where Bin Laden and his top deputy , Ayman Zawahiri , are believed to be hiding .
Advertisement
Little more than a year ago , Al Qaeda ’s core command was thought to be in a financial crunch .
But U.S. officials said cash shipped from Iraq has eased those troubles .
“ Iraq is a big moneymaker for them , ” said a senior U.S. counter - terrorism official .
The evolving picture of Al Qaeda ’s finances is based in part on intelligence from an aggressive effort launched last year to intensify the pressure on Bin Laden and his senior deputies .
As part of a so - called surge in personnel , the CIA deployed as many as 50 clandestine operatives to Pakistan and Afghanistan -- a dramatic increase over the number of CIA case officers permanently stationed in those countries .
All of the new arrivals were given the primary objective of finding what counter - terrorism officials call “ HVT1 " and “ HVT2 . ”
Those “ high value target ” designations refer to Bin Laden and Zawahiri .
Advertisement
The surge was part of a broader shake - up at the CIA designed to refocus on the hunt for Bin Laden , officials said .
One former high - ranking agency official said the CIA had formed a task force that involved officials from all four directorates at the agency , including analysts , scientists and technical experts , as well as covert operators .
The officials were charged with reinvigorating a search that had atrophied when some U.S. intelligence assets and special forces teams were pulled out of Afghanistan in 2002 to prepare for the war with Iraq .
Arduous search
Nevertheless , U.S. intelligence and military officials said , the surge has yet to produce a single lead on Bin Laden ’s or Zawahiri ’s location that could be substantiated .
Advertisement
“ We ’re not any closer , ” said a senior U.S. military official who monitors the intelligence on the hunt for Bin Laden .
The lack of progress underscores the difficulty of the search more than five years after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Despite a $ 25 - million U.S. reward , current and former intelligence officials said , the United States has not had a lead on Bin Laden since he fled American and Afghan forces in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan in early 2002 .
“ We ’ve had no significant report of him being anywhere , ” said a former senior CIA official who , like others interviewed for this article , spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing U.S. intelligence operations .
U.S. spy agencies have not even had information that “ you could validate historically , ” the official said , meaning a tip on a previous Bin Laden location that could subsequently be verified .
President Bush is given detailed presentations on the hunt ’s progress every two to four months , in addition to routine counter - terrorism briefings , intelligence officials said .

The presentations include “ complex schematics , search patterns , what we ’re doing , where the Predator flies , ” said one participant , referring to flights by unmanned airplanes used in the search .
The CIA has even used sand models to illustrate the topography of the mountainous terrain where Bin Laden is believed to be hiding .
Still , officials said , they have been unable to answer the basic question of whether they are getting closer to their target .
“ Any prediction on when we ’re going to get him is just ridiculous , ” said the senior U.S. counter - terrorism official .
“ It could be a year from now or the Pakistanis could be in the process of getting him right now . ”
In a written response to questions from The Times , the CIA said it “ does not as a rule discuss publicly the details of clandestine operations , ” but acknowledged it had stepped up operations against Bin Laden and defended their effectiveness .
Advertisement
“ The surge has been modest in size , here and overseas , but has added new skills and fresh thinking to the fight against a resilient and adaptive foe , ” CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said in the statement .
“ It has paid off , generating more information about Al Qaeda and helping take terrorists off the street . ”
The CIA spies are part of a broader espionage arsenal aimed at Bin Laden and Zawahiri that includes satellites , electronic eavesdropping stations and the unmanned airplanes .
Pakistan pullout
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials involved in the surge said it had been hobbled by a number of other developments .
Chief among them , they said , was Pakistan ’s troop pullout last year from border regions where the hunt has been focused .
Advertisement
Just months after the CIA deployed dozens of additional operatives to its station in Islamabad -- as well as bases in Peshawar and other locations -- Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announced “ peace agreements ” with tribal leaders in Waziristan .
Driven by domestic political pressures and rising anti-American sentiment , the agreements called for the tribes to rein in the activities of foreign fighters , and bar them from launching attacks in Afghanistan , in exchange for a Pakistani military pullback .
But U.S. officials said there was little evidence that the tribal groups had followed through .
“ Everything was undermined by the so - called peace agreement in north Waziristan , ” said a senior U.S. intelligence official responsible for overseeing counter - terrorism operations .
“ Of all the things that work against us in the global war on terror , that ’s the most damaging development .
The one thing Al Qaeda needs to plan an attack is a relatively safe place to operate . ”
Advertisement
Some in the administration initially expressed concern over the Pakistani move , but Bush later praised it , following a White House meeting with Musharraf .
The pullback took significant pressure off Al Qaeda leaders and the tribal groups protecting them .
It also made travel easier for operatives migrating to Pakistan after taking part in the insurgency in Iraq .
Some of these veterans are leading training at newly established camps , and are positioned to become the “ next generation of leadership ” in the organization , said the former senior CIA official .
“ Al Qaeda is dependent on a lot of leaders coming out of Iraq for its own viability , ” said the former official , who recently left the agency .
“ It ’s these sorts of guys who carry out operations . ”
Advertisement
The former official added that the resurgent Taliban forces in Afghanistan are “ being schooled ” by Al Qaeda operatives with experience fighting U.S. forces in Iraq .
The administration ’s concern was underscored when Vice President Dick Cheney and Deputy CIA Director Stephen Kappes visited Musharraf in Pakistan in February to prod him to crack down on Al Qaeda and its training camps .
The Pakistani pullback also has reopened financial channels that had been constricted by the military presence .
The senior U.S. counter - terrorism official said there were “ lots of indications they can move people in and out easier , ” and that operatives from Iraq often bring cash .
Advertisement
“ A year ago we were saying they were having serious money problems , ” the official said .
“ That seems to have eased up . ”
The cash is mainly U.S. currency in relatively modest sums -- tens of thousands of dollars .
The scale of the payments suggests the money is not meant for funding elaborate terrorist plots , but instead for covering the day - to - day costs of Al Qaeda ’s command : paying off tribal leaders , hiring security and buying provisions .
Contributors mobilized
Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , as the network ’s Iraq branch is known , has drawn increasingly large contributions from elsewhere in the Muslim world -- largely because the fight against U.S. forces has mobilized donors across the Middle East , officials said .

“ Success in Iraq and Afghanistan is the reason people are contributing again , with money and private contributions coming back in from the Gulf , ” said the senior U.S. counter - terrorism official .
He added that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia also has become an effective criminal enterprise .
“ The insurgents have great businesses they run : stealing cars , kidnapping people , protection money , ” the counter - terrorism official said .
The former CIA official said the activity is so extensive that the “ ransom - for - profit business in Iraq reminds me of Colombia and Mexico in the 1980s and ‘ 90s . ”
U.S. officials got a glimpse of the Al Qaeda leadership ’s financial dependency when American forces intercepted a lengthy letter Zawahiri sent to now - deceased Iraq insurgent leader Abu Musab Zarqawi in 2005 .
In the letter , Zawahiri alluded to financial difficulties , saying “ the lines have been cut off , ” and asked Zarqawi for fresh funds .
“ We need a payment while new lines are being opened , ” Zawahiri wrote , according to a translation released publicly by the U.S. government .
“ So , if you ’re capable of sending a payment of approximately one hundred thousand , we ’ll be very grateful to you . ”
Advertisement
The payments appear to have given Al Qaeda leaders in Iraq new influence in the organization , officials said .
In particular , officials noted that Zawahiri appears to have abandoned his effort to persuade Sunni Arab insurgents not to divide Muslims by striking Shiites , and has more recently moved closer to sanctioning such bloodshed .
U.S. officials believe they had Zawahiri in their sights on at least one occasion .
Acting on reports that Zawahiri was to attend an Al Qaeda gathering in a remote village in northwest Pakistan in January 2006 , the CIA launched a missile strike on the compound , missing Zawahiri but killing a senior Al Qaeda operations commander .
U.S. officials believe Zawahiri changed plans at the last minute .
Within months of that strike , the CIA began sending dozens of additional case officers to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The impetus for the surge is unclear .
Several former CIA officials said it was launched at the direction of former CIA Director Porter J. Goss , and that the White House had been pushing the agency to step up the effort to find Bin Laden .
Advertisement
But the CIA disputed those accounts , saying in its written statement that “ this initiative was and is driven solely by operational considerations . ”
The effort , according to CIA spokesman Gimigliano , grew out of an assessment in mid-2005 in which “ the agency itself identified changes in the operational landscape against Al Qaeda . ”
Several months before the surge , the CIA disbanded a special unit known as “ Alec Station ” that had led the search for Bin Laden .
At the time , the move was seen as a sign that the hunt was being downgraded , but officials said it was a prelude to a broader reorganization .
The surge included what one former CIA official described as a “ new breed ” of spy developed since the Sept. 11 attacks .
These so - called “ targeting officers ” are given a blend of analytic and operational training to become specialists in sifting clues to the locations of high - value fugitives .
The CIA ’s ability to send spies into the tribal region is limited , officials said .
Advertisement
“ We ca n’t go into the tribal areas without protection , ” said the former CIA official who was involved in the planning of the surge .
“ For the most part they have to travel with [ the Pakistan intelligence service ] and their footprint is not small because they ’re worried about getting shot too . ”
Instead , the effort is designed to cultivate sources in the outer perimeters of the security networks that guard Bin Laden , and gradually work inward .
The aim , another former CIA official said , is “ to find people who had access to people who had access to his movements .
It ’s pretty basic stuff . ”

The card , which will be available during the second half of this year , will enable laptop users to connect to Clearwire 's WiMAX network via a standard Type II card .
Clearwire will support Windows XP and Vista with the cards , which will be manufactured by Motorola .
Clearwire is based in Kirkland , WA and provides wireless broadband and VoIP services .
It controls around 15 percent of the US 2.5GHz spectrum and claimed to have over 160,000 wireless broadband customers as of last September .
The company currently offers WiMAX service with download speeds of up to 1.5 M bps in 37 markets across 12 states , which it says covers over 350 towns and cities .
The company is also active in Belgium , Ireland , and Denmark .
The new laptop cards will give Clearwire subscribers " true " portability for the first time .
" We expect the new laptop card to broaden our potential customer base with more opportunities for customers to access and experience our fast , simple , portable , reliable and affordable wireless broadband services , " said Clearwire president and COO Perry Satterlee .
Intel has also announced plans to add WiMAX support to its upcoming Montevina platform .
Slated to ship during the first half of 2008 , Montevina will offer built - in WiMAX support along with 802.11b/ g/n , all in the same piece of silicon .
After a number of fits and starts , it appears as though WiMAX is finally poised to become a significant player on the broadband scene .
Sprint will begin rolling out its new WiMAX network in early 2008 , starting with Chicago and Washington , DC , and hopes to reach 100 million potential customers by the end of 2008 .
My country has been “ torn to shreds , ” said Fouad Siniora , the prime minister of Lebanon , as the death toll among his people passed 300 civilian dead , 1,000 wounded , with half a million homeless .
Israel must pay for the “ barbaric destruction , ” said Siniora .
To the contrary , says columnist Lawrence Kudlow , “ Israel is doing the Lord ’s work . ”
On American TV , former Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu says the ruination of Lebanon is Hezbollah ’s doing .
But is it Hezbollah that is using U.S. - built F - 16s , with precision - guided bombs , and 155 - mm artillery pieces to wreak death and devastation on Lebanon ?
No , Israel is doing this , with the blessing and without a peep of protest from President Bush .
And we wonder why they hate us .
“ Today , we are all Israelis ! ” brayed Ken Mehlman of the Republican National Committee to a gathering of Christians United for Israel .
One wonders if these Christians care about what is happening to our Christian brethren in Lebanon and Gaza , who have had all power cut off by Israeli air strikes , an outlawed form of collective punishment , that has left them with no sanitation , rotting food , impure water , and days without light or electricity in the horrible heat of July .
When summer power outrages occur in America , it means a rising rate of death among our sick and elderly , and women and infants .
One can only imagine what a hell it must be today in Gaza City and Beirut .
But all this carnage and destruction has only piqued the blood lust of the hairy - chested warriors at The Weekly Standard .
In a signed editorial , “ It ’s Our War , ” William Kristol calls for America to play her rightful role in this war by “ countering this act of aggression by Iran with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities .
Why wait ? ”
“ Why wait ? ”
Well , one reason is that the United States has not been attacked .
A second is a small thing called the Constitution .
Where does George W. Bush get the authority to launch a war on Iran ?
When did Congress declare war or authorize a war on Iran ?
Answer :
It never did .
But these neoconservatives care no more about the Constitution than they cared about the truth when they lied us into war in Iraq .
“ Why wait ? ”
How about thinking of the fate of those 25,000 Americans in Lebanon if we launch an unprovoked war on Iran ?
How many would wind up dead or hostages of Hezbollah , if Iran gave the order to retaliate for the slaughter of their citizens by U.S. bombs ?
What would happen to the 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq , if Shi’ites and Iranian “ volunteers ” joined forces to exact revenge on our soldiers ?
What about America ?
Richard Armitage , who did four tours in Nam and knows a bit about war , says that , in its ability to attack Western targets , al - Qaeda is the B team , Hezbollah the A Team .
If Bush bombs Iran , what prevents Hezbollah from launching retaliatory attacks inside the United States ?
None of this is written in defense of Hamas , Hezbollah , or Iran .
But none of them has attacked our country , nor has Syria , whom Bush I made an ally in the Gulf War , and to whom the most decorated soldier in Israeli history , Ehud Barak , offered 99 percent of the Golan Heights .
If Nixon , Bush I , and Clinton could deal with Hafez al - Assad , a tougher customer than son Bashar , what is the matter with George W. Bush ?
The last superpower is impotent in this war because we have allowed Israel to dictate to whom we may and may not talk .
Thus , Bush winds up cussing in frustration in St. Petersburg that somebody should tell the Syrians to stop it .
Why not pick up the phone , Mr. President ?
What is Kristol ’s moral and legal ground for a war on Iran ?
It is the “ Iranian act of aggression ” against Israel , and that Iran is on the road to nuclear weapons , and we ca n’t have that .
But there is no evidence Iran has any tighter control over Hezbollah than we have over Israel , whose response to the capture of two soldiers had all the spontaneity of the Schlieffen Plan .
And , again , Hezbollah attacked Israel , not us .
And there is no solid proof Iran is in violation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which it has signed but Israel refuses to sign .
If Iran ’s nuclear program justifies war , why can not the neocons make that case in the constitutional way , instead of prodding Bush to launch a Pearl Harbor attack ?
Do they fear they have no credibility left after pushing Bush into this bloody quagmire in Iraq that has cost almost 2,600 dead and 18,000 wounded Americans ?
No , Kenny boy , we are not “ all Israelis . ”
Some of us still think of ourselves as Americans , first , last , and always .
And , no , Mr. Kristol , this is not “ our war . ”
It ’s your war .
I still think the decision I made was the right one
Bishop Anthony Priddis
The employment tribunal said John Reaney , 42 , was discriminated against " on grounds of sexual orientation " by the Hereford diocesan board of finance .
Mr Reaney , from Colwyn Bay , Conwy , said he was " delighted " at the decision .
The Bishop of Hereford , the Rt Rev Anthony Priddis , said he was " naturally disappointed " and may appeal .
During the tribunal in Cardiff in April , Mr Reaney said he was questioned by Bishop Priddis on his previous gay relationship during a two - hour meeting on 19 July 2006
It came after he was told he had emerged as the outstanding candidate for the job during an eight - man interview , the hearing heard .
Mr Reaney , whose case was supported by Stonewall , also told the tribunal he was left " very embarrassed and extremely upset " following the meeting and said he felt like " a total waste of space " .
John Reaney said he had been made to feel like a " waste of space "
During his evidence , Bishop Priddis said he had made clear to Mr Reaney that a person in a committed sexual relationship outside of marriage , whether they were heterosexual , homosexual , bisexual or transgender , would be turned down for the post .
But the tribunal found that the bishop should only have considered the present lifestyle of Mr Reaney , who is single , and he should have not questioned his future relationships .
Delivering the judgement , the tribunal said the case would now be listed for a remedy hearing .
" The respondents discriminated against the claimant on the grounds of sexual orientation , " said the judgement .
Mr Reaney , who had already worked in two other Anglican dioceses , where he had been praised for his achievements , said he was delighted .
He said the case " demonstrated to many lesbian and gay Christians working for God within the Church of England that they are entitled to fair and respectful treatment " .
But speaking to a news conference in Hereford on Wednesday , Bishop Priddis said : " I still think the decision I made was the right one . "
" I regret the polarisation of view which takes place when these things happen , " he said , adding he had made the decision after a " great deal of prayer and contemplation " .
' Not exempt '
Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill said the verdict was " a triumph for 21st Century decency over 19th Century prejudice " .
" We 're very happy for John , " he said .
" The tribunal has rightly made clear that the Church of England cannot discriminate against gay people with impunity .
No-one , not even a bishop , is exempt from the law . "
Under the Employment Equality ( Sexual Orientation ) Regulations 2003 , it is illegal to discriminate against people as a result of their sexual orientation , but the law does contain an exemption for organised religion .
Rev Richard Kirker , chief executive of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement , said the bishop should resign .
He said : " This is a just outcome .
The church has brought this humilation on itself .
The case need never have been brought if the church was not institutionally homophobic . "
O kraji dveh fotografij , ki sta se pojavili v Bulvarju v Slovenskih Novicah sem pisal , prav tako sem pisal o komunikaciji z Moniko Viti in Raayem .
V vmesnem obdobju se je dogajalo kar precej aktivnosti .
Raay mi je v dopisovanju preko mailov ponujal kompenzacijo za objavljeni fotografiji in tudi zatrdil da se glede honorarja dogovarjam samo z njim , ko pa sem ga prosil za naslov in davčno številko , kamor naj izstavim račun po veljavnem ceniku , ki je objavljen na blogu , pa se je z njegove strani končala komunikacija .
Prav tako mi je očital , da sem njegov “ poslovni mail ” objavil na spletni strani .
In da sta bili ti dve fotografiji promo material in mi še enkrat zatrdil , da če so fotografije na internetu , to pomeni , da so javna last .
Sicer bi objavil njegov mail , kjer mi je poskušal razložiti še par stvari , ki so nesmiselne , vendar so v njegovi založbi poskrbeli za to , da ga ne bi objavil in sicer s pripisom , ki se ga držim : “ To elektronsko sporočilo in vse morebitne priloge so poslovna skrivnost in namenjene izključno naslovniku .
Če ste sporočilo prejeli pomotoma , Vas prosimo , da obvestite pošiljatelja , sporočilo pa takoj uničite .
Kakr šno koli razkritje , distribucija ali kopiranje vsebine sporočila je izrecno prepovedano . ”
In sledil je ponoven klic na uredništvo Slovenskih Novic .
Še enkrat sem moral napisati mail , z vsemi podatki in težvami s katerimi sem se srečeval , ki ga je prijazna tajnica posredovala odgovornemu uredniku g. Bauerju .
Čez par dni sem dobil klic in dogovorila sva se za sestanek na uredništvu .
G. Bauer se mi je najprej opravičil za nevšečnosti , potem pa me povprašal o znesku , ki ga želim za objavljeni fotografiji .
Povedal mi je , da so takšne fotografije plačane po približno 2000 sit za komad .
Jaz sem mu povedal , da je na blog objavljen cenik in da si želim plačila po takšnem znesku .
Ko sem mu povedal številko je ugotovil , da mu je veliko lažje , če prepusti primer pravnikom in se vse skupaj konča na sodišču .
Glede na to , da se zavedam stroškov , ki bi jih imel z odvetnikom in vsega časa , ki bi ga porabil za to , sem ga prosil , naj sam predlaga ceno za eno fotografijo .
Začela sva z 10 k sit , jaz se nisem strinjal s ponujeno številko , ponudil mi je 15 k sit , pa mi tudi ni bilo dovolj .
Ko sem ga pogledal v oči , ko je rekel , da mi da 20 k sit za eno fotografijo , sem vedel , da je to zadnja cena , ki mi jo je pripravljen ponuditi .
In sem jo sprejel .
40 k sit za dve fotografiji , kateri mi nista niti v ponos , je več kot dovolj .
Seveda sem ga povprašal tudi o sodelovanju , glede na to , da je fotoaparat povsod z menoj .
Rekel mi je , da bo vesel , če mu pošljem mail s kakšnimi zanimivimi stvarmi in da jih bodo objavili brez problema .
Prav tako pa mi je dal nasvet , če se še kdaj zgodi podobna situacija , da se moram vedno pogovarjati samo z odgovornim urednikom in nikoli z nikomer drugim !
Sledil je stisk roke in ponovno opravičilo g. Bauerja !
V tajništvu sem izpolnil še par formalnosti in stvar je bila končana .
Zaključek zgodbe : dejansko se mi v tej celi zgodbi ni šlo toliko za denar , kot pa za princip in raziskovanje težv avtorskih pravic malega , nepomembnega človeka , ki objavlja svoje prispevke pod CC licenco , ki dovoljuje precej stvari , vendar se vseeno pojavijo primeri , ko se tudi to krši .
Kot je napisal Jonas , v svojem postu
Et tu , Novice ; blogerje je potrebno jemati resno !
In to je za blogosfero zelo velika ZMAGA , kajti to je prvi korak na poti osveščanja , da je blog enakovreden drugim medijem in da vse , kar je na internetu , ni javna last !
p.s. : hvala vsem , ki ste me tako ali drugače podprli in mi pomagali pri NAŠI zmagi !
“ Indeed , it is likely to deter and further delay investment , if not rule out many refinery investments completely . ”
Even so , the current cost of gas — which in real terms is approaching the old peak of $ 1.42 a gallon in March 1981 , or $ 3.31 adjusted for inflation — has renewed suspicions that the oil industry is looking for ways to keep profits high by delaying much - needed investments .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , began hearings yesterday on the topic “ Is Market Concentration in the U.S. Petroleum Industry Harming Consumers ? ”
And the House voted yesterday by a narrow margin to penalize any oil companies , traders or retailers found to be charging “ unconscionably excessive ” prices for gasoline and other fuels .
President Bush will probably veto the measure because the White House has said such legislation would amount to price controls .
Experts point to many short - term reasons the United States is running low on gasoline , causing prices to rise : many oil companies are doing maintenance work on refineries ; new federal rules make fuels cleaner but costlier ; and a string of delays , fires and accidents in the industry have reduced supplies just when drivers are starting to hit the road for summer vacations .
Many analysts predict prices will keep rising , then soften later in the summer as demand trails off .
Energy executives dismissed any suggestions that they were intentionally keeping gasoline off the market .
The oil companies say their views on the longer - term prospects for fuel reflect simple economics .
Because of the enormous investments required to expand refineries , they say they have no other choice but to re-examine their plans in light of the calls for more ethanol fuel , regardless of how realistic they may be .
“ The policy environment has shifted dramatically , ” said Mike Wirth , head of global refining business for Chevron .
“ There is a great risk that has been introduced to projects , predicated upon increasing supplies , that the demand may not be there . ”
Today ’s pet industry continues to show strength and future promise , with fashion products becoming a key driver to future growth .

-- As Dogs become a Key Part of People ’s Families , Spending on Dog Fashion Products is on the Risewww.K9Kloud9.comDecember 2006
Over the past few years the pet industry has been evolving as people begin more and more to accept their four legged friends as members of their family .
As a result of the care and attention pet owners give their animals , the pet market has grown considerably over the past several years .
According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association , pet owners will have spent an estimated $ 38.4 billion on their pets this year .
Today ’s pet industry continues to show strength and future promise , with fashion products becoming a key driver to future growth .
Pampering your pooch can range from purchases of fashionable dog apparel , collars , leashes , vogue carriers , jewellery , accessories and even spa products such as lotions , perfumes , robes etc .
With prices ranging from $ 20 to $ 2000 and up , dogs can now outdress many of their owners .
There are a variety of factors contributing to the growth in spending on doggie fashion .
Empty nesters are finding themselves with extra disposable income and are channeling a portion of that towards fashionable pet products ; they are also filling their homes with the sounds of animals now that their children have grown up and moved on .
In addition , with families having fewer children , or waiting a bit later in life to have kids , they are more likely to bring pets into the family and tend to treat these additions like their own children .
Helping the cause , personalities such as Paris Hilton , Martha Stewart , Nicole Ricchi , Paula Abdul and many others as well as movies such as Legally Blonde 1 & 2 , As Good as it Gets , Bringing Down the House and Secondhand Lions to name but a few , have certainly moved dogs into the spotlight .
An added benefit to this booming industry is that with more dogs being accepted as family and deservingly pampered , the variety of products and available services has increased significantly .
Doggie bakeries , dog spas , a long list of dog fashion designers and dog boutiques continue to create a luxury lifestyle for today ’s dog .
Even the number of dog magazines has escalated with fashion coverage offered by publications such as Modern Dog , with cover ’s featuring entertainment ’s top stars and their beloved dogs .
According to Ann - Marie Fleming , Founder of K9Kloud9.com , an online dog fashion retailer and canine community , “ People ’s attitudes towards their dogs has definitely shifted to where the pet ’s role has become as important as any family member , and with this attention comes a desire to bring fashion , style and an overall pampering of their furry companions .
As a result , we are seeing escalating sales for our designer fashion items ranging from jewellery and carriers , to coats and dresses .
It ’s fun for both humans and dogs alike and we see this trend continuing for many years to come .
” Moving forward expect to see more dog friendly cafes , parks , condos , lofts , bakeries and even restaurants .
Dog social activities are also on the rise as many dog lovers work to organize dog groups , weddings , playdates and of course dog birthday parties .

Dit is een verantwoordelijke en veilige manier van spuiten , waardoor u zich geen zorgen hoeft te maken over uw gezondheid .
Latex hecht op vrijwel iedere harde ondergrond en er kan uit elke gewenste kleur gekozen worden .
In tegenstelling tot verven met een kwast of roller , zijn er bij latex geen banen verf te zien .
De spuitapparatuur zorgt er namelijk voor dat de verf gelijkmatig wordt verdeeld .
Daarnaast kan er een groter oppervlakte worden bespoten in een snellere tijd .
In vergelijking met traditioneel schilderen is het object daarom een stuk sneller geverfd .
Dit maakt dan ook dat latex spuiten zeer scherp geprijsd is : al vanaf € 3,50 per vierkante meter .
In veel gevallen is dit al gauw 30 tot 40 % goedkoper dan traditioneel sauzen !
Uiteraard spuiten wij uitsluitend met hoogwaardige en milieuvriendelijke latex op waterbasis .
Wij gebruiken enkel premium kwaliteit merken voor het beste resultaat .
Dit maakt dat latex spuiten een snel en goed alternatief is voor schilderen met een kwast of roller .

Libtask : a Coroutine Library for C and Unix
write event - driven programs without the hassle of events !
available for FreeBSD , Linux , OS X , and Solaris
libtask.tar.gz 386-ucontext.h clock.c power-ucontext.h taskimpl.h COPYRIGHT context .c primes .c tcpproxy .c
Makefile fd.c print .c testdelay .c README httpload.c qlock.c testdelay1.c amd64-ucontext.h makesun rendez .c asm.S mips-ucontext.h task .c channel .c net .c task.h
Libtask is a simple coroutine library .
It runs on Linux ( ARM , MIPS , and x86 ) , FreeBSD ( x86 ) , OS X ( PowerPC x86 , and x86 -64 ) , and SunOS Solaris ( Sparc ) , and is easy to port to other systems .
Libtask gives the programmer the illusion of threads , but the operating system sees only a single kernel thread .
For clarity , we refer to the coroutines as " tasks , " not threads .
Scheduling is cooperative .
Only one task runs at a time , and it cannot be rescheduled without explicitly giving up the CPU .
Most of the functions provided in task.h do have the possibility of going to sleep .
Programs using the task functions should # include < task .h >. * Basic task manipulation int taskcreate ( void ( *f ) ( void * arg ) , void * arg , unsigned int stacksize ) ; Create a new task running f( arg ) on a stack of size stacksize .
void tasksystem ( void ) ;
Mark the current task as a " system " task .
These are ignored for the purposes of deciding the program is done running ( see taskexit next ) .
void taskexit ( int status ) ;
Exit the current task .
If this is the last non-system task , exit the entire program using the given exit status .
void taskexitall ( int status ) ;
Exit the entire program , using the given exit status .
void taskmain ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) ;
Write this function instead of main .
Libtask provides its own main .
int taskyield ( void ) ; Explicitly give up the CPU .
The current task will be scheduled again once all the other currently - ready tasks have a chance to run .
Returns the number of other tasks that ran while the current task was waiting .
( Zero means there are no other tasks trying to run . ) int taskdelay ( unsigned int ms ) Explicitly give up the CPU for at least ms milliseconds .
Other tasks continue to run during this time .
void** taskdata( void ) ; Return a pointer to a single per-task void* pointer .
You can use this as a per-task storage place .
void needstack ( int n ) ;
Tell the task library that you need at least n bytes left on the stack .
If you do n't have it , the task library will call abort .
( It 's hard to figure out how big stacks should be .
I usually make them really big ( say 32768 ) and then do n't worry about it . ) void taskname ( char* , ... ) ;
Takes an argument list like printf .
Sets the current task 's name .
char* taskgetname ( void ) ; Returns the current task 's name .
Is the actual buffer ; do not free .
void taskstate ( char* , ... ) ; char* taskgetstate ( void ) ;
Like taskname and taskgetname but for the task state .
When you send a tasked program a SIGQUIT ( or SIGINFO , on BSD ) it will print a list of all its tasks and their names and states .
This is useful for debugging why your program is n't doing anything !
unsigned int taskid ( void ) ;
Return the unique task id for the current task .
* Non-blocking I/O
There is a small amount of runtime support for non-blocking I/O on file descriptors .
int fdnoblock ( int fd ) ; Sets I /O on the given fd to be non-blocking .
Should be called before any of the other fd routines .
int fdread ( int , void* , int ) ; Like regular read ( ) , but puts task to sleep while waiting for data instead of blocking the whole program .
int fdwrite ( int , void* , int ) ; Like regular write ( ) , but puts task to sleep while waiting to write data instead of blocking the whole program .
void fdwait ( int fd , int rw ) ; Low - level call sitting underneath fdread and fdwrite .
Puts task to sleep while waiting for I /O to be possible on fd .
Rw specifies type of I/O : 'r ' means read , 'w ' means write , anything else means just exceptional conditions ( hang up , etc . )
The 'r ' and ' w ' also wake up for exceptional conditions .
* Network I / O
These are convenient packaging of the ugly Unix socket routines .
They can all put the current task to sleep during the call .
int netannounce ( int proto , char * address , int port )
Start a network listener running on address and port of protocol .
Proto is either TCP or UDP .
Port is a port number .
Address is a string version of a host name or IP address .
If address is null , then announce binds to the given port on all available interfaces .
Returns a fd to use with netaccept .
Examples : netannounce ( TCP , " localhost " , 80 ) or netannounce ( TCP , " 127.0.0.1 " , 80 ) or netannounce ( TCP , 0 , 80 ) .
int netaccept ( int fd , char * server , int * port )
Get the next connection that comes in to the listener fd .
Returns a fd to use to talk to the guy who just connected .
If server is not null , it must point at a buffer of at least 16 bytes that is filled in with the remote IP address .
If port is not null , it is filled in with the report port .
Example : char server [ 16 ] ; int port ; if ( netaccept ( fd , server , & port ) >= 0 ) printf ( " connect from %s : %d " , server , port ) ; int netdial ( int proto , char * name , int port ) Create a new ( outgoing ) connection to a particular host .
Name can be an ip address or a domain name .
If it 's a domain name , the entire program will block while the name is resolved ( the DNS library does not provide a nice non-blocking interface ) .
Example : netdial ( TCP , " www.google.com " , 80 ) or netdial ( TCP , " 18.26.4.9 " , 80 ) * Time unsigned int taskdelay ( unsigned int ms )
Put the current task to sleep for approximately ms milliseconds .
Return the actual amount of time slept , in milliseconds .
* Example programs
In this directory , tcpproxy.c is a simple TCP proxy that illustrates most of the above .
You can run tcpproxy 1234 www.google.com 80 and then you should be able to visit http://localhost:1234/ and see Google .
Other examples are : primes .c - simple prime sieve httpload .c - simple HTTP load generator testdelay .c - test taskdelay ( ) * Building
To build , run make .
You can run make install to copy task.h and libtask . a to the appropriate places in /usr / local .
Then you should be able to just link with - ltask in your programs that use it .
On SunOS Solaris machines , run makesun instead of just make .
* Contact Info Please email me with questions or problems .
Russ Cox rsc@swtch.com * Stuff you probably wo n't use at first * but might want to know about eventually void tasksleep ( Rendez * ) ; int taskwakeup ( Rendez * ) ; int taskwakeupall ( Rendez * ) ; A Rendez is a condition variable .
You can declare a new one by just allocating memory for it ( or putting it in another structure ) and then zeroing the memory .
Tasksleep (r ) ' sleeps on r' , giving up the CPU .
Multiple tasks can sleep on a single Rendez .
When another task comes along and calls taskwakeup ( r ) , the first task sleeping on r ( if any ) will be woken up .
Taskwakeupall(r ) wakes up all the tasks sleeping on r .
They both return the actual number of tasks awakened .
void qlock ( QLock* ) ; int canqlock ( QLock * ) ; void qunlock ( QLock * ) ;
You probably wo n't need locks because of the cooperative scheduling , but if you do , here are some .
You can make a new QLock by just declaring it and zeroing the memory .
Calling qlock will give up the CPU if the lock is held by someone else .
Calling qunlock will not give up the CPU .
Calling canqlock tries to lock the lock , but will not give up the CPU .
It returns 1 if the lock was acquired , 0 if it can not be at this time .
void rlock ( RWLock* ) ; int canrlock ( RWLock * ) ; void runlock ( RWLock * ) ; void wlock ( RWLock * ) ; int canwlock ( RWLock * ) ; void wunlock ( RWLock * ) ; RWLocks are reader - writer locks .
Any number of readers can lock them at once , but only one writer at a time .
If a writer is holding it , there can't be any readers .
Channel * chancreate ( int , int ) ; etc.
Channels are buffered communication pipes you can use to send messages between tasks .
Some people like doing most of the inter - task communication using channels .
For details on channels see the description of channels in http://swtch.com/usr/local/plan9/man/man3/thread.html and http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/ and also the example program primes.c , which implements a concurrent prime sieve .
Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Journalism
Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Journalism on Hiatus for 2020
The Freedom Forum is selling the Newseum building in Washington , D.C. , to Johns Hopkins University , and the Newseum closed to the public on Dec. 31 , 2019 .
As Freedom Forum leaders envision life after the Newseum , they are committed to the foundation ’s role as a defender of First Amendment freedoms for all , undertaking a strategic review to ensure that our programs are effective in supporting that mission .
As part of that review , the Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Journalism will take a one - year hiatus , in 2020 , in training college journalism students and placing them in summer internships at media sites nationwide .
During that one - year break , we will remain in contact with colleges , alumni of the program , which began in 1991 , and will be reaching out to editors , news directors and others across a range of news and information organizations , asking what they need from the Chips Quinn Scholars program to help their work in diversity and inclusion .
The Covid - 19 pandemic has upended the news media industry , accelerating financial troubles and causing widespread job losses and the closure of many publications .
Yet an opportunity emerged from the disruption .
Although the Chips Quinn Scholars Program is on hiatus in 2020 , its leadership saw a way to help a news industry , and some CQS alumni , disrupted by the pandemic .
In partnership with Gannett , veteran alumni of the CQS program volunteered to mentor some of the company ’s summer interns , most of whom work remotely from their homes .
The hope is that the pilot program will benefit all involved : the youngest cohort of journalists as they launch their careers , CQS journalists as they weather the economic disruption and a news media industry in need of resources .

A therapist has been accused of taking advantage of a patient with a split personality - using one of her alter egos for sex , another to be his cleaner and a third to lend him cash for holidays .
When confronted by his alleged victim he refused to comment , saying he had a duty of confidentiality to her other personalities .
The German woman , Monika Mirte , 44 , had gone to qualified psychotherapist Peter Blaeker , 43 , after she was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder .
Much of
the time Miss Mirte was in control , but sometimes she became her other personalities , " Kathrin " , " Finja " and " Leonie " .
She alleges that Blaeker used his knowledge of her condition to use her for sex , housework and loans .
If convicted he faces up to five years in jail .
Miss Mirte said : " It is like there is more than one person in my head and when one of the others is in control , I always have no memory of what happened when I return .
" I found out there were certain personalities he favoured , and he used them to fulfil his wishes .
" He used Kathrin for sex and Finja to do the shopping and pay for it , while Leonie gave him money to travel on holidays to Mallorca and Sylt ( a popular German tourist island ) . "
It is unclear how Miss Mirte became suspicious about her " treatment " but she eventually confronted Blaeker .
She claims the therapist told her he would not discuss the matter because he had a duty of confidentiality to his patients , including her other personalities .
Miss Mirte later gave details to police which are being studied by prosecutors in Cologne .
Spokesman Dr Gunther
Feld said they were considering charges of sexual abuse under duress .
They were also investigating possible fraud .
Miss Mirte 's lawyer , Christine Andrae , said : " So far there are numerous leads to show that the therapist made use of my client 's weakness . "
Blaeker has refused to comment while the case is being investigated .
Psychologist Dr Christian Luedke said : " It is a unique case but it is possible .
" If you know a person has multiple personalities , you can deal with the personality you want by calling that person by name until they take control .
" You can then replace them with another personality by calling the next personality by name . "
Keyboards can harbour germs
A University of Arizona team found the average office desktop harbours 400 times more bacteria than the average office toilet seat .
However , they also found that on average women have three to four times the amount of germs in , on and around their work area .
But men's wallets provided the most fertile bug breeding ground of all .
It is not whether bacteria are present , or how many there are , but what type they are
Professor Sally Bloomfield
International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene
The researchers said women 's habit of keeping snacks in their drawers could explain why their desks were more germ - ridden .
They also warned that make - up and lotions helped to transfer bacteria .
Lead researcher Professor Charles Gerba found that 75 % of female employees kept food in their work area .
He said : " I thought for sure men would be ' germier ' .
" But women have more interactions with small children and keep food in their desks .
The other problem is make - up .
" I was really surprised how much food there was in a woman 's desk .
" If there 's ever a famine , that 's the first place I 'll look for food . "
Professor Gerba added that men's wallets provided a very attractive breeding ground for bugs .
He said : " It 's in your back pocket where it 's nice and warm , it 's a great incubator for bacteria . "
Do n't take risks
Professor Sally Bloomfield , chairman of the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene , said people should not be unduly worried by the findings , as most bacteria did not cause disease .
She said : " It is not whether bacteria are present , or how many there are , but what type they are .
" But if you leave food on your desktop that you would usually put in the fridge at home , then you are asking for trouble . "
The Arizona team took samples from 100 offices at the university and in New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Oregon and Washington .
They swabbed eight sites in each office : the phone , desktop , computer mouse , computer keyboard , exclamation key on the computer keyboard , pen , bottom of desk drawer , and handle of desk drawer .
They also took samples from workers ' personal items .
The mouldiest spot was the bottom of the desk drawer , where many people stash food .
The study was commissioned by disinfectant maker Clorox .
Six Ways to Reduce Your Start - Up Risks
by Leslie Godwin
People typically spend more time planning a vacation than they do their financial future .
The same can be said for the way most people approach a new business .
Here are six ways that you can reduce your start - up risks by working for free .
80 % of new businesses fail each year , according to the Small Business Administration .
Many of these entrepreneurs lose their life savings , years of hard work , and the dream of being their own boss .
An estate planning attorney once told me that people typically spend more time planning a vacation than they do their financial future .
The same can be said for the way most people approach a new business .
There is a very simple step that anyone can take to dramatically reduce the risk of start - up failure .
Volunteering , being an intern , or simply working for someone else in the field you 'd like to enter will give you the experience you need to become an expert before you open the doors of your own venture .
" I was CEO and dog - washer of a rescue group , and brought greyhounds out to meet the public wherever and whenever I could to find them homes , " says Janet Huey who volunteered for 12 years before coming up with the idea for Pet Stuff Resale , which sells sanitized used pet supplies out of several Houston locations .
It was because of her familiarity with pets and the rescue community that she came up with a unique and profitable business idea .
Put Your Experience to Work
Not only does becoming an expert in the business you 'd like to start makes entrepreneurship a lot less risky .
It makes it more likely that you 'll enjoy your work than someone who impulsively starts a new business and does n't realize what difficulties lie ahead .
Here are some of the ways her desire to help a retired racing greyhound find a comfortable couch to call it's own paid off for Janet :
1. Do What You Love for Free to Do What You Love for a Fee
" I had just about given up the idea of making money doing greyhound adoptions , " tells Janet .
" I was being downsized from my sales position at the Lipton Tea company , and I had to get a job .
I started working at a large pet store chain .
One day a customer pointed to a travel kennel and asked , ' Do you know where I can buy one of these used ? '
I started to wonder if selling used pet items might be a business I could start .
If I had n't been doing animal adoption work for years , I never would have come up with the idea for Pet Stuff Resale . "
Opportunities are going to come your way .
If you are in banking , banking opportunities will appear .
By getting involved in doing something you love , even if it 's part - time or a hobby , you put yourself in a position to find opportunities , or create a business concept , doing something you really enjoy .
2. Market Research Made Easy
Because Janet spent the previous 12 years working closely with veterinarians , other rescue groups and animal shelters , pet stores , and pet owners , she had easy access to numerous people who could help her determine :
whether pet owners wanted to buy used pet items
where to focus initial efforts
how to attract her best customers
Targeted and valid market research tells you what problems to expect , and what questions to ask to prevent the ones that could kill your business before it starts growing .
If you investigate both the market for your services / products and prospective referral sources , the numbers in your business plan will actually be useful instead of wishful thinking .
3. Referrals : Put Your Fan Club to Work
Would n't you feel more comfortable creating a new business if you knew there were many well - respected people who thought you 're terrific , and who have gotten to know your dedication and professionalism over a period of years ?
You can jump - start a new business if you have a small network of people ready to make referrals and become your customers .
Referrals from people who believe in you and want you to succeed are far more effective than any amount of advertising .
The pet experts with whom Janet had been networking for years knew that she was honest , detail oriented , and loved pets .
They were glad to help her get started .
" Janet is a woman of integrity and strong beliefs , " says Dr. Darren Williams , DVM of Mayde Creek Animal Health Center in Katy , Texas .
" I know my clients will be treated fairly . "
Her brightly colored brochures are given out by vets , rescue groups , and others who love to tell their customers what a gem she is .
4. Know Your Niche
Selling is educating !
And the more you know , the better an educator you 'll be .
If you love what you do , it 's rewarding and fun to share useful information with others .
" It took me a long time before I felt comfortable calling myself an expert , " says Janet .
" Women are n't used to tooting their own horn . "
Now that she 's more at ease in her role as pet expert , she knows that she 's not a ' salesperson ' to her customers .
She 's an animal lover and trusted resource .
When she makes recommendations , it 's similar to a doctor giving advice to a patient .
Her customer feels that with her expert advice , they can make the right decision about what to purchase for their pet .
5 . Be in Two Places at Once
" I can't tell you how often I hear , ' I got your info from the treat lady , ' " Janet says .
The treat lady is Greta Kirkland , also based in Houston , who met Janet shortly after she adopted a greyhound and borrowed a racing blanket from her .
Greta is the founder of Raleigh B's , and makes handmade , all - natural dog treats .
" When I 'm helping customers choose treats for their dog , it often becomes obvious that they can utilize Janet 's Pet Stuff Resale for items they either have or need , " tells Greta .
" One of her brochures goes in the bag with every purchase , and I have a display of them on my info table as well . "
As both the owner and only employee , Janet has to be careful to maximize her time and energy .
Having a networking partner like Greta lets her be in two places at once without losing the personal touch .
6. Perfect Pitch
Harder to pitch : " I have a new business .
You should have me on your T.V. show . "
Easier to pitch : " I 've got some adorable rescued greyhounds for adoption , and your show could help the public see what great pets they are ! "
" It was so much easier to promote my business once I had the experience promoting greyhound adoption .
Plus the media was more receptive to my business because they knew about my rescue endeavors . "
It did n't hurt that the journalists covering her greyhound work loved the dogs .
" I 'm still in touch with the reporter that interviewed me at the greyhound rescue in 1990 .
And a couple of newspaper people adopted dogs from me . "
Now when Janet sends a press release to her media contacts , she 's likely to get a return phone call .
And because she learned the ropes of promotion as a volunteer , no one expected her to craft the perfect press release .
Many entrepreneurs are not experienced at doing their own P.R.
Because they have n't budgeted for an outside service , they get very little or no press for their business .
If you 're involved in a community organization , religious group , or any cause you care about , offer to help them with publicity .
If they already have a P.R. person , act as their assistant .
If not , read some books about preparing press releases and press kits , and talk to volunteers helping other groups get their message out .
Pretty soon , you 'll know the finer points of publicizing any business .
Just Do It
There are lots of reasons why NOT to start out as a volunteer or work at an existing business .
You may think you do n't have enough time .
Or you can't stand working for someone else another moment .
Or , like a young engaged couple that does n't want pre-marital counseling , preparing to avoid failure seems " unromantic " when things feel so right .
But if you want to have interesting problems to solve , and avoid the financial and emotional pain of failure , the most productive step to take is to learn the ropes as a volunteer or employee .
Janet went from being over 40 , laid off , and computer - phobic , to creating a growing business that brings her tremendous satisfaction .
Because she volunteered to work at something she loved , she learned on - the - job lessons that many entrepreneurs encounter when the stakes are much higher ­ after they have started their business .
And she 's no longer computer - phobic .
" Greta surprised me and registered a website for me . "
I 'll bet she asked her network of vets , customers , animal shelters and rescues , and pet stores for input before she launched her website , http://www.petstuffresale.com/.
Janet 's tips for bringing home your new puppy
Only buy metal or ceramic bowls .
Plastic absorbs bacteria , and can cause gum infections .
When housebreaking your puppy , if you are crate training , do n't speak to them while letting them out .
They 'll get excited and could pee in their crate .
The same goes for when you just get home .
Use an I.D. tag even if your dog has a microchip .
Microchips are embedded in the skin and have to be scanned by a device .
The tag is visible to any passerby .
People are more likely to help a lost pet than a stray .

Leslie Godwin , MFCC , is a Career & Life - Transition Coach specializing in helping people put their families , values , and principles first when making career and life choices .

A lthough immoral , external military operations of past empires often proved profitable , and therefore justifiable on economic grounds .
Military actions abroad usually brought economic benefits not only to the imperial ruling classes , but also ( through " trickle - down " effects ) to their citizens .
Thus , for example , imperialism paid significant dividends to Britain , France , the Dutch , and other European powers of the seventeenth , eighteenth , nineteenth , and early twentieth centuries .
As the imperial economic gains helped develop their economies , they also helped improve the living conditions of their working people and elevate the standards of living of their citizens .
This pattern of economic gains flowing from imperial military operations , however , seems to have somewhat changed in the context of the recent U.S. imperial wars of choice , especially in the post - Cold War period .
Moralities aside , U.S. military expeditions and operations of late are not justifiable even on economic grounds .
Indeed , escalating U.S. military expansions and aggressions have become ever more wasteful , cost - inefficient , and burdensome to the overwhelming majority of its citizens .
Therefore , recent imperial policies of the United States can be called parasitic imperialism because such policies of aggression are often prompted not so much by a desire to expand the empire 's wealth beyond the existing levels , as did the imperial powers of the past , but by a desire to appropriate the lion 's share of the existing wealth and treasure for the military establishment , especially for the war - profiteering Pentagon contractors .
It can also be called dual imperialism because not only does it exploit the conquered and the occupied abroad but also the overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens and their resources at home .
Since imperial policies abroad are widely discussed by others , I will focus here on parasitic military imperialism at home , that is , on what might be called domestic or internal imperialism .
Specifically , I will argue that parasitic imperialism ( 1 ) redistributes national income or resources in favor of the wealthy ; ( 2 ) undermines the formation of public capital ( both physical and human ) ; ( 3 ) weakens national defenses against natural disasters ; ( 4 ) accumulates national debt and threatens economic / financial stability ; ( 5 ) spoils external or foreign markets for non-military U.S. transnational capital ; ( 6 ) undermines civil liberties and democratic values ; and ( 7 ) fosters a dependence on or addiction to military spending and , therefore , leads to an spiraling vicious circle of war and militarism .
( The terms domestic imperialism , internal imperialism , parasitic imperialism , and military imperialism are used synonymously or interchangeably in this article . )
1. Parasitic Imperialism Redistributes National Income from the Bottom to the Top
Even without the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which are fast surpassing half a trillion dollars , U.S. military spending is now the largest item in the Federal budget .
President Bush 's proposed increase of 10 % for next year will raise the Pentagon budget to over half a trillion dollars for fiscal year 2008 .
A proposed supplemental appropriation to pay for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq " brings proposed military spending for FY 2008 to $ 647.2 billion , the highest level of military spending since the end of World War II - higher than Vietnam , higher than Korea , higher than the peak of the Reagan buildup . " [ 1 ]
The skyrocketing Pentagon budget has been a boon for its contractors .
This is clearly reflected in the continuing rise of the value of the contractors ' shares in the stock market : " Shares of U.S. defense companies , which have nearly trebled since the beginning of the occupation of Iraq , show no signs of slowing down .
. . .
The feeling that makers of ships , planes and weapons are just getting into their stride has driven shares of leading Pentagon contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. , Northrop Grumman Corp. , and General Dynamics Corp. to all - time highs . " [ 2 ]
But while the Pentagon contractors and other beneficiaries of war dividends are showered with public money , low - and middle - income Americans are squeezed out of economic or subsistence resources in order to make up for the resulting budgetary shortfalls .
For example , as the official Pentagon budget for 2008 fiscal year is projected to rise by more than 10 percent , or nearly $ 50 billion , " a total of 141 government programs will be eliminated or sharply reduced " to pay for the increase .
These would include cuts in housing assistance for low - income seniors by 25 percent , home heating / energy assistance to low - income people by 18 percent , funding for community development grants by 12.7 percent , and grants for education and employment training by 8 percent . [ 3 ]
Combined with redistributive militarism and generous tax cuts for the wealthy , these cuts have further exacerbated the ominously growing income inequality that started under President Reagan .
Ever since Reagan arrived in the White House in 1980 , opponents of non-military public spending have been using an insidious strategy to cut social spending , to reverse the New Deal and other social safety net programs , and to redistribute national / public resources in favor of the wealthy .
That cynical strategy consists of a combination of drastic increases in military spending coupled with equally drastic tax cuts for the wealthy .
As this combination creates large budget deficits , it then forces cuts in non-military public spending ( along with borrowing ) to fill the gaps thus created .
For example , at the same time that President Bush is planning to raise military spending by $ 50 billion for the next fiscal year , he is also proposing to make his affluent - targeted tax cuts permanent at a cost of $ 1.6 trillion over 10 years , or an average yearly cut of $ 160 billion .
Simultaneously , " funding for domestic discretionary programs would be cut a total of $ 114 billion " in order to pay for these handouts to the rich .
The projected cuts include over 140 programs that provide support for the basic needs of low - and middle - income families such as elementary and secondary education , job training , environmental protection , veterans ' health care , medical research , Meals on Wheels , child care and HeadStart , low - income home energy assistance , and many more . [ 4 ]
According to the Urban Institute­Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center , " if the President 's tax cuts are made permanent , households in the top 1 percent of the population ( currently those with incomes over $ 400,000 ) will receive tax cuts averaging $ 67,000 a year by 2012 .
. . .
The tax cuts for those with incomes of over $ 1 million a year would average $ 162,000 a year by 2012 . " [ 5 ]
Official macroeconomic figures show that , over the past five decades or so , government spending ( at the federal , state and local levels ) as a percentage of gross national product ( GNP ) has remained fairly steady - at about 20 percent .
Given this nearly constant share of the public sector of national output / income , it is not surprising that increases in military spending have almost always been accompanied or followed by compensating decreases in non-military public spending , and vice versa .
For example , when by virtue of FDR's New Deal reforms and LBJ 's metaphorical War on Poverty , the share of non-military government spending rose significantly the share of military spending declined accordingly .
From the mid 1950s to the mid 1970s , the share of non-military government spending of GNP rose from 9.2 to 14.3 percent , an increase of 5.1 percent .
During that time period , the share of military spending of GNP declined from 10.1 to 5.8 percent , a decline of 4.3 percent . [ 6 ]
That trend was reversed when President Reagan took office in 1980 .
In the early 1980s , as President Reagan drastically increased military spending , he also just as drastically lowered tax rates on higher incomes .
The resulting large budget deficits were then paid for by more than a decade of steady cuts on non-military spending .
Likewise , the administration of President George W. Bush has been pursuing a similarly sinister fiscal policy of cutting non-military public spending in order to pay for the skyrocketing military spending and the generous tax cuts for the affluent .
Interestingly ( though not surprisingly ) , changes in income inequality have mirrored changes in government spending priorities , as reflected in the fiscal policies of different administrations .
Thus , for example , when from the mid 1950 to the mid 1970s the share of non-military public spending rose relative to that of military spending , income inequality declined accordingly .

The first steps that our earliest human ancestors took on two legs may arguably be the biggest ever , for both a man and mankind .
Why the switch from all fours to just two limbs ?
The answer , according to a new study published today in : to save a few calories .
Anthropologist Herman Pontzer and colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis compared the energy expended when chimpanzees walk on either four or two legs with that used by humans walking upright .
Their findings : people use a whopping 75 percent less oxygen , a direct measure of energy use , than chimps do perambulating on either two or four legs .
The study is the best evidence yet to support energy saving as the driver for bipedalism in our ape ancestors .
It shows savings occur in hominins ' upright posture , a result of lengthening leg bones and outward tilting pelvises .
" Since we can understand how anatomy drives the energy cost , we can ask what evolution would tinker with to make bipedalism cheaper , " says Pontzer whose used high speed video and biomechanical measurements to show that chimps sauntering on two legs used the large muscles of their hips causing them to expend more energy than humans who confine most of their stepping movement to the small muscles in their ankles .
Humans also take long strides compared with chimps ' quick , short energy - guzzling steps .
The last common ancestor shared by humans and chimps lived about five million years ago , during a time when Earth was becoming dryer , the rainforest was shrinking , and sources of food were becoming fewer and more widely scattered .
Scientists have long hypothesized that hominins evolved to bipedalism to save energy as they faced longer and longer treks to find food .
Daniel Schmitt , a biological anthropologist at Duke University , says that Pontzer 's study is important because it demonstrates how incremental changes in both femur ( thighbone ) length and pelvis tilt save energy .
" He 's created a way to continue being a biped once you start , " Schmitt says .
In contrast to earlier findings that bipedalism may have evolved in treetops , this study says that upright locomotion may have evolved in a four - legged , knuckle - walking ape ancestor .
Bipedalism is one of the first specifically hominin qualities that developed after our ancestors and ape ancestors split from one another .
" What 's cool about bipedalism is that it 's first , " Pontzer says .
Now , he adds , we have a possible reason and mechanism for its evolution .
Congress is back from its July 4 break and with it more bluster and political posturing on changing course to keep things the same , including everything not working in place .
It 's the same old scheme , back again , to fool enough of the people all the time and most all of them long enough to move on to the next change of course mission shift starting the whole cycle over again .
Even the blind can see the hopelessness of staying the course in Iraq .
Aside from its lawlessness and immorality , pushing on with a failed effort qualifies as a classic definition of insanity - continuing the same failed policies , expecting different results .
The only sensible , honorable option is a full , speedy withdrawal along with providing multi-billions for Iraqis to rebuild what we destroyed and have no intention restoring now or ever beyond what 's needed for permanent occupation .
The only other honorable option is owning up to what no one in Washington or the major media will do - that the Iraq and Afghan conflicts are illegal wars of aggression making those responsible for them in the administration and Congress war criminals warranting prosecution for their crimes .
That wo n't happen nor will the administration and Congress do anything more substantive than say one thing and do another .
It 's been an unbroken pattern since 9/11 , and especially on Afghanistan and throughout the run-up to the Iraq invasion .
Both wars were sold through lies and deceit .
They 're based on a fictitious " outside enemy " threat without which no " war on terrorism " could exist , and no imperial foreign wars could be waged .
They 're possible only by scaring the public enough to believe the threat is still real , and " Enemy Number One " Osama bin Laden ( recruited through Pakistan 's ISI as a CIA asset in the 1980s ) and Al - Queda represent it .
So with Saddam gone and no WMDs found , staying the course is vital to the nation 's security even when , in fact , the truth is the opposite , crying wolf 's wearing thin , and selling snake oil solutions get harder to do .
But schemers keep trying with complicit Democrats as much part of the scam as Republicans and Bush loyalists , dwindling down to a precious hard line few but still around in key positions making noise .
With " the walls of Jericho " crumbling around him as the world 's most hated man and the ship of state listing badly , a pathetic caricature of a president keeps pleading for more time .
He claims it 's needed to head off the threat of " mass killing on a horrific scale " in Iraq and plenty at home as well .
He then continues using the same timeworn line that the war can be won , the " surge " is working , give it a chance , and withdrawing will be disastrous .
Be more patient , and we 'll know more in September we 're told .
The Iraqi puppet government gets blamed for what 's gone wrong with no one in Washington pointing the finger where it belongs .
George Bush can do no better than keep asking Congress and the public " to give ( generalissimo ) David Petraeus a chance to come back ( September 15 ) and tell us whether his ( unworkable ) strategy is working , and then we can work together on a way forward ( further over the cliff ) . "
At his July 12 news conference , he never mentioned and attending shameless journalists never pressed him on CIA Director Michael Hayden 's earlier bleak assessment of things on the ground .
He called the Iraqi puppet government " unable to govern " and its inability to do it " irreversible . "
Also not discussed was the July UN refugee agency 's plea for doubling its Iraq funding to $ 123 million for the growing humanitarian needs of an estimated 2000 people fleeing uncontrollable violence in the country daily ( 60,000 a month ) and an estimated four million or more displaced refugees within and outside the country .
No comment or questions were raised either on what journalists Chris Hedges and Laila Al - Arian ( daughter of US political prisoner Sami Al - Arian ) reported in the July 30 issue of The Nation .
Based on interviews with 50 returning Iraq combat veterans ( ranking from privates to captains ) , they wrote about " disturbing patterns of behavior by American troops " and an indiscriminate use of force ( with pictures to prove it ) amounting to a " depraved enterprise . "
Mentioned were accounts of American troops gratuitously killing Iraqi civilians , including children , that these actions are common , go unreported , are rarely investigated , and almost always go unpunished .
George Bush 's comments ( and most others ) ignore as well that over 7 in 10 Americans favor a force withdrawal , over 60 % say the war was a mistake , only one in five believe the " surge " improved things , and new polls keep showing the numbers getting worse the longer the conflict continues .
It 's got the president 's approval rating barely above the lowest ever registered since polling began with Richard Nixon , Harry Truman , during the unpopular Korean war , Jimmy Carter , briefly in 1980 , and his own father sharing bottom honors .
Maybe George Bush is kept above rock bottom through some creative manipulation of the data or the result of what questions were asked , to whom , the phrasing used , and the order in which they were presented .
It seems likely for the most despised , distrusted and disgraced US president ever .
Even clever pollsters , however , can't salvage Dick Cheney 's rating .
At a bottom - scraping 12 % reported , it 's the lowest number scored for a president or vice - president ever , by far and then some .
The reason is simple .
A decisive majority in the country think the war 's unwinnable , was a mistake , want it ended , and know it was based on lies .
People resent being had .
Even through heavily filtered mainstream news reports , they know the situation on the ground is out of control and an appalling US - inflicted crime against humanity atrocity of enormous proportions .
No one in Iraq is safe anywhere , even in the heavily secured , fortress - like Green Zone becoming more like a embattled one daily with regular attacks on it causing damage , injuries and deaths .
Few are reported , but one on July 10 was with two to three dozen katyusha rockets and mortar rounds striking inside the world 's " ultimate gated community " killing at least three persons and wounding 25 or more .
Throughout the country , violence long ago spiraled out of control , and since the " surge " began in February , even the Pentagon admits things are worse , not better , in its quarterly April - June report to Congress .
It contradicts generalissimo Petraeus ' claim of " astonishing signs of normalcy " in Baghdad overall and " breathtaking " progress even though he ( and others high up ) earlier said repeatedly there 's no military solution to the conflict .
The only thing " breathtaking " about Petraeus is his inconsistency and that he 's either more incompetent than Custer at the " Little Bighorn " or a man who'll say anything to please George Bush .
On the ground , in fact , civilian deaths are higher than ever .
They number well over 5000 a month known about and countless others never reported , the claimed June numbers notwithstanding that are too low to be believed and should be discounted and ignored as meaningless .
In addition , US forces are sustaining more attacks and suffered the highest level of listed fatalities and injuries in the latest three month April - June period since the war began .
Nearly everyone outside the administration and Congress knows the war is lost , but no one 's brave enough to admit it or do anything about it .
So shifting mission means " damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead " with the dominant media always in tow to shape the facts on the ground to fit the policy .
Admiral Farragut would be proud .
Now it 's back to the political drawing board with a repackaged new scheme certain to end up little different from the last one .
Ideas floating promise a substantial drawdown of troops leaving behind what 's claimed is needed to maintain security for the Iraqi people that 's killing thousands of them every month .
All NATO combined can't contain the hate and growing opposition in both war zones matched against any size occupying force put in place to contain them .
Iraq and Afghanistan have a long history of resisting occupiers and a successful record of ousting them in the end .
It will be the same this time as earlier after many more lives are lost in a futile effort to prove otherwise .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , the struggle for liberation is on the ground .
At home , shifting mission is being concocted by scared politicians up for reelection in 2008 .
They 'll face millions of angry voters fed up with wars they want ended and ready to throw out the bums who wo n't do it .
So it 's back to political posturing ( again ) with Democrats and Republicans trying to convince voters this time they mean it , and what they say is what they 'll follow through on .
It 's the same old repackaged scam in the nation 's capitol where nothing can be taken on its face .
It 's high time the public realized the criminal class there is bipartisan , and nothing short of a new breed of uncorrupted officials will change things .
And that wo n't happen until enough fed up voters elect them .
For now it 's business as usual , and summer battle lines have the " intrepid " Democrat - led Congress and a few nervous Republican defectors facing off with the Bush administration on the FY 2008 DOD budget .
It calls for an astonishing $ 648.8 billion plus an additional $ 142 billion war supplemental likely to end up topping $ 800 billion when the dust settles and usual pork is added in .
Debate will play out the same as last year with Democrats in the end failing to use the one constitutional power Congress alone has - the appropriation authority to cut off funding and end the Bush administration 's imperial adventurism once and for all .
No money , no wars , that simple .
It 's apparently too simple , and all that 's likely ahead is more disingenuous posturing over restricting troop deployments and setting an open - ended timetable for an unspecified partial withdrawal at the discretion of the administration taking full advantage to do as it pleases .
And if that does n't work , George Bush promises to veto any legislation setting timelines for withdrawal he 'll ignore even if overridden .
On July 10 , he repeated his earlier statements that Iraq troop levels " will be decided by our commanders on the ground ( obeying White House orders ) , not by political figures in Washington , DC " ( except him , Dick Cheney and their hard line cronies .
The president has no more to fear from " opposition " Democrats and " defecting " Republicans than he had before , but he 's quivering anyway .
Their posturing ( and his ) is as phony now as immediately post - 9/11 in selling the Afghan war and enacting police state laws .
It 's as bad as in pre-March , 2003 , last year 's budget debate , and this spring 's agreement to continue funding through September with George Bush certifying ( on his word alone ) progress is being made and Iraqis are carrying their share of the burden that 's impossible because the world 's only superpower can't handle its own .
But note Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's compromising language with a September 15 administration / Pentagon accountability report upcoming : " The war is headed in a dangerous direction , and Americans are united in the belief that we cannot wait until the administration 's September report before we change course in Iraq . "
His next statement shows he's not preaching pullout but only says " We can not ask our military to continue to fight without a strategy for success ( never mind there is none short of full , unconditional withdrawal ) , and we certainly cannot ask them to fight before they are ready to do so . "
He 's referring to deployment lengths ( unchanged after July 11 Senate amendments were blocked ) and concern for a broken military the Pentagon already admits to .
The likely outcome of current debate will be the same quick fix as before , save for a few dubious amendments achieving nothing .
In the end , the compromise solution will be to kick the can down the road and throw lots more money at the problem hoping it will go away .
It 'll only get worse .
No amount can salvage a lost war , lawmakers and the Pentagon know it , but solutions like last year and this spring are coming with bloated budgets getting more bloated .
Ignore meaningless party line votes like the one the House passed July 12 for withdrawing most combat troops by April 1 , 2008 .
Not while this administration 's in power , and so far , the Senate 's going nowhere .
It ca n't get the 60 votes needed to prevent a Republican promised filibuster , and votes cast in both Houses are to deceive voters , not get action .
They 're made knowing they 're safe with George Bush promising to veto any change of course and can make it stick .
The wars will thus continue to progress in an endless cycle of more spending with no results beyond growing deficits , intensifying public anger , greater violence on the ground , and defeats getting worse as the conflicts drag on .
George Bush calls it " progress .
I know we can succeed in Iraq , and I know we must " he said on July 12 .
Incredibly , he claimed it on eight trivial military benchmarks under US control , blaming eight more important political failures on the Iraqi puppet government in charge of little more than cleaning daily rubble and dead bodies off streets .
He added results to date are a mixed bag and overall it's too early to pass judgment - after over four disastrous years of failure and a conflict longer in duration than WW II when war raged on three continents against formidable enemies , and it was no simple task beating them .
It again proves this man is unchallenged as a world champion serial liar .
By now , he may believe some of his own lies the way writer Alex Cockburn said Ronald Reagan believed his .
" Truth ( for the great fabricator ) was what he happened to be saying at the time .
He ( and Bush ) went one better than George Washington in that he could n't tell a lie and he could n't tell the truth , since he could n't tell the difference between the two . "
There is a difference , however , between the two deceivers .
During his first term at least , Reagan ( as a former actor , albeit a B - rated one ) did a reasonable job impersonating a president .
He could find his " mark " and read his lines .
George Bush never rose to that level even as Texas governor or any other time in his life , and when it comes to lying , he can't stop doing it even when he knows the difference .
He proved it July 12 in his ludicrous portrayal of the true state of things in Iraq .
It 's part of his desperate effort for new congressional funding in even greater amounts .
To get it , he ignores growing public disenchantment and deep revulsion about a criminal lost cause enterprise launched and continued on the basis of lies .
That notwithstanding , Reid and other Democrats have their grandiose notions of mission shift .
It 's to avoid " a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq " with legislation he 'll propose calling for permanent occupation forces on the ground for the spurious notion of " conduct ( ing ) counterterrorism operations , protect ( ing ) our assets ( meaning oil ) and train ( ing ) Iraqi forces . "
Senate Armed Services Committee chairman , Carl Levin is on board with him .
He 'll support a limited troop withdrawal by late year , an end to combat operations on the ground by April 30 , 2008 with Iraqi forces taking over , and a large remaining permanent occupation force hunkered down inside fortified super - bases .
Never mind what Iraqis want that excludes our presence in their country .
And the same is true for the Afghans .
Voices from the administration , Pentagon , Congress and the dominant media assure they 'll be disappointed as the top goal is salvaging America 's imperial adventurism and mission shifting current operations into a workable permanent occupation .
Here 's why .
The Afghan and Iraq wars are for resources , primarily oil , and in the parts of the world where more than four - fifths of proved reserves are located .
Canadian journalist and author Linda McQuaig explains the grandest of grand prizes is " hidden in plain sight " in Iraq .
It 's the country 's oil treasure - the planet 's last remaining bonanza of easily harvested " low - hanging fruit " with more potential reserves than Saudi Arabia , the great majority of them untapped .
It makes the country " the most sought after real estate on the face of the earth " according to one Wall Street oil analyst she quoted .
Even with dated information on its potential , it 's known Iraq has at least 10 % of dwindling world reserves .
But it 's potential was " frozen in time " with no new development in over two decades because of intervening wars in the 1980s , economic sanctions following the Gulf war in 1991 , and the current war ongoing since March , 2003 .
If the country 's potential doubles or triples , as Saudi Arabia 's did in the last 20 years , it would , in fact , have the world 's largest ( mostly untapped ) proved reserves making Iraq too rich a prize for America and its Big Oil allies to pass up .
It 's worth trillions of dollars and immense geopolitical power at a time of peak oil in the face of future dwindling supplies , except in this resource - rich country the US wo n't ever leave as long as there 's enough of them in the ground and region to justify staying .
It 's why the country is being turned into a giant permanent military base protecting the ocean of oil beneath it Washington intends to control for its Big Oil friends and to have veto power over who gets it , who does n't , and at what price .
To understand what 's happening , consider Korea .
The US arrived in the country in 1950 following Harry Truman 's committing American forces to help the South after Washington 's instigated civil war began there on June 25 that year .
Fifty - seven years later , around 37,000 troops still remain with no intention to leave .
Washington has the same thing in mind for Iraq .
The Pentagon set up shop there and intends to stay .
Below is shown , as best we know , how far advanced we 've come toward militarizing the country for permanent occupation no matter how debate plays out in Congress .
It 's all bluster providing cover for administration policy both parties support .
Plan Iraq - Permanent Occupation
Drawdowns , withdrawal , timelines , mission shifting , building democracy and all the other current and long - standing phony rhetoric aside , America is in Iraq to stay as a conqueror and occupier - that is , until Iraqis finally kick us out as they will in time in a part of the world long a graveyard for foreign invaders .
But it wo n't happen quickly or before countless more thousands die , are injured , suffer immeasurably , are displaced , and lose everything .
This is the ugly dark side of imperialism , nurtured on conquest , unchallengeable control , and keenly focused on destroying and permanently occupying the cradle of civilization now smashed and planned for dismemberment .
In the meantime , a new " peace candidate " will become president in January , 2009 on the strength of distant echos of Richard Nixon 's " peace with honor " 1968 campaign and hopes history would call him a " peacemaker . "
Instead , there were five and one - half more years of intense war , thousands more American deaths , and one to two million more Southeast Asian victims in Vietnam and the secret wars in Cambodia and Laos .
Whatever little , if anything , a new president does at home , the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan will remain with plans for Iraqi forces eventually to do most of our killing and dying for us .
If or when they 're up to it , the scheme involves US troops staying hunkered down inside their super - bases , used as needed outside them , with massive air power deployed freely to slaughter innocent victims on the ground whenever they resist what no one should ever have to endure .
For now , Iraqis have no choice but to bear up and fight back because it's their misfortune to have an ocean of " our " oil beneath their sand we laid claim to .
Already discussed is Iraq 's importance as the planet 's last remaining " low - hanging fruit " bonanza of mostly untapped oil riches worth trillions of dollars as the key reason America came to stay .
The US military arrived in March , 2003 and dug in for the long haul with fixed military installations around the country .
Dick Cheney 's former employer , Halliburton , got most of the huge no - bid contracts , worth many billions , to war - profiteer and build them , irrespective of its outlandish record of waste , fraud and abuse .
As of May , 2005 , US forces were operating out of 106 bases around the country from an original estimated 120 sites .
They range in size from the huge Main Operating Base ( MOB ) Camp Victory complex near Baghdad airport where thousands of American troops are stationed to smaller ones known as Forward Operation Sites ( FOS ) that are still major installations .
In addition , there are many Cooperative Security Locations ( CSL ) that are small outposts for as few as 500 personnel , a number of prisons and detention facilities , and an original dozen sites given to Iraqi military or police units that now likely number many more .
Reports vary , and much remains secret , about the administration and Pentagon 's current and future construction plans for Iraq .
What is known is $ 18 billion earlier was allocated for in - country work that includes base installations , the US Embassy and whatever other occupation facilities are intended .
The current figure is likely much higher .
It 's also known US engineers are focusing on building 14 large " enduring bases " for extended encampments for the tens of thousands of US forces there now and future replacements .
Professor Emeritus Jules Dufour of the University of Quebec , Canada discussed " The Worldwide Network of US Military Bases " in his July 1 , 2007 article posted on Global Research.ca .
It included detailed information plus maps and much more on what he called " the Worldwide development of US military power ( in place ) to view the ( entire ) Earth surface as a vast territory to conquer , occupy and exploit ( for giant US corporate behemoths it 's in league with ) . "
He characterizes the scheme as a process of " Humanity .... being controlled and enslaved by this Network of US military bases . "
He and Chalmers Johnson believe they number 1000 or more that , according to Johnson , were in 153 countries as of September , 2001 and now likely in 160 or more .
There are also many other secret , espionage , and other bases jointly used in many countries with their hosts .
Dufour says post - 9/11 , the US built 14 new bases in the Persian Gulf region .
It 's also involved " in construction and / or reinforcement of 20 bases ( 106 structured units as a whole ) in Iraq " plus others in Afghanistan and other Central Asian former Soviet bloc countries and elsewhere to encircle and control both regions ' strategic resources , mainly oil , and the pipeline routes needed to transport it .
Iraq bases are located or are being built around Baghdad , Mosul , Taji , Balad , Kirkuk , Nasiriyah , Tikrit , Fallujah and Irbil .
There are also plans to rebuild and improve Baghdad , Mosul and other airfields as well as rebuild roads and other essential infrastructure strategically needed for occupation .
There are no plans to help the Iraqi people left on their own .
They have the barest of essential services , and infrastructure to provide them , like functioning hospitals , medications , electricity , clean water , safe food to eat , fuel , schools , and most everything else .
Most important for the planned long haul will be four to six or more super - sized bases on the order of small towns with their own neighborhoods and kinds of amenities found in typical US ones .
Inside them , it 's hard distinguishing between Iraq and America unless more sophisticated and better aimed rocket and mortar rounds strike nearby that 's becoming more common .
The biggest of these bases so far is the huge Balad one .
It houses the major Air Force operation in the country , including its new spacious , state of the art , " Kingpin " air traffic control center dividing the country 's airspace into " kill boxes , " called the Common Grid Reference System .
The largest Army logistical support center is here as well , and it's also where thousands of civilian contractors , in neighborhoods known as " KBR - land , " are based with all the comforts of home for them and military personnel when it 's quiet inside .
The so - called secret Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force ( CJSOTF ) is also at Balad .
It 's kept behind " especially high walls " for privacy and seclusive separation from other operations based there .
The al - Asad airbase is the largest marine encampment in the country located in western Anbar province where resistance to US occupying forces has been stiffest .
It , too , has a hometown feel with similar amenities to the country 's other major bases intended to be permanent .
While the Pentagon wo n't admit it , four super - bases were operating last year with plans likely for at least two more .
In addition , it was planned , but now not certain , that British forces would maintain a permanent military presence in the south around Basra where it 's now based .
If Britain pulls out , as its public demands , the Pentagon will move in and likely expand the facilities with at least another super - sized one for that strategically oil - rich part of the country .
They 'll need it as the Brits are no more in control there than US forces anywhere else .
Their 2006 Operation Sinbad flopped with militias on the ground in full control .
Nonetheless , America came to Iraq to stay as long as the Middle East is resource - rich and the greatest untapped portion by far is in Iraq .
But history shows the best - laid plans do n't always work out as intended .
Occupiers are n't welcome anywhere with Iraq and Afghanistan particularly adept at expelling earlier ones that tried and failed , including the British from both countries who should know better .
Journalist Felicity Arbuthnot notes on Global Research.ca July 14 that on this day in 1958 , " the Iraqi army toppled the British ( post WW I - imposed ) royal regime , which had opened the door wide for Western monopolies to plunder the country 's oil wealth under unjust concession . "
Her message to modern - day plunderers : " Listen to history . "
Permanency may only be in the eyes of the beholder and may end much sooner than planned .
Our super - bases , with all their size , security and comforts of home , may become no more permanent than their mega- predecessors in Danang , Cam Rahn Bay and the Saigon embassy ( a miniature compared to the Vatican - sized behemoth in Baghdad 's Green Zone ) where the last remnants of US presence in Vietnam were helicoptered from its rooftop in defeat and humiliation .
It forced us to give up what we intending keeping unchallenged with visions as conquerors no different than today .
In the end , we abandoned them because we were beaten and had no other choice .
What a determined third - world Asian country did 30 years ago to the world 's strongest superpower , Middle East and Central Asian ones are doing today to the only remaining one slipping fast and running out of excuses why .
It 's just a matter of time before history repeats with the same result .
Iraqis and Afghans believe it and intend to prove it again .
Too bad Washington hard - liners know little history and have n't figured it out .
One day they will .
They 're just slow to catch on .
Ruling empires never see the tide turning and that they 're swimming against it .
George Bush 's America is no different .
It bit off more than it can swallow and will end the same as others wrecked on the shoals of their own hubris .
The scene is playing out in the graveyard of other imperial powers in the Middle East and Central Asia .
It just remains for the final chapter to be written ending rest in peace unless Americans locate their cajones and write their own version first .
It has to reject corrupted power politics ; remove the criminal class ; restore the rule of law ; place the rights of humanity and democratic values above wealth and privilege ; and end forever the hellish wars fought for them .

A Cypress man charged in the death of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant said Saturday that he was doing God 's work when he went to a Montrose - area bar last month , hunting for a gay man to kill .
" I believe I 'm Elijah , called by God to be a prophet , " said 26 - year - old Terry Mark Mangum , charged with murder June 11 . " ... I believe with all my heart that I was doing the right thing . "
Interviewed in the Brazoria County Jail Saturday morning , Mangum said he feels no remorse for killing 46 - year - old Kenneth Cummings Jr. , whom relatives described as a " loving " son who never forgot a holiday and a devoted uncle who had set up college funds for his niece and nephew .
He worked at Southwest for 24 years .
Mangum , who described himself as " definitely not a homosexual , " said God called on him to " carry out a code of retribution " by killing a gay man because " sexual perversion " is the " worst sin . "
Mangum believed Cummings to be gay .
" I planned on sending him to hell , " he said .
Cummings disappeared June 4 .
His charred remains were found June 16 , buried on a 50 - acre ranch near San Antonio owned by Mangum 's 90 - year - old grandfather .
Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri
Yenne would not comment on the case , citing a gag order issued by a judge Saturday afternoon .
The Chronicle was unable to reach Mangum 's attorney , Perry Stevens .
Mangum — who claimed he has studied the Bible for " thousands and thousands and thousands of hours " — said God first commanded him to kill during a " visitation , " or dream , while he was in prison in 2001 .
He said his victim must be a man because men " carry the harvest of the sinner . "
After six months ' planning , Mangum said , he went to E.J.'s , a Montrose - area club , where he met Cummings .
After they drank a couple of beers , he said , the two went to Cummings ' home in Pearland .
Mangum said he stabbed Cummings with a " 6 - inch blade . "
" It 's not that I 'm a bad dude , " he said , expressing concern that people might view him as " strange . "
Pausing briefly , he said , " I love God . "
When police searched Cummings ' home , they found traces of blood that someone had tried to clean up , as well as evidence that a struggle had taken place , according to court documents .
Mangum became a suspect not long after Cummings disappeared , for reasons officials have declined to disclose .
Tim Miller , executive director of Texas Equusearch , which found Cummings ' remains , said last month that Mangum had used Cummings ' credit cards to buy lighter fluid , a flashlight and hydrogen peroxide while he was en route to dispose of the body outside San Antonio .
When credit card records showed that the cards had been used near San Antonio , investigators ran a property - records search that led them to the ranch owned by a Robert Mangum , Miller said .
Store video also showed that the person using the cards appeared to be Terry Mangum , investigators have said .
Cummings ' remains were soon found in a shallow grave .
The Facts , the daily newspaper in Brazoria County , has reported that Mangum told investigators he did not kill Cummings .
Mangum first said he killed Cummings , during a jailhouse interview Friday with that paper .
He is being held on $ 500,000 bail .

Grand Illusion
The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11
HarperCollins
New York , 2006
The major question to ask yourself in deciding whether to read Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins ' Grand Illusion is " how angry can I stand to get ? "
Despite knowing several ways that Rudy Giuliani's image of 9/11 heroism was false , I had always believed George W. Bush to be the politician who most exploited that tragedy for his own political benefit , despite having been culpable through his own negligence .
Having read this book , I would have to elevate Rudy Giuliani to a solid tie with Bush .
The myth :
It was Rudy Giuliani 's story of quick response and personal fearlessness that provided a clean and reassuring narrative .
When he stood up that day , covered in soot , he embodied the resolve of the nation .
His name became the one Americans would instinctively connect to that date .
A few months later , Time magazine would pick him as Person of the Year over Bush and the other finalist , Osama bin Laden .
Barrett and Collins destroy this myth methodically , chapter by chapter , in detail almost too great to comprehend or bear .
Despite the fact that the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993 , the year Giuliani was elected mayor , he never made terrorism a priority or moved to correct the deficiencies the 1993 bombing revealed in the city 's emergency response .
In 2001 , New York City was therefore completely unprepared as it faced an act of terrorism that had been foreshadowed and even partially enacted years before .
The Office of Emergency Management , which he subsequently touted as the centerpiece of his supposedly - effective 9/11 response , was slow to be established and was given insufficient authority over the police and fire departments , which feuded constantly .
Giuliani's war with the Port Authority left him unwilling or unable to see the WTC as a potential target for terrorism and took Port Authority resources that would otherwise have been used for security .
The fire department continued using radios that had been antiquated in 1993 and that were not interoperable with police department radios .
As a result , firefighters had no chance to hear warnings from police helicopters that the South Tower appeared ready to collapse .
Giuliani's insistence that the city 's emergency command center be within walking distance of City Hall led to its location in WTC 7 , right next to the city 's major terrorist target .
The building 's lack of suitability for such purposes combined with Giuliani 's willingness to violate safety standards led to the location of an oversized , insufficiently - protected fuel tank aboveground .
In the name of getting back to normal , rescue and cleanup workers and the residents of lower Manhattan were not warned about air quality problems .
Residents were encouraged to clean their own apartments despite evidence that the dust and debris coating them was toxic .
Workers at Ground Zero were not made to wear safety equipment long after the urgent attempts to rescue survivors had ended .
Giuliani's management of all these issues was marked by laziness , vain attention to pet projects ( the command center at WTC 7 had a private suite with monogrammed towels and a cigar humidor ) and wanton disregard for any project that did not satisfy his vanity .
The levels of cronyism in his administration were such that while it was not corrupt in the sense of personally enriching Giuliani , it is difficult to think of another word for the process that surrounded him with the likes of Bernie Kerik .
Once his efforts to unlawfully extend his term as mayor were rebuffed , Giuliani turned to blatantly capitalizing on the reputation of 9/11 heroism he so patently did not deserve to earn tens of millions of dollars as a consultant furthering exactly the kinds of cronyism and poor management that had contributed to the many tragedies of 9/11 .
Barrett and Collins devote their greatest energy to documenting all of these oversights , only rarely pausing to highlight the blatant untruths Giuliani has told in cementing his heroic myth .
But then , they can count on their readers knowing that myth intimately , while the gross negligence it hides is known by very few .
The book is strongest in laying out this negligence in the period between 1993 and September 2001 , when Giuliani had every reason to be concerned about terrorism but gave it very little attention .
Barrett and Collins do identify crucial ways Giuliani mismanaged events on 9/11 itself , but these are mistakes made in the midst of crisis , portrayed as human and understandable .
The real mistakes had been made long before .
In the years since 9/11 the media has too often turned its back on any attempt at oversight of government .
This failing made them complicit in the Bush administration 's drive to war with Iraq , and , as this book makes all too clear , it has also made them complicit in the elevation of Rudy Giuliani to top - tier presidential candidate .
As the book demonstrates , we may have as much to fear from a Giuliani presidency as from the Bush presidency , and for many of the same reasons .
It ’s all so confusing .
Just two weeks ago , Rudy came out opposed to civil unions , even though he was previously for civil unions .
Now today Rudy is again for civil unions .
While it ’s nice that Rudy is finally telling the truth about his being a liberal , it ’s still disturbing that he ’s flip - flopped twice in the past two weeks on this issue .
He did the same thing on abortion ( the media has been paying attention to the abortion flip - flop , but missed the gay one ) .
So which Rudy is which , why did he flip flop ( twice ) , and how do we know he wo n’t flip flop again when it ’s next convenient ?
I mean , the man lied to the American people during the presidential debate , got caught , and now is changing his position again as a result .
Lying is kind of a big deal .
Last week , we brought you a report from the floor of the massive NXTcomm trade show in Chicago , an event where FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein took the stage and announced his support for " open access " in the new 700 MHz wireless auction .
During the event , Adelstein talked more broadly about his view that government could have a legitimate role to play in setting targets and in helping to create truly competitive markets , but his conclusions were repeatedly ( but politely ) challenged onstage by his debate partner , John Kneuer , head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration .
Only days later , Kneuer got rattled and began shouting down questioners at another tech conference in San Francisco .
Kneuer believes that network neutrality , open access rules , and similar ideas only have a place in " command and control " economies .
Apparently FCC rulemakings are only good for dirty socialists and massive companies like Time Warner , AT&T , and Verizon .
The Register , which had a reporter at the event , has a nice writeup of Kneuer 's reaction when pressed by network neutrality advocates .
As he made clear in both Chicago and San Francisco , the Bush administration believes in free markets and absolutely minimal government regulation .
Oddly , this leads them to support the telecom and cable companies , which are hardly competitive in any real sense of the word when it comes to US broadband .
Instead , what we have is a duopoly between cable and DSL for the vast majority of US citizens .
That 's one of the reasons that concerns about network neutrality have taken root .
Network neutrality can be defined in several ways , several of which may in fact be bad for end users .
But when companies start talking about " charging Internet firms to use our pipes " and letting " the market sort it all out , " consumers and small business owners get nervous when they have limited ISPs to choose from .
Will my webmail run more slowly if Google does n't " pay up " ?
Will the flash videos on my small business web site load so slowly that people wo n't make use of them unless I cough up ( a second time ) for bandwidth ?
Will I have to pay for better speeds on every major US network ?
What about internationally ?
Will my own Internet access be free if you 're now charging the websites on the other end of the network ?
After the issue became a political hot potato in the last year , cable companies and telcos in the US have largely backed off from their wilder statements .
Now , a UK analyst says that the " charge Web companies for faster access " idea could still become a reality .
Ian Fogg of Jupiter Research warned that a " two - tier Internet " could be in everyone 's future , as ISPs wo n't be able to resist the lure of all that potential cash for much longer .
In other comments posted on his blog , Fogg also notes what anyone with a wireless data plan has noticed : the wireless industry already has more restrictions than any other ISP and exerts plenty of control already about what sites work well over their networks .
" Early indications are that the mobile Internet will not mean the whole Internet , " he writes , " unless consumers and regulators fight for it . "
And the " regular " Internet could soon follow suit .
But regulators in the US have different visions about what their jobs should be .
Adelstein has made it clear that he does not support heavy - handed regulation , and he went out of his way in Chicago to make the point that the FCC should only help to create a playing field on which companies can compete and consumers can benefit ; prescribing technologies is not what the agency should be doing .
Kneuer sees even this as problematic .
In San Francisco , referring to the 700 MHz auction , he said that " if there is a pro-consumer benefit to open access and if consumers need and want that , the carrier that brings that to consumers will have a powerful need and advantage and bring competitive pressures on other access layer providers . "
This is n't truly a free market , though , and it wo n't be anytime soon .
Whoever wins the FCC auction will control their piece of the spectrum and will control it like a dictator .
Other entrants simply cannot set up shop and start offering service , and to pretend that they can and that the market will therefore produce the best of all possible situations for consumers seems disingenuous .
If the FCC awards the spectrum simply to the highest bidder , it could easily be snapped up by companies like AT&T , companies that might have more interest in protecting their cell phone and DSL business than in opening up an independent third high - speed pipe to the home .
And what would the market do about that , exactly ?
The same issue hovers over the network neutrality debate , where the main US ISPs do n't compete in a market where they can be easily challenged by new entrants if they engage in anti-consumer behavior .
Do we need regulation ?
Maybe not .
Companies in the US at least currently seem to be on good behavior , knowing as they do that the attention of the FCC and of Congress is upon them .
If we can achieve the positive effects of regulation without the unintended consequences that such rules can sometimes bring , then perhaps we 're in a good enough position already .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday December 19 2006
Nehad has the hunched look of a man who has lived with fear for years .
It was to escape fear that he fled Iraq for Europe in 2003 , hoping to start a new life beyond the reach of the torture and prisons of Saddam Hussein 's regime in northern Iraq .
But after four years of failed asylum applications in the UK , he is still living in fear .
He 's too nervous to tell his story inside the cafe where we meet for fear of eavesdroppers , so we sit outside .
He flinches as a policewoman passes .
He says he never answers a knock on his front door at home in Birmingham ; friends know to call first to tell him they are coming .
He knows - as the Home Office officials remind him on his monthly required visits to sign in - that he could be deported at any time and sent back to Iraq .
He could be snatched from the streets or from his bed in the middle of the night .
But , as he is well aware , there is nothing unusual about his plight - he is just one individual out of an army of irregular migrants , which the Home Office estimates at more than half a million strong .
They precariously exist in a kind of bureaucracy - made limbo in this country .
Deportation is not the only fear he lives with .
He needs urgent kidney treatment , but an operation would require several months ' convalescence .
If he can't work , who will pay his rent or food ?
He knows his kidney malfunction is slowly getting worse .
" I came here to survive , not to die slowly . "
He rubs tears from his cheeks .
He works in a kitchen - and he apologises for it .
He knows that he's not allowed to work but explains that after his asylum appeal was refused two years ago and he was ejected from the hostel and his vouchers were stopped , he had no alternative .
He got himself false papers and his employer does n't press him for his national insurance number .
The arrangement suits them both .
Nehad gets £ 182 net for a 40 - hour week , and the employer gets cheap hard labour with no sick or holiday pay .
Nehad will be working through Christmas .
Nehad counts himself as one of the lucky ones .
He knows someone who bought an old car for £ 50 just to sleep in it .
Nehad rents for £ 100 a week , which leaves enough to pay the bills , and feed and clothe himself .
He sometimes helps out other irregulars who are worse off .
" There is another , terrible life underground in this country .
The government calls us illegals , but how can a human being be illegal ?
We are here , and we are human beings .
People ask me what my hope for the future is ; I do n't have a right to hope , but what I would like is to hold my head up high and tell people , this is who I am . "
That 's what had driven Nehad to run the risk of talking to me .
He needed recognition - it was the denial of dignity that had eaten into his soul , the way a whole society had decided to avert its eyes from his plight .
The sheer indifference to the zombie category of " illegal " human beings our asylum bureaucracy has created .
Some irregulars have been here for years , and many will be here for years to come .
They might live in your street or be sitting on the bus or train next to you and you wo n't know because budget clothing shops ensure that poverty and desperation is now well hidden .
The current rate of deportations is 20,000 a year .
The public accounts committee has acknowledged it would take 18 years to deport all irregular migrants .
That means Nehad could die of kidney disease long before his deportation order comes up , or , to put it another way , Nehad and those like him will have washed up many more of the dishes you eat off in restaurants .
And then there 's the cost : £ 11,000 per deportation .
Deporting half a million people will push the bill towards £ 4.7bn , according to the Institute of Public Policy Research .
No one is planning to stump up that kind of money , so this is make - believe policy land : it 's never going to happen .
Yet no politician is prepared to admit that , given the fevered anxieties about immigration in this country .
These half a million have become a political no - go area : everyone has a vested interest in pretending they do n't exist .
They 've provided labour for Britain 's booming economy , filling the increasing personal - service job sectors of domestic work , cleaning , catering , food processing and hospitality .
In this zombie category of irregulars , you are vulnerable to every thug , every kind of criminality - and yet you can never turn to the police .
You get turned away from doctor 's surgeries .
Your employer can deduct money from your wages , increase your hours , withhold pay and you can do nothing or he will make threatening requests for a national insurance number .
Likewise , your landlord can up the rent and ignore complaints about repairs .
No one has wanted to broach the debate .
Refugee organisations are too busy fighting for a fair asylum system , and trade unions , while aware of how employers can exploit irregular migrants and how that has a knock - on effect on other low - paid workers , have held back from an unpopular issue .
Into this gap has stepped the Citizens Organising Foundation - representing community and faith groups in London and Birmingham - with plans to launch a campaign , Strangers into Citizens , in the new year , which will aim to open up a space to discuss this subject sensibly .
It 's the COF that is hunting out the rare characters like Nehad who have the courage to speak out , and have learned good enough English to tell a story that booming Britain does n't want to hear .
There is an obvious policy option .
Spain and Germany have both recently introduced regularisation schemes for long - term irregular migrants .
It pays big dividends in terms of increased tax receipts as migrants start to pay tax - a billion euros in Spain in the first year and rising - which might tempt Gordon Brown .
There are other advantages ; any plan to successfully restrict the flow of new migrants depends on regularising irregulars .
Regularisation would squeeze out those spaces in the economy that so quickly absorb and attract new migrants .
But to date , advocacy of any regularisation scheme in the UK has been regarded as political suicide .
The sheer extent of this institutionalised dehumanisation makes a mockery of any pretensions to decency .
While politicians fret and pontificate about policies on social cohesion and integration , this is the real question at the heart of those issues : the army of cheap labour on which our comfortable lifestyles depend .
Next year marks the second centenary of the abolition of slavery in the British empire .
What makes the Strangers into Citizens campaign so challenging is that it is forcing us to acknowledge that its modern - day version is flourishing .
People like Nehad may have some freedom of movement , but in reality , every detail of their daily lives is sharply circumscribed by fear .
He bitterly knows that though he is 34 , he has no chance of marriage , children , a home , a decent job , or a life worth living .
He is just waiting - without any hope that the wait will end .

MI6 believed it was close to finding the al - Qaida leader in Afghanistan in 1998 , and again the next year .
The plan was for MI6 to hand the CIA vital information about Bin Laden .
Ministers including Robin Cook , the then foreign secretary , gave their approval on condition that the CIA gave assurances he would be treated humanely .
The plot is revealed in a 75 - page report by parliament 's intelligence and security committee on rendition , the practice of flying detainees to places where they may be tortured .
The report criticises the Bush administration 's approval of practices which would be illegal if carried out by British agents .
It shows that in 1998 , the year Bin Laden was indicted in the US , Britain insisted that the policy of treating prisoners humanely should include him .
But the CIA never gave the assurances .
" In 1998 , SIS [ MI6 ] believed that it might be able to obtain actionable intelligence that might enable the CIA to capture Osama bin Laden , " the committee says in its report .
It adds : " Given that this might have resulted in him being rendered from Afghanistan to the US , SIS sought ministerial approval .
This was given provided that the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment . "
British intelligence made a similar request in 1999 , and obtained the same response from Whitehall , but in the event MI6 did not provide the information .
But 1998 and 1999 were not the only times Britain had Bin Laden in its sights .
In January 1996 the Home Office wrote to him when he was in Sudan .
The letter , seen by the Guardian , advised him that Michael Howard , then home secretary , had " given his personal direction that you be excluded from the United Kingdom on the grounds that your presence ... would not be conducive to the public good . "
· The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday August 2 2007 .
In the article above regarding a report on rendition by parliament 's intelligence and security committee we said correctly that it had criticised the Bush administration 's approval of practices that would be illegal if carried out by British agents .
As a result of cutting during the editorial process , most of the article concerned events from 1996 - 99 .
This might have given readers the impression that we thought George Bush was president during that time .
Since I 'm here and almost cogniscent now , I 'll tell you about my impromptu protest .
Yesterday , since I was feeling rather bummed about not being able to protest in DC but in the mood to get out there and make a difference like Cindy Sheehan did , I decided to go park myself in my little town at what is probably the one busy spot : Main Street .
Spontaneously deciding to spread the truth , I gathered up my cardboard , duct tape ( silver , blue , and black ) and my implement for cutting , and I grabbed the sign I already had from the last protest and I went to go sit - in at the one main 4 - way stop that qualifies as the only traffic filled intersection in this small town .
( Nope - - we do n't have a signal --- just that one 4 way stop that most people have to use to get home or to the local lakes . )
Often , in this tiny town , we have police sitting at either side of the town watching for those speeders passing through .
Anyways , I digress a little ...
So as I drove into town with my convertible top down ( in order to fit the 5 foot long pieces of cardboard for my protest ) and my implements of dissent , I saw the police car parked at the coffee shop downtown .
( tssk , tsk ... no assumptions here because in this small town they actually give out LOTS of tickets !
And WE WISH they were at the donut shop ! )
Anyways , so seeing the police officer pulled over 50 yards away from my intended protest spot , I got a little nervous right from the get go .
So I decided to implement a plan .
I assumed that if I were eating from , say , the DQ right near there , they could n't kick me off for eating with a sign near me .
So I bought my protest food -- and I grabbed the 3 x 3 foot sign that is painted red- black and white with the arrows in opposite directions that says " Bush ... Truth " and I parked me and my food right at that 4 - way intersection in plain view .
I have to admit , I was quite scared even at this point .
It 's already scarier protesting by yourself in a small town where everyone considers you an outsider unless your family has lived there 150 years ...
And it 's also scarier being by yourself instead of with a group of people .
Seeing the police car was just the icing on the cake to make the experience scarier .
So I was standing there holding my sign out for quite a while .
Most people were silent .
I felt pretty ridiculous at times .
Eventually someone shouted something out the window of their passing car .
This brave soul shouted , " SUPPORT THE TROOPS ! "
Well , I am .
And had the brave soul allowed me my turn to converse , I would have said that .
Instead , he drove away .
But at that point , I had n't heard completely what was said anyways .
Just then , a younger girl , with her kids in a wagon , walked by me and asked me if my purpose was to get yelled at or something .
I asked her if she was able to hear what they had said , and she told me .
Then as I told her my reason for being there , she said , she supported my efforts .
I invited her to join me but she refused ( kids in wagon ) and she went on her merry way .
So I went back to my lonely protest and eventually another car stopped and asked me what my sign meant .
I explained and they approved and went on their way .
Soon , an elderly lady came by with her two little grand kids and asked who I support .
Imagine bright red sign :
TRUTH >>>>>>>>
<<<< BUSH</p>
and she asks me WHO I support ?!!!
So I gave the OBVIOUS answer .
I said I support TRUTH .
I support public servants who TELL the truth and DON " T OBSTRUCT JUSTICE .
Well , this little old lady gave me the , " I know you just hate Bush " type looks and glared at me and walked away .
Within 5 minutes of the lady walking away , I saw a police car in the distance .
He pulled up near me and said , " Not to stifle dissent but .... "
Then he started asking me my name and taking notes .
( I gave him my first name and asked him , " Am I doing something wrong ?
( No ) Then , why do you need my name if I 'm not doing something wrong ?
I 'm worried about the NSA warrantless spying and I 'm not doing anything wrong but they 're spying on people who are n't doing anything wrong either . " )
Back to his questions : Am I from A - A ? ( No ) .
Do I live in M______ ? ( Yes ) What does my sign mean ?
( Oh , I was HAPPY to discuss that ! )
What 's my last name ?!
( Ok ... gave it at that point .
Unsure of if I could get in trouble for not giving it . )
Which people people do I think tell the truth , anyways ?
( Oh ...I LOVED being able to talk to the POLICE about lies , obstruction of justice , building a case carefully only to have the perp get off .
Would I be able to get off if I lied and obstructed justice ?-- His response , " Rich people get away with things sometimes ... "
My response , " Well if I WERE AN OFFICER , I would be VERY P.O.'d at someone who is GAINING from furthering the obstruction now letting someone go , and committing MORE OBSTRUCTION OF Justice ...
I could n't do that .
If I lied or obstructed justice to you , I 'd be arrested , charged , if guilty serve time in jail like Martha Stewart , right ? "
( He said yes ... )
So it was very weird , because he kept his sunglasses on and DID NOT MAKE or MAINTAIN eye contact with me the whole time we were ' chatting ' which is something that makes me wonder what that meant !
Anyways , eventually , he asked me how long I intended to stay there .
I could n't say , " Until all this traffic dies down . "
So instead , I said , " Oh...until I 'm done eating . "
Thank goodness I had that 1/2 eaten hotdog to hold up my story !
Thus , he agreed that I have the right to eat my dinner where I was but that he did n't want an accident at the four corners as a result of people reading my sign .
I reassured him that I would not cause an accident and he drove away .
So I stood there longer with my sign more sedately across my front as I veeeeeeerrrry slooooowly nibbled my DQ and talking on the phone .
I was actually QUITE scared and shaking as a result of this ' confrontation ' with the police .
( And while on the phone , I saw the same police car circle around AGAIN ! )
Eventually , seeing that there was more traffic , I ran and got more junk food from DQ and resumed my spot .
All the meanwhile counting the number of people on their cell phones .
I politely answered the questions that passerbyers asked .
Then I saw the police officer drive by again but this time in an unmarked car .
( Maybe he was off work at that point . )
Whatever ...
At this point , traffic was starting to slim , so I decided to get the Reuben sandwiches that the bar behind me had on special .
( Family needed dinner too ! )
So I went inside and ordered dinner and had people in the bar staring at me weirdly and a few asked me about the sign .
As I walked out , I decided that I DID NOT want to give the police ANY REASON to pull me over , and walking out of a bar and driving might be a bad thing .
So I plopped my sign on the main road bridge ( in a wide open space ) and grabbed my utensils for making new signs , and I spent the next hour making the new sign while the other one stood in plain view !
I had different reactions from the passerbyers , everything from , " Ca n't wait to see the next sign ... good luck " to glares and " F*** You 's " shouted out the window of a passing car or two .
I noticed when people stopped to say something encouraging and I noticed when others kept their eyes down ( and even their kid 's eyes were down ! ) and they shuffled by without comment .
As I was adding the " Obstruction " to the sign , it got to be quite funny .
I think the local Republican Bush supporters decided to try to hide me and my sign .
The first car pulled up and parked in front of me .
The passenger got out of the car and said , " Sorry to block your sign ... " ( lol )
So I said , " No problem .
But since you 're here , how do you spell " Obstruction ? "
I got up and moved the sign and my belongings to the next open area .
And ANOTHER car pulled in and blocked me before I even finished the word .
So I moved again !
And you guessed it ...
Another car pulled in front of me .
So laughing , I grabbed my stuff and walked across the road to the other side .
That 's when one other person joined me .
A few more cars pulled up and blocked my signs even though there were plenty of other open spaces !
I eventually finished my new sign , " unequal under Bush , NO MORE obstruction of justice ... lies " and left .
I very carefully drove home .
And that ends my tale ... nobody better yell at me for the junk food .
Moral of the story : Do n't wait !
Act now !
Grab your food , your cell , and the articles of TRUTH and DISSENT and take it to your neck of the woods .

6年ぶりの大きなアップデートとなったEmacs 22.1、CVS先端の開発バージョンを使っているユーザは、なんとなく見過ごしてしまっているかもしれないが、新しい機能には便利なものが多い。ここでは、特に強化された置換機能について取り上げる。使いこなせば強力なので、是非使ってみて欲しい。
replace - regexpがプログラマブル置換へとパワーアップ
Emacsではreplace-regexpで正規表現置換ができる。現在主流となっている正規表現のスタイルはPerlに源流をおいたものが多いが、Emacsの正規表現はそれとは異なる。特に\(
\)の表記などが独特だ。とはいえ、Emacsを愛しているならば、馴れるしかないだろう。書き方が違うだけで、本質的には同じことだ。
さて、22.1.xではこの正規表現置換で関数の使用がサポートされた。具体的には、正規表現のなかに、任意の処理が実行可能なLispコードを指定できる。
これまで複雑な置換をするとなると、Perlなどのスクリプト言語で置換処理を書くことが多かったと思うが、22.1.xからはEmacs内で完結できる。ここでは便宜上、この関数を「プログラマブルreplace-regexp」と呼びたい。
サンプルでつかむプログラマブルreplace-regexp - 手始めは値の比較
早速試してみよう。最初の例題は、リスト1をリスト2のようにするというものだ。

“ I ’m just not sure there ’s a connection between terrorism and the war in Iraq , ” said Ann Davis , a Republican homemaker in Lima , Ohio , interviewed in a follow - up to the initial survey .
She said she was fully supportive of American troops in Iraq but , “ I feel we should not be over there , they should be able to figure it out on their own . ”
However , another Republican , Marty Woll , 56 , a retired accountant from Los Angeles , said he saw a clear link between the war and attempts to combat terrorism .
“ Iraq was obviously not the precipitating location for the 9/11 attacks , but if you look at the Middle East as a whole , you see it has been spawning the most violent and the most desperate of the attacks , ’’ Mr. Woll said .
“ Saddam Hussein killed almost a million of his own people .
That magnitude indicated that someone had to do something about it . ”
Mr. Bush ’s inability to improve his overall standing despite gains on the terror issue could be traced to people like Lucia Figueroa , 23 , an independent from Fort Drum , N.Y. , who backs the president on terrorism but faults him elsewhere .
“ Even though I approve of the way Bush is handling terrorism , he is n’t putting enough focus on other issues , like health care and Katrina , and those things need more attention , ” she said
As recently as Monday , Mr. Bush , at a news conference , defended the invasion of Iraq as essential to preventing more domestic terror attacks and said he expected troops to stay there through the remainder of his presidency .
“ If you believe that the job of the federal government is to secure this country , it ’s really important for you to understand that success in Iraq is part of securing the country , ” said Mr. Bush .
But Democrats in recent weeks have made a concerted effort to portray the war in Iraq as a distraction from essential antiterror initiatives , and the poll indicates that message may be effective .
Democrats contend that the war in Iraq has sapped resources and attention from tracking terrorists and bolstering domestic security .
“ We took our eye off the real war , the war on terror , ” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , in a conference call with reporters today .
The public ’s judgment on the job that Congress is doing remains largely negative , with 60 percent registering disapproval .
Forty - seven percent of the registered voters surveyed in the poll said they expected to vote for a Democrat for the House this November ; 32 percent said they would vote for a Republican .
The national poll cannot measure the races in individual Congressional districts , but the findings are indicative of the two parties ’ relative strength .
Soldiering On ABC News has learned of two plans to reduce forces in Iraq next year .
June 1 , 2007  --
The current U.S. emphasis may be on the surge in Iraq , but there are plans to start drawing down U.S. forces by the beginning of 2008 , according to senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the planning .
The senior U.S. commanders in Iraq -- Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno and Gen. David Petraeus -- want the surge to continue until at least December and expect to report enough progress in Iraq by September to justify it , officials told ABC News ' Martha Raddatz .
But then a drawdown may begin in February 2008 , although each of the two generals supports a slightly different plan .
Plan one , which officials say Odierno is pushing , would start with a drawdown of one brigade ( 5,000 troops ) every month starting in February , with a reduction in troops from roughly 150,000 at present to 100,000 by December 2008 .
Petraeus champions a slightly different approach that would cut the troops down to roughly 130,000 by the end of 2008 , with further reductions the following year .
In any event , U.S. officials tell ABC News troop levels in Iraq cannot be maintained at the present level , either politically or practically , with the military stretched so thin .
Presence in Iraq Beyond 2009
There is also discussion of how long a reduced force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates envisions " some presence " on the part of the United States that , he said , " provides reassurance to our friends and to governments in the region , including those that might be our adversaries , that we 're going to be there for a long time . "
A senior official said one long - term plan would have 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. forces in Iraq for five to 10 years beyond 2009 .
During that period , the bulk of the troops would be deployed to bases at strategic points throughout Iraq to respond to crisis in those areas .
Camp Victory would continue to operate as the U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad .
In an interview to be broadcast on " This Week " Sunday , Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos that Iraqi forces eventually can pick up the slack from U.S. troops , but not any time soon .
He expects the Iraqi army will be ready to defend its country by " the end of the next year . "
Some officials have serious doubts about that statement .
As far as the plans for the troops go , they could all change over the coming months .

Ugh .
He has been attending Catholic mass , often with his family but also occasionally alone , since long before he became prime minister .
His wife , Cherie , is a lifelong and practising Catholic , and in accordance with church rules their children have been brought up as Catholics and were sent to church schools .
More than 10 years ago Mr Blair was slipping into Westminster cathedral and occasionally taking communion , until the late Cardinal Basil Hume told him to stop because it was causing comment as he was not a Catholic - an injunction that bemused him at the time .
Since then he has regularly attended services conducted by Canon Timothy Russ , parish priest of the Immaculate Heart of Mary at Great Missenden , the nearest Catholic church to Chequers .
He is also known to have had discussions with priests such as Father Timothy Radcliffe , former head of the worldwide Dominican order , now at Oxford , and with Father Michael Seed , who has shephered a number of high - profile figures , including Ann Widdecome and , allegedly , Alan Clark , towards conversion .
Fr Seed , an engaging if indiscreet figure , has claimed to have paid regular backdoor visits to Downing Street to talk religion , if not necessarily to advise the prime minister .
So why has it taken so long ?
Almost certainly because of Mr Blair 's sensitivity about the place of Catholicism in British public - and particularly its constitutional - life .
The only positions specifically barred to Catholics are marriage to the sovereign or heir to the throne , or becoming sovereign themselves , a legacy of the Act of Settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the deposition of the last Catholic monarch , James II ; there has never been a Catholic prime minister .
In the last 40 years Catholics have entered many senior positions in British public life , generally without comment except among the wilder fringes of Protestant Calvinism : in the civil service , the Foreign Office and industry , as MPs and ministers in Conservative and Labour cabinets .
The current director general of the BBC , Mark Thompson , is a Catholic and , briefly , four years ago , with Charles Kennedy , leader of the Liberal Democrats , and Iain Duncan Smith , leader of the Tories , so were the alternative prime ministers .
But the motives of Catholic politicians have traditionally been regarded with suspicion by non-Catholics , both here and in the US , based on the allegation that they take their orders from the Vatican rather than the electorate .
Catholic political leaders have always denied it - but the recent antics of some bishops in the US during the 2004 presidential campaign when they threatened to deny John Kerry communion because of his support for abortion rights and , recently , Cardinal Keith O'Brien 's warning that he would do the same in Scotland , have tended to confirm old suspicions .
A number of potentially divisive moral issues would have been much more difficult if Mr Blair had been known to be a Catholic , even though his personal beliefs have not necessarily intruded into the government 's decisions .
Ministers have enacted civil partnerships for gay couples and this year faced down demands , particularly from the Catholic church , for exemption from equality provisions enabling gay couples to adopt children , even though the prime minister favoured compromise .
Equally , the government has not attempted to limit abortion rights - an issue regarded as long settled in Britain except by some mainly Catholic groups - or pushed for reduced time limits , even though the church regards abortion as a sin .
And it has permitted stem cell research without conceding to Catholic opposition .
Mr Blair , like President George Bush , ignored the condemnations and warnings of the Pope and all other church leaders over the war in Iraq .
He has been keen to expand the number of faith schools and church - supported academies , in the face of strong opposition from secular groups , but here again seemingly not for reasons of religious indoctrination but because of their parental popularity .
The criticism of Ruth Kelly when she was education secretary because of her membership of the lay sect Opus Dei - at a time when the novel The Da Vinci Code had made the group more widely known - also showed that the old prejudice could still be deployed .
Mr Blair probably thought he could do without the extra hassle .
He has kept his personal religious views largely out of his political life .
Ostentatious religiosity does not go down well in Britain .
He dropped his wish to end a prime ministerial broadcast on the eve of the Iraq invasion with the words : " God bless " on the advice of Alastair Campbell , who famously told him " We do n't do God " .
Explainer : Becoming a Catholic
The path to purification
Converting to Catholicism is not a straightforward or easy process , as Tony Blair will have realised .
It takes time - though how long depends on the candidate 's readiness and aptitude - and is based on the church 's assessment of their sincerity and commitment .
The process is described in a 44 - page document called the Rite of Christian Initiation .
When there was a rush of conversions from Anglicanism in the early 1990s , after the Church of England 's decision to ordain women priests , there was considerable murmuring among lifelong Catholics that the conversion of defectors such as John Gummer and Ann Widdecombe had been too easily sanctioned by Cardinal Basil Hume , the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales .
That is unlikely to be the case with Mr Blair since his conversion is clearly the result of a long period of consideration and is not due to a particular grievance .
Adults wishing to convert undergo a period of doctrinal and spiritual preparation with a priestly adviser to become catechumens , preparing for admission to the church .
They are no longer required to make an abjuration of previous heresy but they do make a profession of faith and belief that they " consciously and freely seek the living God and enter the way of faith and conversion as the Holy Spirit opens their hearts . "
The rite says candidates are to receive help and attention , so that " with a purified and clearer intention they may cooperate with God 's grace . "
The process takes several stages of indeterminate duration : after the period of evangelisation there follows acceptance into the order of catechumens , then election , when the church ratifies candidates ' readiness .
A " period of purification and enlightenment " follows , usually on the eve of Easter , followed by the sacraments of initiation and then catechesis as the candidates are allowed to participate fully in the sacraments , such as communion .
Although conversions usually take place during the Easter period and in public ceremonies , this need not necessarily be the case if there are special circumstances - which the church could probably find for a former prime minister .
White blood cells from a strain of cancer - resistant mice cured advanced cancers in ordinary laboratory mice , researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine reported today .
" Even highly aggressive forms of malignancy with extremely large tumors were eradicated , " Zheng Cui , M.D. , Ph.D. , and colleagues reported in this week 's on - line edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The transplanted white blood cells not only killed existing cancers , but also protected normal mice from what should have been lethal doses of highly aggressive new cancers .
" This is the very first time that this exceptionally aggressive type of cancer was treated successfully , " said Cui .
" Never before has this been done with any other therapy . "
The original studies on the cancer - resistant mice -- reported in 2003 -- showed that such resistance could be inherited , which had implications for inheritance of resistance in humans , said Mark C. Willingham , M.D. , a pathologist and co-investigator .
" This study shows that you can use this resistant - cell therapy in mice and that the therapy works .
The next step is to understand the exact way in which it works , and perhaps eventually design such a therapy for humans . "
The cancer - resistant mice all stem from a single mouse discovered in 1999 .
" The cancer resistance trait so far has been passed to more than 2,000 descendants in 14 generations , " said Cui , associate professor of pathology .
It also has been bred into three additional mouse strains .
About 40 percent of each generation inherits the protection from cancer .
The original group of cancer - resistant mice , also described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , successfully fought off a range of virulent transplanted cancers .

" Now we know that we can take white blood cells from this strange mouse and put them into a normal mouse and these cells will still kill cancers , " said Willingham , professor of pathology and head of the Section on Tumor Biology .
" This is therapy in a mouse that does not have this magical genetic inheritance . "
The transplanted white blood cells included natural killer cells , and other white blood cells called neutrophils and macrophages that are part of the body 's " innate immune system . "
This system forms a first line of host defense against pathogens , such as bacteria .
" Their activation requires no prior exposure , but rather depends on a pre-determined mechanism to recognize specific patterns on the cancer cell surface , " the researchers said .
Moreover , preliminary studies show that the white blood cells also kill " endogenous " cancers -- cancers that spring up naturally in the body 's own cells .
Cui and Willingham said the research produced many other surprises .
For one thing , if a virulent tumor was planted in a normal mouse 's back , and the transplanted white blood cells were injected into the mouse 's abdomen , the cells still found the cancer without harming normal cells .
The kind of cancer did n't seem to matter .
A single injection of cancer - resistant macrophages offered long - term protection for the entire lifespan of the recipient mouse , something very unexpected , they said .

" The potency and selectivity for cancer cells are so high that , if we learned the mechanism , it would give us hope that this would work in humans , " said Cui .
" This would suggest that cancer cells send out a signal , but normal white blood cells can't find them . "
Cui said the findings " suggest a cancer - host relationship that may point in a new therapeutic direction in which adverse side effects of treatment are minimal . "
The next steps include understanding the molecular mechanism .
" The real key is finding the mutation , which is an ongoing investigation in collaboration with several other laboratories , " said Willingham .
Cui , Willingham and their colleagues also showed that highly purified natural killer cells , macrophages and neutrophils taken from the cancer - resistant mice killed many different types of cancer cells in laboratory studies in test tubes .
Besides Cui and Willingham , the team includes Amy M. Hicks , Ph.D. , Anne M. Sanders , B.S. , Holly M. Weir , M.S. , Wei Du , M.D. , and Joseph Kim , B.A. , from pathology , Greg Riedlinger , B.S. , from cancer biology , Martha A. Alexander - Miller , Ph.D. , from microbiology and immunology , Mark J. Pettenati , Ph.D. , and C. Von Kap - Herr , M. Sc. , from medical genetics , and Andrew J.G. Simpson , Ph.D. , and Lloyd J. Old , M.D. , of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in New York .
The primary support for the research came from the Cancer Research Institute , a New York based group founded to foster the science of cancer immunology , on the premise that the body 's immune system can be mobilized against cancer .
The research also had support from the National Cancer Institute and the Charlotte Geyer Foundation .

When you have to use the bathroom , do not let the dogs precede you into the room .
Bathrooms are very small rooms and only have one door .
When the dogs knock you down while they attempt to exit the bathroom , do not fall on the toilet .
Toilets can explode .
Dogs vanish when toilets explode .
You can move at lightspeed when shutting off the water line to a toilet that has exploded .
Porcelain is very sharp , and cuts on the palm of the hand bleed profusely .
Dog towels are good for soaking up blood .
Dog towels are also good for soaking up water that results from exploding toilets .
Plumbers cost $ 150 per hour , plus travel time , plus a new toilet and hardware .
If you laugh at the plumber ’s prices , he will hang up on you .
Toilets at Lowes cost about $ 150 .
Toilets at Lowes have names like “ Parfait ” , “ Bouquet ” and “ Boudoir ” .
It takes two people to carry a toilet .
Toilets are not too hard to replace .
Just be careful , because porcelain is sharp .
You can save about 300 bucks if you replace the toilet yourself .
Dog towels are also good for wiping up the wax ring goo from underneath exploded toilets .
Yard sales are great places to buy dog towels .
You can get a dog towel at a yard sale for about 50 cents .
Best yard sale bargain on Saturday , July 7th , 2007 : 6 dog towels for 3 bucks .
Final score : Toilet=0 , Plumber=0 , Dogs=1 , Dog Towels =6 .
How was your day ?
In a rather extraordinary example of begging for money , Florence Devouard , Chairwoman of the Wikimedia foundation has told an audience at the Lift07 conference that Wikipedia has the financial resources to run its servers for another 3 - 4 months , and that without further funding Wikipedia “ might disappear ” .
Could Wikipedia shut it ’s doors ?
Tthe site alone would be worth at least $ xxx million , if not a billion , after all , there ’s literally no better property out there when it comes to traffic and authority than Wikipedia .
And whoever bought it would not only have an amazing marketing tool , they could even control the truth , at least as most of us know it .
Indeed , the likes of Microsoft would n’t need to hire people to edit entries , they could simply pay the new owner .
Text Link sales alone across the site would more than pay for the servers the site uses , tens of thousands of times over .
I smell a begging bluff on this one , but Devouard did make the claim .

Maybe Give that EMACS a try again …
I do n’t know why but I have had Lisp on the brain for the last few days .
I think it was because I was thinking of switching back to emacs .
How many times have you heard this story .
“ I used to use Emacs , but then after switching computers , I lost my .emacs file so I just switched back to Vi . ”
That ’s me .
After one quick look at the ubuntu app search , I found that they are on EMACS 21 and the world and all their new goodies ( Rails on EMACS are on EMACS 22 .
After about 20 minutes of that thought , I happily went back to using Vi .
When I have a spare week , I ’ll spend the time re-introducing myself to EMACS and it ’s internals … or so I thought .
LispBox & Web Serving
Later on that evening , I did read a blog entry on some lisp programming that pointed to Peter Seibel ’s LispBox .
Aha .
He gets it .
I do n’t want to screw around figuring out stuff …
I want a one click install to the magical lisp stuff .
I ’ve tried to setup EMACS in the past to have all the bells and whistles necessary to do C++ work .
That is n’t an easy task .
This was not going to be like that , so I gave it a try .
Specifically I tried the Allegro Install since the disclaimers said it would have the most magic .
I do n’t mind commercial software and I want to see the polished tools .
I ran the software .
Very nice .
It has the famous SLIME extension to EMACS already lit up .
It definitely had that feel like … this is n’t your normal Editor / IDE environment .
I ’ve used EMACS in the past , this was a bit slicker .
It reminded me a lot of the Smalltalk browser / eval system .
This might be a little bit like what those old Symbolics guys would rant about .
After I got over appreciating that , I immediately went to the chapter in his book on web programming .
I tried out the examples .
I got some web pages to serve and then after noticing the time , pretty much stopped there .
irb
I needed to get back to work on some other stuff , and that whole experience was fun for about 20 minutes .
The next step for me is to spend some time learning about this particular REPL environment .
I ’m just not even remotely familiar with it to be productive .
I need to learn the Ruby equivalent of … >
“ what is that Ruby method on a string ?? hmm..
I ’ll just do .
> irb > “ ” .methods.sort >
Oh yeah , that is the one . ”
Done .
This is not a Lisp failure , this is a me failure .
I just need that tool in my tool chest before I spend any more time on this .
Until then , it is good to know , though , that when I have the time , the environment is there waiting for me … all set up and ready to go .
Thought .
Is there a Rails for Lisp ?
My curiosity from the web exercise did leave me with a question .
Was there an equivalent of Rails for Lisp .
I ’ll bet with a completely dynamic environment like this , there has to be something like Rails .
The web stuff in the Practical Lisp chapter was pretty barebones .
Any good web development framework today needs to be on par with Ruby on Rails .
After a little searching , I found a few scraped together libraries .
None were top - to - bottom frameworks .
There were lots of posts on the Reddit ‘ fiasco ’ .
There are also a lot of good posts on Erlang which does have a Rails like framework called ErlyWeb ( more on that later ) .
There is also Arc… but we ’ll have to wait until that comes out to see if that is going to be interesting .
Nope , it does n’t look like the community has anything yet .
Hung Up on Threads Again
One interesting thing to note .
The lisp community ( like a few other languages ) seems to be hung up on having a multi- threaded lisp implementation for web serving .
Why ?
If the LispBox sample is any indication , only a few of the frameworks were capable of performing the samples in the book .
Also , from the Reddit fiasco posts , there was mention of the servers having deadlocking issues .
Why are they hung up this ?
Do they really want to follow in Java ’s footsteps on this ?
Unfortunately , this is n’t a ding on Lisp .
A lot of languages have problems with the hosting environment .
The only major one that does n’t is PHP .
In an old post on PHP , I elaborate a tiny bit on the benefits of the PHP multi-process model .
For the Lisp situation , I do n’t know enough to understand why most of the web stuff requires a multithreaded common lisp system .
Is it the sexiness of having all the data available as shared state ?
Maybe the warmup time for the runtime is quite high .
More likely , it is the memory footprint .
I took a look at mod_lisp , and it just uses sockets to communicate to a long running process .
I think the community should look at multi-process based solutions if they want to have scalability and reliability .
They could then use any of the runtimes that they have available right this moment .
Back to the Real World
Anyways .
I resumed my work back in the real world .
Towards the end of the day , however , I was scanning one of the iphone dev groups and found this post by Jesse Andrews .
The subject was about a caltrain schedule app for the iphone .
That sounded interesting and I could actually use it .
So I checked out the post .
As I got to the bottom of the post , he mentions that he found some “ hunks of lisp ” in the html of the site .
What ?
Lisp ?
Again 🙂
I got excited and raced to do the ‘ view source ’ on the page .
What would it reveal about the framework that they used for their site ??
( while ( re- search - forward ”
] >\ ) \ ( [ ^
<>]
\ ) ” ) ( replace - match ( format “ \1 \ 2 ″ “ - ” ( car s ) “ - “ ) ) ( setq s ( cdr s ) ) ) ( or ( looking - at “
“ ) ( error “ Foo ” ) ) ) ) )
I ’m not a lisp expert but that sure looks like EMACS lisp .
So this does n’t count as a lisp site .
It might qualify for a daily WTF , though .
Hmm .
Still , maybe I should look at EMACS again . 🙂
I 've heard rumors about a pilot who demonstrated that you can pour a drink in the cockpit while doing a barrel roll and not spill a drop .
Thanks to the magic of YouTube and an email tip , I have finally seen the video .
Since a barrel roll is a positive G maneuver ( properly executed ) , the story was always believable , but there 's something about seeing it for myself that made me smile . :-)
Oh , the other high speed , power off , low flying antics in that video are quite entertaining too .

viewzone.com First Tongue : An Ancient Global Language Introducion
[ Above : Colorado wall originally enhanced with aluminum powder on location but here enhanced with white in Photoshop to reveal shapes .

In the last part of the 20th century , a handful of archaeologists discovered a collection of symbols carved in stone as petroglyphs that appeared to be writing .
Initial dating of these symbols showed that they were made over an extended period of time , beginning around 1500 BC , and are located on as many as five continents .
This unique collection of symbols was first examined in the Negev desert of Israel by Dr. James Harris , a brilliant archaeologist from Brigham Young University .
He identified the symbols as an alphabet in the proto-Canaanite language which he successfully translated by using old - Hebrew phonetic sounds .
The earliest examples of this writing were first described as graffiti left by workers of a turquoise mine .
Later , excellent examples were found in a mining site that collapsed and remained intact from around 1500 BC , established by carbon - 14 dating of wooden beams used to support the tunnels .
This discovery was called " Old Negev " by Harris because of its location in the Israeli desert .
In the late 1990's , William McGlone , an amateur archaeologist and retired space engineer , discovered the same collection of symbols carved in heavily patinated stones surrounding the Southeast Colorado town of La Junta .
Dating of the patina corresponded to the same era as the writing found in Harkarkom in Israel .
McGlone documented the locations of this writing before his untimely death in 1998 .
Prior to this , he gave many of his maps and notes to Gary Vey , programmer and editor of Viewzone .
Vey was able , with the help of Dr. Harris , to successfully translate many of these old petroglyphs and developed a computer program to do this in the field .
In 1999 , Viewzone visited and photographed the petroglyphs in Colorado and posted them on the internet for comments .
[ right : Original image from Colorado enhanced to show details .
37-38'12.59 " N 103-35 '12.88 " W. ]
Within a few years , images of similar petroglyphs were sent to Vey by archaeologists and historians from many global locations .
This included a huge , refined collection of writing from the Republic of Yemen , at the site of the newly discovered palace of the Queen of Sheba .
Vey was immediately invited to visit the museums and archaeological sites in Yemen and photographed as well as translated many of the older stone and bronze artifacts .
The writing in Colorado and Yemen spoke of some event , possibly related to the Sun , which was prophesied to change human civilization .
Subsequent translations of sites in Oklahoma , Australia and South America have added more details about this future event ; however , the present report is meant to describe and illustrate this ancient writing system , which we are calling " first tongue . "
It is similar to proto-Canaanite but , because it seems to pre-date the Canaanites , the use of " First Tongue " is preferred .
In the years following the Viewzone Yemen Expedition of 2001 , Vey has worked closely with historian and linguist , John McGovern , who resides in Australia .
McGovern has collected examples of FT from around the globe and has attempted to reconstruct the esoteric , religious and cultural systems that motivated these early authors .
He describes a highly developed understanding of deity and the cosmos that inspired these ancient texts .
Some recent translations using variations of the Sabaean text as it appears on some stones in the Yemen Museum have been attempted and are published for comments Here and Here .
In these examples , we attempt to follow the protocol used by the University of Calgary -- making vertical lines correspond to word breaks ( spaces ) and assigning the " lamed " sound to what we have previously assigned to the " gimmel . "
Suprisingly , the result of the new translations are consistent with the historical narrative , in general , and even seem to add some details not recorded before .
Note : I have received many inquiries about this discovery .
While we continue to receive photographic material from new finds in Yemen , we have decided to refrain from posting these .
Why ?
Inevitably some traditional archaeologists will attempt to argue about the methods of the translation or of the possibility of the scripts being found in various geographic areas .
In our younger years we would have debated these points and adhered to the traditional paradigm of journal publication etc .
Instead , since the translations are revealing important prophetic information we have decided to focus all of our efforts to this task .
Our goal is not academic or to achieve fame .
In actuality , there is no time for that .
A translation program in JavaScript , which will run on any browser , has been provided to validate our work .
Thanks for your kind words and interest .

The corporate media are disgracing themselves even further , if that is possible , on the impeachment story .
On Thursday , three more members of Congress signed on to Rep. Dennis Kucinichâ€™s bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney ( H Res 333 ) , bringing the total number of co-sponsors of the bill to 10 .
That in itself would be national news , but there is more to it than simple numbers .
The new sponsors include two freshman , Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison , who ran for office calling for impeachment , and Hank Johnson , who took over the seat of pro-impeachment Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( McKinney filed her own bill of impeachment against President Bush in the waning days of the last Congress ) , but the group also includes Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) .
What makes McDermott significant is that he is a senior member of the Washington state delegation to Congress , a 9th - term legislator with considerable clout in Congress who sits on the House Ways and Means and Judiciary Committees , who chairs the subcommittee on income security and family support , and who has , in the past , said he was opposed to impeachment .
While most of the other nine co-sponsors of H Res 333 were also among the group of 39 representatives who last year had signed on to Rep .
John Conyersâ€™ bill in the last Congress calling for creation of a special committee to investigate possible impeachable crimes by the administration , McDermott was never a backer .
In a related development , Kucinichâ€™s bill , which was filed back on April 24 , amid an almost complete news blackout , and which has languished for over two months , with the House Judiciary Committee , headed by Conyers ( D - MI ) taking no action on it , suddenly was referred this week to a Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties , chaired by US Rep.
Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) â€ ” a sign that it will be taken up by the full Judiciary Committee .
Despite all these breaking developments in the impeachment story , Fridayâ€™s and Saturdayâ€™s news reports around the nation had little or nothing on impeachment .
The New York Times , whose front pages and national pages influence the news decisions of editors across the country , has ignored the story completely , as has the Washington Post , which is supposed to be covering Washingtonâ € ” both astonishing examples of corporate media censorship .
Even in Washington , Minnesota and Georgia , the main local papers only ran short briefs on the actions of their local Congress members .
But despite this journalistic lockdown , it is clear that the national grassroots impeachment is gaining power and momentum by the day .
Washington impeachment activists had long been pressing McDermott to join the impeachment campaign , but had been unsuccessful until this week .
His switch on the issue seems to have been the result of that pressure from his constituents , as well as from the latest actions of and revelations about the vice president .
A powerful series of news articles that ran in late June in the Washington Post has disclosed that the vice president was the driving force behind President Bushâ€™s decision to violate the Geneva Conventions and to illegally deny international protections to captives in what he has called the War on Terror , including captives from Afghanistan and Iraq , and to establish a program of torture of captives .
Cheney also made the ludicrous assertion this week that he did not have to respond to Congressional subpoenas and requests for information about the activities of his office because as vice president , he is president of the Senate , and thus is not a part of the executive branch , ( It is a claim that is contradicted by his own earlier assertions of â€œexecutive authorityâ€ in refusing to respond to Congressional requests for information . )
The Post 's silence about McDermott and about impeachment developments is particularly peculiar , given that the latest developments are in part due to the paper 's articles on Cheney 's actions .
Normally , newspapers are quick to point to or even grab credit for the results of their scoops and investigative reports .
While other representatives who have signed on the H Res 333 have done so relatively quietly , or in Rep.
Maxine Watersâ€™ case , in a press conference , McDermott made his move with a public speech in the House .
In that Thursday evening address , he said the vice president should â€œresign or face impeachment , â€ saying , â€ œThe vice president holds himself above the law , and it is time for the Congress to enforce the law , â€ 
In addition to citing Cheneyâ€™s role in deceiving Americans and Congress into supporting an invasion of Iraq , and threatening war with Iran , which are the charges in Kucinichâ€™s impeachment bill , McDermott cited Cheneyâ€™s claim to be exempt from Congressional investigation and his refusal to comply with rules for the handling of classified information as grounds for his impeachment .
It is not clear whether he intends to file his own impeachment bill on those issues , or to have them added to Kucinichâ€™s bill .
Johnson also cited the vice presidentâ€™s refusal to submit materials in his office to control by the Information Oversight Security Office as a reason for his decision to back impeachment .
So far , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , has not changed her position that â€œimpeachment is off the table .â€ Rep.
Conyers , for his part , has not spoken in favor of the Kucinich bill either .
But with seven members of Congress signing on to the Cheney impeachment bill over the past month , and more likely to do so in coming days and weeks , and with polls showing that the public both wants impeachment and is losing patience with the timidity and inaction of the Democratic Congress , it seems increasingly likely that their hands will be forced .
An interesting question will be when the corporate media will finally begin to honestly report on the impeachment story , and how news organizations will explain its seemingly magical appearance as a full - blown campaign in Congress .

Fake images are all around us .
Almost every fashion model or artist photo is digitally beautified prior to its public release .
Sometimes this goes too far and the photos are so fixed that leaves almost no traces of the original natural beauty of the subject being retouched .
This digital enhancement of human faces and bodies is called Digital Makeover .
It usually involves techniques such as skin smoothing , red eye removal , hair color replacement an so on .
Although at first sight performing a digital makeover over a photo seems to be an advanced task , it may surprise you how easy is to make noticeable changes to faces with a basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop .

Gleaming white from its fresh coat of anti-flash paint , the Valiant bomber of the Royal Air Force took a lazy circuit through the clear Pacific skies .
An hour earlier , Wing Commander Ken Hubbard had powered up the plane 's four Rolls - Royce engines for the take - off from the coral atoll of Christmas Island .
Scroll down for more
He and his crew were being particularly careful - they had an historic piece of kit on board .
The year was 1957 , the date May 15 - exactly 50 years ago yesterday - and down in the bomb bay was a four - ton metal cylinder containing ultrahigh explosives , obscure metals and isotopes , a spaghetti of electrical circuitry , top secret triggers and a team of boffins from the secret Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire .
If everything went to plan , there would be an almighty bang .
But , given the rush in which the job had been done and the uncertainty of the complex science involved , that was very much in doubt .
The last components for the bomb ( code - named Short Granite ) had arrived only five days before and the scientists still seemed to be doing their sums , changing their minds and arguing , right up until the last minute .
There was much at stake .
This was an explosion on which the hopes of a nation rested , because it would pitch Britain into the premier league , laying claim to be alongside the United States and the Soviet Union as a nuclear super - power .
Thousand of miles away in London , the recently appointed prime minister , Harold Macmillan , waited for the news that would determine his bargaining strength as a leader in the post - war world .
From Christmas Island , Hubbard had aimed the Valiant south , over the equator , and was now circling at 45,000ft above Malden Island , a low outcrop notable only for its coating of bird dung .
He had made two practice runs over the drop zone and was on his third , waiting for instructions from scientists on board HMS Narvik , the control ship cruising 30 miles away .
This time it was " GO " .
The bomb dropped from its shackles , free - falling through the air as Hubbard turned the Valiant away in a high - speed escape .
The bomb fell for nearly a minute before the time fuse launched the ignition process and , 8,000 ft above the sea , at 10.38 am local time , it exploded .
Down below , on the ships in the nuclear test flotilla , all personnel - the boffins , the observers , the sailors - were in protective clothing and equipped with badges made of special film to monitor radiation ; those on deck were wearing anti-flash gear , goggles and respirators .
Or so the official archive confidently tells us .
Able Seaman John Lowe , a 21 - year - old national serviceman on Narvik , remembers it differently .
He pulled on a flimsy white suit with double cuffs , a balaclava , rubber gloves and an old World War II gas mask .
And the only reason he had all that paraphernalia was because he was part of a special decontamination team .
If radioactive fall - out settled on the ship , everyone else would hide below while they scrubbed the decks with brooms and caustic soda .
For now , the 160 crew sat on deck with their backs to the drop zone , their hands over their eyes , waiting .
What followed was both majestic and horrific .
The intensity of the flash penetrated hands and eyelids so that some men claimed they could see their bones through their skin , as in an X -ray .
A flush of heat burst against their bodies .
Ten seconds later , the spectators turned round to see , in the words of an observer on the aircraft carrier HMS Warrior , " an enormous ball of fire that changed swiftly into a bubbling cauldron of coppery red streaked with grey .
" This fantastic mushroom bridged sea and sky like some giant waterspout . "
Britain had what she desperately wanted .
As the headline in the makeshift newspaper cobbled together that day on Christmas Island proclaimed - and the rest of the world 's press soon repeated - " Bomb gone : H - bomb puts Britain on level terms . "
It was n't strictly true .
To the experts , the bang that day 50 years ago was more of a whimper .
At 300 kilotons , it may have had 20 times the power of the atom bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , but the Americans and Soviets were already experimenting with explosions calculated in megatons .
( A kiloton is the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT , whereas a megaton is a million tons . )
More importantly , they were doing so with a new sort of science .
Atom bombs worked on the principle of fission , where atoms split apart and release huge amounts of energy .
The new H - bomb was based on forcing hydrogen atoms to fuse together .
And the power produced by that fusion was so great that the calculations ran off the end of the physicists ' blackboards .
It was , in theory , limitless .
A - bombs could destroy whole cities , but Hbombs could devastate entire regions .
And it was this power the British government wanted .
The Malden Island blast was not it .
The device dropped from Wing Commander Hubbard 's Valiant was - like a genuine fusion weapon - a double bomb , using the heat from an atom bomb as a trigger for a second detonation .
But no fusion took place .
The only real " H " that day was for Hype , along with " B " for Bluff .
Nonetheless , May 15 , 1957 , went down in history as the day Britain became a nuclear super - power , and a long - held hope of British prime ministers of both parties was realised .
It was also the start of a long - running controversy over the effects of radiation .
A new study has found significant genetic damage in servicemen who took part in the event , and some of them are still fighting for redress .
Ironically , given the pacifist and anti-nuclear division within the Labour party ( then and now ) , it was Clement Attlee , often voted the hero of British socialism , who was first on the quest for nuclear weapons .
Attlee , unexpected winner of the 1945 general election , decided that a British atom bomb was " essential to our defence " .
A month after taking office , he set up a secret Cabinet committee , GEN 75 , and it was at one of the meetings of this Atom Bomb Committee that a serious split appeared in the Labour camp .
The Chancellor , Hugh Dalton , and President of the Board of Trade , Stafford Cripps , questioned whether the country could afford it .
As they made their case , there was a commotion , the door opened , and the pugnacious Foreign Secretary , Ernest Bevin stumbled in , apologising that he had fallen asleep after a heavy lunch .
He listened momentarily to the Cripps / Dalton argument , then went ballistic .
" No , that wo n't do at all , " he thundered .
He had recently had discussions with the Americans , " and I do n't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked at , or to , as I was .
" We 've got to have this thing over here , whatever it costs .
We 've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it . "
An even more secret cabinet sub-committee , from which Dalton and Cripps were excluded , took charge , and Britain 's nuclear weapons project was under way .
The case made by Bevin for Britain never to stand cap - in - hand before the Americans was trotted out by subsequent British leaders .
Churchill , when he returned to Downing Street in 1951 , said the bomb was " the price we pay to sit at the top table " .
As the race for bigger and more lethal weapons hotted up , he gave the order in 1954 to upgrade to hydrogen bombs .
WAS it jingoistic pride , the last blast of empire or sensible politics ?
A bit of all three , one suspects .
But , at a time of declining British power around the world , there was an edge of desperation in the orders and in the way our weapons scientists were egged on .
Atom bombs they could manage , and did , in sizeable numbers at Aldermaston .
But thermo-nuclear devices - H - bombs - were uncharted territory , where the others , with their massive head start and unlimited funds , were racing ahead .
The Soviet test of a thermo- nuclear device towards the end of 1955 increased the pressure for Aldermaston to come up with a multi-megaton bomb .
But pressure was also coming from another source .
Round the world , there were growing protests over nuclear testing and demands for a total ban .
The Americans and the Russians were of a mind to accept .
Their testing was pretty well complete .
They had mastered the technology that was proving so elusive in Berkshire .
For Britain , the prospect of such a ban at this time was appalling .
It was as if they had invited themselves to a party just as it was coming to an end .
Something had to be done - and fast .
That something was Operation Grapple , so- called because it would involve all prongs of the military , the Army , the Navy and the Air Force , hooked up together with civilian scientists in the biggest combined operation since the end of the war .
The aim was to detonate a bomb at least one megaton in power .
Spring 1958 had been the original target date .
Now the deadline was brought forward a whole year .
While the scientists chewed anxiously over theories , drawing sketches , considering the relative merits of lithium - 6 and uranium - 238 in the cycle of detonation , the Kermadec Islands in the south Pacific were picked as a test site .
But the Prime Minister of New Zealand , whose territory they were , refused permission .
The spotlight shifted to Malden Island ( which came under joint UK and U.S. administration ) , with Christmas Island , 365 miles away , as the base from which the tests would be conducted .
The Christmas Island atoll was midway between Australia and the west coast of America .
It had been a staging post for U.S. bombers during the war and so had a rudimentary runway .
It would be a major engineering job to resurface it for the jet bombers and transport planes about to use it , and also to build a " town " of tents and huts for the thousands of men about to descend on it .
This was no tropical paradise .
It was hot and exposed , with no source of food except coconuts and fish , and infested with flies and vicious land crabs .
Everything had to be shipped or flown in , from food and water to heavy machinery .
Corporal John Sadler was one of the first Royal Engineers to arrive .
He was 22 and recently married , and this barren land would be his home for the next year :
" We worked seven days a week because there was nothing else to do . "
Soon the island was buzzing with activity .
Sadler recalled the tension and expectation rising among the 4,000 new inhabitants of Christmas Island as HMS Narvik arrived , followed by the aircraft carrier Warrior .
Overhead , the bombers and the Canberra " sniffer planes " - which would fly directly into the mushroom cloud to take samples - flew constantly , practising their runs and testing their equipment .
When D - Day came , Sadler watched the Valiant roll down the runway and take off .
But after that , he saw and heard nothing .
Though he strained his eyes to see the mushroom cloud it was too far away .
" But I felt very proud .
We knew we were making history .
That bomb would make our country a greater power in the world . "
The scientists on board HMS Narvik who had witnessed the explosion were landing back on Malden Island by helicopter to check their instruments .
Debris floated in the sea , the island scrub was on fire but radioactive contamination was light .
Even seaman John Lowe was allowed ashore to see the fires for himself , assured that it was quite safe .
He and his mates played cricket on the roasted ground and threw themselves into the rolling waves that crashed onto the beach .
Back on board , they fished for tuna and cooked what they caught .
Contamination ?
He gave it no thought . . . for now .
The scientists on Christmas Island and back at Aldermaston were now in almost permanent session .
This first shot in Operation Grapple had been a " disappointment " , even though in London it was being trumpeted as a triumph .
What had gone wrong ?
More tests were needed .
The next one , on May 31 , gave off 800 kilotons of power , close to the magic megaton - which was fortunate since a party of journalists had been invited .
Grapple - X on November 8 , 1957 produced 1.8 megatons .
Six months later , on April 28 , 1958 , Grapple - Y managed a thunderous three megatons .
The prime minister at last had his thunderball to rival the super - powers .
It was " a symbol , not a weapon " , as one historian put it .
For the rest of the 20th century , British leaders could look American presidents in the eye .
But , in the process , trouble was brewing .
For reasons of economy and logistics , the later bomb drops had been carried out off Christmas Island itself rather than over the distant Malden Island .
During the early tests , only those on the ships had been close to the explosion .
Now many more servicemen were in the front line .
One of those was Scottish sapper Ken McGinley , who remembered the growing fear as the bomb test neared .
" It 's the biggest bomb the world has ever attempted to set off , " he wrote to his girlfriend .
They had no idea what to expect .
" There 's boys writing out their last will and things like that . "
They mustered on the beach for the Grapple - Y countdown .
He was given a white cotton suit to put on over his shorts and shirt but he clearly remembers others standing there in their normal clothes , with no protection .
" I 've seen photographs of men wearing futuristic - looking goggles with hoods and special boots who were reputedly stationed on Christmas Island , yet I never once clapped eyes on any such equipment , " he said .
The flash was " like a second sun " , followed by a slow , searing heat .
He screamed in pain .
He saw trees snapped in half by the shock - wave .
More sinister were the thick , black cloud that was drifting towards the camp , the torrential rain and the dead cormorants he was sent to clear from the beach , their eyes burnt out .
McGinley went down with a series of ailments before being discharged from the army as medically unfit .
He never really got better ; he suffered nightmares ; he discovered he was sterile .
But at least he was alive , unlike other Christmas Island veterans he kept hearing about .
In 1983 , he was instrumental in setting up the British Nuclear Test Veterans ' Association to demand recognition , compensation and pensions for their widows .
It has been a thorn in the side of the Ministry of Defence ever since .
The official line remains resolutely unchanged - that safety precautions were taken , there was no evidence of radioactive contamination afterwards , and that the death rate among Christmas Island veterans is statistically normal .
But talk to John Lowe , once that young sailor on Narvik , now the association 's chairman , and it is hard not to be moved by the men 's stories , and to feel that not everything about the tests was as harmless as the MoD would like us to think .
The pressure was intense , time was running out .
At the very least , corners were cut , lives endangered ?
Was the attitude to safety " as casual as if the men had been at a Guy Fawkes bonfire party " , as one MP put it in the House of Commons ?
The new study , from New Zealand , seems to bear that out .
Scientists found " high numbers of rogue cells " in sailors present at Operation Grapple .
Fifty years ago , Britain got its big bomb " with a bloody union jack on it " .
But that independence came at an unknown human price .
From those super - bomb blasts half - a- century ago , sadly the dust has yet to settle .

If the X - Finger looks like a prop from The Terminator , relax .
It is n’t out to kill you , and it is n’t robotic .
In fact , it ’s a mechanical prosthetic finger so effective it provides articulation as fast and flexible as the real thing .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Invented by Dan Didrick of Naples , Florida , the device has no batteries , electronics , servos or actuators .
Instead , each digit incorporates a simple mechanism which , when pushed by the surviving part of the wearer ’s finger , curls a set of artificial phalanges .
“ Having a body - powered device leaves little room for mechanical failure , ” Didrick said , adding that there are n’t any robotic medical alternatives .
“ Many people assumed a device such as mine already existed . ”
In practice , however , robotic fingers are always attached to robotic hands and arms .
Losing an entire limb , however unpleasant , allows the prosthetic manufacturer more room to conceal complicated electronics .
About one in 150 people have lost a digit to war , misadventure or misfortune .
Made of steel and blue plastic , Didrick ’s X - Finger allows for a surprising degree of dexterity : Enough to grip ( and swing ) a golf club , operate a keyboard or even play musical instruments .
When the wearer bends the remaining portion of his or her finger , the tight fit causes it to depress a lever on the X - Finger , articulating the device in proportion to the pressure exerted .
The precision mechanism guides the digit ’s movements to match those of adjacent fingers , creating an uncannily realistic prosthesis where it counts most : mobility , power and accuracy .
In May , Didrick was awarded second prize in the History Channel ’s Modern Marvels Invent Now Challenge , beating thousands of other entries to claim a $ 5,000 award .
The X - Finger , which currently costs thousands of dollars per digit , might seem expensive to prospective buyers .
But it ’s not a get - rich - quick scheme for its inventor : Didrick , 37 , sold his house , his Porsche and many of his personal possessions to help fund development , and he draws only a modest salary from sales of his invention .
“ We only receive a fraction of the overall costs ourselves , ” Didrick said .
“ Also , many people would be surprised to learn that a cosmetic silicone artificial finger , offering only passive function , with no mechanical structure , can cost $ 5,500 from an anaplastologist . ”
Didrick ’s X - Finger works much like a real finger , with its flexing motion actuated by movements in the surviving parts of the wearer ’s finger and hand .
Manufacturing is currently taken care of by a firm in California , but it is able to make only a few fingers a week .
Investment will expedite production , Didrick hopes .
Didrick started out as a maker of realistic monster masks , and eventually moved to Japan , where he planned to work at the movies .
Though Didrick did n’t make a career articulating Gojira ’s mighty digits , he noticed that many workers in heavily industrialized Kawasaki were missing their own .
After crafting a silicone replacement for a stranger at a party , word spread and he was soon supplying artificial fingers to inattentive machine operators .
Returning to America , he found a patient who needed a more versatile facsimile , leading him to study anatomy and invest in CAD software .
Six years later , the resulting invention is a commercial reality .
The finger , however , is only the beginning .
Didrick is already working on an entire hand articulated in similar fashion using the wrist , and has been approached to craft toes using the same principle .
“ Our new approach to prosthetic technology will have a significant impact , not only on the thousands of lives it will change , but also to spark the ingenuity of our youth to develop new technologies for the future . ”

Facebook WASHINGTON 
Since he has been president , George W. Bush has traveled overseas from Afghanistan to Vietnam .
Closer to home , Rhode Island and Vermont have n't rated a presidential trip .
The two deep blue Democratic enclaves , which both gave John Kerry 59 % of the vote in 2004 , are the only states Bush has not visited since becoming president , according to White House records .
A Bush spokeswoman said it 's no snub , adding there is plenty of time for him to reach all 50 states , as his father and Bill Clinton did before him .
" We have 20 months left in office , " spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo said .
" And the weather is really nice up there in the summer . "
Clinton did n't complete his U.S. tour until his final month in office , when he stopped in Nebraska .
The elder Bush visited all 50 states in his four years in office .
Ronald Reagan skipped Vermont and Rhode Island while president , as well as Delaware and Maine , according to Mike Duggan of the Reagan Library .
Reagan won all four states in 1984 .
Though Vermont is a reliable Democratic vote for president , it used to favor Republicans .
In 1936 , Vermont was one of two states to vote for Alf Landon in his landslide loss to Franklin Roosevelt .
Today , Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas is a moderate Republican .
Still , there is no denying the liberalism in the home state of Ben & Jerry 's ice cream , which touts " progressive values . "
Vermont is the only state represented in the U.S. Senate by a self - described socialist , Bernie Sanders .
State legislators recently debated whether to recommend to Congress that Bush be impeached for the Iraq war .
( That push failed . )
" Obviously , Bush is not popular in the state of Vermont , " said Sanders , who extended an invitation to Bush to visit .
The state has one of the nation 's highest death rates of U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq .
" He is president of 50 states , " Sanders said .
" We 'd love to hear what he has to say .
We 'd love him to listen to what other people have to say . "
Rhode Island 's politics are less reliably Democratic .
Reagan carried the state twice .
Republican John Chafee and his son , Lincoln , held one of the state 's U.S. Senate seats for 30 years until Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse beat the younger Chafee in November .
The Iraq war and Bush 's leadership were key issues in the race .
Whitehouse said Bush 's absence " comes as no surprise . "
He said the president often relies on " handpicked audiences so he does n't get any adverse feedback . "
As a result , he said , Rhode Island is " not a happy place for him to visit . "
Not that folks would n't be nice , Whitehouse said .
" Well , we always want to be courteous to the president , " he said .

President Bush has turned the executive branch into a two - way mirror .
They get to see everything Americans do : our telephone calls , e-mail , and all manner of personal information .
And we get to see nothing about what they do .
Everyone knows this administration has disdained openness and accountability since its first days .
That is about the only thing it does not hide .
But recent weeks have produced disturbing disclosures about just how far Mr. Bush ’s team is willing to go to keep lawmakers and the public in the dark .
That applies to big issues — like the C.I.A. ’s secret prisons — and to things that would seem too small - bore to order up a cover-up .
Vice President Dick
Cheney sets the gold standard , placing himself not just above Congress and the courts but above Mr. Bush himself .
For the last four years , he has been defying a presidential order requiring executive branch agencies to account for the classified information they handle .
When the agency that enforces this rule tried to do its job , Mr. Cheney proposed abolishing the agency .
" Pixing the froblem " - the humanitarian community can feed children , drill water wells , provide some healthcare , set up tents and refugee camps , lotsa other stuff to give struggling people a chance .
We can tell people about what is going on , show people what is going on , we can try to help people to understand what is going on , people who are far away from the situation .
Still , what humanitarian organizations , and their workers do - it does not stop any wars .
We do not stop the violence .
We try to give people a chance to live until the wars stop .
Here on dKos , I 've tried to be low - key about my experience .
I dunno , maybe I have been , maybe not .
I do n't wanna beat anybody over the head with it , with what I 've seen , what I know .
Still , I cannot help but feel that there are things that folks should understand .
Understand deeper than rationality , deeper than intellectually , deeper than what people can see in the media .
I wish that I could take you by the hand and walk you through these places , help you see and feel these things deep in your heart , in your soul , in your bones .
Maybe you already do .
I wish that I could drive this understanding into the minds , and the hearts , and the forsaken souls of the powers - that - be .

Blue Cross : You 'd Have To Be Dead To Not Be Affected By " Sicko " Posted by Pile ( 7410 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Activists ]
An employee of Blue Cross , one of the largest HMOs in the nation forwarded a secret memo to Michael Moore the other day , outlining the company 's reaction to Moore 's expose on the healthcare industry .
Check out the memo and Moore 's response .
From Michael Moore :
An employee who works at Capital BlueCross has sent us a confidential memo written and circulated by its Vice President of Corporate Communications , Barclay Fitzpatrick .
His job , it seems , was to go and watch " Sicko , " observe the audience 's reaction , and then suggest a plan of action for how to deal with the movie .
The memo , which I am releasing publicly , is a fascinating look at how one health care company views " Sicko " -- and what it fears its larger impact will be on the public .
The industry 's only hope , the memo seems to indicate , is if the movie " flops . "
Mr. Fitzpatrick writes : " In typical Moore fashion , Government and business leaders are behind a conspiracy to keep the little guy down and dominated while getting rich . "
No .
You do n't say !
That can't be !
BlueCross V.P. Fitzpatrick seems downright depressed about the movie he just saw .
" You would have to be dead to be unaffected by Moore 's movie , " he writes .
" Sicko " leaves audiences feeling " ashamed to be ... a capitalist , and part of a ' me ' society instead of a ' we ' society . "
He walks out of the theater only to witness an unusual sight : people -- strangers -- mingling and talking to each other .
" ' I did n't know they ( the insurers ) did that !' was a common exclamation followed by a discussion of the example , " according to Fitzpatrick .
He then assesses the film 's impact : " [ T ] he impact on small business decision makers , our members , the community , and our employees could be significant .
Ignoring its impact might be a successful strategy only if it flops , but that has not been the history of Moore 's films ...
If popular , the movie will have a negative impact on our image in this community . "
The BlueCross memo then suggests a strategy in dealing with " Sicko " and offers the BCBS " talking points " to be used in discounting the film .
My heartfelt thanks to the employee who sent this to me .
And now a word from me to Capital BlueCross :
How 'bout a debate ?
No more secret memos and hand wringing about the millions seeing " Sicko . "
Just me and your CEO openly debating the merits of a system that kills thousands of innocent Americans every year .
In the meantime , I hope you do n't mind me sharing your thoughts and impressions in your well - written memo .
And if the rest of your executive team has n't seen " Sicko , " it opens in an additional 100 cities tonight for a total of over 700 screens across North America .
Attendance went up a whopping 56 % on the 4th of July , higher than any other film in the theaters right now .
But do n't be scared , and certainly do n't be ashamed to be a capitalist .
Greed is good !
Especially good for you .
There 's nothing like having the pre-existing condition of being rich , should you ever get sick and need help .
Yours ,
Michael Moore
mmflint@aol.com
www.michaelmoore.com
P.S. Join me at noon EST , today , when I 'll be chatting with U.S. Steelworkers , the California Nurses Association , and whoever stops by to talk about " Sicko " and the industry 's attempt to stop this movement .
Check my website for details .
[ The following memo was written by Barclay Fitzpatrick , VP of Corporate Communications for Capital BlueCross ]
I was able to see Sicko last night in Lancaster .
There were about 30 other viewers in the theatre covering all age groups .
I have attached the well - written memo from one of our partners , which describes cases used in the movie , to the end of my memo .
Also attached are the latest talking points from BCBSA .
I will focus on impact to our brands , issues , and suggested strategies in this memo .
The Movie
You would have to be dead to be unaffected by Moore 's movie , he is an effective storyteller .
In Sicko Moore presents a collage of injustices by selecting stories , no matter how exceptional to the norm , that present the health insurance industry as a set of organizations and people dedicated to denying claims in the name of profit .
Denial for treatments that are considered " experimental " is a common story , along with denial for previous conditions , and denial for application errors or omissions .
Individual employees from Humana and other insurers are interviewed who claim to have actively pursued claim denial as an institutionalized goal in the name of profit .
While Humana and Kaiser Permanente are demonized , the BlueCross and BlueShield brands appear , separately and together , visually and verbally , with such frequency that there should be no doubt that whatever visceral reaction his movie stirs will spill over onto the Blues brands in every market .
Here are some examples :
* Horizon BlueCross / BlueShield is picked out early in the film in a collage of stories citing bad treatment of members .
* BCBSA is cited for rejecting a woman for coverage due to a high BMI - " too fat " is written across the screen over a copy of her application denial letter , which describes the BMI rejection .
* BlueShield of California denied coverage for a diagnostic test , which the patient later received overseas .
Patient sues BS of CA and medical director admits to not ' seeing ' the actual denial letter , which was given an electronic signature .
* BlueCross of California denied payment for a major surgery after they discovered a previous yeast infection , then dropped the person for coverage .
This is followed by an interview with a person who claims to have been a specialist at finding inaccuracies in applications to enable post - treatment payment denials .
* A BCBSA card is shown while the narrator describes how they ( insurers ) got wealthy .
In typical Moore fashion , Government and business leaders are behind a conspiracy to keep the little guy down and dominated while getting rich .
Nixon Oval
Office tapes are used to show how the initial idea of a ' less care = profit ' enterprise was supported by the administration and became the HMO paradigm .
Legislators are presented as bought stooges for the political agendas of insurers and big Pharma .
Insurers are middlemen in the Medicare Modernization Act - which is presented as a trick to charge seniors more for their prescription drugs .
Doctors are barely touched - only in the course of discussing the AMA 's work to sink early efforts in the 40's and 50's to start universal health care .
He takes efforts to show that doctors live well in other countries despite the existence of universal health care .
In follow - up interviews , Moore has stated that he has spoken to and knows many doctors , and " doctors are n't the problem " .
In the second half of the movie , Moore walks us through individual stories of the Canadian , British , French , and Cuban health care systems where everything is free and - he reminds us repeatedly - no one is ever denied service because they can't pay .
In addition to health care , the government provides free day care , college , and someone to do your laundry .
Everybody gets along and takes care of each other and life is beautiful because there is universal health care .
As a viewer , you are made to feel ashamed to be an American , a capitalist , and part of a ' me ' society instead of a ' we ' society - and the lack of universal health care is held up in support of that condemnation .
The Impact
Moore 's movies are intentionally intense and his objective in Sicko seems to be to revive the earlier Clinton efforts - not to achieve universal coverage with this movie , but to push the topic to the top of the agenda .
He will be just as successful whether proponents mount momentum or discussion entails key stakeholders defending why it wo n't work .
As a health care industry educated viewer it is easy to pick out where Moore is cultivating misperceptions to further a political agenda , but you will also recognize that 80 % + of the audience will have their perceptions substantially affected .
In demonstration of its impact , an informal discussion group ensued outside the theatre after the movie .
While some people recognized how one - sided the presentation was , most were incredulous and " I did n't know they ( the insurers ) did that ! " was a common exclamation followed by a discussion of the example .
The unfortunate reality for Capital BlueCross is that as the market leader , we will be affected both in brand and as employees as Moore 's efforts in the movie and surrounding PR activity are seen by more of the community .
The impact on industry savvy Sales ' contacts should be minimal , while the impact on small business decision makers , our members , the community , and our employees could be significant .
Ignoring its impact might be a successful strategy only if it flops , but that has not been the history of Moore 's films nor the way this one appears to be headed .
If popular , the movie will have a negative impact on our image in this community .
There should be no doubt that many of our employees will be asked what they think of the movie by friends , family , and neighbors .
We should anticipate that our customer service people will be asked about particular cases from the movie and if we follow similar policies .
Word and phrases we have routinely used to date in policy change communications or denial letters , such as " Investigational " , will be seen as affirming the film 's contentions .
The national BCBSA response - while coming out against the film 's divisiveness and focusing on the positive work of the Blues - steers media inquiries about policies and denials back to the plans themselves .
There are 4 key areas of misperception cultivated by the movie that we should consider in any messaging strategy :
1 . That the industry is all about HMO's .
Moore cultivates this further in his interviews .
The reality is that HMO's are a minority product and have been for some time .
2 . The movie attacks insurers for a profit motive , but makes no distinction among for - profit and non-profit insurers , and in its execution places the Blue Plans together with the for - profit insurers .
3 . All plans and employees - from leaders to service representatives - are painted as motivated by profit to deny claims , and only those with crisis of conscience have come forward to confess their sins .
4. Perhaps most damaging of all , Moore completely fails to address the most significant driver of health care costs - our own lifestyle choices - and seeks to focus attention and efforts on the alluring ' quick - fix ' of universal health care .
It has taken a generation of poor nutrition and exercise to get obesity and related health issues - and subsequent costs - to their current levels , and Moore 's movie fails to acknowledge the causal relationship or need to change ( he briefly touches the subject in a non-memorable way ) .
Contrast this to the recent Health Care Symposium held in Harrisburg - where a panel of representatives from Government , Insurance , Hospitals , Business , Physicians , and even Lawyers agreed on one thing - that there was no quick fix and that Health and Wellness was the critical area of focus .
Suggestions
I believe the most successful strategy will not be in attacking the movie for its weaknesses or misperceptions , but in distancing ourselves and our brand from the groups and motivations he attacks , demonstrating the good that we do and achieve ( aligns with BCBSA strategy ) , and in articulating our disappointment that he did not address the truly relevant issue of improving our health and wellness .
We will convene a team to consider other approaches and work on potential messages for media inquiries , customer service , and employees .
Confidential Memo ( from partner )
SiCKO - viewed on 6/26/2007
Takeaways
* The main theme of the movie is that American society needs to focus on the " we " and not the " me " in healthcare .
o This broad message is an overlay for the specific criticisms of the healthcare industry - the movie asks where the morality of the American public lies and contrasts America 's approach to health care unfavorably with other nations .
* SiCKO does not go into any depth about how health insurers operate how the health insurance business works - instead it fixates on what it characterizes as the profit incentive to deny care to patients ( e.g. examples of barriers to getting health insurance if you are not healthy ; examples of people being denied expensive tests or procedures ; examples of efforts to deny reimbursement after care has been received . )
* The film draws no distinction between not - for - profit and for - profit insurers - in fact the Blue Cross / Blue Shield brand is intermixed with the for - profit brands as background reference points .
o
One scene shows a Blue Cross / Blue Shield logo as Michael Moore 's voice over begins , " While the healthcare companies get wealthy ... "
* The health insurers that get the most airtime are :
o Kaiser Permanente
o Humana
o CIGNA
o Blue Cross of California
o Aetna
* No Pharma companies are mentioned - but SiCKO suggests in multiple instances that prescription drugs are overpriced
o At a pharmacy in London , prescription drugs are Â£ 6.65 , no matter how large the dose
o In Cuba , one bankrupt 9/11 worker 's inhaler costs 5 cents , instead of $ 100
Further Notes
* Some of the examples of denial of care highlighted in the film :
o A woman with Kaiser Permanente takes her 18 - month daughter to the hospital in an ambulance , only to be told to go to an in - network hospital .
By the time they reach the second hospital , her daughter has stopped breathing and dies 30 minutes later in ER .
o A woman with Blue Shield of California has a tumor but is denied requests to get an MRI , or to see a specialist .
While on vacation in Japan she is given an MRI , and eventually returns to the U.S. to demand treatment from her insurer .
* In the ensuing court case , a doctor admits to denying her request without having reviewed it .
o Blue Cross of California approves one woman's $ 7,500 treatment , but the approval is later denied for her failure to report a previous medical incident - a yeast infection .
* " They 're just looking for a way out , " she says
* Other examples of how health insurers avoid paying for treatment :
o One graph ( from Humana ) shows that doctors with the highest % of denials get a bonus .
o Michael Moore interviews a former health insurance employee who specialized in denying care to patients retroactively - by finding inconsistencies in their medical records .
o A 5 - minute piece in the beginning of the movie .
* The film also focuses on the politicians and the funds they raise from Pharma and other player in the health care industry and alleges that the system has been heavily influenced by lobbyists and contributions .

Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association
Talking Points in Response to Michael Moore 's " Sicko "
June 2007
1 ) The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association ( BCBSA ) and the 39 Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are committed to improving the U.S. healthcare system for our nearly 100 million members through continuous innovation that reflects the ever - changing healthcare landscape and the needs of the consumer .
2 ) The Blues recognize the need for improvement of both the coverage and delivery of healthcare .
But the divisive tone set forth by Michael Moore and his movie " Sicko " is not helpful .
Positive change to our healthcare system can be best achieved through shared responsibility , not recrimination .
To ensure Americans have access to the best healthcare that is both timely , efficient , and of high quality , requires the collective contribution of all stakeholders -- consumers , providers , employers and the government .
3 ) The Blues participation in the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured is a primary example of how the broader healthcare community is working together to reduce the number of uninsured in the United States .
4 ) The Blues are working on myriad initiatives that ensure Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare .
Each day , Blue Plans across the country are bringing healthcare value to their members in a number of ways such as new advances in health information technology and greater access to cost and quality information .
In addition :
o The Blues recently created Blue Health Intelligence a data resource that will shine light on emerging medical trends and treatment options in an unprecedented way .
To further the use of evidenced - based medicine , BCBSA has called upon Congress to establish an independent , payer - funded institute that will study the comparative effectiveness of new and existing medical treatments and procedures .
o Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are at the forefront of healthcare transparency by providing their members with online access to real - time information related to provider quality and the cost of common healthcare services .
In addition , the Blues have committed to making personal health records available to their members by 2008 .
o We are working to ensure that Medicare is funded appropriately and that seniors continue to have access to comprehensive benefits .
5 ) The Blues are proud of these efforts and we will continue to work with consumers , providers , employers and the government to provide Americans with the healthcare services and information they need to lead full , healthy lives .
Insurers Do n't Want Reform - - they have it to good
Posted by politickle on 2007-07-06 19:23:31
" Do the Republicans favor ending the subsidies for the private insurers operating within the Medicare program that the Medicare Payments Advisory Commission estimates at 12 percent per beneficiary ?
Is n’t a government subsidy a form of government intervention ? "
" Do the Republicans favor eliminating government granted patent monopolies that raise the price of prescription drugs and medical supplies to levels that are many times the free market price ?
Are n’t government imposed monopolies a form of government intervention ? "
" Representative Dennis Kucinich has the ONLY health care reform plan that has any mass - based support . "

Within it are three nuclear - powered submarines at different stages of construction .
And as a huge , red neon sign reminds the workforce , the first one is now just 32 days away from launch .
But to judge by the scaffolding surrounding it , it 's hard to believe it 's going to be ready on time .
" I 'm determined it will be , " says operations director Nigel Ward .
" However it 's a nuclear submarine , and lots of things can go wrong . "
Secrets intact
Under all its covers , Astute is a technological phenomenon .
Its nuclear reactor means it 'll never need refuelling in the whole of its 25 - year life .
Submarines have been built in Barrow for 120 years
In pictures
Since it makes its own air and water , it can circumnavigate the globe without needing to surface .
And its weapons systems are so accurate that were it positioned in the English Channel , its cruise missiles could pinpoint targets as far away as North Africa .
Indeed , down in the weapons room it looks like a Tomahawk cruise missile is already waiting to be loaded into one of the torpedo tubes .
" It 's only a dummy , " says the man who 's keeping a close eye on us .
His job is to stop us photographing anything that might give away some of Astute 's secret capabilities .
Reduced requirements
It may be one of the most sophisticated submarines ever built , but the project has been beset with problems .
The three submarines are £ 900 m ( $ 1.8 bn ) over budget and four years behind the original schedule .
ASTUTE FACTS Cost : £ 3.5 bn for three subs Weight : 7,800 tons Length : 97 m
Time to build : 6 years 4 months Power : pressurised water reactor , fuelled for life Crew : 98
But a new boss at Barrow , Murray Easton , introduced big changes when he arrived a few years back .
A team of psychologists was brought into the yard to improve management effectiveness , and to create better ways of communication .
Even now a psychologist is present at every board meeting .
Another big innovation , learnt from the American submarine - builder Electric Boat , was to build sections of the submarine vertically rather than horizontally .
Equipment can be lowered in with the help of gravity , cutting the need for manpower dramatically .
Future missiles
It all leads to a prouder , more committed workforce .
The building project is enormous
" We needed help over Easter , " says Nigel Ward , " and over 300 men volunteered to work , even though the weather forecast was good . "
Workers are also enthusiastic about what they have built .
" It 's a fantastic product , " says Andy Ogden as he stands near the conning tower of Astute .
" And something the Navy will be extremely proud of when they get their hands on it in a year 's time . "
Three - and - a - half thousand other workers have a vested interest in such customer satisfaction .
Because if all goes according to plan , they 'll be rewarded with contracts to build four more Astute submarines , and eventually the submarines that will carry the next generation of Britain 's nuclear missiles .
A U.S. military brigade is constructing a 3 - mile - long concrete wall to cut off one of the capital ’s most restive Sunni Arab districts from the Shiite Muslim neighborhoods that surround it , raising concern about the further Balkanization of Iraq ’s most populous and violent city .
U.S. commanders in northern Baghdad said the 12 - foot - high barrier would make it more difficult for suicide bombers to strike and for death squads and militia fighters from sectarian factions to attack one another and then slip back to their home turf .
Construction began April 10 and is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
Although Baghdad is replete with blast walls , checkpoints and other temporary barriers , including a massive wall around the Green Zone , the barrier being constructed in Adhamiya would be the first to be based in essence on sectarian considerations .
A largely Sunni district , Adhamiya is one of Baghdad ’s trouble spots , avoided not only by Shiites , but Sunni outsiders as well .
The area is almost completely surrounded by Shiite - dominated districts such as Shamasiya and Gurayaat .

The ambitious project is a sign of how far the U.S. military will go to end the bloodshed in Iraq .
But U.S. officials denied that it was a central tactic of the U.S. - Iraqi security crackdown launched Feb. 13 .
“ We defer to commanders on the ground , but dividing up the entire city with barriers is not part of the plan , ” U.S. military spokesman Army Lt. Col.
Christopher Garver said Thursday .
News of the construction was first reported Thursday by the Stars and Stripes newspaper
Shiite and Sunni Arabs living in the shadow of the barrier were united in their contempt for the imposing new structure .

“ Are they trying to divide us into different sectarian cantons ? ” said a Sunni drugstore owner in Adhamiya , who would identify himself only as Abu Ahmed , 44 .
“ This will deepen the sectarian strife and only serve to abort efforts aimed at reconciliation . ”
Some of Ahmed ’s customers come from Shiite or mixed neighborhoods that are now cut off by large barriers along a main highway .
Customers and others seeking to cross into the Sunni district must park their cars outside Adhamiya , walk through a narrow passage in the wall and take taxis on the other side .
Several residents interviewed likened the project to the massive barriers built by Israel around some Palestinian zones .
“ Are we in the West Bank ? ” asked Abu Qusay , 48 , a pharmacist who said that he would n’t be able to get to his favorite kebab restaurant in Adhamiya .

Residents complained that Baghdad already has been dissected by hundreds of barriers that cause daily traffic snarls .
Some predicted the new wall would become a target of militants on both sides .
Last week , construction crews came under small - arms fire , military officials said .
“ I feel this is the beginning of a pattern of what the whole of Iraq is going to look like , divided by sectarian and racial criteria , ” Abu Marwan , 50 , a Shiite pharmacist , said .
Marwan lives in a mostly Shiite area adjoining the wall , but works in Adhamiya .
Since the wall was begun , he has had to walk to work rather than drive .

Najim Sadoon , 51 , was worried that he would lose customers at his housewares store .
“ This closure of the street will have severe economic hardships , ” he said .
“ Transportation fees will increase .
Customers who used to come here in their cars will now prefer to go to other places . ”
Majid Fadhil , 43 , a Shiite police commissioner in a neighborhood north of the wall , said flatly , “ This fence is not going to work . ”
So far , the barriers have cut off streets and sidewalks , avoiding homes and backyards , residents said .
Pentagon officials first broached the idea of creating “ gated communities ” in Baghdad this year .

But more recently , military officials have emphasized political negotiation as well as increased troop presence as a way to stem sectarian conflict .
On a tour of the Middle East this week , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates repeatedly struck chords of unity and reconciliation .
He is expected to meet with sectarian leaders and government officials in Baghdad today .
The construction in Adhamiya is not the first time U.S. military planners have attempted to isolate hostile regions .
In 2005 , U.S. troops tried to surround the Sunni - dominated city of Samarra with earthen berms to prevent insurgents from entering and leaving the city .
A similar strategy was deployed in Tall Afar and Fallouja .
Experiments with less extensive walls and trenches also have been attempted in Baghdad and Kirkuk .
The latest project is the work of the 407th Brigade Support Battalion , part of the 82nd Airborne Division , based in north Baghdad ’s Camp Taji .
Since April 10 , soldiers have ventured out almost nightly after curfew , overseeing installation of the 14,000 - pound wall segments , using giant construction cranes and employing Iraqi crews , said Army Sgt. Michael Pryor , a public affairs specialist for the unit .

Soldiers have dubbed the project the “ The Great Wall of Adhamiya . ”
Commanders in the 82nd Airborne could not be reached for comment Thursday .
In a press release Tuesday , military officials said the project was intended to protect citizens on both sides .
The wall is “ on a fault line of Sunni and Shia , and the idea is to curb some of the self - sustaining violence by controlling who has access to the neighborhoods , ” Army Capt .
Marc Sanborn , brigade engineer for the project , said in the release .
He said the concept was closer to an exclusive gated community in the United States than to China ’s Great Wall .
In an e-mail , Pryor said it was too soon to judge how residents would respond .
“ Bear in mind that the wall is an ongoing project , ” Pryor wrote .
“ We ’re not completely sure how the population feels either way . ”

A special correspondent in Baghdad contributed to this report .
Clouds of smoke poured from the Kashiwazaki nuclear power plant A strong earthquake in central Japan has damaged a large nuclear power plant causing a leak of radioactive material , officials at the plant have said .
A small amount of water containing radioactive substances leaked into the sea , officials said , and a fire broke out at the plant in Kashiwazaki .
At least seven people were killed and hundreds injured in the earthquake .
Several hours later a second earthquake of magnitude 6.6 struck in the sea off Kyoto in western Japan .
Footage of damage caused by the earthquake Tokyo Electric Power Company said the small amount of radioactive material that leaked into the sea posed no environmental risk .
Reactors at the plant automatically shut during the magnitude 6.8 quake .
' Vertical jolt '
The seven deaths occurred in the city of Kashiwazaki .
Four women and three men - all in their 70s and 80s - died from injuries sustained in the earthquake , officials said .
Several hundred homes and businesses in Niigata prefecture were destroyed , roads were cracked and several landslides buried roads .
In pictures : Japan quake Japan 's shaky nuclear record More than 800 people were reported injured , most with broken bones , cuts and abrasions from collapsing buildings and falling objects .
" First there was a sharp vertical jolt and then it shook sideways for a long time and I could n't stand up , " said Kashiwazaki teacher Harumi Mikami , who was at her school when the earthquake struck at 1013 ( 0113 GMT ) .
" Tall shelves fell over and things flew around , " she told Reuters news agency .
More than 7,000 people were evacuated from their homes as aftershocks of up to magnitude 5.8 shook the area .
No damage from the second earthquake deep under the sea off Kyoto was reported but Tokyo residents said they felt buildings shake .
Safety fears Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe broke off from election campaigning to visit Kashiwazaki .
He promised to " make every effort towards rescue and also to restore services such as gas and electricity " .
The safety of Japan 's nuclear installations , which supply much of Japan 's power , has come under the spotlight in recent years after a string of accidents and mishaps .
Japan lies in one of the world 's most earthquake - prone regions and the ability of some reactors to withstand a strong tremor has been questioned .
Three years ago an earthquake in the Niigata area killed 65 people .
In 1995 , a magnitude 7.3 tremor hit the city of Kobe , killing more than 6,400 people .

When you start working with threads in your Unity3D project , you will discover that many things need to be done in the main loop .
For exampl ...
Generating strings of balanced parentheses
About a year and a half ago , the Perl Quiz of the Week question was to write a program which , given an argument n , printed out all the strings containing n balanced pairs of parentheses .
For example , if the argument was 3 , the output was to contain the lines : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ( ( ) ) ) in some order .
Enumerating parentheses is important because the parentheses obviously correspond to all the forms that an infix expression can take , so any attempt to enumerate all possible expressions of some form can be built atop a parenthesis - enumerator .
But also , there 's a straightforward correspondence between parentheses and tree structures , so by enumerating parentheses you are also enumerating all possible tree structures .
There were quite a few correct solutions posted to the list , and also some wrong ones .
The commonest mistake to make was to assume that any string of n+1 pairs of balanced parentheses must have the form S ( ) , () S , or ( S ) , where S is a string of n pairs of balanced parentheses .
But this is n't so ; ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ) does n't have this form .
The commonest strategy that worked correctly was to generate all the strings of the right length of the form ( S ) S , where S is a shorter balanced string .
This can be done recursively as follows : sub parens { my ( $ N ) = @_ ; return ( " " ) if $ N == 0 ; my @result ; for my $ i ( 0 .. $ N - 1 ) { for $ a ( parens ( $ i ) ) { for $b ( parens ( $ N - $ i - 1 ) ) { push @result , " ( $a ) $b " ; } } } return @result ; } print join "
" , parens ( shift ( ) ) , " " ; Or you can organize the logic differently : sub parens { my $ N = shift ; $ pattern = @_ ? shift : " S " ; if ( $ N == 0 ) { $ pattern =~ tr / S//d ; return $ pattern ; } return unless $ pattern =~ /S/ ; my $ new_pattern_a = my $ new_pattern_b = $ pattern ; $ new_pattern_a =~ s/S/S( S ) / ; $ new_pattern_b =~ s/S// ; return parens ( $ N - 1 , $ new_pattern_a ) , parens ( $N , $ new_pattern_b ) ; } print join "
" , parens ( shift ( ) ) , " " ; A somewhat different approach was to build up the string from left to right .
Here $s tracks the string built so far , $ N counts the number of ) 's that are still required , and $ unclosed counts the number of ( 's that have been added without a corresponding ) .
The function may append a ( to the string , increasing the number of unclosed open parentheses , if there are fewer than $ N such unclosed pairs total , and it may append a ) , decreasing both the number of required close parentheses and the number of unmatched open parentheses , as long as at least one open parenthesis remains unclosed .
sub parens { my ( $ N , $ unclosed , $ s ) = @_ ; $ unclosed ||= 0 ; $s ||= " " ; return $s if $ N == 0 ; my @result ; push @result , parens ( $ N , $ unclosed + 1 , " $ s ( " ) if $ unclosed < $ N ; push @result , parens ( $ N - 1 , $ unclosed - 1 , " $s ) " ) if $ unclosed >
0 ; return @result ; } print join "
" , parens ( shift ( ) ) , " " ; I had originally planned to do something like the first of these .
But a couple of days of intermittent tinkering revealed a completely different and unexpected algorithm : #!/usr /bin/perl -l print $ _ = " ( ) " x shift ( ) ; print while s{^ ( \(+ ) ( \ ) + ) \( } { " ( ) " x ( length ( $ 2 ) - 1 ) . " ( " x ( length ( $ 1 ) - length ( $ 2 ) + 2 ) . " ) " }xe ;
This is understandably mystifying , since in tidying it up ( and getting it to run as fast as possible ) I also erased all the clues as to how I got here to begin with .
Folks on the mailing list asked how I came up with this .
What follows is a somewhat edited version of my reply .
I said at the time : I can explain how I thought it up , although I 'm not sure whether the explanation will be helpful or whether it will sound like " I just counted the legs and divided by four . "
By this I meant that the explanation might leave people even more mystified than the algorithm itself .
I 'm still not sure it wo n't sound like that , so I 'm going to include the following one - paragraph summary that omits the details :
One of the other list members suggested an alternative representation for the strings that seemed promising , so I tried out some examples .
Close examination of those examples reminded me of a technique I had used to solve some other problems , so I tried to apply it in this case with the necesary variations .
It worked well enough to continue the investigation , but the alternative representation was getting in the way .
So I took what I had learned from applying the technique to the alternative representation and tried to write an algorithm to do the same thing directly to the strings of parentheses .
Then I optimized the result for speed and code compactness .
The details follow .
I had originally planned to write a recursive solution , but before I started I thought it would be smart to investigate alternative representations .
( Someday I 'm going to write a long essay about this .
I mentioned to Kurt Starsinic last week that the one sure sign of a program written by a novice programmer is that it will represent the data internally in the same format in which it needs to be output , typically as strings . )
One of the representations I looked at was one that had earlier been mentioned by Roger Burton West on the list .
In this representation , a string of one " ( " followed by n " ) " 's becomes the number n , thus : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1111 ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ) 1102 ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ) 1021 ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) 1012 ( ) ( ( ( ) ) ) 1003 ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ) 0211 ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ) 0202 ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ) 0121 ( ( ) ( ) ( ) ) 0112 ( ( ) ( ( ) ) ) 0103 ( ( ( ) ) ) ( ) 0031 ( ( ( ) ) ( ) ) 0022 ( ( ( ) ( ) ) ) 0013 ( ( ( ( ) ) ) ) 0004
Now if you look at the right - hand column , and at the way the numbers , change , it will seem awfully familiar .
Or at least , it felt familiar to me .
It reminded me very strongly of a counting process .
The essence of a counting process is that you find the rightmost column that has a certain property , and then you do a little transformation on it so that it gets a little less of that property and the columns to the right get reset to have more of it .
I realize that if you 've never thought of it that way that is going to sound totally bizarre , so here 's an example .
Let 's count base - 10 numerals .
The magic property in this case is the property of being less than 9 .
0 has the largest possible amount of this property , since it is as much less than 9 as any digit can be .
8 has very little of this property , since it is just a little less than 9 .
9 itself does not have any of this property , since it is not less than 9 .
When you count , you find the rightmost column that is less than 9 and then you do a little transformation on it so that it has a little less of that property , so that it a little closer to 9 : 387 388 389
After you have done that a few times , you get to a point where the rightmost column 's less - than - 9 - ness has been entirely depleted and you can't change it any more .
So you move to the next column to the left and deplete that one instead , and you reset the rightmost column so that it is full of less - than - 9 - ness again : 390 Then you continue : 391 392 ... 399 and now you have to deplete the less - than - 9 - ness of the third column , and reset the two to its right : 400 This may be a weird way to look at counting , but it describes all sorts of useful processes .
To count in base 2 , you allow the columns to hold 0's and 1's , and the property of interest is the property of being a 0 ; you find the rightmost column that is a 0 , and change it to a 1 , and change the columns to its right back to 0's .
Probably the next simplest example is when the property of interest is that the n'th column contains a number less than or equal to n : 0000 0010 0100 0110 0200 0210 1000 1010 1100 1110 1200 1210 2000 2010 ...
3210 Order
Higher - Order Perl
from Powell 's Higher - Order Perl , where I called it the " odometer method " .
It 's used again in the following section to enumerate DNA sequences .
So it 's a pretty fundamental technique , and turns out to be useful in a wide variety of settings .
Another example I was already familiar with is like the base - 2 counting example , but with the added restriction that you are not allowed to have two adjacent 1's : 0000000 0000001 0000010 0000100 0000101 0001000 0001001 0001010 0010000 0010001 0010010 0010100 0010101 0100000 ...
We can generate these strings by repeatedly doing this : s/00 ( ( 10 ) * 1 ? ) $ / " 01 " . " 0 " x length $ 1/e ; ( This pattern has close relations to the Fibonacci sequence .
For example , the nth string contains a single 1 exactly when n is a Fibonacci number .
Moreover , every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum of distinct nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers , the so - called " Zeckendorff representation " , and this counting thing tells you what it is .
This is analogous to the way that every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum of distinct powers of 2 , and the binary expansion tells you what it is . )
So anyway , I was already familiar with this idea , and when I saw the parenthesis numbers , it reminded me strongly of one of these counting processes .
Here they are again : 1111 1102 1021 1012 1003 0211 0202 0121 0112 0103 0031 0022 0013 0004
Here the rule seems to be that you always decrement the rightmost nonzero digit that is n't in the last column and increment the following digit — I imagine that the digits are little heaps of 1 's , and you are allowed to transfer a 1 from its heap to the heap on its right .
But there are some additional constraints .
Since a number n here represents the string ( ) ) ) ... ) , with n close parentheses , we have the constraints that the leftmost column may not exceed 1 ; the sum of the two leftmost columns may not exceed 2 , and so on .
Under these constraints , 1111 is clearly an extreme case , and no string has the 1 's any farther to the left .
To go from 1111 to 1102 , the rightmost moveable 1 , which is in the third column , moves to the right , into the fourth column , which I now imagine contains a heap of two 1's .
Now the rightmost 1 is in the second column .
So I reset the columns to the right of that ( getting back 1111 ) and then move the 1 from the second to the third column , yielding 1021 .
Again , I imagine that the 2 here represents a heap of two 1 's .
These 1's can move to the right , yielding 1012 and then 1003 .
Now I 'll need to move the 1 from the first to the second column , so I reset the columns to the right of that ( getting back 1111 again ) and move the 1 from the first to the second column , yielding 0211 .
Then the 1 in the third column moves , yielding 0202 , and then I reset the third and fourth columns back to 0211 so that I can move a 1 from the second to the third column , yielding 0121 .
My first cut at implementing this actually manipulated these digit strings directly , like this : output while s / ( [ 1 - 9 ] ) ( 0 * ) ( [ 1 - 9 ] ) $ / ( $ 1 - 1 ) . ( $ 3 - length ( $ 2) +1) .1 x length ( $ 2 ) /e ;
As a result , it would n't work for n > 9 .
But after I thought about it some more , I realized I did n't need to deal with the digit strings ; I could directly manipulate the parentheses in the corresponding way .
This was faster , simpler , and got rid of the n < 10 restriction .
Translated back into parentheses , the algorithm might even be simpler to understand .
The property we are trying to reduce is appearances of ) ( , in which ( appears to the right of ) .
In ( ) ( ) ( ) ...( ) , the open parentheses are as far to the right as they can be , so this represents the maximal configuration .
At each step , we 're going to find the rightmost moveable open parenthesis , and we 're going to move it one step to the left .
That is , we 're going to find the rightmost ) ( and change it to ( ) .
If there are other parentheses to the right of the ones that moved , we 'll reset them into their minimal configuration .
In what follows , the ) ( that just changed to ( ) is in red , and the parentheses to its right that were reset are in blue .
The ) ( that is about to change to ( ) in the next step is in boldface .
In the initial configuration , the rightmost ) ( is in positions 6 - 7 : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
1111 We replace it with ( ) : ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ) 1102 Now the rightmost ) ( is in positions 4 and 5 .
We replace it with ( ) and reset the following parentheses to the minimal configuration : ( ) ( ( ) ) ( )
1021 The rightmost ) ( is on the right again , so we get : ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) 1012 Now the rightmost ) ( is at positions 5 and 6 , so the string changes to : ( ) ( ( ( ) ) ) 1003 Now the only ) ( is far to the left , at positions 2 – 3 , so when we change it , we need to reset the parentheses to its right : ( ( ) ) ( ) ( )
0211
And it continues in the same way : ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ) 0202 ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ) 0121 ( ( ) ( ) ( ) ) 0112 ( ( ) ( ( ) ) ) 0103 ( ( ( ) ) ) ( ) 0031 ( ( ( ) ) ( ) ) 0022 ( ( ( ) ( ) ) ) 0013 ( (( ( ) ) ) ) 0004
After I had implemented that , I realized there was nothing stopping me from writing all the strings backward , and doing the substitutions at the left end of the string instead of at the right end .
This is always much cheaper in perl 's regex engine because it does n't have to guess where to start matching in the target string .
So I reversed the whole thing .
It no longer produced the parentheses in lexicographic order ( unless you read right to left ) but it was substantially faster .

XSS Hole in Reddit Allows Gaping Access : Proof of Concept
Fixed by Reddit .
So , a few months back Digg added a new feature that allowed users to invite and add friends more easily .
Unfortunately , as I reported then , this hole allowed a site to automatically add friends if the visitor was still logged into Digg .
This story did quite well in Reddit , often considered rivals , actually out performing the story on Digg which was , unsurprisingly , quickly buried .
Nevertheless , an XSS hole in the handling of non-existing 404 pages has created a gaping hole which can allow a site to perform almost any site function we would want .
To be fair to Reddit , I figured the Proof of Concept should mimic the same one as I did for Digg , an auto friend adder .
If you are reading this page and are logged into Reddit , assuming the hole has not yet been fixed , you will add “ rjonesx ” as a friend .
By using the most basic XSS and CSRF techniques , I was able to do the following …
Inject a remote script onto a 404 page ( http://www.thegooglecache.com/reddit-friends-adder.js)
Inject an iframe into that same 404 page of the / prefs / friends page
Use the remote script with a basic timed delay to fill out and submit the form on the / prefs / friends page to add rjonesx as a friend
The solution , of course , is as simple as any good XSS security solution .

US antiwar protest groups silent on Cindy Sheehan ’s resignation from Democratic Party
By Patrick Martin
2 June 2007
The organizations and publications that head up the antiwar protest movement in the US have sought to suppress any discussion of the political conclusion drawn by antiwar campaigner Cindy Sheehan that the time has come for opponents of the war in Iraq to break with the Democratic Party .
Sheehan issued an open letter to the Democratic Congress May 26 , announcing her resignation from the Democratic Party in response to last month ’s vote to provide another $ 100 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Two days later , she announced she was temporarily suspending her active role in antiwar protest campaigns , in part due to family and health concerns .
In that letter she noted bitterly that she had come under attack from some within the antiwar protest milieu because of her public repudiation of the Democrats .
Both the corporate - controlled media and the antiwar “ left ” groups have focused attention on the second statement and downplayed or suppressed outright any reference to the first .
( A Google news search , for instance , reveals that not a single “ mainstream ” publication quoted Sheehan ’s declaration , “ I am leaving the Democratic Party , ” although there were hundreds of reports of her second statement about discontinuing her active role in the antiwar protest movement . )
The reasons for the media to suppress any reference to Sheehan ’s decision to quit the Democratic Party are obvious : the major daily newspapers and television networks are controlled by the same financial aristocracy whose social interests are upheld by the two - party system .
Anything that challenges the political monopoly of the Democrats and Republicans must be either ignored or ridiculed .
But what of the antiwar protest organizations and the array of left - liberal pressure groups ?
A survey of their responses to Sheehan ’s resignation from the Democratic Party shows a revealing pattern .
All of these groups , from the avowedly pro-Democratic Party MoveOn.org to ostensibly “ socialist ” organizations such as the International Socialist Organization and Workers World Party , shy away from , downplay or flatly reject Sheehan ’s conclusion that a political alternative to the Democratic Party is needed .
The essential political orientation common to all of these organizations is reflected in the similarity of their methods .
None of these groups presents Sheehan ’s criticism of the Democrats fairly and honestly , and none of them directly addresses her political conclusion .
They combine falsification and distortion of the most shameless kind with abject political cowardice .
The Nation
John Nichols of The Nation magazine describes Sheehan patronizingly as “ an honest player who spoke her mind — sometimes intemperately , often imperfectly , always sincerely . ”
His commentary does not mention Sheehan ’s resignation from the Democratic Party , making only this cryptic reference : “ It is reasonable to argue with Sheehan about her read of politics and assessment of politicians .
She ’s the first to admit she ’s no expert on campaign strategy or legislative tactics ” ( See : “ Cindy Sheehan ’s Farewell ” ) .
The issue , however , is not one of political tactics and strategy , but of basic principle .
Sheehan has concluded — on the basis of a deeply felt and steadfast opposition to the war and the Bush administration , and bitter personal experience with the two - faced and cynical maneuvers of the Democrats — that the Democratic Party is not an instrument through which a struggle against war and for progressive social change can be conducted , but is instead an obstacle to any such struggle .
Sheehan has , to her credit , decided to take a principled stand .
That she as yet lacks a worked - out political perspective is entirely understandable in a country where historical truth is systematically suppressed and a media establishment devotes its huge resources to pumping out government propaganda and lies on a daily basis .
Her great strength is that she strives to speak the truth .
She has taken the measure of the Democrats not only from their political record , but also from considerable first - hand experience .
She has met or been in contact with nearly every leading Democratic politician in the two years since she first came to public attention when she established “ Camp Casey ” on the outskirts of Bush ’s ranch in Crawford , Texas , and began to demand an explanation from the “ commander - in - chief ” on why her son , killed in Iraq in April of 2004 , died .
Her revulsion against the double - dealing and cowardly capitulation of the congressional Democrats reflects the thinking of millions of people in the US .
As Sheehan said in an interview this week on the radio program “ Democracy Now ! , ” “ If we do n’t get a viable third party — or some people say second party ; you know , the Democrats and Republicans are so similar , and their pockets are lined by the same people — we are — our representative republic is doomed ... we really need an opposition party in this country .
But we vote out of our fear .
We go and we vote for the lesser of two evils , and we always end up getting somebody evil . ”
The Nation is adamantly opposed to any struggle to develop a political movement of the working class independent of the Democratic Party and opposed to the two - party system .
Its entire orientation revolves around the election of a Democratic administration in 2008 and continued Democratic control of Congress — which would result , not incidentally , in hundreds if not thousands of well - paying jobs for the privileged middle - class layer whose interests it articulates .
MoveOn.org
Another major player in the antiwar protest movement is MoveOn.org , which represents a wing of the Democratic Party .
Its executive director , Eli Pariser , was interviewed Wednesday on CNN about Sheehan ’s suspension of activity in antiwar protests .
He voiced criticism of the Senate and House Democrats who voted for the war - funding bill , but added , “ Let ’s not forget , it ’s the Republicans who are obstructing the — you know , who are obstructing the two - thirds vote we ’re going to need to override President Bush ’s veto . ”
At one point , CNN interviewer John Roberts asked Pariser directly about Sheehan ’s criticism of MoveOn.org for acting as a political arm of the Democrats and subordinating the issue of the war in Iraq to the campaign to elect Democrats in 2008 .
According to the transcript , Pariser ’s answer combined evasion with a slur against Sheehan , suggesting her response to the war was too emotional .
Roberts : MoveOn.org was one of Cindy Sheehan ’s early supporters .
She then turned against your organization as she moved further to the left , claiming that you ’re not anti-war enough .
Is there any validity to her charges ?
Pariser :
Well , you know , I think none of us can really understand what it ’s like to be a mother who lost her son in this war .
And I think , you know , in any war , but especially in a war that was as tragically mismanaged , as huge a blunder as this one .
So , Cindy and MoveOn , you know , our members have had differences with her from time to time .
I think she was a voice though at the beginning who spoke out when few other people would .
And we ’re very thankful for that ( Partial transcript here ) .
The Green Party
The Green Party issued a statement May 30 hailing Sheehan for “ her courage and sacrifice . ”
The statement declared , “ Green Party leaders offered their thanks to antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan for dedicating three years of her life to ending the Iraq War , in the wake of Ms. Sheehan ’s announcement that she is retiring from the movement to end the war ” .
This statement continued with quotations from various state and national representatives of the party .
Nowhere in any of their comments was there a single reference to the Democratic Party , or to Sheehan ’s break with it , despite the fact that the very existence of the Green Party as an electoral organization is supposedly bound up with a rejection of the two - party system .
The Greens do not welcome Sheehan ’s public letter of resignation from the Democratic Party , comment on its significance , or suggest that in doing so she is giving voice to the sentiments of millions of people currently trapped within the two - party framework .
This silence demonstrates that the Green Party ’s independence from the Democratic Party is purely nominal , a device to allow the Greens to exert a bit of pressure in an attempt to push the Democrats to the left .
They do not aspire to lead a mass break with the two - party system , nor do they believe such a political eruption is possible , or even desirable .
United for Peace and Justice
A similar commentary on Sheehan ’s statements came from Leslie Cagan , co-chair of United for Peace and Justice , the major liberal - left umbrella group for antiwar protest demonstrations .
Cagan ’s response was published as an article on the web site of Political Affairs , the magazine of the Communist Party USA .
The Stalinists have perhaps the foulest record of support for the Democratic Party of any nominally left - wing political tendency , invariably denouncing any struggle by working people against the Democrats as a conspiracy by the ultra - right to divide and weaken “ progressives ” — in which category they place such stalwart defenders of American imperialism as Bill and Hillary Clinton .
Cagan flatters Sheehan , declaring , “ Her clarity and her energy helped to inspire others to activism , ” but makes no mention of the Democratic Party at all .
There is one coded reference to the subject : “ There are differences among us and there always will be .
The goal should n’t necessarily be to eradicate those differences but rather to find new , constructive ways to deal with them .
We ’re going to need every ally and every tool in the toolbox ... to end this war ” ( See article here ) .
These words will be clearly understood by the Stalinist milieu for which Cagan is writing in Political Affairs , but perhaps not by less experienced readers .
Translated into plain language , it means that the struggle against the war in Iraq must be subordinated to the overriding goal of electing a Democratic president and Democratic Congress in 2008 .
Clinton , Obama , Edwards , Pelosi and Reid must be included in the category of “ every ally and every tool in the toolbox . ”
The International Socialist Organization
Finally , there are the responses to Sheehan from the nominally socialist organizations .
Socialist Worker , the publication of the International Socialist Organization ( ISO ) , a split - off from the state capitalist tendency founded by the British ex-Trotskyist Tony Cliff , refers to Sheehan ’s statements in its lead article on the passage of the war - spending bill by Congress .
Again , there is no reference to the antiwar activist ’s resignation from the Democratic Party .
Instead , Socialist Worker writes , “ A few days later , an emotional Sheehan announced that she was retreating from political activity , ” as though this was simply the expression of political demoralization after the congressional vote .
The ISO reassures its readers that things are not so bad : “ For antiwar activists , it is equally important to recognize how much the ground has shifted in mainstream politics — in spite of Bush ’s victory on war spending .
The Democrats ’ surrender was greeted by an outpouring of anger , not least from liberal individuals and organizations that were quickest to defend the Democrats in the past .
There is a rebellion brewing in the base of the Democratic Party — even if its political outline and future direction is still vague . ”
As evidence of this “ outpouring , ” the ISO cites , not Sheehan ’s public attack on the Democrats , but the verbal scolding of Reid , Pelosi & Co. by MoveOn.org and liberal MSNBC journalist Keith Olbermann .
According to their analysis , such criticism “ has created the potential for much larger numbers of people to take an active stand against the war .
Antiwar protest and organization has lagged behind the overwhelming sentiment against the war ...
The key to ending the occupation of Iraq and building an opposition to the US empire lies outside Washington — in building up antiwar groups , organizing protests and turning the vast sentiment against the war into active opposition . ”
For all the radical rhetoric , the ISO does not pose the central task confronting working people in the United States , the building of a new , mass independent political party directed against the Democrats , the Republicans , and the corporate financial oligarchy .
The perspective presented here is one of continued impotent protests which leave the two - party political monopoly undisturbed .
Workers World Party
Even more heated rhetoric appears in Workers World , the publication of the Workers World Party ( WWP ) .
A lead article on the passage of the war - funding bill , posted May 31 , carries the headline , “ Democrats Bait and Switch : Betray Voters , Okay War Funds . ”
It denounces the Democrats for “ stunning ... cynicism , ” “ total capitulation , ” “ grandstanding as war opponents , ” and “ defending imperialist interests ” .
Lest the Democratic leadership take too much offense , however , this is followed by effusive praise for two House Democrats , Dennis Kucinich and Barbara Lee , who voted against the funding bill , and extended quotations of their remarks in the congressional debate .
The article then turns to Sheehan , quoting her May 26 letter of resignation from the Democratic Party , which Workers World concedes expressed “ the deep frustration of millions of people who are opposed to the war and had faith in the Democratic Party . ”
The Workers World article , however , draws no political conclusions from this event , other than the need to “ move the struggle into the streets , ” i.e. , into protests directed to the same Democratic politicians who have just demonstrated their complicity in Bush ’s imperialist war in Iraq .
Despite their verbal attacks on the Democrats , they have only tactical differences with openly pro-Democratic outfits like MoveOn.org .
They believe it more effective to lobby Congress with marchers on the Mall than with email blasts on the Internet .
The article points to a planned “ encampment ” outside the US Capitol in late September , and a march on September 29 , timed to coincide with the Democrats ’ own plans for another series of phony antiwar proposals — after which Congress will dutifully rubberstamp another year of bloodshed in Iraq in the name of “ supporting our troops . ”
According to Workers World , the call for these demonstrations “ opens an opportunity for an independent intervention representing millions of workers and oppressed people . ”
This is to turn language on its head : an “ independent intervention ” on the legislative timetable of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi !
The Workers World Party is perfectly prepared to make verbal denunciations of the two - party system , declaring , “ Both the Democratic and Republican parties are committed and loyal to the same imperialist system of corporate rule , based on private ownership of the resources and labor of all of society on a global scale . ”
But in limiting the alternative to “ militant action [ emphasis mine ] independent from both capitalist parties , ” the WWP effectively rules out political action : the struggle to build a socialist , mass political party of working people as the alternative to the parties of big business .
That is because the WWP , for all its occasional paeans to “ socialism ” ( whose highest expression , according to them , is the grisly Stalinist dictatorship in North Korea ) , has quite definite and practical relationships with leading Democratic Party politicians which it wishes to maintain — including not only Kucinich and Lee , but also Charles Rangel , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and author of legislation to reestablish a military draft in the United States .
The tendencies discussed above cover the full range of the liberal and radical “ left ” in the United States — that is , they occupy the intermediate position between outright capitalist reaction and the revolutionary socialist perspective advocated by the World Socialist Web Site and Socialist Equality Party .
But they all have one characteristic in common : they reinforce , in one way or another , the political monopoly of the two - party system , through which the American ruling elite purposes its policies of imperialist war abroad and social reaction at home .
A Worcestershire man may well have saved his own life after suffering a " severe allergic reaction " to a hamster bite - by self - administering anti-allergy drugs before paramedics arrived .
The unnamed 50 - year - old was " trying to retrieve his pet from under the floorboards of his home near Evesham " after his daughter accidentally let the beast escape its cage on Monday night , the BBC reports .
The little blighter duly bit him , and by the time medics reached the scene the man was suffering " severe breathing difficulties and was in a semi- conscious state " .
The crew quickly administered more drugs and whisked the patient to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch .
An ambulance service spokesman warned : " If you have been identified as someone who can have severe reactions it is vital that you and your family know what to do .
The man 's actions in administering drugs to himself may well have played an important part in his recovery . "
The victim in this case really did have a narrow escape .
Back in 2004 , a Japanese man died " after a bite from his pet hamster caused anaphylactic shock " .
An autopsy later showed he 'd succumbed to an acute reaction to protein contained in the animal 's saliva . ®
Opera has launched a beta of its mobile browser , Opera Mini : version 4 supports smooth zooming around web pages and server - based page optimisation , giving Opera claim to deliver the whole internet ahead of Apple 's much - anticipated iPhone .
Version 4 of the Java - based browser also makes greater use of the keypad for navigation , freeing up directional keys for control of an on - screen pointer , but it is the zoom function which grabs the attention .
Newly loaded pages are presented in their entirety ; complete but impossible to read , and Opera Mini tries to guess which part of the page you actually want to look at .
Focus is shifted to that area , though you can use the directional keys to change it , and a smooth zoom then renders the content in a readable size .
Opera has produced a , slightly arrogant , video comparing its product with the iPhone .
It highlights cross - phone compatibility and low cost compared to Apple 's baby .
It might seem odd to compare a downloadable web browser to a phone handset , but if the iPhone is being sold on the premise that it 's the first time the web has been truly navigable then it's fair for Opera to compare when it believes its product achieves the same thing .
Readers can try the beta of Opera Mini for themselves , those wanting to compare it to the iPhone will have to wait until the end of the month . ®
China continues its growth in the blogosphere with 20 Million strong and growing according to the Chinese Internet Association .
While still pondering a strong move to cover the Chinese Blogosphere I ’d like to note the Chinese blogosphere is heavily monitored by government sources while the US Blogosphere is barely monitored by corporate interests in the US .
The correlation is interesting considering the harm that can be done on the blogosphere to a company .
It will be interesting to see if US companies begin to watch the global blogosphere more as plant workers , and factory workers for companies like Apple , Dell , and other tech companies and others begin to blog .
Will companies shift to starting to pay attention to international bloggers ?
The number of Internet bloggers in China reached 20.8 million at the end of 2006 , with more than three million web - users regularly posting their writings , state press said .
Web logs in China took 101 million hits in 2006 , Xinhua news agency said , citing the China Internet Survey Report 2007 .
“ Web logs have gradually developed into a new trend in Internet information communication , many public figures as well as ordinary people use web blogs … to express their thoughts , ” the report quoted Huang Chengqing of the China Internet Association as saying .
BBC Arabic.com asked four Somalis about conditions in the city , how they viewed Ethiopian intervention in their country , and their hopes for the future .
SAFIA , MOGADISHU , RESEARCHER
Life is harsh here because of recent events ; and it 's been made worse by Ethiopian interference .
Prices are rocketing , unemployment is rising and chaos prevails .
We feel afraid because there is a rampant lack of security .
We see more assassinations and we hear more bombings ; shops especially are being targeted .
The government has stepped up its campaign to restrict our freedom of expression .
I think they want to prevent the outside world knowing what has happened in Somalia .
Of course there were big disagreements before [ under the rule of the Union of Islamic Courts ] , but at least that came within the context of freedom of expression .
It is really terrifying here .
Everyone believes Ethiopia is only after its own interests in Somalia .
I do n't see any popular support for the new government .
With the worsening security and economic situation , khat [ a mild stimulant ] is once again openly on sale in the markets .
I think the Ethiopian forces should withdraw and new negotiations should be launched between the disputing parties .
If not , the government and the Ethiopian forces will suffer heavily , as the resistance is growing day by day .
Members of the government are afraid for their lives .
They are aware that they are not popular .
They should pack up and leave .
It is in everyone 's best interests .
MAHMOUD ABDULLAH , MOGADISHU , CHARITY CHAIRMAN
I hope Ethiopia 's interference will help solve our problems - even though no - one here wants or accepts Ethiopia 's involvement .
The Ethiopian forces should focus on helping the transitional government build infrastructure , achieve peace and generally create a state .
The Islamic Courts radically changed things in Somalia .
There was safety , peace and commerce .
In other words , they brought Mogadishu back to life .
However , the Islamic Courts did not really create a state or its institutions .
They created a tribal regime instead .
The Ethiopian presence is a reality we just have to accept .
What really matters is that we get peace and security .
The Islamic Courts should be allowed to return only as part of the institutions of a new government , and not on the basis of the tribal regime they adopted before they collapsed .
I think life will go on , and the Somalis will manage .
We have survived more than 15 years of worse conditions than this .
MUSTAFA EL- SOMALI , SUDAN , STUDENT
It is a very precarious situation there in Mogadishu .
Humanitarian conditions are getting worse , as Somalis suffer from Ethiopian interference and American bombings .
Violence breaks out and we do n't know when it will finish .
I think the dispute between the Somali government and the Islamic Courts is ideological , not based on power - sharing ambitions .
Foreign interference is not new in Somalia .
It 's been there for a while .
The road to peace in Somalia should start by ending Ethiopian , US and Kenyan interference in Somali affairs .
Somalis should take power .
The Arab League and European Union should be the ones who help the reconciliation effort .
ZAKIYA ABDULLAH , MOGADISHU , STUDENT
When the Islamic Courts were in charge , we had peace .
I could go and visit people easily , and move around without being afraid .
It 's true they banned cinemas , but people did n't complain about that .
There are no such restrictions on cinemas now .
However , we need to wait and see what the new interim government and Ethiopian forces will do .
I do n't mind foreign intervention if it improves the situation here .
Otherwise , the intervention should stop .
Life is difficult , but not as bad as it was before .
We do have a problem with freedom of movement .
I hope this improves .

Star Wars : A New Hope has become a classic in the 30 years since its release , and looking back at the film today , it 's easy to see why .
Though it 's definitely the slowest of the Star Wars movies , it 's by no means boring , and most fans regard it as one of the two best movies in the series .
There are plenty of reasons to love this movie , but I 've selected ten particular moments that really stand out and define the film as classic for me .
# 1 : Han Solo Chases
The Stormtroopers !
Our heroes are wandering the corridors of the Death Star trying to get back to the Millennium Falcon , when all of a sudden they round a corner and run into half a dozen stormtroopers who are just as surprised to see them .
Without even thinking about it , Han recklessly starts chasing them down the hallway , firing his blaster like a madman and intimidating them into running away with his " crazy powers " .
I think they totally ruined this moment in the Special Edition , where Han rounds a corner and encounters an enormous room filled to the brim with stormtroopers ( " cuz more is funnier , am I right guys ? " ) .
For my money , it 's much funnier in the original when they reach a dead - end , everyone halts , and the stormtroopers collectively seem to realize that running from a guy they outnumber 6 - to - 1 is really kind of stupid .
And so the chase continues back up the hall , this time with Han being pursued by the stormtroopers .
# 2 : Luke Drinks Blue Milk !
Okay , so this is n't the most exciting thing on this list , but when I was a kid , seeing Luke and his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru drinking what appeared to be blue milk out of space age Tupperware containers blew my friggin ' mind , man !
I was so curious to know what their mysterious " space food " and " cosmic drink " tasted like .
It only dawned on me years later that Tattooine cuisine probably tasted about as appetizing as tree bark and windshield washer fluid , but when you 're a kid these kinds of things keep you up at nights , dammit .
# 3 : " You 'll Be Dead ! "
This is one of my favorite cheesy exchanges of dialog in the entire trilogy .
Luke is just sitting there minding his own business when all of a sudden a guy , who we 'll pretend for a moment I 'm not dorky enough to know the real name of so we 'll just call him " Pigface " , rudely taps Luke on the shoulder and informs him that his friend " Walrusface " does n't like him .
Luke kind of has an " oooooookay " moment and goes back to minding his drink when suddenly the guy taps him again and tells him that he does n't much care for him either .
At this point Luke is clearly uncomfortable , so he apologizes , which prompts Pigface to warn him that he'd better be careful because he 's wanted in twelve systems .
It 's pretty clear that Pigface is a drunk just spoiling for a fight and Luke 's totally not playing into his hands , so when Luke meekly responds " I 'll be careful " , ol ' Piggy gets up in his face and says " You 'll be dead ! "
Then of course Obi-Wan kicks some ass and starts chopping arms off .
I just love the way the actor delivers his lines though — makes me chuckle every time I watch the scene .
# 4 : The Clumsy Stormtrooper !
I do n't think there 's a person alive who does n't know about this one already , but it 's such a great moment I 'd be remiss if I did n't include it .
Threepio and Artoo are holed up in some kind of control room waiting for Han and Luke to rescue Princess Leia when some stormtroopers suspect something is amiss and break into the room .
And that 's when Captain Klutzo ( on the right ) smacks his head into the bottom of the door when he walks into the room .
I can only imagine they could n't afford to film another take of this , George Lucas thought it was funny , or they just did n't notice until they were editing the film .
In any event , they even added in a sound effect of his helmet going " clink " against the door and the lead stormtrooper says " see to him ! " but does n't turn around at all , which makes me think they probably did n't notice until they were editing .
Regardless of why it ended up in the movie , millions of fans are now extremely glad this hilarious shot is there .
# 5 : Han Shoots Greedo !
This is another moment that they completely ruined in the Special Edition , and I do n't think there 's a Star Wars fan alive who does n't prefer the original version of this .
Han Solo is hanging out in the Mos Eisley cantina when Greedo , some punkass upstart of a bounty hunter , corners him and attempts to take him in for Jabba the Hutt .
Han distracts the inexperienced Greedo by picking at a spot on the wall with one hand , carefully pulls out his gun with the other , and shoots Greedo dead from under the table .
This is probably the single most badass Han Solo moment in the trilogy , and Lucas completely undermined what used to be a great dynamic character by having him wait to shoot in " self defense " ( which is what it was originally anyway , since Greedo had a gun pointed at him ) , and the revised version just looked awful since no one believed for a minute that even a chump like Greedo could have missed from point - blank range .
George Lucas now claims that Greedo shooting first is how he originally intended the scene , but there 's no special effects limitation that would have prevented him from doing that in 1977 , and if you watch the scene , it 's obviously not constructed that way and the change feels painfully forced .
George Lucas is made of lies .
# 6 : The Dianoga !
In the trash compactor on the Death Star , there is a creature called a Dianoga ( and I am enough of a dork to know that but let 's pretend I only just looked it up ) , and nobody really knows what it looks like because all we ever see is a freaky eyestalk and a bit of a tentacle .
It sucks Luke under the nasty water and the only thing that saves him is the fact that the walls started closing in , causing Mr. Dianoga to promptly get the hell out of there .
As awesome and tension - filled as the walls - closing - in scene is , to me the creepiest thing about the garbage compactor is just knowing that there 's something alive swimming around in there .
# 7 : Old Farts Lightsaber Duel !
This has got to be the least exciting and most visually unimpressive lightsaber duel in all of the movies , but for that very reason , it has its own humorous charm .
It kind of makes sense too , because it basically amounts to an old man fighting a robot , so it has all the adrenaline pumping action that you might expect from seeing a geriatric fight a quadruple amputee .
Vader does n't seem to really " get into " most of his lightsaber duels , and it becomes obvious in Empire that he 's more than capable of kicking ass but he just likes toying with people , but at this point in the story we still do n't know that so he kind of comes across as a feeb .
My favorite part in the entire duel has to be when Obi-Wan slowly spins around for no good reason at all , totally opening his backside up for Vader to take a few leisurely swings , but Vader was apparently caught snoozing and he somehow he manages to finish spinning and get his blade up in time to block .
Wonderfully choreographed ?
Perhaps not .
Damned amusing to watch ?
You bet !
# 8 : Drunk Jawas !
It amuses the hell out of me every time I notice these surely - drunk jawas just sort of chilling outside the Mos Eisley cantina ( which is so scummy it does n't even have a name , like " Bob 's Place " ) .
I can only imagine what kind of lives these jawas lead , working hard all day scavenging and stealing parts , and then heading off to the bar to get away from their old ladies and knock back a few drinks .
Ah , who am I kidding ?
Look at those guys !
They 're more than likely unemployed .
On a side note , it seems to me than many Star Wars fans have come to the same conclusion that Obi-Wan is almost certainly a tremendous boozehound and regular patron of said cantina .
I mean , think about it : the guy probably feels totally responsible for Anakin becoming Darth Vader and killing all the other Jedi in the first place , so it 's no wonder he'd be drowning his sorrows in a bottle all the time .
Hell , I 'm surprised that he was out of the bar long enough for Luke to have found him in the desert !
# 9 : Vader Chokes a Bitch !
Of all the scenes in this movie , this one probably dates it in the 1970s more than any other , because of all the old guys sporting serious sideburns sitting around a table discussing plans and politics .
One guy pipes up that he does n't believe that Vader 's so - called super powers are anything to write home about , so Vader in turn gives him ( and the audience ) a much - needed demonstration .
This is the first instance where we really see the Force in action , we learn that Vader 's powers are legit and that he 's totally playing for keeps .
I just love the facial expressions this guy makes as he clutches his throat and pretends he 's being choked .
# 10 : A Spastic Tusken Raider !
The Tusken Raiders , or " Sand People " , were always cool because they were a bit of a mystery .
No one really knows what they look like under their rags and cloth - wraps , so they really grabbed hold of my imagination when I first saw the movie as a child .
Our first close encounter with them in the movie is about as close as you can get , as one of these freaky dudes sneaks up on Luke and attacks him from behind .
He gets super excited and holds his gaffi stick up in the air , thrusting it up and down and grunting like a fool .
It 's a really great , tense moment in the movie and it's also fun to reenact and annoy your friends every time you pick up any kind of stick - like object .
Of course , in doing so , you will also look like a complete idiot , but hey , that 's never seemed to slow me down .
So that 's my Star Wars list .
Go back and take a look at my Empire list if you have n't seen that and you enjoyed this .
Jedi is certainly forthcoming and I 'm even thinking about doing the prequels as well .
But the question is , if I do the prequels , would you rather I try to actually find ten things that do n't suck about those movies ( which would be quite a challenge , I 'm sure , but it could be fun ) , or would you rather see the ten most sucktastic things about them ?
Write in and let me know what you 'd like to see — I 'm open to either idea !

Information Security and Externalities
Information insecurity is costing us billions .
There are many different ways in which we pay for information insecurity .
We pay for it in theft , such as information theft , financial theft and theft of service .
We pay for it in productivity loss , both when networks stop functioning and in the dozens of minor security inconveniences we all have to endure on a daily basis .
We pay for it when we have to buy security products and services to reduce those other two losses .
We pay for the lack of security , year after year .
Fundamentally , the issue is insecure software .
It is a result of bad design , poorly implemented features , inadequate testing and security vulnerabilities from software bugs .
The money we spend on security is to deal with the myriad effects of insecure software .
Unfortunately , the money spent does not improve the security of that software .
We are paying to mitigate the risk rather than fix the problem .
The only way to fix the problem is for vendors to improve their software .
They need to design security in their products from the start and not as an add - on feature .
Software vendors need also to institute good security practices and improve the overall quality of their products .
But they will not do this until it is in their financial best interests to do so .
And so far , it is not .
The reason is easy to explain .
In a capitalist society , businesses are profit - making ventures , so they make decisions based on both short - and long - term profitability .
This holds true for decisions about product features and sale prices , but it also holds true for software .
Vendors try to balance the costs of more secure software — extra developers , fewer features , longer time to market — against the costs of insecure software : expense to patch , occasional bad press , potential loss of sales .
So far , so good .
But what the vendors do not look at is the total costs of insecure software ; they only look at what insecure software costs them .
And because of that , they miss a lot of the costs : all the money we , the software product buyers , are spending on security .
In economics , this is known as an externality : the cost of a decision that is borne by people other than those taking the decision .
Normally , you would expect users to respond by favouring secure products over insecure products — after all , users are also making their buying decisions based on the same capitalist model .
Unfortunately , that is not generally possible .
In some cases software monopolies limit the available product choice ; in other cases , the ‘ lock - in effect ’ created by proprietary file formats or existing infrastructure or compatibility requirements makes it harder to switch ; and in still other cases , none of the competing companies have made security a differentiating characteristic .
In all cases , it is hard for an average buyer to distinguish a truly secure product from an insecure product with a ‘ trust us ’ marketing campaign .
Because of all these factors , there are no real consequences to the vendors for having insecure or low - quality software .
Even worse , the marketplace often rewards low quality .
More precisely , it rewards additional features and timely release dates , even if they come at the expense of quality .
The result is what we have all witnessed : insecure software .
Companies find that it is cheaper to weather the occasional press storm , spend money on PR campaigns touting good security and fix public problems after the fact , than to design security in from the beginning .
And so the externality remains …
If we expect software vendors to reduce features , lengthen development cycles and invest in secure software development processes , it needs to be in their financial best interests to do so .
If we expect corporations to spend significant resources on their own network security — especially the security of their customers — it also needs to be in their financial best interests .
Liability law is one way to make it in those organisations ’ best interests .
If end users could sue software manufacturers for product defects , then the cost of those defects to the software manufacturers would rise .
Manufacturers would then pay the true economic cost for poor software , and not just a piece of it .
So when they balance the cost of making their software secure versus the cost of leaving their software insecure , there would be more costs on the latter side .
This would provide an incentive for them to make their software more secure .
Basically , we have to tweak the risk equation in such a way that the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) of a company cares about actually fixing the problem — and putting pressure on the balance sheet is the best way to do that .
Security is risk management ; liability fiddles with the risk equation .
Clearly , liability is not all or nothing .
There are many parties involved in a typical software attack .
The list includes :
the company that sold the software with the vulnerability in the first place
the person who wrote the attack tool
the attacker himself , who used the tool to break into a network
and finally , the owner of the network , who was entrusted with defending that network .
100 % of the liability should not fall on the shoulders of the software vendor , just as 100 % should not fall on the attacker or the network owner .
But today , 100 % of the cost falls directly on the network owner , and that just has to stop .
Certainly , making software more secure will cost money , and manufacturers will have to pass those costs on to users in the form of higher prices .
But users are already paying extra costs for insecure software : costs of third - party security products , costs of consultants and security services companies , direct and indirect costs of losses .
But as long as one is going to pay anyway , it would be better to pay to fix the problem .
Forcing the software vendor to pay to fix the problem and then passing those costs on to users means that the actual problem might get fixed .
Liability changes everything .
Currently , there is no reason for a software company not to offer feature after feature after feature , without any regard to security .
Liability forces software companies to think twice before changing something .
Liability forces companies to protect the data they are entrusted with .
Liability means that those in the best position to fix the problem are actually responsible for the problem .
Information security is not a technological problem .
It is an economics problem .
And the way to improve information security is to fix the economics problem .
If this is done , companies will come up with the right technological solutions that vendors will happily implement .
Fail to solve the economics problem , and vendors will not bother implementing or researching any security technologies , regardless of how effective they are .

November 1987
Congressman Richard Cheney was the ranking Republican on the congressional committee investigating the Iran - contra affair , in which Reagan administration officials secretly diverted the proceeds of arms sales to Iran to fund the contras in Nicaragua , who were fighting to oust the left - wing government .
Below are excerpts from the section of the committee 's minority report on presidential power , which Cheney and his staff authored .
" Judgments about the Iran - Contra Affair ultimately must rest upon one 's views about the proper roles of Congress and the President in foreign policy .
... [ T ] hroughout the Nation 's history , Congress has accepted substantial exercises of Presidential power -- in the conduct of diplomacy , the use of force and covert action -- which had no basis in statute and only a general basis in the Constitution itself .
... [ M]uch of what President Reagan did in his actions toward Nicaragua and Iran were constitutionally protected exercises of inherent Presidential powers .
... [ T ]he power of the purse ... is not and was never intended to be a license for Congress to usurp Presidential powers and functions .
...
" The boundless view of Congressional power began to take hold in the 1970's , in the wake of the Vietnam War .
The 1972 Senate Foreign Relations Committee 's report recommending the War Powers Act [ which requires presidents to seek Congressional authorization if they deploy U.S. troops for longer than 60 days ] , and the 1974 report of the Select Committee on Intelligence Activities ( chaired by Senator Frank Church and known as the Church Committee ) , both tried to support an all but unlimited Congressional power by invoking the " Necessary and Proper " clause .
That clause says Congress may ' make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing [ legislative ]
Powers , and all Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department of Officer thereof . '
The argument of these two prominent committees was that by granting Congress the power to make rules for the other departments , the Constitution meant to enshrine legislative supremacy except for those few activities explicitly reserved for the other branches .
" One must ignore 200 years of constitutional history to suggest that Congress has a vast reservoir of implied power whose only limits are the powers explicitly reserved to the other branches .
... The Necessary and Proper clause does not permit Congress to pass a law usurping Presidential power .
A law negating Predidential powers cannot be treated as if it were ' necessary and proper for carrying '
Presidential powers ' into E
Ink - jet printers , no longer limited to spitting out simple text documents , are being used nowadays to produce some snazzy images – and even food .
Homaru Cantu , a Cordon Bleu chef , modified an ink - jet printer to use inks made of fruits and vegetables , and paper made of soybeans and potatoes .
" You can make an ink - jet printer do just about anything , " Cantu told New Scientist magazine .
After he prints out his edible artwork , he dips it in a tasty powder and bakes , sautés or chills it .
He even prints menus for the Moto restaurant in Chicago this way , allowing customers to literally chew over their dining decisions .

Dick Cheney was apoplectic today .
No wonder .
He truly was the mastermind behind Iraq .
And , Iraq is a complete disaster .
He and his President got the U.S. in to an unwinnable war that is making us look weak around the world .
Yet , the man who is help leading us to defeat in Iraq is accusing the Democrats of having a " defeatist strategy . "
Seriously , if the Bush team put as much energy in to attacking our enemies in Iraq as they do in to attacking Democrats , we might actually make some progress in their war .
Cheney was clearly firing shots at Harry Reid today .
But , we know he 's not a very good shot .
When asked about Cheney 's tirade , Reid was dismissive :
Reid shrugged off Cheney 's remarks but with his own dig at the vice president .
" I 'm not going to get into a name calling match with the administration 's chief attack dog , " he said .
Vice President Cheney should be the last person to lecture anyone on how leaders should make decisions .
Leaders should make decisions based on facts and reality , two words that seem to be foreign to the Vice President .
This is the same guy who said Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and that we would be greeted as liberators .
And it 's the same guy who continues to assert that Saddam Hussein had links to al Qaeda long after our own intelligence agency conclusively refuted this notion .
To suggest he lacks credibility would be an understatement .
The Vice President 's and others ' attacks on those who disagree with their failed policies are signs of desperation .
They are lashing out because they know the days are numbered for their failed strategy and that the American people and a bipartisan majority are determined to force this Administration to change course in Iraq .
Reid 's spokesperson , Jim Manley , responded with a statement .
What Cheney said was really unworthy of the Majority Leader 's time : Nico at Think Progress thoroughly slices and dices Cheney 's misleading rant .
Theres a skill that should be taught in pharmacy school , but is n’t .
Its learning how to hold a straight face .
All pharmacists , techs , clerks have been in this situation :
You are working along , typical day , when a well endowed ( not in the good way ) woman comes in obviously not wearing a bra .
You think to yourself “ oh please , not today ” but fate drew your unlucky number .
She quickly walks up to the counter , and asks if she could see you .
You do n’t even have a chance to mentally prepare yourself before she horks up her shirt to show you her two very red and very angry mommy - bags right there in the middle of the store for all to see .
She asks “ Is there any cream I can put on these to make the rash go away ? ”
You think “ Holy crap are they really laying on the counter ? ” as your clerks make a bee - line to the break room .
Now a seasoned retail pharmacist would n’t even bat an eye .
Been there , done that , heres your miconazole , thanks for coming .
Now we shall share our secrets .
There are some main types of straight - face holding .
Lets review them .
Laughing :
You mostly get this when the patient says something really stupid and you do n’t wish to make them feel bad .
However there are times when it takes all your will not to laugh at the patient .
A prime example of this is watching an old man bend down to pick up his dropped cane only to rip the loudest , wettest , juiciest fart you have ever heard .
Now to some , farts are n’t funny , but to 99.999 % of the people who are actually living , farts are a joke that never get old .
Other examples include “ oh god ” moments like having someone shout from the isles if they can use a Fleets Enema up their vagina , or asking for the “ large tampons ” because they have an “ especially large cooter ” .
This takes practice .
If the other pharmacists in the store are jokers , then this is a skill you must learn as soon as possible .
Disgusting :
The yeast infection under the breasts is a prime example of this .
Now the goal of this face is to not visibly show that you have been mentally ( or sexually ) scarred from this experience .
You will be shown stuff that you do n’t want to see .
You will have to talk to people who have the worse BO / Breath / Cat piss / etc stank known to man .
Boobs really are n’t / that / bad , however add on the smell of BO and you have some serious face - restraint going on .
This face can also be used when looking at boils , draining wounds , the use of laxatives and pill hunting in poop .
Embarrassing :
This one usually involves teenage girls and personal questions .
Pretty easy to keep a straight face if you know what you are talking about ( or are a female and speaking to a female ) .
You ’ll be asked how to properly put on a condom , how to take Plan - B , or how to insert a tampon .
It can be embarrassing at first , but if you ’re professional about the whole event , it ’ll go smoothly .
Like wild animals , they are more afraid of you than you are of them .
Remember , its okay to think the “ You ’re pregnant at 12 !?!?! ” thoughts , just not the face .
Anger and Disgust at Humanity :
You use this face when some welfare baby - factory brings in her 10 children ( who are tearing apart your store ) and yells at you because her Protonix has a $ 3 copay / and / she cant get her vicodin / soma filled 2 weeks early .
Similarly , when a 11 year old comes in for prenatal vitamins and her parents are so proud of their little girl even though her life is pretty much put on hold .
Welfare recipients who drive $ 60 k SUV ’s ( and frequent the ER to get more OTC Tylenol / Pediacare / Pedialyte for their crotch - fruit ) also fall in this category .
You must suppress the face of disgust and be neutral .
Keep on telling yourself that living a lifestyle off of the working class ’ dime is extremely hard and we should feel sorry for these people .
….. Then think what a load of bullshit that last sentence was and why these bastards cant go out and get a goddamn job and quit talking on their goddamn cellphones while you ’re telling them how to give medication to their goddamn bastard children .
Am I bit bitter on this subject ?
Nah .
July 31 , 2007  -- Former Sen. Fred Thompson , R - Tenn. , appears to have flip flopped on his pledge to sign federal legislation replacing all federal taxes with a 23 percent sales tax , according to an unedited FairTax.org video reviewed by ABC News .
" He has not taken this pledge , " Thompson spokesperson Linda Rozett told ABC News .
The Thompson camp 's denial appears to be contradicted , however , by an unedited FairTax.org video in which Thompson is asked , " Senator , if the House and Senate pass the ' Fair Tax ' bill do you feel right now that you would sign it ? "
Thompson replies to the question by saying , " Yeah , absolutely . "
" Fred Thompson may have spoken without thinking .
But the tape is accurate , " said FairTax.org spokesman Ken Hoagland .
The Democratic National Committee seized on the all - but - announced candidate 's apparent contradiction with his own staff , questioning whether the actor turned politician is qualified for the role of commander - in - chief .
" Fumbling Fred Thompson 's flip flop on the ' Fair Tax ' issue shows once again that his presidential campaign is just not ready for prime - time , " said DNC spokeswoman Amaya Smith .
" Next time Thompson should make sure that he's on the same script as his advisors before changing his position on an issue . "
The disputed Thompson incident occurred when Doug Ripley , the controller of FairTax.org , asked him about the tax overhaul measure as the former senator greeted supporters at an airport hangar in Houston on July 24 .
You can watch the i-CAUGHT video , which was shot by FairTax.org media producer Paul Yeager , by clicking here .
Proposal Repeals Current Tax Code
The federal taxes that would be swept away by the " Fair Tax " legislation include all federal personal and corporate income taxes , gift , estate , capital gains , alternative minimum , Social Security , Medicare and self - employment taxes .
In place of those taxes , the " Fair Tax " legislation would impose a 23 percent sales tax .
The legislation would abolish all current federal tax credits and tax deductions .
But in order to offset the impact that the new 23 percent sales tax would have on American households languishing in poverty , the legislation would offer a monthly prebate .
The size of a household 's prebate would be calculated by multiplying 23 percent -- the size of the new tax -- against the government - established poverty level for a household of that size .
According to the 2007 federal poverty level , an adult with no children would receive an annual prebate of $ 2,348 ( which would come in monthly checks of $ 196 ) .
A married couple with two children would receive an annual prebate of $ 6,297 , which would come in monthly checks of $ 525 .
Five Republican '08ers Have Agreed to Sign " Fair Tax " If Passed
" Fair Tax " supporters opted for a prebate system , which would flow even to the richest Americans , rather than exempting certain staples of life , in the hopes of protecting the new sales tax from the kinds of lobbying - induced loopholes that pervade the current system .
The five Republican presidential candidates who have pledged to sign the " Fair Tax " bill into law are Sen. John McCain of Arizona , former Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin , Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado , Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas .
So many Republican candidates have agreed to sign the " Fair Tax " bill because the group that is urging its passage , FairTax.org , has proved adept at using its supporters -- which total a quarter of a million -- to birddog presidential candidates .
" We try to keep constant pressure on them , " David Polyansky , FairTax.org 's chief operating officer , told ABC News .
Giuliani and Romney Resist
Despite FairTax.org 's success with five Republican presidential candidates , it has not been able to secure commitments from either the party 's national front - runner or the candidate leading in the crucial states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
The Republican presidential candidate who has been most outspoken in expressing objections to the fair tax proposal is former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , the front - runner in national polls .
Asked if he would sign the " Fair Tax " bill , Giuliani said , " I do n't think so .
I do n't think so .
I 'll have to study it some more .
I do n't think a fair tax is realistic change for America .
Our economy is so dependent upon the way our tax system is operated the best thing to do is to simplify that tax system . "
Watch Giuliani's response here .
A second top Republican -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- has also refrained from pledging to sign the " Fair Tax " bill .
" That 's too much of a hypothetical , since you 'd have to know the specifics of the legislation , " Romney spokesman Kevin Madden told ABC News .
" The governor has said that the fair tax idea has attractive characteristics , but it is not part of his tax reform platform .
Romney believes in a simpler , less burdensome tax system .
He wants to reduce the tax burden placed on Americans , encourage economic growth and simplify the tax system . "
" ' Fair Tax " supporters have also not been successful in making inroads among Democratic presidential candidates .
Among the Democratic White House hopefuls , only the longest of long shots -- former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel -- has agreed to sign the fair tax bill if passed by Congress .
Feasibility Questioned
Even though the fair tax is marketed as " revenue neutral , " liberal tax policy experts have substantial questions as to whether a 23 percent retail sales tax on its own would adequately cover the current cost of government .
" Even before looking at the distributional analysis , there is this big problem that it would leave the basic job of government undone because it would not raise the revenue , " said Aviva Aron -Dine , a policy analyst with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
" That said , " continued Aron -Dine , if you did set the tax rate high enough to cover the current cost of government , " you would be shifting the tax burden from people at the top of the income scale to people in the middle . "

Just about every new product in consumer electronics is going to have a problem or two , and there may also be technical issues too .
In this potential court case , Apple 's problem is one , Jose Trujillo , who is suing Apple and seeking class - action status in a lawsuit over the iPhone .
It turns out Apple " marketed it 's [ sic ]
iPhone as a ' revolutionary new mobile phone ' that incorporates ' high technology ' , " whatever that means .
Besides that , most of the substantive allegations focus on the iPhone battery , including :
Unknown to the Plaintiff , and undisclosed to the public , prior to purchase , the iPhone is a sealed unit with it 's [ sic ] battery soldered on the inside of the device so that it cannot be changed by the owner .
The battery enclosed in the iPhone can only be charged approximately 300 times before it will be in need of replacement , necessitating a new battery annually for owners of the iPhone .
To the Plaintiff 's apparent surprise and dismay , you do not have access to a phone while the battery is being replaced unless you pay $ 29.95 for a loaner , and Apple will erase " all data from the iPhone . "
Damn them .
Also , the cost of all this battery repair is allegedly equal to " 20 % of the purchase price of the iPhone annually . "
Finally , none of the details regarding battery life and replacement were to be found anywhere in the materials that came with the phone , and could only be found " under several layers of links " on Apple 's support website .
Looking at the court documents , it 's — or is it its ? — hard to know where to begin , though a cheap shot at Mr. Trujillo 's lawyer and the use of possessive pronouns is as good a place as any .
Setting aside the fact that the iPhone battery is covered for the first year under warranty , thus negating that first year of the " annual " cost of iPhone ownership , the battery life information is just wrong .
The battery page for the iPhone provides Apple 's official position on battery life .
A properly maintained iPhone battery is designed to retain up to 80 % of its original capacity at 400 full charge and discharge cycles .
You may choose to replace your battery when it no longer holds sufficient charge to meet your needs .
The miserly charge cycle described in the lawsuit may possibly have been derived from the review of the iPhone in the New York Times .
Apple says that the battery starts to lose capacity after 300 or 400 charges .
Eventually , you ’ll have to send the phone to Apple for battery replacement , much as you do now with an iPod , for a fee .
It 's hard to imagine any court taking this case seriously , since all the information regarding the iPhone and its battery was published at the time the iPhone went on sale , even if it was not readily apparent to Mr. Trujillo .
However , this is America , land of the free and litigious , so you never know .
Adding to an already tense environment , more problems became apparent in the mortgage market today .
Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , said it had tapped $ 11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world ’s largest banks , as it seeks to shore up its cash position .
The company , which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street , acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it may have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide .
Shares of the company closed down 11 percent , after falling 13 percent yesterday .
The stock is down more than 50 percent for the year .
In a statement released early this morning , the company also said that 90 percent of the home loans it will now make will be to standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the big purchasers of mortgage loans , because it is not able to sell them to other buyers .
The reversal of fortune in the housing market was further illustrated by figures released by the Commerce Department today that showed the rates of construction of new homes and building permits issued fell in July to their lowest levels in more than a decade .
A move by the Federal Reserve intended to calm the markets seemed to have little impact at first .
The Fed injected $ 17 billion into the system this morning in two open - market actions by lending against mortgage securities .
Whether the turbulence in financial markets will have larger ramifications for the American economy is still unclear .
Many economists , including those at the Fed , have said they believe the damage will remain contained .
With each day of turmoil in the markets , however , the outlook becomes more and more murky .
Henry Paulson , the Treasury secretary , told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published today that market troubles “ will extract a penalty ” on economic growth , but he said he did not believe a recession was likely .

An ancient theatre filters out low - frequency background noise .
Modern actors can be heard clearly 60 metres away on a windless day .
Nico Declercq
The wonderful acoustics for which the ancient Greek theatre of Epidaurus is renowned may come from exploiting complex acoustic physics , new research shows .
The theatre , discovered under a layer of earth on the Peloponnese peninsula in 1881 and excavated , has the classic semicircular shape of a Greek amphitheatre , with 34 rows of stone seats ( to which the Romans added a further 21 ) .
Its acoustics are extraordinary : a performer standing on the open - air stage can be heard in the back rows almost 60 metres away .
Architects and archaeologists have long speculated about what makes the sound transmit so well .
Now Nico Declercq and Cindy Dekeyser of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta say that the key is the arrangement of the stepped rows of seats .
They calculate that this structure is perfectly shaped to act as an acoustic filter , suppressing low - frequency sound — the major component of background noise — while passing on the high frequencies of performers ' voices1 .
It 's not clear whether this property comes from chance or design , Declercq says .
But either way , he thinks that the Greeks and Romans appreciated that the acoustics at Epidaurus were something special , and copied them elsewhere .
Sound steps
In the first century BC the Roman authority on architecture , Vitruvius , implied that his predecessors knew very well how to design a theatre to emphasize the human voice .
" By the rules of mathematics and the method of music , " he wrote , " they sought to make the voices from the stage rise more clearly and sweetly to the spectators ' ears ... by the arrangement of theatres in accordance with the science of harmony , the ancients increased the power of the voice . "
“ The acoustic cut - off frequency is right where you would want it ” Nico Declercq , Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta
Later writers have speculated that the excellent acoustics of Epidaurus , built in the fourth century BC , might be due to the prevailing direction of the wind ( which blows mainly from the stage to the audience ) , or might be a general effect of Greek theatre owing to the speech rhythms or the use of masks acting as loudspeakers .
But none of this explains why a modern performer at Epidaurus , which is still sometimes used for performances , can be heard so well even on a windless day .
Declercq and Dekeyser suspected that the answer might be connected to the way sound reflects off corrugated surfaces .
It has been known for several years now that these can filter sound waves to emphasize certain frequencies , just as microscopic corrugations on a butterfly wing reflect particular wavelengths of light .
The sound - suppressing pads of ridged foam that can plastered on the walls of noisy rooms also take advantage of this effect .
Declercq has shown previously that the stepped surface of a Mayan ziggurat in Mexico can make handclaps or footsteps sound like bird chirps or rainfall ( see ' Mystery of ' chirping ' pyramid decoded ' ) .
Now he and Dekeyser have calculated how the rows of stone benches at Epidaurus affect sound bouncing off them , and find that frequencies lower than 500 hertz are more damped than higher ones .
Murmur murmur
" Most of the noise produced in and around the theatre was probably low - frequency noise , " the researchers say : rustling trees and murmuring theatre - goers , for instance .
So filtering out the low frequencies improves the audibility of the performers ' voices , which are rich in higher frequencies , at the expense of the noise .
" The cut - off frequency is right where you would want it if you wanted to remove noise coming from sources that were there in ancient times , " says Declercq .
Declercq cautions that the presence of a seated audience would alter the effect , however , in ways that are hard to gauge .
" For human beings the calculations would be very difficult because the human body is not homogeneous and has a very complicated shape , " he says .
Filtering out the low frequencies means that these are less audible in the spoken voice as well as in background noise .
But that need n't be a problem , because the human auditory system can ' put back ' some of the missing low frequencies in high - frequency sound .
ADVERTISEMENT
" There is a neurological phenomenon called virtual pitch that enables the human brain to reconstruct a sound source even in the absence of the lower tones , " Declercq says .
" This effect causes small loudspeakers to produce apparently better sound quality than you 'd expect . "
Although many modern theatres improve audibility with loudspeakers , Declercq says that the filtering idea might still be relevant : " In certain situations such as sports stadiums or open - air theatres , I believe the right choice of the seat row periodicity or of the steps underneath the chairs may be important .

An Argument for the Metric System
Quickly , how many pounds are there in 100 ounces ?
How many feet are there in a mile ?
Which is greater : 5.5 pints , 94 fluid ounces , or 3 quarts ?
How many square yards are there in an acre ?
At the very least , most people would fumble a bit before seriously answering any of these questions .
Maybe even use a calculator or reference guide .
At worse , some people would not try or be able to answer some of these questions .
The Imperial System is obviously very clumsy and confusing to use even for Americans .
This is the reason why the United States of America should finally stop using the Imperial System of measurement .
To be fair , there are two other countries that also use the Imperial System , and they are Liberia and Myanmar ( Burma ) .
These three countries should instead use the Metric System .
The Metric System is superior to the Imperial System for three reasons .
First , the Metric System is simple to understand .
The simplicity of a base 10 system of measurement , such as the Metric System , makes it extremely easy to understand especially when dealing different scales of measures , such as meters versus kilometers .
For example , it is obvious that 100 meters is 1/10 of a kilometer .
No serious thinking is necessary .
Second , calculations in the Metric System are also easier .
This is probably why most researchers , doctors , and scientists use the Metric System even in the United States .
For example , which is greater : 989 grams , 1.1 kilograms , or 1 million milligrams ?
How many meters are there in a kilometer ?
How many milliliters are there in 1.25 liters ?
Third , the Metric System is the international standard .
This is probably the most important reason .
Car manufacturers already realized that having similar parts in different measurements for different countries was a waste of resources , so all cars are now built using the Metric System for redundancy eliminations and cost reductions .
Furthermore , all goods exported outside of the United States have to be label in metrics , or else they can not be sold .
N.A.S.A. actually lost a $ 125 million dollar spacecraft , called the Mars Climate Orbiter , over the planet Mars , because one team was using the Metric System and another team was using the Imperial System .
That was a very costly mistake that could have been avoided if everyone in the world used the same system of measurement .
Since over 90 % of the world uses the Metric System , it is by default the international standard .
The Metric System has been proven to be far superior than the Imperial System , so why has n't the United States of America converted ?
I believe it is NOT because Americans are afraid of the Metric System , but rather Americans are concerned over how painful the conversion process would be .
In the long term , I believe the benefits and cost savings to convert to the Metric System would greatly offset the short term inconveniences .
As a result , the United States of America should finally and completely stop using the Imperial System of measurement for the Metric System that has been proven to be simpler to understand , easier to calculate , the international standard , and reduce redundancies , errors , and costs .
So fellow Americans , please contact your elected officials and let them hear our logical reasons for a better system of measurement .

Scumbags of South Africa , you have been warned .
Later this month , women there " will be able to arm their vaginas with the Rapex device , a product priced at 1 rand ( around 14 cents ) and sold over the counter , " the* Guardian * reports .
" Shaped like a female condom and worn internally , its hollow interior is lined with 25 razor - sharp teeth , which fasten on to an attacker 's penis if he attempts penetration . "
**
Some people - including women 's campaigners - have criticised the device for being " vengeful " .
Well , as its inventor , Sonette Ehlers , has said , it 's " a medieval device for a medieval deed " .
If any rapist finds himself hopping with pain as a result - as well as facing the fact that the only way to remove the device is said to be a highly awkward and incriminating hospital visit - that seems just fine to me .
Yes , it 's vengeful .
Yes , it hurts rapists .
Oh well .
The device is " inserted with an applicator like a tampon , and removed with the same applicator , " according to the Rapex website .
It can stay in for up to 24 hours .
And it will be " available in various sizes ... small , medium and large . "
When should it be worn ?
" If you have to travel long distances alone , on a train , working late , going out on a date with someone you do n’t know too well , going to clubs , or in any situation that you might not feel comfortable or even just not sure . "
" The myth of the vagina dentata - vagina with teeth - has proved strangely compelling down the centuries , " the Guardian adds , " but who would have thought it would become real ? "

I 've been playing around with Lua recently .
It 's a really sweet little language .
A particular highlight is its " tables " , which are generalized associative arrays that can have keys of any type .
( Most languages only allow strings and / or numbers . )
It also has pretty nice uniform handling of multiple function arguments , multiple return values , and multiple assignment .
A frequent topic of discussion on the Lua list is the fact that Lua does not have a switch / case statement .
Most of the people who propose how one should be added tend to copy other languages which can only switch on one value at a time .
I think it would me more in keeping with the rest of Lua to have a multi-valued case statement .
I also quite like the idea of making it capable of ML - style pattern matching and variable binding .
The syntax I have in mind is as follows .
I 'm using ? to mean 0 or 1 of the following , * to mean 0 or more , and + to mean 1 or more .
case explist1 +( +( match patlist ?( if exp ) ) then block ) ?( else block ) end
As in C , multiple matches for a given block are expressed using multiple match clauses , instead of the alternatives being listed in a single clause as in Modula .
Each match can be guarded by a conditional expression ; when it evaluates to false the match fails and later ones are tried .
The statements followingare evaluated if one of the precedinges succeeds .
You can put a " default " or " otherwise " case after an .
( I quite like the re-use of keywords , though perhaps it is too cute . )
All variables bound by theclauses are visible in the following block ; the variables in a pattern list must all be different ; if the clause binding a variable is n't the one that matched then the variable 's value is nil .
Lua also needs more expressive exception handling - I 'm not too fond of its " protected call " mechanism .
It would be more palatable if it were dressed up in something like :
try block +( +( catch patlist ?( if exp ) ) then block ) ? ( finally block )
end
A useful bit of syntactic sugar is to be able to declare functions in a pattern matching style instead of an argument - passing style , so :
function (... ) case ... match a , b , c blah blah end end
function match a , b , c blah blah end
could be more concisely written :
I 'm still pondering the syntax for pattern lists .
A basic principle is that all direct comparisons should be against constants , so that the match can be compiled into a table lookup against a constant table .
This means only numbers and strings - other objects in Lua either do not have compile - time expressions ( C userdata ) or have expressions that do not denote constant values but instead describe how to create new objects at run-time ( function closures and tables ) .
I also want to allow indirect comparisons against table elements , so that it 's possible to match against structured data .
Finally there needs to be a way of binding a variable to the value being matched against .
I do not intend to support exact matches against tables : only the elements that you specify in the match will be checked and if the table has more elements they will be ignored .
This is because the extra check to make the match exact may not be entirely trivial to implement , and because it makes code brittle in the presence of unexpected values squirreled away in a table - it 's quite common in prototype - based object systems to add methods to an object without co-operation from the code that created it .
So the basic syntax for a pattern to match against simple constants or to bind a variable is :
String | Number | Name
" { " pattern *( " , " pattern ) " } "
Matching against the first few integer indexed elements of a table in list style is also simple :
It 's also useful to both match against a table and bind a variable , so that you can refer to the table in the later statements .
( It is n't possible to reconstruct the table because it may have extra elements , and even if it were possible it would be inefficient and the result would have a different identity . )
It 's also useful to both match a constant and bind a variable , if you have multiple match clauses : case f( ) match 3 match 4 then -- did f return three or four ?
I 'm still unsure about the syntax for matching and binding .
Some possibilities are :
pattern and pattern pattern pattern Name " = " pattern Name " == " pattern
The idea of " and " patterns is that you are matching both the left - hand side and the right - hand side .
It suggests that there should also be " or " patterns , as in case f( ) match 3 or 4 then ...
In MCPL you get the same effect as and by just writing the patterns side - by - side , and ( like sh ) | is used instead of or .
The idea of using " = " is to make binding in a pattern look like assignment , whereas " == " is supposed to be like an assertion .
However these get problematic when we try to fit key / value style table matching into the syntax .
Table constructors in Lua look like :
tableconstructor = " { " ? fieldlist " } " fieldlist = field *( fieldsep field ) ?
fieldsep fieldsep = " , " | " ; " field = " [ " exp " ] " " = " exp | Name " = " exp | exp
table [key ]
table.name
table [ " name " ]
( The first form of field is by analogy with theform of index expression .
The second is likeindexing , which is syntactic sugar for .
The last is for list - style construction , where the value is assigned to the next integer index starting from 1 . )
If we follow constructor syntax closely , we get the serious difficulty that a pattern like { foo = bar } is n't clear which name is the table index and which is the variable being bound .
This probably indicates that = should be avoided .
Perhaps the solution is to use an arrow to indicate which way values flow , as in :
tablepattern = " { " ? fieldpatterns " } " fieldpatterns = fieldpat *( fieldsep fieldpat ) ?
fieldsep fieldpat = " [ " ( String | Number ) " ] " " -> " pattern | Name " -> " pattern | pattern pattern = String | Number | Name | pattern and pattern | pattern or pattern
->
This seems reasonably OK , I think .
It also suggests adding a free - standing match operatorthat produces a boolean result ( and probably should not bind variables ) .
VMWare GUI interface is great for building Virtual Machines and making any configuration changes when needed .
After the VM is running and configured to your preference , there is little need to use the GUI interface except for starting VM's when they are powered off .
Instead of using the GUI , VMWare provides an easier method to administer and manage VM 's from the command line using vmware - cmd command .
vmware - cmd has two modes of Operations ( see further below for entire list of parameters for vmware - cmd ) :
Operations on a Virtual Machine syntax – vmware - cmd < options > < vm-cfg - path > < vm-action > < arguments >
Operations on VMWare Server syntax – vmware - cmd -s < options > < server- action > < arguments >
and can be found on Windows at < install location >
\VmWare \VMWare Server and on Linux at /usr / bin
The first parameter you want to run is vmware - cmd -l which lists all registered VMs on the local computer .
Running this command first will display the path of each VM config file , which is needed for most of the commands .
On my Windows Vista Computer , running this command returns :
> C: \Program Files\VMware \VMware Server>vmware -cmd -l
> C: \Other \Virtual Machines \WTN1 \Windows XP Professional.vmx
> C:\OTHER \Virtual Machines \WTN2 \Ubuntu.vmx
( Note : On Windows OS 's , if you do not CD ( Change Directory ) to the location of vmware - cmd , do n't forget to use quotes when there are spaces in the path – " C : \Program Files \VMware \VMware Server\vmware - cmd " - l )
To start a Virtual Machine , the sytax is : vmware - cmd < vm-cfg - path > start
So on my computer , I would run the following command to start the Virtual Machine named WTN1 :
vmware - cmd " C:\OTHER\Virtual Machines \WTN1 \Windows XP Professional.vmx " start
To stop WTN1 , I would run : vmware - cmd " C:\OTHER\Virtual Machines \WTN1 \Windows XP Professional.vmx " stop
What if I did not know if the VM was running or stopped ?
In this case , I would use the getstate parameter which will tell me the state of the machine by running : vmware - cmd " C:\OTHER\Virtual Machines \WTN1 \Windows XP Professional.vmx " getstate
The command would return : getstate ( ) = off telling me that the VM is is powered off .
When managing VM's on a remote computer , use the following options :
vmware - cmd - H < hostname > - U < username > - P < password >
Where H is the host name of the remote computer , U is the username or account on the remote computer and P is the password .
If the VM WTN1 was on a remote computer named PC1 and I wanted to start it up , I would enter the command :
vmware - cmd -H PC1 - U mike P watchingthenet " C:\OTHER\Virtual Machines \WTN1 \Windows XP Professional.vmx " start
Managing Virtual Machines from the command line has many benefits , including remote administration , status , and creating scripts or batch files that can be used to automate backups of VM's by shutting down and powering off .
While using the GUI interface is convenant , using vmware - cmd command can provide for quick access and execution .
Below is the list of options / parameters used with vmware - cmd .
To output the list on your Computer , run vmware - cmd -h
Options :
Connection Options :
- H < host > specifies an alternative host ( if set , - U and - P must als
o be set )
- O < port > specifies an alternative port
- U <username > specifies a user
- P < password > specifies a password
General Options :
-h More detailed help .
-q Quiet .

So , that 's 3 reasons ( beyond the fact that it's in the WSJ ) not to think it 's a good thing , right ?
The above numbers come from a poll of market economists who are asked their opinion on various macro-economic topics ( click on pic to enlarge ) .
The core issue is that energy is currently not priced correctly , and is thus cheaper than it should be - and we therefore , naturally , use more than we could and should .
Now I know that saying that it is " cheaper than it should be " sounds pretty bad , so let me explain .
We ARE paying more for our energy than we think we are .
It 's just that this cost does not appear as a monetary price when we actually buy the gas .
It is paid in indirect ways :
taxes to subsidize oil and coal companies
taxes to pay for the military forces that ensure the security of maritime lanes ( and occasionally occupy oil - rich countries )
higher interest rates that increase the price of other investments , if the above is paid by government debt rather than taxes ( if the government borrows a lot of money , it crowds out other borrowers and makes it more expensive for all to borrow , ceteris paribus )
) lifes of soldiers involved in the above healthcare costs for asthma patients and other pollution related diseases costs caused by global climate change ( cf NOLA )
That cost is not borne by the consumers of the oil / the gas .
It is disproportionately borne by the poor ( cf NOLA , cf Iraq Vets , cf Bush tax breaks ) .
But it 's not valued .
A policy that forces energy sources to reflect their indirect costs does not make those energy sources more expensive , it only brings in the open costs already incurred in another way - and it allocates that cost to those that are actually using the energy , thus ensuring that they are actually responsible for what they do and , more to the point , that they have the incentive to do something about it - because they 're the ones with the best ability to influence their use of energy .
A gas tax is a very effective way to translate the indirect costs of burning oil into an actual monetary cost borne by end users , so it is a rational economic tool ( to " internalize externalities " ) in econospeak ) , and it is not altogether surprising that economists would support it .
Two points are worth bearing in mind .
The first one is that it is a great thing that economists are finally recognizing that there actually are externalities associated with gas use .
That 's thanks to " hippies " and " green extremists " and other similarly blighted progressives repeating that simple message for a long time , being ignored , insulted and demonized for a long time in the process - but prevailing because they were right .
As we have lots of other ideas that are in that " pipeline " toward public acceptance , this is an optimistic thing to note .
The other is that market economists are , naturally , driven by money , and find decisions made purely on monetary considerations to be good decisions .
But effective does not necessarily mean good .
Forcing only the poor to bear the brunt of an adjustment may be effective from the point of view of economics , but it 's bad policy ( and hopefully , bad politics as well ) .
And yet that 's the logic behind a lot of reforms that say : let markets act .
Famines are efficient market solutions to food scarcity .
People freezing to death ecause they are unable to pay for heating oil is an effective market solution .
Thus a gas tax cannot and should not be enough , if it is ever used .
It should always be accompanied by measures to help alleviate the monetary pain it will cause to the poor - tax reform to change the burden on the poor , use of the tax receipt towards investment that provide substitutes ( public transport , help to save energy at home , etc . .. )
One of the reasons I support the gas tax is that in fact it is not , in itself regressive - it only makes the regressive nature of the cost of oil * appear * more starkly .
That means that , politically , it cannot happen without a package to change that fact - which will help to change the underlying regressive status quo .
As you know , we are trying to restart the Energize America work on dKos.
EA does NOT include a gas tax , because discussions here made it clear that it would not be supported politically .
But it does include a number of measures aimed at making , in less direct ways , the externalities of some of our favorite energy sources appear more starkly , and at encouraging behavior that avoids the sources of energy with the most hidden effects .
That includes incentives to use less energy , or more of the better sources of energy .
The important thing to flag is that we must keep up on the idea that some forms of energy uses have very high hidden costs , already borne today by the poor and the weak , and thus that it is progressive politics to tackle that - and that it requires a coherent , global programme ( a ' holistic ' approach , would say A Siegel ) , and not simplistic solutions .
Energy policy should focus on these costs , and ensuring that all Americans ( and all Westerners ) , not just those that can afford to ignore the problem by paying more , pay their share .
When Antonio Stradivari of Cremona , Italy , started making violins in the 1660s , Newton had not yet discovered the principles of modern physics and the first piano had not yet been manufactured .
By the time of Stradivari ’s death in 1737 , his violins were already some of the most prized in the world , the product of a fine hand and an almost occult science .
About 600 of perhaps 700 survive .
And now , a select few people will have the special treat of playing one of these rare and expensive musical instruments .
On Monday , in the hushed auction room of Christie ’s in Midtown Manhattan , a Stradivarius made in 1729 will be put up for bid at a minimum asking price of $ 1 million .
One little - noticed part of the auction : in theory , anyone without butterfingers can take out the Stradivarius for a test play .
And so yesterday , a few did .
A systematic effort by attackers to penetrate US government and industry computer networks stems most likely from the Chinese military , the head of a leading security institute claims .
The attacks had been traced to the Chinese province of Guangdong , and the techniques used made it appear unlikely it came from any other source than the military , said Alan Paller , the director of the SANS Institute , an education and research organisation focusing on cybersecurity .
" These attacks come from someone with intense discipline .
No other organisation could do this if they were not a military organization , " Paller said in a conference call on Monday to announced a new cybersecurity education program .
AT&T rewrites rules :
Your data is n't yours
AT&T has issued an updated privacy policy that takes effect Friday .
The changes are significant because they appear to give the telecom giant more latitude when it comes to sharing customers ' personal data with government officials .
The new policy says that AT&T -- not customers -- owns customers ' confidential info and can use it " to protect its legitimate business interests , safeguard others , or respond to legal process . "
The policy also indicates that AT&T will track the viewing habits of customers of its new video service -- something that cable and satellite providers are prohibited from doing .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Moreover , AT&T ( formerly known as SBC ) is requiring customers to agree to its updated privacy policy as a condition for service -- a new move that legal experts say will reduce customers ' recourse for any future data sharing with government authorities or others .
The company 's policy overhaul follows recent reports that AT&T was one of several leading telecom providers that allowed the National Security Agency warrantless access to its voice and data networks as part of the Bush administration 's war on terror .
" They 're obviously trying to avoid a hornet 's nest of consumer - protection lawsuits , " said Chris Hoofnagle , a San Francisco privacy consultant and former senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
" They 've written this new policy so broadly that they 've given themselves maximum flexibility when it comes to disclosing customers ' records , " he said .
AT&T is being sued by San Francisco 's Electronic Frontier Foundation for allegedly allowing the NSA to tap into the company 's data network , providing warrantless access to customers ' e-mails and Web browsing .
AT&T is also believed to have participated in President Bush 's acknowledged domestic spying program , in which the NSA was given warrantless access to U.S. citizens ' phone calls .
AT&T said in a statement last month that it " has a long history of vigorously protecting customer privacy " and that " our customers expect , deserve and receive nothing less than our fullest commitment to their privacy . "
But the company also asserted that it has " an obligation to assist law enforcement and other government agencies responsible for protecting the public welfare , whether it be an individual or the security interests of the entire nation . "
Under its former privacy policy , introduced in September 2004 , AT&T said it might use customer 's data " to respond to subpoenas , court orders or other legal process , to the extent required and / or permitted by law . "
The new version , which is specifically for Internet and video customers , is much more explicit about the company 's right to cooperate with government agencies in any security - related matters -- and AT&T's belief that customers ' data belongs to the company , not customers .
" While your account information may be personal to you , these records constitute business records that are owned by AT&T , " the new policy declares .
" As such , AT&T may disclose such records to protect its legitimate business interests , safeguard others , or respond to legal process . "
It says the company " may disclose your information in response to subpoenas , court orders , or other legal process , " omitting the earlier language about such processes being " required and / or permitted by law . "
The new policy states that AT&T " may also use your information in order to investigate , prevent or take action regarding illegal activities , suspected fraud ( or ) situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person " -- conditions that would appear to embrace any terror - related circumstance .
Ray Everett - Church , a Silicon Valley privacy consultant , said it seems clear that AT&T has substantially modified its privacy policy in light of revelations about the government 's domestic spying program .
" It 's obvious that they are trying to stretch their blanket pretty tightly to cover as many exposed bits as possible , " he said .
Gail Hillebrand , a staff attorney at Consumers Union in San Francisco , said the declaration that AT&T owns customers ' data represents the most significant departure from the company 's previous policy .
" It creates the impression that they can do whatever they want , " she said .
" This is the real heart of AT&T 's new policy and is a pretty fundamental difference from how most customers probably see things . "
John Britton , an AT&T spokesman , denied that the updated privacy policy marks a shift in the company 's approach to customers ' info .
" We do n't see this as anything new , " he said .
" Our goal was to make the policy easier to read and easier for customers to understand . "
He acknowledged that there was no explicit requirement in the past that customers accept the privacy policy as a condition for service .
And he acknowledged that the 2004 policy said nothing about customers ' data being owned by AT&T .
But Britton insisted that these elements essentially could be found between the lines of the former policy .
" There were many things that were implied in the last policy . "
He said .
" We 're just clarifying the last policy . "
AT&T's new privacy policy is the first to include the company 's video service .
AT&T says it 's spending $ 4.6 billion to roll out TV programming to 19 million homes nationwide .
The policy refers to two AT&T video services -- Homezone and U - verse .
Homezone is AT&T 's satellite TV service , offered in conjunction with Dish Network , and U - verse is the new cablelike video service delivered over phone lines .
In a section on " usage information , " the privacy policy says AT&T will collect " information about viewing , game , recording and other navigation choices that you and those in your household make when using Homezone or AT&T U - verse TV Services . "
The Cable Communications Policy
Act of 1984 stipulates that cable and satellite companies can't collect or disclose information about customers ' viewing habits .
The law is silent on video services offered by phone companies via the Internet , basically because legislators never anticipated such technology would be available .
AT&T's Britton said the 1984 law does n't apply to his company 's video service because AT&T is n't a cable provider .
" We are not building a cable TV network , " he said .
" We 're building an Internet protocol television network . "
But Andrew Johnson , a spokesman for cable heavyweight Comcast , disputed this perspective .
" Video is video is video , " he said .
" If you 're delivering programming over a telecommunications network to a TV set , all rules need to be the same . "
AT&T's new and former privacy policies both state that " conducting business ethically and ensuring privacy is critical to maintaining the public 's trust and achieving success in a dynamic and competitive business climate . "
Both also state that " privacy responsibility " extends " to the privacy of conversations and to the flow of information in data form . "
As such , both say that " the trust of our customers necessitates vigilant , responsible privacy protections . "
The 2004 policy , though , went one step further .
It said AT&T realizes " that privacy is an important issue for our customers and members . "
The new policy makes no such acknowledgment .
Vse se spreminja , da bi ostalo isto
Nenavaden občutek .
Povabljen sem bil , da pristavim svoj piskerček na temo e-demokracije , pa me tema niti malo ne prepriča .
Vse se spreminja , da bi ostalo isto .
Kategorija : Kolumna | Datum objave : Monday , 7 . 05 . 2007 | Avtor : Gostujoče pero
Ne razumite me napak : priča smo resnično obsežnim , tehnološko pogojenim spremembam , katerih narave in globine verjetno še ne zmoremo razumeti v celoti .
Blogi , Splet 2.0 , državljansko novinarstvo , težave tradicionalnih medijev , premiki oglaševalskih proračunov in še bi lahko naštevali .
Pojave , ki smo jim priča , najprej označuje premik možnosti produkcije vsebin ( besedil , fotografij , videa ) iz organizacij na posameznike .
Vsak , ki si lahko privošči ustrezna tehnološka sredstva ( še vedno samo približno ena šestina človeštva ) , lahko sodeluje .
Ni več urednikov , vratarjev , nič več zaprtih klubov , cehovskih omejitev , vstopnina je vsak dan nižja .
Demokratizacija medijev ?
Je izboljšanje dostopa do produkcijskih sredstev že enako demokratizaciji ?
Kako pojav uporabniško ustvarjenih vsebin spreminja politično igro in razmerja v družbi ?
Kot že rečeno , vse se spreminja , da bi ostalo isto .
Vrtiljak tehnoloških sprememb bo ustoličil nove igralce , tako pri medijih kot v političnem življenju .
Nekatere medijske trdnjave , ki ne bodo zmogle pravočasno razumeti sprememb , bodo padle , pojavile se bodo druge .
Velikansko ponovno mešanje kart na globalni ravni .
Iluzijo , da smo priča spremembam , ki resnično spreminjajo družbene silnice , nam dopušča dejstvo , da smo še vedno v obdobju odraščanja tega krasnega novega sveta .
Še vedno nam je dovoljeno eksperimentirati in sanjati .
Toda slej kot prej bodo novi/ stari igralci zacementirali položaje , pa naj si bodo to Google , Yahoo ! , AOL , News Corp. , SiOL … ali pa kdo izmed množice blogerjev .
Medenih tednov bo enkrat konec .
Dobra vsebina zahteva čas in predanost , predanosti in časa ni brez denarja , denar za produkcijo vsebin zagotavlja oglaševanje .
Čez čas bo vse akterje , tudi tiste blogerje , ki jih bo vredno brati , določala ista struktura kot današnje “ tradicionalne ” medije .
V kolikor pogledate slovenske bloge , vam je trend lahko hitro viden .
Z redkimi izjemami je resnično vredno brati samo tiste , ki nakazujejo ambicijo po profesionalizaciji .
Še več : najpomembnejše slovenske politične bloge so postavili ljudje iz tradicionalnih medijev ( Vest.si , Razgledi , Medijski watch dog ) .
Novi akterji ?
Vzpon amaterjev ?
Očitno ne , prej tekmovanje , kdo iz sveta starih medijev se bo uspešneje zasidral v novih .
Vsi hitijo čim prej zakoličiti nov teritorij .
“ Democracy is about power and representation , not merely about having a voice , ” je zapisal Bill Thomson in s tem pod vprašaj postavil tako bloge kot druga orodja e-demokracije ( spletne peticije , forumi , e- referendumi , e-volitve… ) .
E- demokracija naj bi namreč omogočila večjo aktivno participacijo državljanov , ki imajo danes občutek , da se pomembne odločitve sprejemajo daleč od njih .
Vladata apatija in nizka volilna udeležba .
Četudi predpostavimo , da je diagnoza prava , še naprej ostaja vprašanje , če smo izbrali pravo zdravilo .
Menim , da gre v precejšnji meri za placebo .
Kot pri vsakem placebu , bo tudi ta pri določenih skupinah ustvaril iluzijo učinka , iluzijo , da je možnost “ imeti glas ” že enako participaciji pri političnih odločitvah .
Bojim se , da nas čaka razočaranje , saj problemi sodobnih demokratičnih družb niso povezani s primanjkljajem informacij na relaciji od državljanov do političnih elit .
Problem gre prej iskati v pomanjkanju političnega vodstva , ki bi državljane ( tako splošno kot zainteresirano javnost ) bilo pripravljeno vključiti v proces političnega odločanja .
Potrebujemo politično vodstvo , ki recimo posvetovalnih organov v kateri so zastopani zainteresirana javnost ali strokovnjaki , ne bi izrabilo samo za pokritje odločitev , za ustvarjanje iluzije participacije .
Bojim se , da tega primanjkljaja še tako dovršene tehnologije ne morejo odpraviti .
Pomemben nauk prinašajo tudi izkušnje s sodobnimi metodami merjenja javnega mnenja in njihovi uporabi v vsakodnevnem procesu političnega odločanja .
Izmeriti utrip , želje , podporo javnosti ni težko .
Množice agencij po celem svetu vsak dan zalagajo politike s podatki o javnem mnenju .
Toda , kot so kaj hitro spoznali tudi najbolj vneti uporabniki teh metod , je lahko uporaba teh podatkov spolzek teren .
Ljudstvo dostikrat ne ve kaj pravzaprav hoče , že jutri lahko popolnoma spremeni mnenje in grdo zavede uporabnika raziskav .
Postalo je jasno , da še tako izpopolnjene metode merjenja politikov ne odrešujejo naloge , da so v prvi vrsti aktivni oblikovalci in prenašalci političnih vizij , idej in povezovanja .
Poslušanje “ glasu ljudstva ” , pa naj si bo preko meritev javnega mnenja ali preko različnih orodij e-demokracije , jih teh nalog ne odrešuje .
Povedano drugače : e-demokracija nam ne prinaša politikov z vizijami .
V pomanjkanju le-teh je iskati prave vzroke za apatijo volivcev .

just trying to figure it all out as quickly as possible .
The family of Wu Ping gave up defending their Chongqing house after reportedly reaching a deal with the authorities .
The " nail house " - so called because it refused to be hammered down - had been isolated in a huge construction pit after other households agreed to move .
The dispute became a cause celebre for ordinary Chinese people who have tried to fight property developers .
But the struggle came to an end on Tuesday , when a few dozen people looked on as the two - storey brick building was broken up by an earth mover .
A night watchman at the building site told AFP news agency : " The stubborn nail has been removed . "
Mrs
Wu , when told the house had been demolished , reportedly said : " Oh well . "
New law
Her husband , Yang Wu , stayed in the house until the demolition , hanging out banners reading : " The legal private property of citizens can not be violated . "
The house was the last standing on a huge construction site

The family had insisted on staying in their home , because they were not satisfied with the compensation the authorities were offering .
Mrs
Wu said earlier that she had been offered an apartment in a planned new complex , or a cash settlement , but she turned both down .
According to state news agency Xinhua , the couple have now agreed to move into another apartment elsewhere in Chongqing .
Accusations of illegal land grabs and corruption have dogged China 's fast - paced building expansion , and the family 's resistance has been portrayed as heroic by state media .
China 's parliament last week passed a landmark law to boost protection of property rights for individuals .
ATLANTA --
When Georgia officials tried to find a way to make student - athletes show up for classes and academic appointments , athletic director Damon Evans made a bold proposal :
Unexcused absences should bring $ 10 fines or game suspensions .
After having six months to examine the attendance policy , introduced in January , Evans concluded Wednesday " It 's the right thing for us to do . "
Georgia officials say the policy deserves credit for a strong academic showing this spring .
For the first time , more than 50 percent of Georgia 's student - athletes had 3.0 or better grade - point averages in the spring semester .
Also , when compared with last spring , there were far fewer dropped classes and a sharp increase in credit hours earned -- 954 this spring , compared with 770 last spring , according to Ted White , Georgia 's director of academic services .
" It 's a great sign , " White said .
Word of Georgia 's early success with the policy has spread .
Georgia is receiving calls from other schools interested in starting similar programs .
" It 's exactly what we want , " Evans said .
" We want our individuals going to class and getting a quality education . "
The policy produced dramatic results in its first month .
George Bush is trying to save Paul Wolfowitz ' job as President of the World Bank even after the vulpine neo-con was caught slipping a load of World Bank loot to his love interest , Shaha Ali Riza .
Big deal .
Yes , Wolfowitz should n't have been greasing his cookie sheet with government funds , but there are bigger reasons to toss The Wolf out the door .
Like , say , perjury and homicide ?
I have n't forgotten , Mr. Wolfowitz , that on March 27 , 2003 you testified before the US Congress that the occupation of Iraq would n't cost the American taxpayer a penny .
You said , " There 's a lot of money to pay for this that does n't have to be U.S. taxpayer money . "
Oh , really ?
When Wolfowitz laid down that line of jive , he and the Bushes knew that Americans just can't pass up a bargain , and here The Wolf was offering the sale of the century , a " free Iraq . "
Not " free " as in " self - governing " but " free " as in , we 'll get their oil and their allegiance for nothing !
We can bomb Iraq and the Iraqis will pay for the bombs !
And where will the Iraqis , holding nothing but bushel - bags of Saddam dinars , get these billions of US dollars to pay for the Occupation ?
Wolfowitz testified , " The oil revenues of that country could bring between $ 50 and $ 100 billion over the next two or three years . "
Is that so ?
Wolfie 's claim was no small matter .
It 's hard to remember , but lots of the Congressional debate was not about Saddam 's Weapons of Mass Destruction -- the New York Times had already found those for us .
Senators were asking ,
What 's this little war going to cost us ?
There was no way in hell Congress would have authorized Bush 's big adventure if it cost $ 100 billion .
Indeed , $ 100 billion was the price projected by the President 's chief economist , Larry Lindsey .
The President corrected Lindsey 's math : Bush fired him .
You know the punchline :
The war has so far cost the U.S. taxpayer over half a trillion dollars - and counting .
But you were n't wrong , Wolfie .
You were lying .
And you knew it .
This is serious stuff .
I can tell you , as a former government racketeering investigator : if you are wrong , well , stuff happens .
But if you say one thing under oath but knew something very different , that , Mr. Wolfowitz , is perjury .
Perjury 's a felony , Wolf , and you know it .
Indeed , your neo-con buddy , Elliott Abrams , was convicted in 1991 for lying to Congress about Reagan 's arms - for - hostage swap .
So , did Wolfowitz perjure himself - or just get it wrong ?
While the question never crossed the mind of the Sheep - o - witz US press , which repeated Wolf 's no-cost - invasion claim unchallenged , my producer at BBC Television asked me to investigate .
I learned that Wolfowitz , then Deputy Secretary of Defense , would have gotten his numbers from the expert official designated to measure Iraq 's oil , Guy Caruso .
Caruso once ran the CIA 's oil ops ; now he 's the head of Bush 's Energy Information Administration .
A source close to Caruso ( in Saudi intelligence , no less ) told me the ex-spook heard Wolfowitz ' testimony and said , " What are they getting this from ? "
In 2004 , I confronted Caruso in his Department of Energy office in Washington .
Nice man .
Caruso knows his stuff .
And , after an hour of technical jibberish , he told me the info he gave Wolfowitz ' department -- and the numbers did n't add up to anything close to Wolfowitz ' Iraq oil windfall .
I then checked Caruso 's numbers with his own numbers man , another ex-CIA oil expert , Robert Ebel .
I asked Ebel about the Wolfowitz claim of an oil gusher in Iraq that would pay for the US Occupation .
Ebel would n't answer until after the cameras were off .
But I was n't asked to keep it off the record .
Ebel told me he had put the real numbers up on a think tank website just before the Humvees rolled into Baghdad .
His projections conflicted big time with the fantasy facts to which Wolfowitz testified .
Ebel told me that allies of neo -con conman Ahmad Chalabi asked Ebel to remove and bury the realistic numbers .
He did .
Did Wolfowitz lie ?
Ebel smiled , " It was just part of the sales pitch , was n't it ? "
The sales pitch ??
WAR FOR SALE - CHEAP !
Well , you can say that one man 's sales pitch is another man 's perjury .
If Wolfowitz had knowingly concealed the Caruso team 's findings while testifying under oath , then The Wolf is guilty of a felony .
Moreover , perjury which leads to death is homicide .
But he 's off the hook .
I checked the record .
Ever since his crony Abrams was charged with perjury , Wolfowitz wo n't testify under oath .
Nor will any of the Bushies .
Wolfowitz did not raise his hand and swear to " tell the whole truth , so help me , God . "
The Wolf 's home free .
How the Lord will judge this loophole , I can't say .
So , no perjury charge for Wolfowitz .
Of course there 's another crime .
His getting caught icing his cupcake , Ms. Riza , with World Bank funds , forces millions of innocent morning newspaper readers to suffer visions of these two neo -cons naked and nasty .
Urgh !
Still , one can't but help be touched by the romantic side of this story .
After all , here were two people of different faiths , sharing their intense love . . . of money , secrets and lies .

By Matt Wells
BBC News , Florida , USA
It is officially called Colony Collapse Disorder , but a more pithy way of describing it would be Vanishing Bee Syndrome .
Bees are driven around Florida to help pollinate early crops
Nobody , so far , knows why .
The sad mystery surrounding the humble honeybee - which is a vital component in $ 14 bn - worth of US agriculture - is beginning to worry even the highest strata of the political class in Washington .
" Hillary Clinton 's got interested in this in the last week or so , " said David Hackenberg , the beekeeper leading the drive to publicise their plight .
" And she 's not alone , " he said .
" There 's a lot of Congressmen have called ... wanting to know what 's going on .
It 's serious .
Before : a healthy beehive ....
What makes our interview slightly surreal is that we are standing next to an orange grove , in rural Florida , while about 70 hives of bees buzz angrily behind us , as if to emphasise their predicament .
... and after : a hive with CCD
Mr Hackenberg is suffering along with his bees .
Like many in his rather neglected profession , he and his son spend the summer and autumn in the north of the country , driving their bees down south during the winter , to kick - start the early fruit and vegetable crops .
In a matter of weeks , he lost just over 2,000 of his 3,000 hives .
The yard of his small honey farm near Tampa Bay , is littered with empty boxes , which normally would be full of worker bees , doing what they do best .
As we speak , his mobile phone chirps constantly , with yet more beekeepers across the US , reporting losses of up to 95 % .
Pesticides ?
Federal scientists , the National Beekeepers Association and state researchers have come together to form an emergency working group to try and halt the disastrous trend .
There are as many theories as there are members of the panel , but Mr Hackenberg strongly suspects that new breeds of nicotine - based pesticides are to blame .
" It may be that the honeybee has become the victim of these insecticides that are meant for other pests , " he said .
" If we do n't figure this out real quick , it 's going to wipe out our food supply . "
Just a few miles down the sunlit road , it is easy to find farmers prepared to agree with his gloomy assessment .
Carl Grooms contemplates his future
In the old days , crops would be pollinated by bees living in the woods around the fertile fields , but housing developers have gobbled up much of the natural habitat , according to Carl Grooms , who runs Fancy Farms Inc .
" The squash crops that we grow have a male and female bloom , and the bee has to visit ... to make it pollinate and produce , " he said .
" We 're going to have a hard time finding rental bees to aid in this pollination and if it's as critical as it looks like it will be , I probably wo n't even plant anything this spring . "
Back at the Buffy Bee honey farm - the Hackenberg 's Florida base - two members from the working group checked in to pay their respects , and take some bee samples on their way back to Washington .
Crazy theories
Dennis van Engelsdorp , a Pennsylvania - based beekeeper and leading researcher , walks over to an isolated group of hives , and pulls out two different wooden frames that would normally be covered in bees , busy making honey .
The difference is obvious .
While one is teeming with insects , the other is virtually uninhabited .
" The adult population totally disappears , " he said .
He shakes his head in frustration .
The US Department of Agriculture is working on finding the cause
He runs through the long list of possible causes , ranging from new mite infestation to new chemicals , but he is adamant that it is too early to pin the blame on insecticides .
" We have no evidence to think that that theory is more right than any other ... There 's stronger evidence for some other things really , " he said .
He points to the fact that the Colony Collapse Disorder is inconsistent even within localised regions .
Some beekeepers have managed to retain completely healthy hives .
His caution is backed up by Nathan Rice , from the Department of Agriculture 's bee research laboratory .
" While there is a lot of this crazy guessing going on , people get kind of concerned , " he said .
" We 're here to try to figure out why it 's happening . "
Future fears
The sensitivity of the beekeepers themselves is easy to understand .
For the Hackenbergs , their livelihood is at stake , not to mention the millions of bees that have died .
David Hackenberg 's son , Davey , 35 , is angry and frustrated that there are no answers yet .
" We 're working hard at it every day , and we 're going to keep working hard until the bank comes and says , 'hey , we 're taking the place , ' " he says with a defiant edge .
As a father of four , he thinks that the time may have come to get out of the bee business .
Tales abound around the Hackenberg breakfast table of beekeepers who have already given up after a calamitous few months trying to pollinate the huge almond crop in California .
Some bankrupt beekeepers do not have the money to get themselves home , let alone their equipment .
A bumper - sticker on one of the family trucks shows support for the Bush - Cheney ticket in the 2004 election , but Davey is now wondering whether anywhere near enough has been done by governments - and everybody else - to keep his fragile industry and environment going .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
For the average person , popping vitamin C pills is unlikely to ward off the common cold or shorten its length or severity .
However , for people exposed to short bouts of extreme physical exercise or cold temperatures , vitamin C may markedly reduce their risk of catching a cold .

However , for people exposed to short bouts of extreme physical exercise or cold temperatures , vitamin C may markedly reduce their risk of catching a cold .
REUTERS / USDA / Randall Smith / Handout
The findings stem from a review of 30 published studies involving 11,350 people who took at least 200 milligrams of vitamin C each day .
Based on pooled data , regular ingestion of vitamin C did nothing to lower the risk of the common cold in the ordinary population , report reviewers in the latest issue of The Cochrane Library , a publication of the Cochrane Collaboration , an international organization that evaluates medical research .
There was a slight reduction in the duration and severity of common cold symptoms with vitamin C , compared with placebo , but the magnitude of the effect was so small its clinical usefulness is doubtful , the experts report .
Therefore , it is senseless for most people to take vitamin C every day to reduce their risk of catching a cold , according to co-author Harri Hemila of the University of Helsinki , Finland and her colleagues .
An exception appears to be when individuals are exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress .
In six trials involving a total of 642 marathon runners , skiers , and soldiers taking part in sub-arctic exercises , vitamin C supplements reduced the risk of the common cold by 50 percent .
Vitamin C , for the average person , also failed as a “ therapeutic ” for the common cold .
Trials of high - dose vitamin C taken after the onset of cold symptoms showed “ no consistent ” effect on either the length of a cold or the severity of symptoms .
Hemila and colleagues caution that there were only a few therapeutic trials and their quality varied .
One trial showed a borderline benefit from downing an 8 - gram dose of vitamin C at the beginning of a cold , and two trials using 5 - day supplementation reported benefits .
More trials testing vitamin C as a possible treatment for the common cold are needed , the reviewers conclude .
The value of vitamin C in preventing and treating the common cold has been the subject of controversy for six decades .
Nonetheless , vitamin C is widely sold and used for these purposes .
The authors of the Cochrane report conclude , based on the data at hand , that the routine use of vitamin C to prevent the common cold is “ not rationally justified for community use .
It could be justified in people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise or cold environments . ”

Government of the People , By the People , For the People
“ Government of the people , by the people , for the people ” … remember these words from Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address ?
Has it now become , “ Government fuck the people ” ?
The Declaration of Independence says
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security
I ’m just saying …
Olbermann hosts Al Gore on the abuses of ' mass media persuasion ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This On Tuesday 's edition of Countdown , Keith Olbermann began by highlighting both the ignorance of General Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , concerning the number of American troops that have died in Iraq and Cindy Sheehan 's withdrawal from her role as a leader of the anti-war movement .
Olbermann then turned to his guest , former Vice - President Al Gore , asking him whether he agrees with Sheehan .
Gore hestitated before answering but finally said that he agrees in part , in that he believes our " national conversation " is dominated by trivialities and " very cleverly constructed propagandistic messaging that really does n't take logic and reason into account . "
When Olbermann pursued the point further , asking Gore to comment on Sheehan 's sense that the country does n't want change , and the broader sense that attempting to engage in a dialog is pointless , Gore responded by pointing to the Internet as something that is bringing back a " public marketplace of ideas that is more accessible to individuals "
Picking up one of the major themes of his book , The Assault on Reason , Gore stated , " The Internet does invite a robust , multi-way conversation that I think is already beginning to serve as a corrective for some of the abuses of the mass media persuasion campaigns that brought us the invasion of Iraq and the ignoring of the climate crisis . "
Democracy , said Gore , is something that comes naturally to human beings , but when the conversation becomes one - way -- as it does when dominated by mass media like television -- and is diverted into propaganda , people come to feel they have no way to be heard .
" We are more vulnerable to these kinds of sophisticated efforts to bypass reason and logic , " Gore stated .
The corrective to this , he insisted , is that " We the People must reclaim the integrity of our democracy . "
Finally , when asked about the prospect of him seeking the presidential nomination , Gore answered as always that he does n't expect to run , explaining , " I do n't think I 'm necessary very good at politics or at a lot of the things that our modern political system rewards and as a result I 'm serving in other ways . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on May 29 .
RUSH TRANSCRIPT ( via Closed - Captioning )
|- he does n't care what you say , look at another , that 's insulting to the integr li l gore now on " countdown . " [ captioning made possible by msnbc ] |- good evening in his rose garden news conference last week president bush having told americans to expect heavy fighting in iraq in the months ahead warning after quote , bloody , very difficult august .
The month mr .
Bush should have been warning about perhaps the one we are in now .
Ten american soldiers dying in iraq on memorial day .
Making may with three days still to go already the deadliest month of the year for hustfer u.s.
Troops .
It freezes the soul to wonder what mr .
Bush madges august would look like in comparison .
Mr. Bush 's sixth memorial day as a wartime president , one of the costliest .
Officials announcing the deaths of the ten american soldiers yesterday .
Casualties for this month at 115 and counting the fer .
At least one top u.s .
Official having trouble keeping track of the death toll .
General peter pace not even estimating the number of iraq dead in a memorial day interview .
|- we have more than 3,000 americans murdered on 11 september , 2001 .
The number who have died , sacrificed themselves since that time is approaching that number .
|- for the record , general , it has long since exceeded that number .
As of yesterday morning , 3,456 americans had lost their lives in iraq and you , sir , have just lost a large measure your credibility .
Cindy sheehan deciding she has lost too much to the war in iraq .
In addition to the life of her son casey , she is tired of being smeared and ridiculed , particularly now by the left .
In a memorial day resignation letter concluding it is time to get out , quoting her casey died for counsel a country which cares more about who will be the next " american idol " than how many americans will be killed in the next few months while democrats and republicans pay politics with human lives .
I 'm going to take whatever I have left and go home .
|- as promised , a pleasure to once again be joined by vice president al gore .
The new book is " the assault on reason . " cindy sheehan 's point that this country cares more about a game show than the war in iraq so she 's getting out of the whole process , do you agree with her ?
and is what she 's saying kind of representative of what you 've written about in the new book ? |- I do n't agree with that sentiment as it was expressed .
I think that our public airwaves and , more importantly , the national conversation of democracy , if you will , now is dominated by elements that were not features of the conversation that our founders expected that we would have .
And a lot of the -- a lot of the public forum is taken up not just with triffyalts but also with very cleverly constructed 3r07 grand is particular me thinking that -- really does n't take logic and reason into account .
And there was never a golden age when everything was all logical in the past , of course not .
But the relative role of facts and logic and reason used to be much larger than it has become in the age of 30 - second tv ads and the multiscreen experience .
|- the sense of defeat in her statement , that the country does n't want change that she 's beating her head against the wall .
Take out the stesks of her and her situation , it does seem to be symbolic of what we 're talking about .
How on earth do you change the broader sense that protest that dialogue that involvement is meaningless or pointless ?
|- well , first of all , my heart goes out to all those americans who have lost loved ones , be it children or spouses or partners or brothers and sisters in the war .
And of course mrs .
Sheehan is one of those who has tried to also play a role in our national dialogue .
And i'd like to separate those two things .
I think that it is difficult for any individual to gain access to the public forum in the same way that was the case when the printed word was dominant .
I think that the internet is bringing back not only the printed word but a public marketplace of ideas that is more accessible to individuals .
And for all of its excesses and bad features , the internet does invite a robust multi-way conversation that I think is already beginning to serve as a corrective for some of the abuses of the mass media persuasion campaigns that brought us the invasion of iraq and the ignoring of the climate crisis and the other serious mistakes that we 've been making over the last few years .
|- put in context with me on this , and I want to get back to the internet because obviously it 's vitally important to any kind of feedback .
But in terms of this public perception that it can or cannot effect change in this nation , the democrats ' agreement last week to continue to fund the war in iraq basically on president bush 's terms , do you see one as representative of the other ?
fit them together for me .
|- well , I think that it might have happened even without it , even without these trends , because the tools available to the legislative branch of government are less precise and often more difficult to wield than those available to the executive branch .
The power available to the executive branch has increased in the television age .
And the use of symbols is something any president has the upper hand with over a congress by and large .
And when the congressional leaders did n't have the votes to override the president 's veto , then their options were diminished .
I have a lot of faith in nancy pelosi and harry reid and the new leaders of the committees , but they did n't have the votes and so I understand that their options were reduced sharply .
But there 's no doubt that a lot of people who felt that they would just instantly change the course of the war may not give them as much credit as they should for trying as hard and effect I feel as they have .
And they 're not done yet .
|- to one of those points in there , I was intrigued by the you made in the book about congress should hold its key votes in primetime .
That would get theoretically some of the public momentum back .
At least people might initially mistake it for some sort of live action series or reality show .
But why is it that you or I can check on the minute - by - minute progress of a football game or a basketball game or a baseball game or an " american idol " show on the internet , on a blackberry , on your cell phone but last week during those votes in the house and the senate , I could n't get a representative by representative vote or senate by senate vote , senator by senator vote anywhere on the internet .
What happened there ?
|- I think that 's an excellent point , keith scompshes it should be remedied .
And I have a list of specific recommendations for a lot of the institutions of our society , including the congress , and that 's one of them .
I think that we should have the most important debates in primetime so that the american people could watch if they choose to .
And I think that the congress and all parts of the government should be transparent to those citizens who wish to contact them over the internet and get a minute - by - minute , second - bi- second account of what 's going on and give their own opinions during the process .
|- and on the subjects of transparency , you also argue in the book , " the current white house has engaged in an unprecedented and sustained campaign of mass deception , especially where its policies in iraq are concerned . " should that not be put in the present tense ?
is n't the administration still using propaganda and disngs on iraq ?
and what are the immediate steps to try to remedy that ?
|- well , they have -- the president himself has changed his rhetoric slightly on the implied linkage between saddam hussein and osama bin laden .
But the vice president has not .
And overall , more than half of americans still have the opinion that saddam was involved in that attack .
At the time the congress voted , 70 % pleefed that saddam hussein was primarily responsible for the attack of 9/11 .
And I think that impression did not come about accidentally , I think that there was an organized effort with all of these administration spokesmen in the same week going out and using the same phrases , a mushroom cloud over an american city , the uranium from africa that saddam was supposedly using to make a bomb that he would then give to osama , it was all false , it was all nonsense .
But the fact that it was conveyed so skillfuly and so effectively that more than two - thirds of the american people had it firmly in mind as the principle reason to support the invasion of iraq , that 's an indictment of the integrity of this national conversation of democracy that our founders assumed would take place with a well - informed citizenry that would hold our elected officials accountable .
And the fact that that 's not working is not so much an indictment of president bush and vice president cheney , although it is , but much more serious , in my view , is that our nation was so vulnerable to such crass efforts to manipulate opinion and drive the country in directions we would never have chosen if we had a full and open debate .
|- the premise of the book appears to be , in some , and if i'm wrong please correct me or someone will send in an email immediately , for democracy to work , people need to connect with each other , connect with the political system and actively take part in the democratic process .
But at the heart of it , are n't you demanding first that people think ?
you can't force them to think .
|- well , I think that all of the activities of democracy that come natural to us as human beings , regardless of where we were born -- immigrants who come here from other countries take to our democratic processes like ducks to water because it's a universal desire for dignity and respect .
But when the conversation is diverted to these trivial advertise and to these efforts to sway public opinion this way and that in a one - way dialogue , then people do n't have a way to join the conversation .
One of the reasons why so many americans feel as if their votes do n't count , that their opinions are n't heard , and that they have no way of meaning fully participating in our democracy is because they know that , for example , in the last election in november , 80 % of the campaign budgets and contested races were spent on these 30 - second tv ads .
Those are one way .
They are n't based op facts and logic .
And campaigns never have been entirely thus based .
But , when the bulk of it is made up of these mass persuasion techniques that do n't respect the facts and do n't respect the people who are the objects of this persuasion , then we get the kinds of serious mistakes that we have seen with the climate crisis , with the invasion of iraq , with the mass , warrantless eavesdropping on american citizens , eliminating the prohibition against torture that general george washington laid down that 's been respected by every president and both parties for more than 200 years .
These things happen not just because one white house makes terrible decisions but because we are more vulnerable to these kinds of sophisticated efforts to bypass reason and logic to reach a preconceived policy that was decided before the facts were ever brought into play .
It 's like the old line from alice and wonderland , first the verdict , then the trial .
If they decide to invade iraq , regardless of the facts , then there 's no discussion of the facts that 's going to matterment but we the people , without using the phrase in a way that inevitably sounds corny , we the people , must reclaim the integrity of our democracy by using the new tools that are now beginning to be available to us to insist on respect for reason and logic to a degree that our founders hoped would be the case .
[ commercial ] |- the only reason al gore's
movie " an inconvenient truth " was in a position to win an oscar was because he had lost the florida recount .
As plan b's go , mr .
Gore 's come back career has been hugely successful .
But as he is finding out on his media tour for his latest book , questions about whether he 's planning to take another shot at the white house are impossible to scape .
Many cannot help but wonder if on any number of imperative issues , he could surely be more if he effective from inside the oval office than from the top of the bestseller list .
More now on our conversation from efrlier today .
One other topic while you 're here -- nobody ever asks you about this , it 's the prospect of you seeking the president deposition nomination next year am there 's an item in " newsweek " that read he , and that he would be you , is 50 - 50 according to one of his closest friends and financial backers .
What 's your reaction to that item ?
|- well , whoever it was does n't reflect my thinking and I can't even answer that question , keith , without sounding repetitious , so you know my answer .
I 'm not thinking about running .
I do n't expect to run .
Yes , I have n't ruled out the possibility at some point in the future but i'm not keeping that exception alive to be could i.
I really do n't expect to be a candidate get gren .
But here we are , 500 days or so before the next election .
I do n't see why , you know , everybody has to close the doors and say , ok , let 's narrow the field and make your bets .
I 'm an american citizen .
I 'm going to continue speaking out on my views forcefully and as best |- -- is to actually become president of the united states ?
|- well , I respect that argument and i'm under no ill luge that is there 's any position as influential as that of president of the united states .
I do n't think i'm necessarily very good at politics or at a lot of the things that our modern political system rewards .
And as a result , i'm serving in other case .
I 'm involved in a different kind of campaign , to persuade people to solve the climate crisis .
And it 's really as part that have effort that i've addressed the problems with our democracy .
I 'm convinced that we have to fix the foundations in our democracy in order to make better choices and solve the climate crisis .
|- all right .
The one last topical or nontopical question , I guess we would view it as topical and you would view it as nontopical .
You mentioned the door closing .
When does the door close ? |- I do n't know that .
|- you do n't know that ?
that 's still up in the air ? |- oh , I thought you were talking about deadlines and dates and so forth .
I really do n't know those dates .
|- that 's where we 'll leave it .
The 45th vice president of the united states , al gore , whots new book is " the assault on reason . "
I hope you 're as successful with it as you were with " an inconvenient truth . " and that the results are as positive for all of us .
|- thank you , keith and thank you for your passionate involvement in your own way trying to address these same issues .
|- thanks for being so generous with your time .
Well , I tried , more with al gore including the possibility that the internet might still save oir democracy , tomorrow night here on " countdown . " now arc frightening health alert .
They told him not to fly , he flew anyway .
Now authorities scrambling to
Scientists have created embryonic stem cells in mice without destroying embryos in the process , potentially removing the major controversy over work in this field .
Embryonic stem cells are special because they are pluripotent , meaning they can develop into virtually any kind of tissue type .
They therefore offer the promise of customized cells for therapy .
The work , which appears in the June 6 online issue of Nature , was led by Rudolf Jaenisch , a member of the Whitehead Institute and a professor of biology at MIT .
His colleagues on the work are from Whitehead , MIT , Massachusetts General Hospital , the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , and Harvard Medical School .
Somatic cell nuclear transfer ( " therapeutic cloning " ) offers the hope of one day creating customized embryonic stem cells with a patient 's own DNA .
In this process , an individual 's DNA would be placed into an egg , resulting in a blastocyst that houses a supply of stem cells .
But to access these cells , researchers must destroy a viable embryo .
Now , Jaenisch and colleagues have demonstrated that embryonic stem cells can be created without eggs .
By genetically manipulating mature skin cells taken from a mouse , the scientists transformed these cells back into a state identical to that of an embryonic stem cell .
No eggs were used , and no embryos destroyed .
" These reprogrammed cells , by all criteria that we can apply , are indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells , " says Jaenisch .
What 's more , these reprogrammed skin cells can give rise to live mice , contributing to every kind of tissue type , and can even be transmitted via germ cells ( sperm or eggs ) to succeeding generations .
" Germline transmission is the final and definitive proof that these cells can do anything a traditionally derived embryonic stem cell can do , " adds Jaenisch .
" But , " he cautions , " these results are preliminary and proof of principle .
It will be a while before we know if this can ever be done in humans .
Human embryonic stem cells remain the gold standard for pluripotent cells and it is a necessity to continue studying embryonic stem cells through traditional means . "
In August 2006 , researchers at Kyoto University reported that by activating four genes in a mouse skin cell , they could reprogram that cell into a pluripotent state resembling an embryonic stem cell .
However , the resulting cells were limited when compared with real embryonic stem cells , and the Kyoto team was unable to generate live mice from these cells .
How they did it
The Jaenisch team decided to replicate this experiment , while refining certain technical aspects .
This group included Jaenisch lab postdocs Marius Wernig , Alexander Meissner and Tobias Brambrink , MIT graduate student Ruth Foreman , Manching Ku , a research fellow from Bradley Bernstein 's lab at Massachusetts General Hospital , and Konrad Hochedlinger , formerly of the Jaenisch lab and now at Massachusetts General Hospital .
Using artificial viruses called vectors , the team activated the same four genes in a batch of mouse skin cells .
These genes , Oct4 , Sox2 , c- Myc and Klf4 , are called transcription factors , meaning that they regulate large networks of other genes .
While Oct4 and Sox2 are normally active in the early stages of embryogenesis , they typically shut down once an embryo has developed beyond the blastocyst stage .
" We were working with tens of thousands of cells , and we needed to devise a precise method for picking out those rare cells in which the reprogramming actually worked , " says Wernig .
" On average , it only works in about one out of 1,000 cells . "
To test for reprogramming , the team decided to zero in on Oct4 and another transcription factor called Nanog .
These two hallmarks for embryonic stem cell identity are only active in fully pluripotent cells .
The trick would be to figure out a way to harvest Oct4 - and Nanog - active cells from the rest of the population .
The answer came in the form of a laboratory technique called homologous recombination .
Here , the scientists took genetic material known to be resistant to the toxic drug neomycin and spliced it into the genomes of each cell right beside Oct4 and Nanog .
If Oct4 and Nanog switched on , the drug - resistant DNA would also spring into action .
The researchers then added neomycin to the cells .
Only those fully reprogrammed cells with active Oct4 and Nanog survived .
Next , the team ran these cells through a battery of tests , seeing if they could discover any substantial differences between these cells and normal embryonic stem cells .
" In all tests ... there were no molecular markers distinguishing these two groups , " says Meissner .
But definitive proof would only come through demonstrating that these cells could actually develop into any kind of body tissue and cell type .
The researchers approached this question in three ways .
Definitive proof
First , they fluorescently labeled these reprogrammed cells and injected them into early - stage embryos , which eventually gave rise to live mice .
While these mice consisted of both the reprogrammed cells and the natural cells from the original embryo , the fluorescent tags indicated that the reprogrammed cells contributed to all tissue types in the mouse , everything from blood to internal organs to hair color .
Next , they bred these mice and found lineages of the reprogrammed cells in the subsequent generation , proving that these new cells had contributed to the germ line .
Finally , the team took advantage of another lab technique that involves creating a genetically abnormal embryo whose cells all consist of four chromosomes , rather than two .
Because of this aberrant formation , the embryo can only form a placenta and cannot develop into a full - term fetus .
The researchers injected the reprogrammed cells into this embryo and then implanted it in a uterus .
Eventually live late - gestation fetuses could be recovered -- created exclusively from the reprogrammed cells .
" This is the most stringent criteria anyone can use to determine if a cell is pluripotent , " says Jaenisch .
Still , many technical hurdles remain for possibly translating this work to human cells .
For example , the homologous recombination technique used to isolate the pluripotent cells does not yet work in human embryonic stem cells .
" We are optimistic that this can one day work in human cells , " says Wernig .
" We just need to find new strategies to reach that goal .
For now , it would simply be premature and irresponsible to claim that we no longer need oocytes for embryonic stem cell research . "

New York electric company seeks 17 percent rate hike
By Alan Whyte
8 May 2007
New York City ’s major electrical company , Consolidated Edison , has asked state regulators to increase rates 17 percent for city residents and 10.7 percent for businesses .
The hikes would take effect over the next three years , with the first and largest installment — 11.6 percent , for an annual increase of $ 1.2 billion — beginning next April .
Con
Ed would further increase its revenue by $ 335 million in 2009 and $ 390 million in 2010 .
The proposed increases would dramatically raise electric bills for an estimated 3.2 million customers in New York City and suburban Westchester County .
It has been estimated that an average monthly bill for a resident would increase from $ 70 to $ 82 per month , and from $ 2,200 to $ 2,435 per month for a business .
New Yorkers already pay among the highest rates for electricity in the country .
The rate hike request has provoked widespread anger among the city ’s residents , the vast majority of whom are working people already hard - pressed by rising housing costs and other price increases .
The proposed hikes have provoked particularly strong opposition and outrage because of the electrical power monopoly ’s performance last July , when it plunged some 170,000 people in western Queens into protracted blackout .
For nine days , residents were forced to suffer through sweltering heat without air conditioning or lights , and business losses were estimated in the ten of millions of dollars as stores and restaurants were forced to throw out perishable goods .
Many small businesses had to close down , and a number have yet to reopen .
Nevertheless , as in the blackout , so too today , the utility enjoys the support of New York City ’s billionaire Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
He urged residents to keep an open mind about the further price gouging they confront , telling them to assess the rate hike request “ on the merits , not on politics . ”
Bloomberg expressed admiration for the monopoly ’s marshalling of facts and arguments in the attempt to get the permission of New York ’s regulatory agency to boost its revenues .
“ Con Ed submitted more than 1,800 pages of data and testimony to the State ’s Public Service Commission today — a commission that was created to analyze this kind of data and make decisions based on the facts , not political influence , ” he declared in a statement released last Friday .
City residents are not only unimpressed with such arguments , but are further incensed by the fact that these rate hikes are being proposed right after the New York City Water Board proposed to raise the water and sewer taxes by 11.5 percent , the largest increases in 15 years .
The mayor also defended this increase in a recent radio show , saying that “ somebody ’s got to pay . ”
As is always the case with the mayor , who himself has a personal fortune of more than $ 5 billion , the somebody from whom he demands sacrifice to maintain essential city services never includes the wealthy and big business , but always consists of working people who can least afford these increased prices and taxes .
The Public Service Commission has already determined that the blackout last year was a product of the Con Ed ’s own failure to adequately maintain and utilize its equipment .
It will also be holding hearings on the company ’s decision - making before and during the blackout to determine whether fines — for as much as $ 100 million — should be levied against the company .
Thus , the same public agency that will be deciding on penalties against Con Ed will also be determining if the utility should obtain the rate increases .
The commission , therefore , is in a position not only to fine the utility , but also to include the cost of the fine in approved rate hikes .
This would effectively amount to a kind of double jeopardy for the consumers — the same city residents who endured hardship and losses because of the company ’s failure to provide electricity for nine days last summer would be hit with a rate hike to cover the company ’s fine .
Given the structure of the deregulated US electrical power system , residents could end up paying significantly more than what has already been proposed by Con Ed .
In pursuit of higher profits , the company has sold off most of its own power plants to other companies that sell power back to Con Ed and other utilities on the wholesale market .
If , as many are predicting , wholesale prices rise significantly , Con Ed can be counted on to pass the costs on to its customers .
“ Supply is tightening , and wholesale prices may rise quite a lot , in addition to Con Edison ’s delivery charges , ” Gerald Norlander , executive director of the Public Utility Law Project , a public advocacy group , told the New York Times .
Con Edison has stated that it needs the rate increase in order to spend billions of dollars on improvements in its substations , transformers , and primary cables .
Generally speaking , power costs have been soaring throughout the country , and according to an analysis by the Associated Press in 2006 , consumers in deregulated parts of the country pay about 30 percent more than those in regulated areas , a widening of the ratio from the 24 percent difference that existed in 1990 .
Though the rate hike spells growing pressure on the city ’s working population , it will come as good news at least to the company ’s wealthy shareholders .
It has been estimated that the utility has $ 12 billion in annual revenues .
And , according to a report in the New York Post , a Con Ed official stated at an investors ’ conference earlier this year that not only is it the case that New Yorkers probably pay the highest rates in the country , but also that much of the increase that the company is demanding will go to shareholder dividends .
In its most recent report to stockholders , management boasted that the company has increased its net income to $ 737 million .
As of last January , it decided to increase its annual dividend to shareholders for the 33rd straight year .
Con
Ed stock is currently trading at $ 51.42 per share , an increase of $ 7.00 since the beginning of the year .
