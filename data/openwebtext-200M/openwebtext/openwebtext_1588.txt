Opponents of a proposed wind farm off the Scarborough Bluffs huffed and puffed at city councillors Monday but failed to get even a symbolic call for a halt to the politically charged project .
The executive committee of council heard more than three hours of deputations , mostly from Guildwood residents vehemently opposed to a Toronto Hydro proposal to install about 60 turbines in an offshore ribbon from roughly the Leslie Street Spit east to Ajax .
One after another , they beseeched the 12 - member committee to pass along to full council a motion by Scarborough councillors Paul Ainslie and Brian Ashton to ask the Ontario government for a moratorium on wind - power development in Ontario .
Energy Minister Brad Duguid has said such a motion would have no impact on the province ’s drive to boost green energy production .
But the wind farm opponents , thwarted so far at every turn , gave it everything they had .
John Laforet , president of Wind Concerns Ontario and a challenger in the city election for Ainslie ’s council seat in Ward 43 , Scarborough East , said that nowhere in the world are there so many turbines so close ( 2 to 3 kilometres offshore ) to a populated shoreline .
Nobody really knows the turbines ’ effect on human health , on fish habitat or on shore erosion , he said .
“ We need this council to act .
You own this problem .
You can stop Toronto Hydro , ” which is owned by the city , he said .
Anthony Haines , Toronto
Hydro ’s chief executive , said the utility wo n’t decide whether to install the 140 - metre - high turbines until it gets at least two years of data from a wind gauge and tries to address the residents ’ concerns .
“ You have our commitment that that process will be full and complete and open and transparent , ” he said , noting Hydro has pledged to find 500 megawatts of renewable energy from sources including wind , solar and biomass .
“ I think it is important , however , to understand that this ( wind farm proposal ) is a very important piece of achieving our target , ” he said .
Another Scarborough councillor , Glenn De Baeremaeker ( Ward 38 , Scarborough Centre ) , made a successful motion to refer the matter to the Toronto Environmental Office , which is to report back to committee after Hydro has the results of its wind tests .
De Baeremaeker said he understands only the aesthetic argument against the turbines .
“ I think they ’re grand .
I think they ’ll be a tourist attraction , and boats are going to weave in and out of them . ”

IT IS a peculiar , if blessed , sort of natural disaster in which nobody dies .
The Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull produced a thrilling show — and may continue to do so — but did most of its damage simply by shutting down air traffic in and out of large parts of Europe for nearly a week .
Rather than bereavement , it brought the eeriness , and sometimes the joy , of displacement .
Colleagues were absent from their desks , and teachers and pupils from their classrooms ; the clear blue skies were bereft of the silver needles that sew the world together .
Birdsong made loud the silence of the jets , florists ' vases missed the bright blooms of far - off fields , and far - off farmers missed the cash those blooms would have brought .
But , this time , almost all that went missing will be returned .
Two arguments spout up from this demonstration of earthly power .
The first is immediate and practical : was all this chaos man-made — an immense and costly overreaction by regulators to a spectacle that posed only a minor and manageable risk ?
The second is more philosophical : what does this say about man 's apparent inability to control nature ?
To fly or not to fly
The initial position of Europe 's regulators was that the safe level of volcanic ash was , in effect , zero , thus grounding all flights in the broad swathes of sky which computer models said could be tainted .
The fact that this regulatory stance changed in the face of an affluent cadre of displaced people , airlines feeling the pinch , a looming threat to some supply chains and ( in Britain ) an election , makes it all the more suspicious .
Areas with low concentrations of dust and ash are now suddenly deemed navigable , and aircraft passing through them will be given thorough post - flight engine inspections ( see article ) .
How exactly the new safety threshold came to be set at 2,000 micrograms of dust or ash per cubic metre is not clear ; the figure appears to have come from engine manufacturers , but the evidence on which it is based has not yet been made public .
Regulations without a clear and open argument behind them are worrisome .
But that does n't mean the threshold , equivalent to about 100 times the typical level of dust in the atmosphere at ground level , is necessarily a bad one ( test flights found patches of dust of up to 20 times normal levels ) .
And the previous position that there was no safe level clearly lacked any sort of evidence base at all .
Had better policies been in place beforehand , much inconvenience might have been avoided .
But it is wrong to dismiss the week 's woes as an over - precautionary fuss over nothing .
Northern Europe has many hub airports downwind of one of the most volcanic countries in the world , and the emergence of the global aviation industry just happened to coincide with a period of relative inactivity there .
Some of Iceland 's volcanoes can shoot hundreds of times as much gunk into the atmosphere as Eyjafjallajokull has , and over long periods .
There are other volcanoes , notably in the American north - west and Japan , capable of disrupting a lot of airspace around big cities .
The fact that the long - distance risks posed by volcanoes are not , for the most part , insurable seems to have led to them being less well studied than other kinds of natural disaster .
A wake - up call was needed , and it has been sounded .
The new regulatory approaches now need to be openly justified , and perhaps taken further .
With great power comes great responsibility
But the week of absences also offers a less obvious lesson .
One of the things that went missing in the shadow of that volcanic dust was a sense of human power .
And as with the quiet skies , this absence found a welcome in many hearts .
The idea that humans , for all their technological might , could be put in their place by this volcano — this obscure , unpronounceable , C - list volcano — was strangely satisfying , even thrilling .
Such pleasure in the face of overpowering nature , as seen from a place of safety , was at the heart of the idea of “ the sublime ” as expressed by the great conservative Edmund Burke 250 years ago , and its aesthetic and spiritual allure remains strong .
The sublime offers solace and inspiration , but it makes a poor guide to policy .
For humans are not completely powerless in the face of nature : rather the reverse .
There is no technology to plug volcanoes which pierce the earth 's crust , or to bind the faults which cause earthquakes .
There is not yet even a science for predicting when faults and volcanoes will let loose .
To that extent , mankind is still vulnerable to the vagaries of the planet .
But the story of human development is one of becoming better at coping with them .
Death by disaster is in many ways a symptom of economic underdevelopment : witness the very different consequences of the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile .
In general , richer places and richer people are better able to survive and rebound .
More interconnections provide more ways to mobilise resources and explore alternatives when things go wrong .
If the Eyjafjallajokull plume had been as risky as it first appeared and long - lived to boot , such interconnectedness would undoubtedly have provided ways to keep Europe supplied , though probably at substantial cost and with a fair bit of lasting disruption .
The apparently sublime power of the volcano was largely the result of an initially supine reaction .
Very few events are able to perturb an increasingly globalised world .
The Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 was a murderous event , but the world pushed on and many areas recovered quickly ( see Buttonwood ) .
For a natural disaster to represent a global threat , it has to act on a global scale .
An eruption of hot plasma from the sun , called a coronal mass ejection , which could do damage to electricity grids over an entire continent , might fit the bill .
The largest volcanoes might cause short - term climate change profound enough to reduce agricultural production precipitously in many places at once .
A large asteroid strike would do yet more damage .
These are , though , rare events .
Very large coronal mass ejections are thought to happen every 500 years or so ( the most recent was in 1859 ) .
Volcanoes that change climate enough to affect agriculture round the world are perhaps 100 times rarer than that , and cataclysmic asteroids rarer still .
What is more , such asteroids could , in principle , be identified and , with plausible technology , nudged aside .
Here Burke 's sublime is turned on its head , and human capability seems to humble nature .
This is worth applying to climate change .
Many of Burke 's descendants find it difficult to believe that something as big as the earth 's climate could really be at risk from human activity , and even harder to think you could do something about it .
But the risk , if not full certainty about its consequences , is there .
Moreover , the idea of a counterbalancing , “ geoengineered ” cooling to counteract some aspects of climate change is worthy of study and discussion .
Large volcanic eruptions spread cooling palls through the stratosphere .
Techniques for doing something similar in a less dramatic way are plausible .
When people talk about the charms of powerlessness in the face of nature , part of what they are saying is that they do n't want to be bothered with facing up to what humans can do , and to what they might have at risk .
The business of looking after a planet requires being bothered in advance — and not just about little matters like volcanoes .
In a statement , Sarah Carlson , Moody ’s lead analyst for Greece , said it was “ unlikely that the rating will remain at A3 , unless the government ’s actions can restore confidence in the markets and counteract the prevailing headwinds of high interest rates and low growth . ”
The stream of news pushed the yields on Greek bonds up to new highs — to 8.835 percent , above the 8.529 percent return that investors currently demand for similar debt from South Africa .

The euro slid in early Asian trading on Friday to $ 1.3201 against the dollar , the lowest level in a year .
On Thursday in Europe , it dropped to $ 1.3316 , down from $ 1.3401 on Wednesday .
Shares in Athens also tumbled again on Thursday , with the benchmark index closing almost 4 percent lower , taking its losses for the year so far to more than 15 percent .
Officials in Athens and Brussels sought to limit the damage .
The Greek Finance Ministry said in a statement that the announcement by Eurostat did not alter its goal of reducing the deficit by at least four percentage points of G.D.P. in 2010 , as laid down in the Greek stability and growth program , which it forwarded to the European Commission for scrutiny .
“ The government has already adopted all the necessary measures — in excess of 6 percent of G.D.P. — to ensure the achievement of this objective and is rapidly progressing on the implementation of all policy and structural changes , ” it said .
Analysts expressed concern that the increased debt and deficit forecasts could spread the economic pain further into the future .
Amnesty International has condemned the executions in Iran of four Kurdish political activists and another Iranian man , all convicted of “ moharebeh ” ( enmity against God ) .
The four Kurds – Farzad Kamangar , Ali Heydarian , Farhad Vakili , Shirin Alam - Holi - along with Mehdi Eslamian , were hanged on Sunday 9 May 2010 at Evin prison in Tehran .
The five were accused of “ enmity against God ” for carrying out ‘ terrorist acts ’ and convicted of this vaguely worded charge which can carry the death penalty and is usually applied to those who take up arms against the state .
“ We condemn these executions which were carried out without any prior warning .
Despite the serious accusations against them , the five were denied fair trials .
Three of the defendants were tortured and two forced to ‘ confess ’ under duress , ” said Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's Director for the Middle East and North Africa .
“ They were then executed in violation of Iranian law , which requires the authorities to notify prisoners ’ lawyers in advance before carrying out executions . “
Three of those executed - Farzad Kamangar , Ali Heydarian and Farhad Vakili - were sentenced to death for alleged membership and activities for the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) a Turkish armed opposition group that has been fighting the Turkish government .
Shirin Alam - Holi , the woman who was executed , was accused of belonging to another Kurdish group , the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan ( known by its Kurdish acronym PJAK ) , an Iranian armed group that is banned in Iran .
The fifth person executed , Mehdi Eslamian , was accused of providing financial assistance to his brother , who was executed in early 2009 for allegedly bombing a mosque in Shiraz in April 2008 .
“ These latest executions appear to be a blatant attempt to intimidate members of the Kurdish minority and other critics and opponents of the government in the run up to the first anniversary , on 12 June , of last year ’s disputed presidential election , ” said Malcolm Smart
Mehdi Eslamian is reported to have been tortured including by being flogged and beaten ; he was denied medical attention for injuries sustained while in custody and forced to ’ confess ’ .
Farzad Kamangar , a teacher , had been held for seven months prior to being allowed to meet with his family .
According to a letter he wrote , circulated on the internet in April 2008 , he was repeatedly tortured following his arrest in May 2006 .
He was whipped , held in a freezing cold room and guards played ‘ football ’ with his body , surrounding him and pummelling him as he was ’ passed ’ between guards .
In a letter from prison , Shirin Alam - Holi said she had had nightmares because of what her interrogators did to her .
She was repeatedly beaten , including on the soles of her feet , kicked in the stomach , causing internal bleeding , and when she went on hunger strike , force fed through nasal tubes which she ripped out in protest , damaging her nose .
She said she had made a videotaped “ confession ” after she was hospitalised and given an injection .
Detainees are often held incommunicado for lengthy periods in detention centres outside the control of the judiciary , putting them at grave risk of torture and other ill - treatment .
Trials in Iran are frequently unfair , with detainees routinely denied access to a lawyer .
Proceedings outside Tehran are often summary , lasting only a few minutes .
Iran has one of the highest rates of executions in the world .
To date in 2010 , Amnesty International has recorded over 80 executions .
“ Amnesty International is calling on the Iranian authorities to halt all executions .
In the meantime , there should be full transparency over the use of the death penalty in Iran , and - at the very least - the authorities should adhere to their own laws regarding the implementation of executions ” said Malcolm Smart .
In resolution 2005 / 59 , adopted on 20 April 2005 , the UN Commission on Human Rights called upon states that still maintain the death penalty “ to make available to the public information with regard to the imposition of the death penalty and to any scheduled execution ” .

Allied Fiber said today it ’s begun construction of a nationwide wholesale fiber network that will span 11,548 miles .
The New York - based company will build out the network in six phases , linking undersea cable landing points , data centers , colocation interconnection facilities , rural networks and wireless towers in order to feed the increasing demand for broadband capacity resulting from everything from the ever - growing number of cellular towers to cloud computing ( we ’ll talk about the bandwidth needs for cloud computing at our Structure 2010 conference next month ) .
A New Model to Meet Broadband Demand
But Allied ’s effort is n’t just aimed at boosting overall capacity — it ’s aimed at changing the underlying business model of providing long - haul telecommunications networks .
Hunter Newby , CEO of Allied Fiber , wants to connect the U.S. with an open fiber network comprised of the three disparate systems that essentially make up the backbone of the Internet , and is targeting data centers , high - bandwidth sites , rural ISPs , wireless companies and long - haul networks providers as customers .
But it remains to be seen if Allied ’s model will compete , not just with offerings from backbone providers such as Level 3 Communications ( s lvlt ) , but also with colocation companies and the tower industry .
Newby , who was the chief strategy officer at colocation provider Telex , is pretty impassioned about his plan to bring wholesale fiber to places where existing backhaul providers may not go .
It ’s a plan similar to Google ’s ( s goog ) experimental fiber network for consumer broadband , but enacted on a much larger scale , and for businesses .
Newby believes that in underserved areas where Allied Fiber will have a presence , the cost of bandwidth will be driven down significantly because Allied will be willing to sell access to the long haul network , at competitive rates , to anyone who wants them — something the incumbents are n’t inclined to do .
Competition Drives Costs Down
The construction of Allied ’s network is a big deal for small ISPs , which can find themselves having to pay more than $ 100 a megabyte for bandwidth , and may mean they do n’t have to implement bandwidth caps as a means to keep their own costs down .
It ’s also a big deal for cellular carriers like Sprint ( s S ) and T - Mobile , as it will give them access to less expensive backhaul without having to pay the likes of AT&T ( s T ) or Verizon ( s vz ) .
As Newby explains , rural providers or cellular providers needing rural coverage will be able to buy transport at wholesale rates from a colocation provider in the middle of field somewhere along a railroad right of way ( Allied has a deal with some railways companies for access to their ducts ) .
Such an approach could provide access for a single provider near the colocation facility or other regional providers could build off the Allied network .
It would also open up the opportunity to locate data centers in rural areas , perhaps near renewable energy projects .
“ The incumbents have control and have made it quite clear they ’re not willing to make any significant capital investments in rural areas and are selling off rural assets , ” Newby told me .
“ But you need to change the economics , and if these buyers can buy at even $ 15 per megabyte … the number of gigs and terabytes will eclipse the current rate because right now it ’s so expensive . ”
Building a High - Fiber Network
The first phase of the Allied network will cost $ 140 million , will connect New York , Chicago and Ashburn , Va. and will be completed by the end of this year .
Newby said the second phase ( from Atlanta to Miami ) will cost $ 180 million , and the third phase connecting Chicago to Seattle could cost as much as $ 350 million .
However , he added that potential customers are willing to go in with him on the cost of the connection to Seattle because big bandwidth providers like NTT Corp.
need a shorter route to get their traffic to Asia .
The final three projects are n’t budgeted yet , nor is there a definitive time frame .
The first phase will provide a combined 648 dark fibers , 19 colocation facilities and 300 tower sites .
From the press release :
Allied is deploying a 432 - count , long haul cable coupled with the 216 - count , short - haul cable that will be a composite of Single - Mode and Non-Zero Dispersion Shifted fibers .
Allied Fiber has implemented a new , multi-duct design for intermediate access to the long - haul fiber duct through a parallel short - haul fiber duct all along the route .
This enables all points between the major cities , including wireless towers and rural networks , to gain access to the dark fiber .
In addition , the Allied Fiber neutral colocation facilities , located approximately every 60 miles along the route , accommodate and encourage a multi-tenant interconnection environment integrated with fiber that does not yet exist in the United States on this scale .
If Allied Fiber can build an open fiber network that spans the country and includes colocation and towers , it could provide a way for municipal fiber networks and rural ISPs to get online and connect to backhaul for less , while bypassing their potential competitors ( for example , a muni fiber network might compete against AT&T but may also have to buy access back to the Internet backbone from AT&T because it ’s the only provider in the area ) .
We ’ve long argued that open networks are the way to go when it comes to big infrastructure , something with which Newby agrees .
“ I believe in the power of open networks , ” he said , “ but instead of talking about it or writing , about I want to do it . ”
He went on to say that : “ I encourage other people to copy our model and philosophy of neutrality .
It drives growth and it ’s what drives the innovation and bridges the islands of broadband we have in this country . ”

Israel plans to deploy the rocket defence system this year
Barack Obama is to ask the US Congress for an extra $ 200 m in military aid to help Israel get a short - range rocket defence system in place .
The system is designed to shoot down mortars and rockets from Gaza or Southern Lebanon with guided missiles .
The system , called Iron Dome , has gone through testing and installation will start later this year .
According to US State Department figures , direct military aid to Israel was $ 2.55 bn in 2009 .
This is set to increase to $ 3.15 bn in 2018 .
Easing tensions
A White House spokesman reaffirmed what he called the administration 's " unshakeable commitment " to Israel 's security - adding that Mr Obama recognised the threat posed by missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah .
Iron Dome was conceived and developed in Israel following the Lebanon war of 2006 , during which Hezbollah launched about 4,000 rockets into northern Israel .
Southern Israel has also come under fire , with thousands of rockets and mortars fired by Palestinian militants .
Israel completed tests on the system in January .
Officials say the next phase in its development is its integration into the Israeli army .
A BBC correspondent in Washington , Steve Kingstone , says Washington may be acting now to ease the recent tensions in its relations with Israel .
In March a diplomatic row erupted when approval was granted for new homes for Jews in occupied east Jerusalem .
The decision came during a visit to the city by the US Vice - President Joe Biden .
The announcement on US funding for Iron Dome coincides with the resumption of indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
ISRAELI OFFICIALS have expressed optimism that an announcement on the resumption of peace talks with the Palestinians will be made during the three - day visit to the region of US envoy George Mitchell , which began yesterday .
Negotiations were put on hold during the Gaza war 16 months ago , and Mr Mitchell has made repeated trips to the region in an effort to get the sides to agree to resume talks aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state .
The US envoy , who last night met Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah after talks earlier in the day with Israeli leaders , is scheduled to meet Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu again tomorrow .
“ I look forward to working with the Obama administration to move peace forward , ” Mr Netanyahu told Mr Mitchell at the start of yesterday ’s Jerusalem meeting .
“ We are serious about it , we know you are serious about it and we hope the Palestinians respond . ”
President Shimon Peres told Mr Mitchell no one benefited from the peace process stalemate and that it was time to move forward .
“ If there are elements on the other side doubting our support for the two - state solution , I suggest that they take a look at the peace treaties we have already signed with Egypt and Jordan , ” Mr Peres said .
Israel , under intense pressure from Washington , is expected to agree to a number of goodwill gestures ahead of the resumption of peace talks .
Officials were reluctant to reveal details of the measures ahead of an announcement of the resumption of talks , but , according to media reports , Israel will release Palestinian prisoners , remove some West Bank roadblocks and hand control of additional West Bank areas to Palestinian Authority security forces .
The Palestinian leadership , angered by ongoing Israeli construction in West Bank settlements and east Jerusalem , refused to resume direct talks .
The expected formula will be “ proximity ” talks , with Mr Mitchell holding separate discussions with Israeli negotiators in Jerusalem and a Palestinian team in Ramallah , north of the Israeli capital .
An agreement on proximity talks was expected last month during the visit of US vice - president Joe Biden , but an announcement by Israel of construction of 1,600 new homes in an ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbourhood in east Jerusalem scuttled the breakthrough .
Despite US pressure , Mr Netanyahu , who heads a largely right - wing religious coalition , told Israel ’s Channel 2 television in an interview on Thursday that construction in east Jerusalem , viewed by Palestinians as the future capital of their state , would continue .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticised Mr Netanyahu ’s comments .
“ We should give the proximity talks the chance they deserve , but at the same time , it is evident after Mr Netanyahu ’s statements last night that this Israeli government is determined to continue the course of settlements , dictation and confrontation and not peace and reconciliation , ” he said .
Scientists are planning to use the largest supercomputers to simulate life on Earth , including the financial system , economies and whole societies .
The project is called " Living Earth Simulator " and part of a huge EU research initiative named FuturIcT .
Supercomputers are already being used to explore complex social and economic problems that science can understand in no other way .
For example , ETH Zurich 's professor for transport engineering Kay Axhausen is simulating the travel activities of all 7.5 Million inhabitants of Switzerland to forecast and mitigate traffic congestion .
Other researchers at the ETH -- all working within its Competence Center for Coping with Crises in Complex Socio - Economic Systems ( CCSS ) -- are mining huge amounts of financial data to detect dangerous bubbles in stock and housing markets , potential bankruptcy cascades in networks of companies , or similar vulnerabilities in other complex networks such as communication networks or the Internet .
Coping with Crises
In the past , supercomputers have been used mainly in physics or biology , or for difficult engineering problems such as the construction of new aircrafts .
But now they are increasingly being used for social and economic analyses , even of the most fundamental human processes .
At the CCSS , for example , Lars - Erik Cederman uses large - scale computer models to study the origin of international conflict , and is creating a large database documenting the geographic interdependencies of civil violence and wars in countries such as the former Yugoslavia or Iraq .
In sociology , simulations at the CCSS have explored the conditions under which cooperation and solidarity can thrive in societies .
They show that the crust of civilization is disturbingly vulnerable .
These simulations reveal common patterns behind breakdowns of social order in events as diverse as the war in former Yugoslavia , lootings after earthquakes or other natural disasters , or the recent violent demonstrations in Greece .
Social Super - Computing
The CCSS , particularly the Financial Crisis Observatory led by Didier Sornette , is currently the biggest shareholder of ETH Zurich 's Brutus supercomputing cluster , which is currently the 88th fastest computer in the world and ranked 10th in Europe .
Social supercomputing is also a new focus of other renowned research centres such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Brookings Institution in the United States .
Such simulations , researchers now widely recognize , represent the best chance to gain insight into highly complex problems ranging from traffic flows to evacuation scenarios of entire cities or the spreading of epidemics .
Independent projects in the United States and in Europe have already embarked on efforts to build simulations of the entire global economy .
advertisement
The FuturIcT project aims to bring many efforts of this kind together in order to simulate the entire globe , including all the diverse interactions of social systems and of the economy with our environment .
The concept for the project has already been deeply explored within several European research projects .
Large - Scale Data Mining
Complementary to large - scale computer simulations , the FuturIcT project also aims to gather and organise data on social , economic and environmental processes on an unprecedented scale , especially by augmenting the results of field studies and laboratory experiments with the overwhelming flood of data now resulting from the world wide web or massive multi-player online worlds such as Second Life .
Furthermore , the rapid emergence of vast networks of distributed sensors will make data available on an almost unimaginable scale for direct use in computer simulations .
At the same time , an ethics committee and targeted research will ensure that these data will be explored in privacy - respecting ways and not misused .
The goal is to identify statistical interdependencies when many people interact , but not to track or predict individual behaviour .
Crises Observatories
In a practical sense , the scientists behind the FuturIcT project foresee the development of crises observatories and decision - support systems for politicians and business leaders .
" Such observatories would detect advance warning signs of many different kinds of emerging problems , " says Dirk Helbing , " including large - scale congestion , financial instabilities , the spreading of diseases , environmental change , resource shortages and social conflicts . "
The FuturIcT project led by him aims to put the power of today 's information technology to work in creating the tools needed to address the challenges of humanity in the future , and to ensure social and economic well - being around the globe .
Economic and Policy Opportunities
George Soros , who has established the Institute of New Economic Thinking ( INET ) with an endowment of 50 million dollars , has welcomed the initiative and writes : " The team of scientists that Dr. Helbing has gathered together can , I believe , make a significant contribution to the understanding of the evolution and change in societies as they meet the formidable issues of governance , climate change , sustainable economic balance that we are all faced with in the coming decades .

Character ideas are not my own , they are those of their respective players .
I guess I am Ezekiel , when I was 12 years old , 1955 , I was a witness to some pretty freaky things .
Here are my memories of just that .
In the three weeks since the April 20th explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico , and the start of the subsequent massive ( and ongoing ) oil leak , many attempts have been made to contain and control the scale of the environmental disaster .
Oil dispersants are being sprayed , containment booms erected , protective barriers built , controlled burns undertaken , and devices are being lowered to the sea floor to try and cap the leaks , with little success to date .
While tracking the volume of the continued flow of oil is difficult , an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil ( possibly much more ) continues to pour into the gulf every day .
While visible damage to shorelines has been minimal to date as the oil has spread slowly , the scene remains , in the words of President Obama , a " potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . " ( 40 photos total
Q : Does an illegal immigrant in Florida get $ 1,500 a month for each of her eight children ?
A : No . Illegal immigrants do n’t qualify for welfare or food stamps .
A chain e-mail from a “ disabled Vietnam vet ” is full of misinformation .
FULL QUESTION
Doubting that the info about someone receiving $ 1,500 each for 8 children is correct , but would appreciate any information you are able to provide .
THIS IS TRULY AN OUTRAGE ….
My name is d’Lynn .
I ’m a disabled Vietnam vet .
I do n’t look too bad for a beat - up old fart , do I ?
And that ’s my ride .
She ’s looking pretty good looking also , especially when you consider that she ’ll turn twenty this summer .
That ’s right , it ’s a 1990 with a 1990 sidecar .
I ca n’t ride a solo bike , ergo the sidecar rig .
It ’s my sole means of transportation – rain or shine , snow or wind , and this summer also marks a milestone in both of our lives , as I will finally be able to pay her off .
Twenty years old ?
What ?
Why did it take so long ?
You were n’t paying attention , were you ?
It ’s right at the beginning of this paragraph .
I am a disabled vet , which means I receive a veterans administration disability pension , which also means “ I ’m broke ! ” Just one step ahead of being homeless every month , and that ’s not an idle statement or an ” Oh , whoa is me ” dire complaint .
There ’s a point to this , so hang in there a minute or two and read on .
There ’s a 25 - year - old illegal immigrant woman living in Florida , with eight kids .
Yes , eight “ anchor babies ” and she receives just shy of $ 1,500 per month per kid , plus medical , plus food stamps .
Oh , wait .
I ’ve been informed that I should n’t call them Food Stamps anymore .
That ’s not PC .
It ’s all called “ Social Assistance ” now .
You do the math on that yourself .
I ’d say that she was schooled early in how to make it in the system .
Twenty - five years old , eight kids . . . . . yep , she started early .
You can whip out the calculator if you want , but this women who never has paid a dime in taxes of any kind , ( and still does n’t – she ’s ‘ illegal , ’ remember ? ) is here in this country illegally .
She has n’t paid one one cent in medical for all the “ anchor babies , ” makes more in one month , legally , than I receive in over a year and a half in disability payments and I can’t even get food stamps !
Oops , I mean “ Social Assistance . ”
Technically I am eligible for “ Social Assistance . ”
I was told it would be a walk through – a gimme – being disabled .
No problem , and in the very next breath I was also informed that under the law the amount I received in “ Social Assistance ” would be deducted from my disability pension .
Let ’s say I take a great photograph .
It was just luck , a one of a kind accidental , in the right place at the right time shot .
My local newspaper offers me fifty bucks to use the photo in a featured story .
( I live in a small town and fifty bucks is all they could afford . )
I have to report that fifty dollars to the VA as earned income , which will immediately be deducted from my next month ’s disability check .
If I do n’t report it I ’m in violation of federal law and technically they can stop my disability pension and prosecute me under a federal felony .
Pretty cool , eh ?
For fifty bucks .
I see no point in dealing with two federal bureaucracies , so I do n’t bother .
What ’s the point ?
She ’s here illegally and with just one kid would make over twice what I receive per month .
She has eight and she ’s not a stand - out case .
She ’s not alone .
That ’s the way the system works .
Millions of illegal immigrants know this , know how the system works and know how to use it .
( Have n’t you seen the pamphlet ?
It ’s handed out all along our borders , “ The Illegal Immigrants ’ Guide to Keeping America Just The Way It Is. ” ) and that ’s just the way it works .
Did you know that the federal government provides a “ refugee ” in this country with a monthly “ stipend ” of $ 1,890 , plus $ 580 a month in “ Social Assistance ? ”
That ’s $ 2,470 a month , tax - free .
That ’s two and a half times what I ’m allowed to receive as a disabled vet .
And just what did they do to earn this ?
All you have to do is show up on our collective doorstep , raise your right hand and swear that you ’re a refugee and , bingo , receive $ 30,000 a year , tax - free .
That ’s more than someone making $ 15 an hour , and they have to pay taxes to boot !
Now , in defense of the Veterans Administration , they are doing what they can with what they ’ve got .
This is precious little compared to what they should have to get the job done .
At least this country has a VA .
It ’s the Senate that keeps passing laws , rules and guidelines , cutting their budget , denying requests for more staff and computer systems to handle the massive work flow .
Their hands are tied by the very government that ’s supposed to give them what they need to get the job done , by the government you voted into office .
Do n’t scream at the VA .
I have .
It ’s misguided anger .
The point to this “ story ? ”
Just why are you paying such high taxes to support this incredibly screwed - up government ?
Why ?
And I ’m not proposing you stop paying your taxes .
That ’s wrong .
There are good programs and reasons to pay your taxes and support our government .
What am I proposing ?
It ’s quite simple .
Vote .
The government , our government , is broken and we as the voters serve as the maintenance crew .
We fix it . . . . . by voting .
If your state Senator has been in office more then two terms , vote ’em out at the next election .
If your state representative has been in office more then two terms , vote ’em out of office .
We put term limits on just about every publicly - elected official in the country except the House and Senate .
Why ?
Believe me , they know this and love it !
Ahhh – the power !
I do n’t care how much you believe your Senator or Representative is doing a good job .
They ’re not !
Look at the government you have , that we have .
How can you state they are doing what you want as the voter that put them there ?
How ?
Vote them out of office .
Do it .
Change the course of this country ’s history by what you are granted and guaranteed under the law .
Vote !
And if you have the guts , the anger , the outrage , start a petition in your state for a state - wide initiative to be placed on your next state ballot .
Limiting the terms of office for your state senators and state representatives to your federal government to two terms .
The federal government will never pass such a law , but you can .
You can get it done .
You can force it .
You can make it a law .
This is the first step in “ getting it right . ”
Just vote .
It ’s simple .
It ’s easy .
This first step will send a very clear message .
It ’ll work .
It ’ill put “ us ” back in control of “ them . ”
As it should be .
As it was intended in the first place .
Are you an American ?
Born and raised ?
Then vote !
Side note : I sent this e-mail to a little over one hundred on my e-mail list .
If you believe I ’m wrong or misguided or you simply do n’t agree , that ’s fine .
Go right ahead a delete this e-mail .
No problem .
Sorry to have bothered you .
But if you think I just might have a worthwhile idea , something we can easily accomplish , something that could be a small part at getting this country back under “ our ” control , then please pass this along .
REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER !!
FULL ANSWER
Just about everything this chain e-mail claims regarding benefits to illegal immigrants and refugees is pure bunk .
The photo , however , is of a real person , d’Lynn Morrison of Chelan , in central Washington state .
He confirms that he originated the message and sent it to 14 to 16 friends and fellow veterans , after which it became an Internet phenomenon .
He says some of what appears in the current version has been added or modified by unknown persons who forwarded his message .
In an exchange of e-mail messages , he told us :
d ’Lynn Morrison : I had no ill - intent to misled in my original email .
I used what was sent to me from contacts – and to say the least , I was extremely pissed - off at what I had read .
Unfortunately , the claims that Morrison passed on are simply wrong .
His message claims that there is “ a 25 - year - old illegal immigrant woman living in Florida , with eight kids ” who “ receives just shy of $ 1,500 per month per kid , plus medical , plus food stamps . ”
There is no such woman .
The state does n’t provide benefits anywhere near that large to anyone , native or immigrant , legal or illegal .
And illegal immigrants qualify for no cash benefits at all .
This message has gotten such wide distribution that the Florida Department of Children and Families has prepared a form letter responding to it :
Florida DCF : Under federal and state law , only “ qualified immigrants ” are eligible for these benefits .
Qualified immigrants must provide documentation of certain legal statuses , so individuals without legal status are not eligible .
The letter also explains why the mythical mother of eight is an impossibility .
Under state law , even a citizen or legal resident with eight children could n’t qualify for anything close to the $ 12,000 a month ( $ 1,500 times eight ) claimed by the message .
Florida DCF : Your email specifically asks if it is true that a woman would receive $ 1,500 per child in Florida .
I can assure you this information is incorrect . …
The maximum benefit for a family with one mother and eight children would be $ 671 a month .
Recycled Bunk
Morrison told us that he heard the story about the undocumented mother from a Florida doctor , whom he did not name .
He added , “ I admit – I did not check it all out , some of which I did n’t know how to confirm . ”
We first encountered the mythical Florida mother of eight in a message that claimed to be written by an anonymous “ Florida ER doctor , ” who stated the following : “ Today I had a 25 - year old mother with 8 kids – that ’s right 8 ; all illegal anchor babies and she had the nicest nails , cell phone , hand bag , clothing , etc .
She makes about $ 1,500 monthly for each . ”
Neither the doctor nor the elusive mother is named , of course .
Both the mysterious “ Florida ER doctor ” and the latest message also repeat a number of other false claims about refugees that have been circulating since 2007 .
We covered them in an Ask FactCheck item dated April 17 , 2009 .
We wo n’t repeat all that here , but we ’ll just summarize :
It ’s not true , then or now , that refugees get a $ 1,890 monthly stipend from the government .
That claim actually started as a mistaken rant about Canada , not the U.S. , and it ’s not true of either country .
It ’s also not true that refugees get an additional $ 580 per month as “ social assistance . ”
In Florida , for example , a single refugee — who is a legal immigrant — could qualify for a maximum of only $ 180 per month in temporary assistance ( plus food stamps ) , according to the Department of Children and Families .
Morrison told us that his original message stated that a refugee received $ 890 a month including food stamps , a figure he says he got from “ an advocacy attorney in New York State , ” whom he did not name .
He says somebody later substituted the larger numbers : “ Those numbers – in the copy of the email you sent me were changed by someone .. , which is so easy to do in emails . ”
Morrison says he ’s amazed at how quickly and widely his message has traveled .
d’Lynn Morrison :
One email , written by a ticked - off vet , ( that appears that have had his numbers wrong ) has reached so many people , groups and government bodies .
That is amazing , is n’t it ?
Could that have happened ten years ago ?
Though he says he did n’t write the last paragraph concluding “ REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER , ” he adds , “ I admit I like that phrasing . ”
We have no quarrel with anyone who wants to vote incumbents out of office — or keep them in , for that matter .
Everyone is entitled to an opinion about that .
But in our judgment , false Internet rumors and carelessly repeated falsehoods make a poor basis for forming any opinion or for casting any vote .

HONG KONG — Salvage experts and a tugboat crew struggled on Monday to save a large Chinese freighter that slammed into the Great Barrier Reef off Australia over the weekend , trying to prevent the vessel from breaking apart as some of the 1,075 tons of engine fuel in its tanks began oozing from the hull , threatening the world ’s largest collection of coral .
The freighter , the Shen Neng 1 , crashed into the reef at full speed late Saturday , a few hours after leaving the port of Gladstone , the Australian authorities said .
The ship , which was nine miles outside its authorized shipping lane , was hauling 72,000 tons of coal .
Patrick Quirk , general manager of maritime safety for Queensland , the Australian state where the vessel ran aground , said in a statement Monday morning that a hole in the bottom of the ship allowed water into the main engine room .
The main engine was damaged and the rudder was seriously damaged , he said .
“ One of the most worrying aspects is that the ship is still moving on the reef to the action of the seas , which is doing further damage , ” he said .
Anna Bligh , Queensland ’s premier , told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio early Monday , “ It ’s possible that this could be one of the most complex and difficult salvage operations we ’ve seen , certainly in Queensland ’s maritime history and possibly Australia’s . ”
They say that the first step in dealing with a problem is acknowledging that you have one .
It is therefore good news that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will lead a delegation to Mexico tomorrow to talk with officials there about efforts to fight the mob violence that is being generated in Mexico by the war on drugs .
U.S. recognition of this shared problem is healthy .
But that ’s where the good news is likely to end .
Violence along the border has skyrocketed ever since Mexican President Felipe Calderón decided to confront the illegal drug cartels that operate there .
Some 7,000 troops now patrol Juárez , a city of roughly one million .
Yet even militarization has not delivered the peace .
The reason is simple enough :
The source of the problem is not Mexican supply .
It is American demand coupled with prohibition .
It is doubtful that this will be acknowledged at tomorrow ’s meeting .
The drug - warrior industry , which includes both the private - sector and a massive government bureaucracy devoted to “ enforcement , ” has an enormous economic incentive to keep the war raging .
In Washington politics both groups have substantial influence .
So it is likely that we are going to get further plans to turn Juárez into a police state with the promise that more guns , tanks , helicopters and informants can stop Mexican gangsters from shoving drugs up American noses .
Last week ’s gangland - style slaying of an unborn baby and three adults who had ties to the U.S. Consulate in Juárez has drawn attention to Mrs. Clinton ’s trip .
The incident stunned Americans .
Yet tragic as they were , statistically those four deaths do n’t create even a blip on the body - count chart .
The running tally of drug - trafficking linked deaths in Juárez since December 2006 is more than 5,350 .
There has also been a high cost to the city ’s economy as investors and tourists have turned away .
Even with low odds of a productive outcome , though , Mexico ca n’t afford to write off tomorrow ’s meeting .
It is an opportunity that , handled correctly , could provide for a teachable moment .
I suggest that one or two of Mexico ’s very fine economists trained at the University of Chicago by Milton Friedman sit down with President Obama ’s team to explain a few things about how markets work .
They could begin by outlining the path that a worthless weed travels to become the funding for the cartel ’s firepower .
In this Econ 101 lesson , students will learn how the lion ’s share of the profit is in getting the stuff over the U.S. border to the American consumer .
In football terms , Juárez is first and goal .
Mexico has n’t always been an important playing field for drug cartels .
For many years cocaine traffickers used the Caribbean to get their product to their customers in the largest and richest market in the hemisphere .
But when the U.S. redoubled its efforts to block shipments traveling by sea , the entrepreneurs shifted to land routes through Central America and Mexico .
Mexican traffickers now handle cocaine but traditional marijuana smuggling is their cash cow , despite competition from stateside growers .
In a February 2009 interview , then - Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora told me that half of the cartel ’s annual income was derived from marijuana .
This is especially troubling for Mexican law enforcement because marijuana use , through medical marijuana outlets and general social acceptance , has become de facto legal in the U.S. , and demand is robust .
The upshot is that consumption is cool while production , trafficking and distribution are organized - crime activities .
This is what I called in a previous column , “ a stimulus plan for Mexican gangsters . ”
In much of the world , where institutions are weak and folks are poor , the high value that prohibition puts into drugs means that the thugs rule .
Mr. Medina Mora told me in the same 2009 interview that Mexico estimated the annual cash flow from U.S. drug consumers to Mexico at around $ 10 billion , which of course explains why the cartels are so well armed and also able to grease the system .
It also explains why Juárez is today a killing field .
Supply warriors might have a better argument if the billions of dollars spent defoliating the Colombian jungle , chasing fast boats and shooting down airplanes for the past four decades had reduced drug use .
Yet despite passing victories like taking out 1980s kingpin Pablo Escobar and countless other drug lords since then , narcotics are still widely available in the U.S. and some segment of American society remains enthusiastic about using them .
In some places terrorist organizations like Colombia ’s FARC rebels and al Qaeda have replaced traditional cartels .
There is one ray of hope for innocent victims of the war on drugs .
Last week the Journal reported that Drug Enforcement Administration agents were questioning members of an El Paso gang about their possible involvement in the recent killings in Juárez .
If the escalation is now spilling over into the U.S. , Americans may finally have to face their role in the mess .
Mrs. Clinton ’s mission will only add value if it reflects awareness of that reality .

New York forensic experts will start a major new search Monday through debris from the World Trade Center for remains of people killed in the 9/11 terrorist attack , officials said .
About 844 cubic yards ( 645 cubic meters ) of material recovered from the reconstruction site at Ground Zero will be combed for bones and other remains of the 2,752 people killed when hijacked airliners slammed into the Twin Towers on September 11 , 2001 .

“ That material is going to be sifted to see if there are any human remains , ” said Jason Post , a spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
“ We ’re taking every step we can to recover the remains of 9/11 victims . ”
Experts , including anthropologists , will hand check the material in the 1.4 - million - dollar operation , which could go on as long as three months at a closed location at a landfill on Staten Island .
Previous searches through the mountain of rubble from the World Trade Center , which collapsed as a result of the aircraft strikes , have already turned up 1,772 pieces of potential human remains , according to the mayor ’s office .
Many of those remains belonged to already identified victims .
The following video is a series of aerial photos of the Fresh Kills landfill , where an earlier forensic investigation of the 9/11 rubble was carried out .

Physicists in Austria say they have solved the conundrum of " ball lightning " , mysterious glowing spherical apparitions which baffled boffins have struggled to explain for centuries .
According to Josef Peer and Alexander Kendl of the University of Innsbruck , there is in fact no such thing as ball lightning in reality .
Rather , powerful magnetic fields created by ordinary lightning affect the brains of humans nearby so that they see things which are n't there .
According to Peer and Kendl 's calculations , a certain type of long - lasting repetitive lightning strike emits magnetic fields very similar to those used in transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) - a medical technique use to hotwire activity in the brain .
“ In the clinical application of TMS , luminous and apparently real visual perceptions in varying shapes and colors within the visual field of the patients and test persons are reported and well examined , ” says Kendl .
Thus the right kind of lightning strike nearby affects people 's brains , accounting for long - accumulated reports of mysterious " ball lightning " phenomena during thunderstorms .
Scientists have always struggled to explain just how these strange glowing spheres would be generated and sustained : it now appears at least possible that they are n't , in any physical sense .
Apparently an artificially induced image in the brain is called a " phosphene " .
Kendl adds :
“ An observer located within few hundred metres of a long lightning stroke may experience a magnetic phosphene in the shape of a luminous spot . "
The physicist says that this is much the simplest and likeliest explanation for ball lightning .
“ Contrary to other theories describing floating fire balls , no new and other suppositions are necessary , " he says , uncompromisingly .
The two boffins ' paper is to be published in the journal Physics Letters A .

Update 4/12/2010 : Now that the week of the 12th is upon us , let 's see how a quick stock check at the usual suspects turns out .
Due to most retailers taking pre-orders , everyone seems to be listing what cards they will be carrying .
As a result we 're seeing a lot of cards right now that show up as out of stock or on pre-order status .
Amazon for example has n't begun shipping any cards , while Newegg ( who as we noted in the original blog post was already shipping their first - arrivals ) and MWave have a mix of cards that are still awaiting arrival and cards that are genuinely sold out .
In any case the supply situation is such that cards have been coming in and going out of stock all day long .
When I started writing the first paragraph of this short update you could find both GTX 470s and GTX 480s in stock at MSRP , and now all that 's left are cards above MSRP .
Judging from Newegg 's data in particular , we should be seeing more cards arrive later this week but at this point it looks like most retailers have received a significant portion of their stock .
It 's worth noting that of the two cards , it 's the GTX 480 that 's the hard one to get .
Most of the day someone , somewhere , at some price has a GTX 470 for sale , but GTX 480s are a rare sight .
At this point we 're not sure whether this is a product of allocation with NVIDIA sending out more GTX 470s than GTX 480s , or if it 's a popularity issue since the GTX 470 performs so closely to the Radeon 5800 series .
More than likely it 's a combination of these two factors , which means if you want a GTX 480 you 're going to be doing some scouring .
April 2010 Video Card Prices Video Card Original MSRP Available Price Radeon HD 5850 $ 259 $ 299 Radeon HD 5870 $ 379 $ 419 Radeon HD 5870E6 $ 479 $ 499 GeForce GTX 470 $ 349 $ 379 -$ 399 GeForce GTX 480 $ 499 $ 539
As for pricing , it remains heavily retailer - dependent .
Amazon ( pre-order ) and Newegg have been pricing things at MSRP , while others like ZipZoomFly , MWave , and Best Buy ( backordered ) are priced above MSRP .
Consequently we 've seen Newegg sold out of non-overclocked cards most of the day , while ZipZoomFly and MWave have been able to maintain a few different GTX 470s ( and the errant GTX 480 ) in stock .
This leaves us in a middle of the road situation on pricing with some cards going for MSRP and some cards going above it , meaning you can either play the lottery for an appropriately priced card or pay more to get a card now .
This kind of scheme is economically efficient , but it ultimately distorts pricing and results in gouging .
In fact we 're surprised that anyone with stock is sticking to MSRP given what we 've seen over the last 6 months with the Radeon shortage , but unless demand drops off or NVIDIA sends even more cards we can't imagine MSRP pricing will last .
Ultimately this is n't so bad for the GTX 480 where the only card above it is the even less available Radeon 5970 , but this means that most GTX 470s are priced at nearly $ 400 and end up costing entirely too much for what they do .
There 's no sense in picking up a GTX 470 at anything but MSRP .
As for AMD 's response , Radeon 5850 prices have been holding flat at $ 300 , while Radeon 5870 prices have snuck up a bit in the past couple of weeks - if you want a 5870 right now , the average cheap card is a $ 420 affair .
None of this is surprising since NVIDIA only priced their cards competitively with AMD 's existing prices , so there 's absolutely no downward price pressure .
If prices do end up falling , it will be AMD moving their prices down to put pressure on NVIDIA , and right now there does n't appear to be an incentive for AMD to do this .
As some of our astute forum readers have noticed , NVIDIA ’s GeForce GTX 400 series have started showing up early .
Officially they have been and are still scheduled for a full retail launch next week , but for the past few days a few of them have been showing up in small batches at etailers .
We shot off a quick question to NVIDIA about the matter and got a response last night .
The gist of the matter is that NVIDIA started shipping the first retail GTX 400 boards to their partners last Saturday , which means that those partners with a fast turnaround time in boxing and air shipping have already managed to get them in to etailers ’ hands .
NVIDIA is n’t enforcing a hard launch date here , so everyone is allowed to sell their cards as soon as they can .
Even with this initial availability , NVIDIA is sticking to their official line that broad availability wo n’t be until next week .
This allows for all of their partners to catch up , since not everyone had such a fast turnaround time .
This also allows for larger batches to make their way in to etailers ’ hands , since larger batches are almost always sent via a slower method of shipping .
In any case , current availability should n’t be considered representative of what we ’ll see next week according to NVIDIA .
As for current availability and pricing , it ’s highly variable .
Some etailers are holding to MSRP and as such are quickly selling out , while other etailers are charging more than MSRP ( e.g. $ 400 for a GTX 470 ) and still have cards in stock .
The fact that anyone is charging MSRP right now is a good sign that pricing should n’t get too far out of hand , but we ’ll have to see how things go next week .
In the mean time if you ’re dying to have a GTX 400 card , you should be able to get a GTX 470 right now but you ’re going to be paying entirely too much for it .
We ’ll have more on this next week once the GTX 400 series reaches broad availability .
The head of the European Central Bank once again said today that a Greek default " would not happen " .
Every G20 official - in or outside the eurozone - will tell you the same thing : with markets as fragile as they are , it is unthinkable that a sovereign government would be allowed to default .
Investors and experts are thinking about it all the same .
In fact , looking at the economic programme the Greek government has signed up to , many veterans of past debt crises would say a debt restructuring was only a matter of time .
But it 's worth asking how - and when - it is done .
And how it would help .
As you 'd expect , there 's no rule book for countries seeking to default on their debt .
It 's not something the international system likes to encourage .
But it 's not as if it has never happened .
There have been 40 defaults by sovereign governments in the past 20 years alone , and more than 70 since 1980 .
Many of those governments were able to borrow again quite soon after - sometimes in a matter of months .
But only when they were able to do a deal with all - or nearly all - the bond - holders on how much of the debt would get repaid - and over how long .
Russia took less than two years to restructure its foreign debt after declaring a moratorium in August 1998 .
Creditors lost about half of the value of the principal .
A similar deal was done over the same period for Ukraine and its debt .
But as we know , Argentina in January 2002 was different : messier and much more drawn - out .
Offered only 30 cents on the dollar , some bond - holders are still holding out , eight years later .
Only now is the country able to talk about borrowing again on international capital markets .
Research by IMF economists ( The Costs of Sovereign Default , Working Paper October 2008 ) suggests the long - term cost of default for countries can be quite low : after a few years , governments do n't even pay much of a premium on world markets .
But the short - term cost to the economy can be huge .
That would certainly apply to Greece today .
Imagine the Greek government stopped paying interest on its debt tomorrow .
It would still have a primary deficit - excluding interest payments - of more than 8 % of national income , and it might not have anyone to borrow that money from .
That could mean more austerity , not less , especially if the country remained in the euro .
There would also be the collapse of the domestic banking system to consider , Greek banks being the largest holders of Greek sovereign debt .
And that 's before you get even to the costs of contagion for other countries , as investors wondered who would be next .
Many investors now think a Greek default - or debt restructuring - is inevitable at some point .
They may be right .
But it 's no soft option .
There are good reasons why European officials will keep saying it is unthinkable for as long as they possibly can .
Well today CONCACAF announced the group stage draws for the 2010 / 2011 Champions league :
RSL will be in Group A , facing Arabe Unido of Panama , the winner of Cruz Azul of Mexico vs. San Francisco also of Panama , and the winner of whoever ends up representing Canada vs. Motagua of Honduras .
Those preliminary matches will start between July 27th and 29th with the first legs , and complete a week later .
The group stage starts August 17th with each team in a group facing the other teams in both home and away matches .
So we could see RSL vs. Toronto or Vancouver as one of the matches ( hmm I wonder if this would work with a Seattle road trip if Vancouver wins ? ) .
Either way based on the teams that are in our group RSL should be able to advance out of this group as one of the top two teams .

Yes , I broke my own rules and used a “ breaking ” modifier for this story ( let me have my fun for once ) .
Here we have it , as the rumour mill suggested , Google has released the On2 VP8 video codec as open source ( royalty free , BSD - style ) , while also launching the WebM container format which combines a VP8 video stream with Vorbis audio .
Support for WebM has been enabled on YouTube ’s HTML5 beta , and you can download patches against ffmpeg as well as DirectShow filters for Windows ( Gstreamer plugins are labelled as “ coming soon ” ) .
Mac users are out of luck for now ; no QuickTime plugins have been announced yet .
Update : The WebM blog is now open – and the list of partners is pretty decent already .
It includes ARM , NVIDIA , AMD , Qualcomm , and many others .
Update II : VP8 will be baked into Flash .
Update III : The Opera labs version with WebM support has been released too , for Linux , Mac , and Windows .
The news has n’t been officially announced yet , but the WebM project ’s website has been launched today , coinciding with the Google I /O conference .
As you would expect , both Mozilla and Opera are part of the WebM project , meaning that Opera , Chrome , and Firefox will soon suppor the format out of the box .
You can already get your hands on Firefox and Chrome developer snapshots which support it , while an Opera beta is on the way .
The really , really good news is that Google is eating its own dog food : YouTube already supports WebM and VP8 , but probably not on all videos .
All you need to do is download one of the compatible browsers , enable the YouTube HTML5 beta , and append &webm=1 to the search URL .
“ A key factor in the web ’s success is that its core technologies such as HTML , HTTP , and TCP / IP are open for anyone to implement and improve , ” the project ’s FAQ reads , “ With video being core to the web experience , a high - quality , open video format choice is needed .
WebM is 100 % free , and open - sourced under a BSD - style license . ”
You can download patches to apply to ffmpeg , and Google has also made DirectShow filters available for Windows users .
There ’s also an introduction to the WebM VP8 codec SDK , and of course you can get your hands on the code .
Google is clearly taking on the MPEG - LA with this one , as can be read in the FAQ .
“ Some video codecs require content distributors and manufacturers to pay patent royalties to use the intellectual property within the codec , ” the FAQ reads , “ WebM and the codecs it supports ( VP8 video and Vorbis audio ) require no royalty payments of any kind .
You can do whatever you want with the WebM code without owing money to anybody . ”
This is very , very good news for the web , people .
The news has n’t been officially announced yet , so we ’ll have to wait for more details which will most likely come either today or tomorrow .
The WebM blog is still members - only at this point , but we ’ll obviously keep you all up to date on whatever happens is now open .
Microsoft and Apple can apply suction to it .

Today , President Obama visited Solyndra , Inc. in Fremont California – a solar panel manufacturer that is building a new facility ( and creating new jobs ) thanks to funding from the Recovery Act .
So far , construction of the new facility has created over 3,000 construction - related jobs and the new factory could create up to 1,000 long - term new jobs .
And this is just one of countless stories that together account for the up - to - 2.8 million jobs the Recovery Act is responsible for by the CBO ’s count .
During his remarks at the Solyndra facility the President stressed the importance reviving our economy by spurring innovation and creating new manufacturing jobs :
So we recognized that we ’ve got to go back to basics .
We ’ve got to go back to making things .
We ’ve got to go back to exports .
We ’ve got to go back to innovation .
And we recognized that there was only so much government could do .
The true engine of economic growth will always be companies like Solyndra , will always be America ’s businesses .
But that does n’t mean the government can just sit on the sidelines .
Government still has the responsibility to help create the conditions in which students can gain an education so they can work at Solyndra , and entrepreneurs can get financing so they can start a company , and new industries can take hold .
So that ’s why , even as we cut taxes and provided emergency relief over the past year -- we also invested in basic research , in broadband networks , in rebuilding roads and bridges , in health information technology , and in clean energy .
Because not only would this spur hiring by businesses -- it would create jobs in sectors with incredible potential to propel our economy for years , for decades to come .
There is no better example than energy .

The President also stressed the importance of investing in clean energy to help wean Americans off our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil and to compete in the international economy .
The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico underscored the importance of that goal .
But even as we are dealing with this immediate crisis , we ’ve got to remember that the risks our current dependence on oil holds for our environment and our coastal communities is not the only cost involved in our dependence on these fossil fuels .
Around the world , from China to Germany , our competitors are waging a historic effort to lead in developing new energy technologies .
There are factories like this being built in China , factories like this being built in Germany .

Today Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman participated in a ground breaking ceremony for Nissan North America ’s new advanced batter manufacturing facility in Smyrna , Tennessee .
The Department of Energy closed a $ 1.4 billion dollar loan with Nissan North America to retool their facility in Smyrna to build advanced electric automobiles and batteries .
Nissan has put that money to work by producing its all - electric vehicle , the LEAF , at its existing plant in Smyrna .
The loan will also help Nissan will offer 150,000 electric vehicles to fleet and retail customers annually .
Nissan has already created 250 jobs to retool the factory and anticipates the project may result in an increase of up to 1,300 jobs when full production is reached .

Sports radio in Calgary and a team 's marketing employee are saying EA Sports ' NHL 11 will feature teams from the Canadian Hockey League , the top tier of junior hockey in that country .

Although there is minor league hockey in North America , Major Junior hockey , as it's known , is played by 16 - to 20 - year - olds , and the majority of NHL players have seen some kind of action in in its three leagues .
So bringing in teams from the Ontario Hockey League , Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and Western Hockey League would deepen the game 's singleplayer career mode and diversify choices available in general manager mode .
The first word came from Dhiren Mahiban of CKNW - AM radio in Calgary , via Twitter : " EA Sports NHL 2011 will have a #CHL mode where you can play with teams from the #WHL , # OHL and # QMJHL "

Operation Sports then noticed an unconfirmed post on a Colorado Avalanche message board purporting to be from a marketing employee of the London ( Ont. ) Knights of the OHL .
" When I showed up for work and there was an email forwarded to me from my boss saying that EA Sports needs pictures of our home and away jerseys with all different numbers and the C's and A's because the OHL , WHL , and QMJHL are all going to be part of NHL11 . "

Important Update : Dilbert is gone !
blogging - 57 comments
Summary
I had to change the site name from “ Pointy Haired Dilbert ” to “ Chandoo.org ” .
While the change is triggered due to an email from Scott Adams , creator of Dilbert Strip , I have been mulling the change for a while and I think this is the right time for it .
I had a strange email in my inbox when I woke up on May 3rd .
The subject said “ From Scott Adams ” .
I was half - asleep at that time .
So I thought this must be an email from one of the readers or customers .
I opened it and read half way thru the mail before realizing that it was from Scott Adams , the creator of Dilbert Cartoon Strip .
I shook my head in disbelief and re-read the email a couple of times before I understood the message .
Scott said ,
Hi Chandoo , I ’ve been following your success for some time via my Google Alerts ( it
sends me all Internet references to Dilbert ) .
When you were small I was
ignoring your use of Dilbert and “ pointy - haired ” in your name , but now I
think we have to have this discussion .
Obviously there ’s a trademark issue with any commercial use of the name
Dilbert , as it is an obvious trade on the goodwill I created in the
trademark .
And even the pointy - haired part seems a bit unfair .
I have to have this sort of conversation to prevent “ dilbert ” from slipping
into the public domain .
I ’m sure you understand .
So with that in mind , can you suggest a solution ?
I like what you ’re doing ,
and would n’t want to impede your momentum , but a name change is due .
Scott Adams
Of course Scott is being very fair and sweet .
I never really thought my site would become even mildly popular .
But as the site grew I had an inkling of suspicion that something like this would happen .
But I brushed aside my feelings under the header of “ that is just insane ” .
At the moment I didnt know what to do .
I could n’t afford Dogbert , the evil consultant to advice me a name like “ Duhflushtech inc . ”
My immediate ideas for a new name for this blog were equally lame like ,
Six Pack Simpson
Pointy Haired Chandoo [ PHC ]
Excel @ Work [ already tested and found lame ]
Then it stuck me like a stroke of sumproduct .
Why not just call the site by what it already is – Chandoo.org .
After a few minutes , it made a lot of sense ,
The site url is Chandoo.org
People already see that in Google Search , Other blogs linking etc .
My nick name is Chandoo , so loads of people already call me that .
There would be very little confusion for a new visitor as they dont see the unrelated “ pointy haired dilbert ” on the site when they come looking for moving average calculations .
It would help me build brand Chandoo instead of borrowing it from Dilbert .
Then I emailed back Scott this ,
Hi Scott ,
Thanks for your email .
I am both thrilled and little worried to get this email .
But I totally understand your intentions and support you .
My idea is not to step on Dilbert ’s domain , but just a play with words .
I have a solution for this : * I will replace the “ pointy haired dilbert ” in my webpage titles , logo and future posts and just call it “ chandoo.org ” .
* I will have to keep the wording “ PHD ” , “ pointy haired dilbert ” in already written articles as it is too cumbersome ( there are over 1000 posts ) .
But this should not be a problem as the words are inside the posts and not part of title , page headers .
( removal of Pointy haired dilbert from titles is automatic ) .
* I will make an announcement explaining why the change is happening and have a sidebar link “ where did the dilbert go ? ” for a few weeks just so that people who visit once in a while do n’t feel lost .
… Thanks ,
So , What are the changes and how they affect you ?
The blog , forums and formula pages have new logos .
The look and feel of the site hasnt changed .
Just the logos .
Check them out to get familiarized with what is new .
The wording “ Pointy Haired Dilbert ” has been removed from most places on the site .
But there will be some references to it in past articles and content .
Try calling me Chandoo when you comment or refer to me .
You can of course call me PHD or pointy haired dilbert or even bumbling bumble bee as it is your choice .
But I would prefer Chandoo .
What has not changed and will not change :
The spirit of community .
We will continue to be a community of excel users who have passion , eagerness and a sense of humor .
The Feed URL for the site will remain http://feeds2.feedburner.com/
PointyHairedDilbert .
.
The facebook fan page url will remain http://www.facebook.com/pages/
Pointy - Haired - Dilbert - Chandoo/31468481118
[ I will try for a vanity url and see if the migration is possible ]
- Chandoo /31468481118
[ I will try for a vanity url and see if the migration is possible ]
My hair ( and the familiar logo of my hair standing up ) .
What do you think of the changes ?
I have been attached to the PHD so much .
It is hard to let that go .
I am sure I will make mistakes and refer to my blog as PHD when writing emails or replying to comments .
But I also see a lot of positives in letting the PHD go .
It will let me build brand Chandoo and keeps my site simple and clean .
PS : I named the site PHD because I was both an engineer and an MBA .
I was transitioning from Engineer to manager when I started this blog .
PPS : You have a rocking weekend .
I have more exciting and awesome excel stuff for next week , as usual .
Hello Awesome ...
My name is Chandoo .
Thanks for dropping by .
My mission is to make you awesome in Excel & your work .
I live in Wellington , New Zealand .
When I am not F9ing my formulas , I cycle , cook or play lego with my kids .
Know more about me .

Phantom island could use some help .
Please research the article 's assertions .
Whatever is credible should be sourced , and what is not should be removed .
A phantom island is an island that was or is believed to exist , but does not actually exist .
Phantom islands have appeared on maps during the entire history of cartography .
Legendary islands like Atlantis are not usually considered phantom islands , as their status is mythical , rather than due to errors in exploration or map making .
Causes for reports [ edit ]
Reports of phantom islands have several causes .
A common explanation is the misidentification of a genuine island .
Pepys Island , for example , was in reality the Falkland Islands .
Sometimes fog banks , icebergs or optical illusions are mistaken for real islands .
It is less dangerous to steer around nonexistent islands than hit uncharted rocks , so recording islands that might exist makes sense .
Sometimes islands that existed in the past have disappeared due to volcanic eruptions , tectonic activity , sea level rise , or erosion .
Some islands are just made up , for fraudulent or political reasons .
Phantom islands in pseudohistory [ edit ]
Occasionally phantom islands get a second life in theories claiming that islands or continents were discovered earlier than the date that is commonly accepted .
This is especially common for islands in the Northern Atlantic : maps depicting Antillia , Estotiland , Frisland , Bacalhau , Saint Brendan 's Island , Brasil and Greater Ireland have all at one time or another been considered evidence for a pre-1492 discovery of the Americas .
Occasionally such a theory may be true ; after all , it has now been decisively proven that Vinland , which was discovered and named by Vikings , is Newfoundland .
But more often than not such theories are way off and ought to be considered pseudohistory .
Gavin Menzies [ edit ]
A well known example is in Gavin Menzies ' 1421 : The Year China Discovered the World .
Menzies uses a 1455 Portuguese map that depicts the islands of " Antillia " and " Satanzes " as evidence that the Chinese reached the Americas in 1421 .
Menzies identifies these islands as Puerto Rico and Guadaloupe , despite the fact that Puerto Rico runs from west to east and not from north to south like Antillia , that both islands are depicted at most 2000 kilometers away from Europe , half the distance of Puerto Rico and Guadaloupe , and that the relative position of Antillia and Satanzes do not match those of Puerto Rico and Guadalupe .
Even further from reality , Erich von Däniken claims islands depicted on the 1513 Piri Reis map constitute evidence for extraterrestrial visits to the Falkland Islands .
Phantom islands today [ edit ]
Phantom islands are usually considered something of the past , but even today there are islands of which the existence is not satisfactorily defined .
Notable examples [ edit ]
The islands Maria Theresa and Ernest Legouvé , purportedly located south of the Tuamotu islands of French Polynesia , which were spotted in 1843 and 1902 , respectively .
It is now generally accepted that both islands do not actually exist , but they still appear on some maps .
Maria - Theresa ( sometimes called Maria Theresa Reef , Tabor Island or Tabor Reef ) was allegedly spotted by a New Bedford whaler called Captain Asaph P. Taber and is noted for its appearance in Jules Verne 's novels In Search of the Castaways and The Mysterious Island .
A 1966 radio broadcast from Maria - Theresa was later revealed to be a hoax .
Ernest Legouve Island or Reef is named after the French ship Ernest ‑Legouvé , whose captain allegedly sighted it . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Sandy Island aka Sable Island lies between Australia and New Caledonia , or rather it lay there on maps until someone attempted to visit it in 2012 .
It was first reported by Captain James Cook in 1774 , and from the late 19th century was regularly included in maps .
In fact , there are comparatively deep waters where it is supposed to lie . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Other examples [ edit ]
Other phantom islands in the same area are Wachusett Reef , Jupiter Reef and Rangitiki Reef. Wachusett Reef appears in the 2005 edition of the National Geographic Atlas of the World .
Another example is Kiribati's Filippo Reef , which probably does n't exist , but is nonetheless mentioned in the same edition of National Geographic 's Atlas . [ 5 ]
Bermeja " conspiracy " [ edit ]
Perhaps the most controversial contemporary example is Bermeja .
Bermeja is supposedly located in the Gulf of Mexico , north of Yucatán , at 22°33 ′N 91°22 ′W﻿ .
It has been reported on maps since the 17th century , but it has not been sighted since the 19th century , does not appear on even the oldest satellite photographs and a survey from the Mexican Marine Secretariat in 1997 did not manage to find the island .
The sea around Bermeja 's supposed location is 40 meters deep .
Bermeja's " disappearance " is controversial , since its existence is relevant for determining the maritime border between Mexico and the United States in the oil - rich Gulf of Mexico .
The case has spawned a conspiracy theory in Mexico , which claims that the CIA dynamited the island in the 1970s in an attempt to rob Mexico of part of its oil reserves .
This theory has been defended by several Mexican politicians and has been reported in various media outlets . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
According to the Mexican government , it is likely that the island disappeared either because of sea level rise or because of tectonic events .
Julio Zamora , president of Mexico's Society of Geography , suggested it was a fictitious entry deliberately inserted to stop rival nations using the map . [ 6 ]
For the Clinton - Zedillo treaty of 2000 , which fixed the maritime borders between Mexico and the United States , the island was considered not to exist .
If it had existed , the border would have been 100 nautical miles north of its current location .
Not fake but not there [ edit ]
Vordonisi , an island in the Sea of Marmara off the coast of Turkey , vanished in 1010 CE due to an earthquake , but its summit popped up again around 2013 with further seismic rumblings .
[ 8 ]
Graham Island aka Ferdinandea lies off the coast of Sicily and has appeared and disappeared multiple times due to volcanic activity . [ 9 ]
Some islands have disappeared due to global warming , including New Moore ( or Moor ) Island ( aka South Talpatti ) in the Indian Ocean , subject of a territorial dispute between India and Bangladesh . [ 10 ]
Q - I 'm someone who is a bit obsessive about values polling , I look at all of them that I can find , and what strikes me is that if the seats in the House of Commons were assigned to parties based on how their policies lined up with Canadian - stated values , the NDP would have a majority .
Why do we have a Conservative government when Canadian values actually line up so well with the NDP 's values and policies ?
Well , the first reason is that we have an electoral system that permits massive distortions of the public views when it comes to the results , the seats , and therefore the governance .
We 've had that for some considerable time , it 's just particularly evident right now when you have a government that in two successive elections could n't get less than 62 per cent of the public to vote against them .
Yet they end up with 100 per cent of the power ... 100 per cent of the executive power , and maybe something than just a little less than 100 per cent of the legislative power .
At the same time , they are transforming the judiciary with their appointments so they 're rapidly increasing their power in the judicial arm of government as well .
So that is why you need proportional representation and why we continue to fight for it and push for it .
I think the reaction to the prorogation showed that there is an appetite for considering these issues and I think that is great .
I love the grassroots nature of it .
It gave it more legitimacy I think .
So that is number one .
Number two , of course , you have the traditional governing parties that have alternated in and out , have had access to the support of the dominant forces in society .
In particular , the largest , most powerful corporate entities , the banks and the oil companies , who seem to be the one constant when it comes to those who benefit by government policies .
As the government alternates back and forth between red and blue they are tied to this notion that tax cuts and a shrinking capacity to do things together through our collective enterprises and public services is fundamental .
Finally , you 've got , in our case , you 've got a party that has been rebuilding since the populist impulse was split up in the early 90s with the creation of the Bloc Quebecois , on the one hand , and the Reform Party , on the other hand .
So suddenly you had three parties with a populist edge , so putting our party back into play and strengthening it and having it develop and mature in some important ways has been a project that I think I was given by the membership to do , and we 've had three elections in seven years to work at that and we 're making some progress .
Q - This is one of the things I 've written about , and I guess it is a criticism of the NDP , but I see as preoccupation with political tactics which comes at the expense of longer term strategy and political vision .
How do you respond to that criticism ?
I do n't think it 's correct .
I do n't accept the argument .
In fact , what we 've been working hard to do is to weave together the progressive elements and components of our country into a strong political force and that requires some pretty long - term thinking and I think that we have been engaged very much in implementing that .
Just to give one example that 's extremely important -- because it's been the blockage to our growth for the first 45 years of our party 's history -- which was figuring out how to translate our founding principle .
Which was that the people of Quebec constituted a nation within Canada .
That was a part of our founding positions in 1961 , weaving into real policy .
At our convention in Quebec City in 2006 , we adopted , by 90 per cent of the vote , a very comprehensive policy called the Sherbrooke Declaration , which really was quite a major transformation of the way in which our party operationalized federalism .
Reflecting principles that we 'd accepted but that we'd never turned into comprehensive policy framework .
Having done that , this then opened the door for us to get almost half of a million votes in Quebec in the last election .
Again , because we do n't have proportional representation that did n't translate into the seats we should have had .
But we did , on the other hand , get the first - ever Member of Parliament elected in a general election and we received more votes in Quebec in the 2008 election than we did in western Canada combined
Secondly , we took an extremely strong and unpopular position -- at least at first blush it seemed unpopular , on the war .
That was n't minor tactics -- that was major strategy and reflected who we are as a party and where I believe the majority of Canadians are .
Unfortunately , sometimes there is a lag [ laughs ] between when you take these strong and major positions , that one was also taken at the Quebec City Convention in 2006 , and when the public comes around to seeing that , ‘ Hey , you know , that makes sense , we identify with that position . '
Sort of like Tommy [ Douglas ] when he took his position on the War Measures Act , which was not a tactical move at all , it was a serious strategic decision that immediately resulted in a plummeting in support .
But it turned around to generate a growth of respect and ultimately support over the longer term .
I think our position on climate change was another very strong strategic move , where we worked to get through the House of Commons and successfully did , the first ever bill of any democratically elected government in the world , establishing the 80 per cent target by 2050 , with intermediate targets according to the UN science , prior to Copenhagen .
Unfortunately , because we have the senate , it never got around to putting the bill through and Harper called an election in 2008 and prevented that from being signed by the governor - general .
We then turned right around after the election and reintroduced it .
[ The NDP 's Bill C311 was subsequently passed in the House of Commons . ]
But these are major strategic moves that have been done in close consultation with civil society , that climate change bill was worked on very closely with the Pembina and the Suzuki Foundations .
Just like our position on the war , which was built on our relationships with civil society working around peace and disarmament issues , quite well documented in Steve Staples book around missile defence for instance .
Those kinds of building projects are why I believe we are now at 37 seats and likely to grow significantly in the next election .
Q - Do you think that in terms of where you 're at now in the polls that you will get beyond 37 seats ?
Polls are the last thing to change ... always the last thing to change .
I mean the other thing I would mention to people who offer that criticism , is where were you ( I 'm not speaking about you personally ) , where were the people who share this view that we 're just into minor tactics when the coalition was proposed and worked on .
I suggest people read Brian Topp 's book , I mean this is major .
This was a strategic attempt to give effect to the will of the Canadian people as expressed in elections and then frustrated by the lack of PR .
We 've been ready to move on that in three successive minority parliaments , all of which is documented there and in my own book .
Q - This partly based on casual conversations with people who , I essentially think , want the NDP to do better , but I 've heard the comment more than once about lack of vision .
Partly , of course , this is because you have a media that is either indifferent or hostile .
Well , if they 're watching for our vision to be expressed in the At Issue panel on CBC , then I would suggest that they need to do a little deeper thinking [ Laughs ] .
I mean , let 's face it , if you are counting on the news broadcasts to give an indication of what 's really going on , then what you are saying is you are willing to accept the proposition that a four - second sound bite on occasion ought to deliver the complete vision and perspective of a political party , because that is all they get .
That is why I write books .
That is why I make speeches .
That is why we put video on the website .
That is why we have 100,000 people on our e-news now .
We are building in the networking and social - networking world , so as to try and end the run of the massively concentrated media world that we have to deal with now , and to reach out in other ways .
I mean we 've never had so many people involved in our party in 25 years at the grassroots doing good stuff .
How do we get the former chief of the Saskatchewan First Nations [ former head of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations , Lawrence Joseph ] indicating to us that he wants to run for us in northern Saskatchewan ?
That kind of thing does n't happen if you are sitting around playing small minor , juvenile , tactical games .
I 'm very , very excited about this and when we see what is happening in Quebec and the kind of people we 've got coming to us and how we are growing there , I mean , we won the only seat in Alberta with a candidate who was running against the untrammeled , unlimited development of the tar sands .
That was a courageous and bold strategic decision .
Taking a big campaign jet and flying it from Stephen Harper 's constituency down to 3,000 feet over the tar sands , because they would n't let us bring the media in to look at the devastation of the pollution .
So I 'm excited about it , Murray , I 've got to tell you I 'm excited .
Q - It is interesting that in terms of leadership you 're now polling second to Stephen Harper .
I look at Harper and I can't quite figure why he is so popular as a leader when his policies are in such contrast to people 's values .
I think back to Ronald Reagan .
Most of the policies Reagan pursued were opposed by the majority of Americans and yet they still re-elected him , and in part it was because they said , well at least this guy believes something .
Is that part of Harper 's popularity ?
Well , Reagan went on a positive emotional appeal .
Harper goes on a negative emotional appeal .
It 's based on fear .
So he ends up with a base of support that responds to the notion that we should be fearful of one thing or another .
Fear provokes a certain kind of anger and a certain kind of response .
By the way , I think that is the reason why he hit a ceiling .
He tried to break through it with the piano performance and With a Little Help from My Friends and suddenly people said , ‘ Oh , maybe the guy is n't all about fear . '
Canadians are fundamentally not fearful people , in the majority , they 're hopeful people .
Q - In the last election you stated you were running to be prime minister and I 'm wondering what was the thinking behind that ?
I think the response of most people was ‘ well that is not going to happen , ' and maybe some skepticism that you actually believed that .
Would it not partly hamstring you in terms of allowing you and the NDP to be who you are , a force pushing from the left ?
If you 're running to be the governing party then does that not restrict you in terms of having to compete with the Liberals ?
Not at all .
In fact , most people , most Canadians except a certain small group that talks about this kind of thing , said : ‘ Well , what did you think you were running for ? '
I mean , that 's what I ran into .
‘ Well of course .
You 're running candidates in every riding , you 're laying out a full program , it 's carefully put together , you have a team , what are you running for if you 're not running for prime minister ? '
What it was , was an attempt to say there is an alternative to the same old parties that we 've had .
Q - People keep hoping that Harper will just go away , but wondering how we can get rid of the man .
Hope wo n't do that , unless you convert it into action and activism , which is what we are spending a whole heck of a lot of time doing .
Fortunately , we now have a model which , of course , can't be translated directly by any means , but it 's a model that has showed you can end run some aspects of traditional politics .
And that is what we saw flowing out of the Obama campaign with all kinds of new approaches and techniques that resulted in people getting involved , especially young people .
To me , it 's like going to the doctor , the first thing they check is your pulse .
If there is something wrong with that , then you have an issue .
Well , the equivalent of a pulse for democracy is the number of people that participate in something as basic as the election and we 're in free fall .
Something is wrong with our political system in that , people are engaging less and less .
You 've got hate - fests of attack on politicians of any stripe , and even the word politician is pronounced with derision and disdain by no matter who on these networks that are out there , including , sometimes , even the CBC .
People do n't want to be associated with failure , so why would you go out and vote for a politician given that by definition a politician is going to be a failure .
To the extent that you can drive down turnout then you have an opportunity to have those that are particularly fearful and therefore motivated to go out and vote ... they 're niche markets , that you can then really , really go after .
And this is Harper 's specialty and it is right out of [ George Bush 's advisor ] Karl Rove .
Q - There does seem to be this gridlock in federal politics .
It reminds me of the movie Groundhog Day , it 's just repeated day after day .
I 'm wondering if a new coalition agreement is possible with Ignatieff as Liberal leader ?
It would be necessary to go into the next election talking about a coalition so that you then have a mandate to pursue that once the election is over if the conditions are right .
What I 've always said is that we are willing to work with any party that is willing to work with us on things we believe should be accomplished .
That is how I go into elections and that is how I come out of elections and that 's how you operationalize them .
If you look at most of the European contexts , the parties run with their program and they try and convince as many people as they can to support their program and then they simply say , and Europeans of course know this after years and years of experience , that parties will come together in some combination after the vote .
That 's also happened here .
Stephen Harper was ready to combine with Gilles Duceppe ; in fact he relied on Duceppe for the first two major confidence cycles , the Budget votes in 2006 .
People forget who it was that sat out those votes and kept him in power .
It was the Bloc .
Q - Do you get a sense that the Liberals would be interested ?
Who knows ?
[ Laughs . ]
I thought we had it .
We even had the signature of every single one of them -- sent to the representative of the Queen .
I thought that was pretty solid .
But it sounds like the Bay Street bankers that met with Ignatieff had more influence than the broad sweep of Canadians that supported doing something right .
Ignatieff had a chance to be prime minister and he walked away from it .
Harper need n't be in power right now and that would have reflected , in fact , what the voters would have preferred in October 2008 .
Q - I wanted to touch on a few policy issues .
The Liberal and Conservative tax cuts , I know you know this intimately , have reduced government revenue by almost $ 80 billion a year .
That is twice as much as the current deficit .
You could pay off the deficit and have a national childcare and pharmacare program .
These cuts were so radical that we actually hear talk of tax increases , probably for the first time in 15 to 20 years .
Even two - thirds of the CEOs on Bay Street are saying we need tax increases on high - income earners .
I know the NDP has come out for a halt to further corporate tax cuts , but I 'm wondering if you 'll be coming out to call for a higher tax brackets for the wealthy and the super - wealthy ?
We 're analyzing the state of the government 's finances .
Of course , we are trying to prevent some of these very moves that you are describing from being made .
In fact , we moved in the House of Commons just three weeks ago that the corporate tax cuts for January 1 , not be implemented .
Unfortunately , we were unable to get the sufficient number of Liberals in the room to implement that , to have that motion adopted .
That is why it was a bit of a surprise two weeks later to have Mr. Ignatieff come out and say we should n't have more corporate tax cuts .
I mean the speeches they were making against that proposition just three weeks earlier were quite strong .
What you have to do is sit down and look at the state of the finances .
It is not possible to know now where precisely we are going to be .
We do believe that a strong system of cap - and - trade needs to be put into place , and that 's a revenue generator , a very efficient revenue generator in terms of economic transformation towards a greener economy .
We are talking about the importance of the CPP and the doubling of the CPP over a period of time , which will have some implications in terms of revenues .
Precisely what other proposals we need to bring forward is really always going to be a question of analyzing the state of the finances at the time an election actually happens , and laying out a program that is going to accomplish what we need to do step by step .
At the same time , be reasonable as far as where Canadians would like to see us go .
You make those judgments at the time and we do n't know when the election is going to be , so I do n't put out my election platform without having a clue about when the election is going to happen .
Q - I have n't heard the party call for decreases in defence funding -- or even a halt to the Conservative 's planned increases in that funding into the future .
The current defence budget is huge -- larger relatively than at any time since the height of the Cold War yet we have no identifiable enemies and our involvement in Afghanistan is coming to an end .
On the matter of budgets , we are constantly reviewing and revising our budget proposals and our campaign proposals to be prepared for whichever comes first .
We do want Canada 's defence policy to focus on UN Peace Keeping Missions such as the Congo and others rather than the war in Afghanistan .
Canada 's role in the UN effort is pitiful even as Canadians want us to play an active role as peacekeepers in the world .
Q - The Conservatives have let it be known that they may make public financing of parties an election issue .
Is the NDP satisfied with the current system or are there any changes you would like to see to the current system ?
We think it is vitally important to keep big money out of politics .
Public financing is what allows for a leveling of the playing field , so you are able to bring ideas forward that do not have the support of the most powerful economic forces .
We are certainly very strong defenders of that concept .
We think it was a legacy left by Jean Chrétien , which was particularly important .
Q - As usual , Mr. Harper makes these calculations pretty carefully and given the amount of money they are able to raise , their assumption obviously is that they could do away with the public financing and they would hurt less than the other political parties .
I think that there is a bigger picture here .
He would eliminate restrictions on third - party campaigning and that is where the big money would go .
Then those who have groups with access to multi-million - dollar third - party type campaigning , like big pharma , big oil , big banks , etcetera , etcetera , would spend all kinds of money .
Q - The Liberals , and of course they say lots of things , so we 'll see what they say in their campaign .
But it is interesting that Ignatieff a couple of months ago said that they would pursue a national childcare program regardless of the current deficit .
Now , what is your sense of that , would you support such a national childcare program ?
Not only would we support it , we have put legislation before the House to implement it .
It went almost to third reading in the last Parliament and it's before the House again .
With a complete program all defined as legislation , it is in the form of the Canada Health Act .
It respects Quebec 's unique situation because of the role of education in Quebec being so critical .
So much so that the Bloc Quebecois voted for it .
The Bloc Quebecois has never voted for a new social program in Canada , the only one and the first one they voted for was the NDP 's childcare bill .
That is why the Code Blue people are so thrilled about it .
On the other hand , when we look at the Liberals on childcare , I remember the '93 Redbook , which said they would absolutely bring it in if the economic growth exceeded 3 per cent -- 50,000 spaces per year , new spaces , each and every year that the GDP rose more than 3 per cent .
The GDP rose more than 3 per cent throughout their entire tenure and they never brought it in .
We kept saying to Ken Dryden , when that last minority Parliament got moving , we said : ‘ Put it in legislation , do n't do one - off agreements by province , because it simply wo n't work .
It can then be abandoned by any future administration without a vote of parliament . '
Which is of course , precisely what happened .
Those idiots !
They were so full of their own view about how things should be done that they did n't lock it in , in legislation .
This is why Tommy and New Democrats and ultimately Ed Broadbent and Bill Blakey insisted that Medicare had to be enshrined in the Canada Health Act .
It could n't be left as just a fiscal set of agreements -- and that is what we argued about childcare .
That is why we have written a National Housing Act -- Olivia has brought it before , it is based on all the work we did back in the 90s -- which for the first time ever it has gone through second reading and is now at a standing committee .
So we 've got a National Housing Act written the way it should be .
We 've got a Post Secondary Education Act , modeled on the Canada Health
Act but for the federal government 's role in post secondary education .
We will have is a complete legislative framework so that the moment that we 're able to put a progressive administration into place , the work will already have been done .
Q - One of the most emotional issues facing any political leader is the issue of Israel and the Palestinians and a lot of people are feeling it is hard to have a debate in Canada because people feel intimidated , often by charges of anti-semitism if they express support for the Palestinians .
What is your party 's position on the recent decision by Israel to build 1,600 more units of housing in East Jerusalem , which of course , Palestinians claim is the capital of their future state ?
We have a deep concern about that .
We have constantly said that this growth of settlements exacerbates the set of obstacles that stand in the way of what we believe ought to happen , and what so many others believe ought to happen .
Which is a comprehensive negotiation of a two - state solution .
So naturally that is a deep concern .
Even Stephen Harper 's government has said that they are opposed to that .
Q - The NDP has been proven correct on many issues , but rarely gets credit in the media , as you pointed out .
The Globe and Mail 's Lawrence Martin said that until there is a newspaper in the NDP 's corner their ideas wo n't get validated .
With the crisis in the media sector now , do you think it would be smart for progressive organizations and unions to perhaps actually buy a newspaper ?
That 's a very interesting question .
I used to believe that it was essential , but with the decline of newspaper readership and the rise of new media and electronic forms of communication it may be possible for those new forms of being in touch , particularly those that involve engagement with people , opportunities for back - and - forth .
The other thing is political parties would have a tough time going out and rustling up tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to buy a newspaper .
The union movement , I suppose , could look at that kind of idea and I know that different individuals have , from time to time .
Frankly , there are so many challenges right now in front of working people and their organizations , they 're just being attacked on every front , it 's very difficult to look at that kind of an option .
You 've got organizations like rabble .ca and others that are out there engaging people in new ways .
We 've got these new tools and I think that their effectiveness was dramatically shown by the response to the prorogation .
Q - Any final remarks you 'd like to make ?
I 'll just finish with this comment .
People ask me about these different things and it's the old story about how you build a house .
I want to build a brick house and that means when the shifting winds happen the house does n't fall down and you have to start again .
I think in the past we neglected Quebec and were never quite able to figure it out .
Although Ed came close , we had a robust Quebec organization in 1987 , but we just were n't able to break through .
When I became leader I said : ‘ We 've got to fix this .
It 's like trying to build a house with a quarter of the foundation missing .
You can't do it and I 'm asking for your mandate to start building this part of the foundation and then we 'll start building on top of that . '
I believe that we are well on the way with that project now .
That means this house ain't gonna get blown over anytime soon .
The whole truth about Alfredo Lim 's political issues .
[ digg- reddit - me ] How did the GOP oppose Obama during the campaign ?
They raised fears that he was a radical , Marxist , leftist , Communist , Socialist , Muslim , Arab who hates America .
How did the GOP oppose Obama ’s stimulus plan ?
They claimed it did n’t include tax cuts ( which it did ) which are the most effective way of stimulating the economy ( which most research does n’t support ) that it has n’t helped the economy at all ( something which virtually all mainstream economists disagree with ) , and that it was part of a socialist government takeover of the economy ( which it ’s not ) .
How did the GOP oppose Obama ’s health care plan ?
They claimed there were death panels ( nope ) , government mandated euthanasia and abortion ( nope and nope ) , coverage for illegal immigrants ( not at all ) , secret socialist indoctrination of children ( huh ? ) , and that it represented a government takeover of 1/6th of the economy ( so far from being true ) that would increase the deficit ( when it actually reduces the deficit more than any bill in history ) .
How does the GOP oppose net neutrality ?
They claim it would enable the government to control political speech on the internet – likening it to the Fairness Doctrine for radio ( which is so far from what it actually does ) .
How does the GOP oppose cap and trade legislation ?
They call it a massive redistribution of wealth ( which it ’s not ) and based on thoroughly debunked lies ( which is rather dangerous bullshit ) .
How does the GOP oppose Obama ’s national security policies ?
They claim he is deliberately weakening America ( when his focus has been on strengthening America ) , abandoning all of Bush ’s policies ( which he is not , to the disappointment of many progressives and libertarians ) , along with many other debunked claims .
How then does the GOP oppose financial reform ?
They are claiming that it “ allow [s ] endless taxpayer - funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks ” and creates a “ slush fund ” for future bailouts .
And here ’s the brilliant part : while trashing Wall Street and the bailouts that saved the big firms , they are simultaneously promising Wall Street and the big firms that they will block the reforms Wall Street does n’t want in return for massive campaign contributions .
They are following — almost to the letter — Republican pollster Frank Lutz ’s proposed strategy to rake in the dollars from Wall Street for blocking any reform while railing against bailouts and how Democrats are too soft on the banks .
The best way to oppose something is to pretend it ’s something it ’s not .
Absolutely brilliant strategy .
Too bad it ’s evil .
The policies they are attacking include a FDIC tax on the banks to create holdover money to allow regulators to go in and dismantle the company .
Contrary to some cushy authority to bailout big firms , Senator Mark Warner describes the process being created by the financial reforms in an interview with Ezra Klein :
“ Resolution , ” Warner continued , “ will be so painful for any company .
No rational management team would ever choose resolution .
It means shareholders wiped out .
Management wiped out .
Your firm is going away .
At least in bankruptcy , there was some chance that some of your equity would ’ve been retained and you could come out in some form on the other side of the process .
The resolution that Corker and I have tried to create means the death of the company .
The institution is gone . ”
The financial reform bill is far from perfect — but it ’s a good bill and nothing at all like what the Republicans are describing it as .

How does international adoption work ?
It ’s governed by a patchwork of local , national , and international rules , which makes the system vulnerable to abuse and corruption .
Working through an array of international and private agencies , U.S. families adopted 13,000 foreign - born children last year — more than the rest of the world combined .
Many of these adoptions go smoothly , and result in thrilled new parents and in children whose futures are immeasurably brighter than they would have been otherwise .
But international adoption can also be a legal no - man ’s land , in which prospective parents shell out tens of thousands of dollars only to be subject to delays , uncertainties , and demands for more money .
The demand for foreign - born children by childless American couples has opened the door to some truly horrific abuses , including bribery , kidnapping , and the selling of babies .
Is n’t that illegal ?
In theory .
But in practice , Western adoption agencies often rely on in - country facilitators , including orphanage directors and “ child finders ” who are paid for each adoptable child they produce .
This system provides incentives to kidnap and sell children .
Several years ago , six employees of a French charity were charged with kidnapping 103 â€¨children in Chad , many of whom turned out to have families , so they could be adopted .
In Chennai , India , a toddler was kidnapped outside his home , and by the time his grief - stricken parents tracked him down to a nearby orphanage , he had disappeared into the international adoption pipeline .
David Smolin , a â€¨law professor in Alabama , adopted two children from an Indian orphanage only to learn later that the children had been placed there by their illiterate ( and very much alive ) mother , who had expected them to be educated at the orphanage .
“ Credulous Westerners eager to believe that they are saving children are easily fooled into accepting laundered children , ” Smolin says .
“ For there is no fool like the one who wants to be fooled . ”
Is the entire system rotten ?
No .
There are many ethical agencies , and several unscrupulous operators have been closed down in recent years .
Still , horror stories keep cropping up .
A few years ago , Guatemala was sending an average of 270 babies a month to the U.S. — far more than were in the nation ’s orphanages .
Local “ finders ” were being paid up to several thousand dollars for each baby they produced .
Catriona Aldridge , who adopted three children from Guatemala , says she was motivated by giving them a better life , but now feels she may have contributed to the exploitation of desperate families .
“ We need to improve the situation for people — or women in particular — in these developing countries , ” she says .
After reports of stolen babies and of families being coerced to give up their children , Guatemala placed a moratorium on international adoptions in 2008 .
But when one country cracks down , the “ market ” simply heats up someplace else .
Where are the hot spots today ?
China , Ethiopia , and Russia were the top sources for U.S. adoptions in 2009 .
But Russia may no longer permit adoptions to the U.S. In April , Torry Ann Hansen of Shelbyville , Tenn. , put 7 - year - old Artyom Savelyev , whom she adopted last year , alone on a plane back to Russia .
She pinned a note on him that said : “ I no longer wish to parent this child . …
I was lied to by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability . ”
Hansen later said that the boy , who had spent most of his life in an orphanage , was violent and angry , and threatened to burn her house down .
Russian President Dmitriâ€ ¨Medvedev called the incident “ a monstrous deed ” and put a freeze on U.S. adoptions .
Could the mother in that case be prosecuted ?
Tennessee law - enforcement officials said that while Hansen showed “ some bad judgment on the way she turned this child back , ” she apparently did n’t break any laws .
When adoptions originate abroad , laws are murky or non-existent .
And as celebrity adopters like Madonna and Angelina â€ ¨Jolie have demonstrated , with money and connections , most obstacles can be overcome .
In 2006 , Madonna adopted a child from Malawi ; it turned out the boy had a father who had n’t signed off on the adoption .
And one of Jolie ’s children was reportedly acquired with the assistance of a hospital in Ho Chi Minhâ€¨ City , Vietnam , that the U.S. State Department considers a source of “ unreliable ” birth certificates .
More than 75 countries have signed on to an international treaty , known as the Hague Convention , that establishes standards aimed at protecting both children and adoptive parents .
But enforcement mechanisms are weak .
Will anything change ?
There are signs that the international adoption market has been tightening , reflecting increased scrutiny .
And as nations such as China and Russia grow more prosperous , they are less eager to send children overseas .
U.S.â€ ¨adoptions of Chinese children , for instance , dropped from nearly 8,000 in 2005 to about â€ ¨3,000 in 2009 .
But critics say international adoptions will remain suspect as long as the demand for children exceeds the supply , and as long as money is a driving factor .
“ You can get away with buying babies around the world as a United States citizen , ” said Richard Cross , a senior agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
“ It ’s not a crime . ”
Protecting Haiti’s ‘ orphans ’
When self - styled American missionaries attempted to take 33 Haitian orphans out of the country following the Jan. 12 earthquake , the effort exposed a grim reality .
As it turned out , many of the “ orphans ” actually had families .
Even before â€ ¨the quake , some 380,000 Haitian children were living in crowded orphanages that serve as a last resort for impoverished parents who feel they can no longer care for their children .
The missionaries may have sincerely believed they were saving children , but at the same time , say prosecutors who charged them with kidnapping , they did nothing to determine if the kids had families that would not have wanted them whisked out of the country .
While the most serious charges have now been dropped , child advocates hope the negative publicity will lead to tighter adoption controls .
“ Even in an emergency , ” says State Department official Michele Bond , “ it ’s important to do things carefully and methodically and not to scoop up the children and take them away . ”
Following a campaign by BDS organizers , Elvis Costello has announced that he will be canceling his upcoming shows in Israel .
It does n’t sound like it was an easy decision for him , and he has posted a thoughtful statement about the decision on his website :
Then there are occasions when merely having your name added to a concert schedule may be interpreted as a political act that resonates more than anything that might be sung and it may be assumed that one has no mind for the suffering of the innocent .
I must believe that the audience for the coming concerts would have contained many people who question the policies of their government on settlement and deplore conditions that visit intimidation , humiliation or much worse on Palestinian civilians in the name of national security .
I am also keenly aware of the sensitivity of these themes in the wake of so many despicable acts of violence perpetrated in the name of liberation .
Some will regard all of this an unknowable without personal experience but if these subjects are actually too grave and complex to be addressed in a concert , then it is also quite impossible to simply look the other way .
An aspiring blogger who says she was investigating a company for possible fraud must reveal the sources behind statements she posted online , a New Jersey appellate court ruled last week , in a rare case examining who has the right to legal protections extended to journalists .
The court ruled that Shellee Hale , who has been sued for defamation , is not a journalist and is therefore not protected by the state 's shield law .
" Simply put , new media should not be confused with news media , " wrote Superior Court Appellate Judge Anthony J. Parrillo .
The case involves a high - profile 2007 computer security breach at a software company called Too Much Media .
Following the breach ,
Hale accused the company or an employee of fraudulent acts against its customers within the online adult entertainment business .
TMM sued Hale for defamation , and sought to depose her to identify the sources she claimed were behind her allegations .
Hale countered that she was a journalist , and asserted protection under New Jersey 's shield law , which generally protects reporters from being forced to identify their sources .
The claim was unusual since Hale 's accusations were posted to the comments section of a message board , and not her own blog .
But she was in the process of setting up her own website , which she said would offer the public information about " scams , fraud , technological issues " in the adult entertainment industry .
Hale argued that her accusations were based on interviews and extensive research she 'd conducted , and therefore her sources should be protected .
A judge denied her application for a protective order , and Hale appealed .
A three - judge appellate panel upheld the lower - court ruling ( .pdf ) on Friday , saying that merely claiming one is a reporter or journalist is not sufficient to gain protection under the shield law .
In order to receive the protection privilege , Hale must have been " actively affiliated with and engaged in any of the ' aspects of the news process , ' " the court noted , quoting the state law .
Contrary to her claims ,
Hale had " produced no notes of conversations , meetings or interviews with contacts or sources , " the court found .
And contrary to her assertions that she was producing news , evidence showed she was merely assembling the writings and postings of others for her website .
She also failed to demonstrate an " adherenece to any standard of professional responsibility , " such as editing or fact - checking , and did n't identify herself as a journalist to people she spoke with and assure them their identity would remain confidential , " a key factor in the application of the newsperson 's privilege , " Parrillo wrote .
The decision is the second state appellate case to examine whether a blogger should have the same protection as a traditional journalist .
In 2004 , Apple filed a complaint alleging that Apple Insider and another blog operated by Jason O'Grady had illegally obtained and published trade secrets about an upcoming product .
Apple sought to obtain e-mail that would help determine the identity of the blogger 's source .
O'Grady filed a motion for protection against discovery , but the court denied the motion , saying the site had involved itself in the unlawful appropriation of trade secrets .
But an appeals court ruled in 2006 that the blogger was protected under California 's reporter shield law , though the case ultimately turned on a federal law that protects stored communications .
WASHINGTON , April 26 , 2010  --
The Army 's top medical officer today sharply denied a report that mentally wounded soldiers are being treated in " warehouses of despair , " calling the newspaper characterization " poor " and " almost 180 degrees of the truth . "
The New York Times said it based its front - page Sunday story on interviews with more than a dozen soldiers and health professionals stationed at the Army 's Warrior Transition Unit at Fort Carson , Colo. , quoting one active duty soldier who said his year - long experience at the WTU was " worse than being in Iraq . "
Instead , Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker argued , most soldiers in the Army 's 35 transition units are satisfied with the way they are treated .
He said the overall satisfaction rate is 81 percent , and at Fort Carson , it is closer to 90 percent .
" It 's wholly unrepresentative of the totality in the context of what we 've done for warrior care , " Schoomaker said of the New York Times story .
But some relatives of soldiers who have lived at the Fort Carson unit , designed to ease wounded soldiers in either returning to battle or to civilian life , say the paper 's depiction is accurate and that the military personnel and civilian case workers stationed at the facility are ill - trained and ill - equipped to deal with the mental wounds soldiers suffer on the battlefield .
" I do n't think , really , that these people are qualified to handle these guys , " said Ashley Nowicki , whose husband , Sgt. Keith Nowicki , committed suicide in March 2009 after spending nearly a year at the Fort Carson WTU awaiting a medical discharge for post - traumatic stress disorder following his second deployment to Iraq .
While doctors and nurses are stationed at the transition units , the Warrior Transition Command is headed not by a career military physician , but by an artillery officer .
The unit at Fort Carson is led by an intelligence officer .
" It needs to be run by medical personnel -- period , " said Sally Darrow , the mother of a soldier who attempted suicide during his nearly year - long stay at the unit .
" He was depressed .
He was feeling hopeless and helpless and they were n't doing anything but babysitting , " Darrow said of her son , Pvt. Michael Crawford .
" He never went to therapy .
There was nothing .
They just gave him medicine , " Darrow said .
" I 've got a bag full of medications that they want my son to take . "
Relative of Soldier at Fort Carson WTU : You Can't Punish Them
Nowicki told ABC
News that during her late husband 's time at the Fort Carson unit , he only saw one psychologist and one psychiatrist , each every other week .
Darrow complains that soldiers like her son are routinely disciplined by noncommissioned officers for minor infractions that they are more apt to commit because of their mental or physical injuries .
" They are soldiers , but they have short - term memory loss .
They 're getting scolded and their pay cut and in trouble for losing their keys , or showing up to formation late because they can't get out of bed , " Darrow said .
" You can't punish them for stupid stuff like that . "
But the Army says it must treat wounded soldiers as soldiers .
" We want our soldiers to show up at accountability formation so we know that they 're safe , " Lt. Col .
Andy Grantham , commander of the Fort Carson transition unit , told reporters Monday .
Crawford , who suffers from traumatic brain injury and post - traumatic stress , was recently reduced in rank from specialist to private for overstaying leave and using marijuana , the Times reported .
He now lives with his mother in Michigan as he awaits his medical discharge .
Crawford told the New York Times that the WTU is " just a dark place , " and that " being in the WTU is worse than being in Iraq . "
" In Iraq , he was with his comrades and they had a purpose , " his mother explained .
" They had each others ' backs and they were on a mission .
In the WTU , you are isolated [ from your fellow soldiers ] .
They do n't know each other .
Half of them are in their rooms and they 're not coming out . "
Army officials , briefing reporters at the Pentagon Monday , made no pledge to initiate any further investigations of the transition units , beyond an inspector general review that is currently ongoing .
Army officials , briefing reporters at the Pentagon Monday , made no pledge to initiate any further investigations of the transition units , beyond an inspector general review that is currently ongoing .
But Brig .
Gen. Gary Cheek , who leads the Army 's Warrior Transition Command , suggested the publicly aired complaints might provoke " some adjustments to the program , " particularly when it comes to dealing with mentally wounded soldiers who isolate themselves in their rooms .
" Even for a weekend , for a soldier that does n't have something to do , I mean , that can be a problem , " Cheek said .
Not to be outdone by those 73 Democrats who told the Federal Communications Commission this week not to go forward with its plan to reclassify ISPs as common carriers , over twice that number of Republicans have sent the agency a letter on Friday with the same message .
" We write to encourage you not to proceed down your announced path to reclassify broadband service as phone service under Title II of the Communications Act , " they wrote .
That sort of move " should be made by Congress . "
The letter is signed by Joe Barton ( R - TX ) , ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , and Cliff Sterns ( R- FL ) , ranking member of that committee 's subcommittee on the Internet .
169 more Republicans co-signed the missive .
The statement notes that in the past , the agency has defined broadband as an " information " rather than a " telecommunications " service , " outside the reach of the Title II common carrier rules . "
It adds that Section 230 of the Communications Act declares it the policy of the United States " to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services , unfettered by Federal or State regulation . "
" Whether the country should stray from that legislative posture — which has produced 200 million broadband subscribers over the last ten years , is a matter best left to Congress , " the letter concludes .
Whether a " legislative posture " produced all those broadband lines is another interesting question to ponder .
In any event , now both Democratic and Republican foes of net neutrality rules insist that it is Capitol Hill 's job to make this call , rather than the FCC's .
So be it , declared four top- ranking Congressional Democrats on Monday — they announced hearings to consider proposals to rewrite the Communications Act.
Congress " will invite stakeholders to participate in a series of bipartisan , issue - focused meetings beginning in June , " they promise .
Club Penguin Rewritten Fan Club
Soon you will be able to explore our Club Penguin Rewritten Fan Club website !
Eircom , Ireland 's largest ISP , has decided to snuffle up to the entertainment industry 's hindquarters and become the first European ISP to actively practice " 3 strikes " : if you are accused ( without proof ) of three acts of copyright infringement , they will take away Internet access from your entire household for a year .
Ireland is the first country in the world where a system of " graduated response " is being put in place .
Under the pilot scheme , Eircom customers who illegally share copyrighted music will get three warnings before having their broadband service cut off for a year .
The Irish Recorded Music Association ( Irma ) , whose members include EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner , reached an out - of - court settlement with Eircom in February 2009 under which the telecoms company agreed to introduce such a system for its 750,000 broadband users .
HARARE , Zimbabwe —
An incident at a Harare art gallery last week starkly illustrated the problems besetting Zimbabwe ’s power - sharing government .
A photo exhibition showcasing gory pictures of victims of violence in the country ’s 2008 elections was confiscated by the police , later returned to the organizers after they secured a court order and then hidden when the police threatened a second raid .
The police wanted to see written permission from everybody featured in the 65 pictures .
In the midst of this tussle , Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai formally opened the exhibit .
A photo of him with a swollen face after a savage beating at a police station in March 2007 formed part of the display .
Tsvangirai , who had instructed the minister responsible for the police to uphold the court order and return the pictures , said he felt sorrow not anger when he heard of the attempt to stifle the display .
“ Anyone who believes they can deny the truth of our past is delusional , ” he said .
“ Covering up old wounds can only make them fester .
The seizure of the photos in Harare did not happen in isolation .
In Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second city , police last week jailed artist Owen Maseko , for exhibiting paintings depicting the Gukurahundi massacres , in which Mugabe and the army 's Fifth Brigade are blamed for killing more than 10,000 Ndebele civilians .
Maseko was held in jail for four nights before being released on bail .
The art gallery owner was jailed for one night and the paintings have been seized .
The Mugabe government is giving a clear message .
It does not want the public to see any evidence that suggests it has committed any human rights abuses .
At the Harare art gallery , Tsvangirai spoke out against Mugabe 's heavy - handed attempts to prevent Zimbabwe from knowing its own history .
“ There is nothing new in this story , ” Tsvangirai pointed out .
“ It reminds us of the trauma we went through as a nation .
The reason why we are having this inclusive government is because of our desire to end the suffering of our people and say never again should we see a repeat of this . ”
Tsvangirai said when he goes around the country he hears cries for revenge .
“ Forgiveness cannot happen in a vacuum , ” Tsvangirai said .
“ There can be no real forgiveness without justice . ”
Tsvangirai's remarks are timely .
A delegation comprising ministers from both sides of the government of national unity is due to go to Europe where it will call for the removal of sanctions .
This is Tsvangirai ’s main concession to Mugabe and he is pressing ahead with it despite resistance from within his own ranks .
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change is currently fashioning a parliamentary motion to name and shame those responsible for electoral violence .
Mugabe ’s Zanu - PF members walked out when the roll - call of the accused was read out .
Mugabe is in denial .
Despite South African President Jacob Zuma ’s recent bid to revive the stalled inter-party talks , Mugabe says he wo n’t negotiate so long as sanctions remain in place .
His detractors argue he is solely responsible for those sanctions and has it within his power to get them removed .
But Zimbabwe ’s 86 - year - old leader , cantankerous at the best of times , refuses to make the changes necessary for the European Union and United States to contemplate lifting the measures .
The issue , both in the controversial photo exhibit and the larger national debate , is how Zimbabwe will come to terms with the political violence and the human rights abuses that have taken place over the past 10 years .
A human rights commission headed by a respected academic was sworn in Wednesday .
But not a single person responsible for the 2008 violence , documented in the art gallery exhibit , has been brought to justice .
Instead of pursuing the perpetrators of the political violence , the police continue to arrest civic activists .
And Mugabe ’s iron grip on the public media intensifies by the week .
The president does n’t believe he lost the 2008 election .
It was stolen from him he claims .
Nor does he believe reports of torture .
According to a recent account by MDC election official Dennis Murira , " Cries from Goromonzi : Inside Zimbabwe ’s Torture Chambers , " there has been no accountability by the state .
“ We want to know who was supplying all the unmarked vehicles and who was commanding them , ” Murira says .
“ There should be total disclosure and truth - telling . ”
In particular , he says , those who perpetrated crimes of torture and rape should be brought to justice .
“ We cannot continue sweeping these crimes under the carpet , ” Murira says .
One victim of Mugabe ’s thugs was prominent MDC activist Tonderai Ndira .
His wife Plaxedes says she continues to live a nightmare with nobody prosecuted .
“ I do not know what these people did to my husband , ” she said .
“ I do not know the pain and suffering he went through and I do n’t know what his last thoughts were .
But I want whoever murdered my husband to face justice . ”
Her plea will probably go unheard .
Investigations by the new human rights body are likely to be curtailed by an amnesty for those involved in the violence of the period from 2000 to 2009 which included the murders of farmers David Stevens and Martin Olds and MDC activists Talent Mabika and Tichaona Chiminya , among others .
Their killers walk free and are known to the authorities .
Sadly , those seeking justice for their loved ones will have to wait a while yet .

Sarah Palin Quotes Thomas Jefferson but Mangles Construct of Freedom of Press
The press fawned over Sarah Palin when she arrived at last night ’s Time 100 Gala , stepping over themselves to get a photo of the Palin , who has not yet held a press conference or taken unscreened questions from the press .
She took this opportunity to “ set the record straight ” , which in Sarah Speak , amounts to another one - way pronouncement comprised of her version of reality , much like her ghost - written Facebook scolds .
The Daily Intel reported :

“ I did talk to a couple of reporters already and said that a bunch of stuff that they write is bogus , but we had a great conversation about it and we agreed to disagree on a lot of things , ” she ( Palin ) said .
She chastised the press that they need to be writing the “ truth ” and then went on to clear up “ the bogus reports about how much money I supposedly make , ” she said .
“ I have a business .
I run a business with my speaker ’s fee . ” ”
As usual , Sarah offers no proof to back up her claim and offers no rebuttal to the indisputable evidence offered against her claim , such as her speaking contracts with the Mall of America and the Stanislaus Foundation .
This is the same Sarah Palin who was found guilty of abusing her power and violating Alaska ethic ’s law , but who announced to the press that she was glad to be “ cleared of any wrong - doing there . ”
Palin has also been called to task for fraudulent tax returns , fleecing the tax payers of Alaska for several unethical rides , and had her Alaska Fund Trust frozen by the legislative board .
Politifact named Palin Liar of the Year in 2009 for her Death Panels lie .
In other words , Palin is not an honest person .
Palin tends to hide behind one - way communications with the public , which she calls talking “ without the filter of the media ” , but which remove the possibility of the press ever being able to question her about anything .
This is not a new stance of hers , even though she tries to portray it as a reaction to the alleged poor treatment she received in the 2008 campaign .
In fact , Palin has initiated press black outs since she was the mayor of Wasilla , during which time the local paper accused her of behaving as if she were Queen , not an elected official in America .
Palin used her toast to further establish her limited comprehension of freedom of the press , “ I want to make a toast to all at this press event who agree with Thomas Jefferson , who said that our liberty depends on the freedom of the press , ” she said .
“ So I want to lift a glass to those who defend that freedom .
Our finest , the men and women in uniform who defend that freedom , our Constitution , and our exceptional way of life in America . ”
Palin ’s use of Thomas Jefferson is particularly hypocritical and disingenuous on the subject of freedom of the press .
The truth is that Sarah Palin is terrified of the press , and that ’s why she does n’t take any unscreened questions , hold press conferences , or take interviews with any but the most friendly hosts whom happen to be her co-workers at a network which admits it is nothing but a PR extension of the Republican party .
Sarah mangled her two big interviews with Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric in 2008 , and has not faced the press since then .
The McCain campaign covered for her , and under the guise that the best defense is a good offense , accused that the press of being “ sexist ” .
They followed this up with the poutraged announcement that Palin would not deign to give interviews until the press showed “ deference ” to her .
Notice how the reference to Palin as royalty is a repeating theme , one I daresay Thomas Jefferson would not have appreciated from an elected official .
The press is not supposed to be kind , show deference , or pave the way for candidates or government officials .
The press has a much different job , as prescribed by the Founding Fathers ( whom Palin can not name ) .
According to Wikipedia , “ Thomas Jefferson wanted to unite the two streams of liberalism , the English and the French schools of thought .
His goal was to create a government that would provide both security and opportunity for the individual .
An active press was essential as a way of educating the population .
To work freely , the press must be free from control by the state .
Jefferson was a person who himself suffered great calumnies of the press .
Despite this , in his second inaugural address , he proclaimed that a government that could not stand up under criticism deserved to fall . ”
The differences between Palin and Jefferson are vast .
Thomas Jefferson did n’t scold the press for attacking him or hide from the press .
He understood that the press needed to criticize leaders in order to keep their power in check .
Since she quoted Thomas Jefferson , let ’s look at some more Jefferson quotes and see how they apply to Sarah Palin .
“ [ This is ] a country which is afraid to read nothing , and which may be trusted with anything , so long as its reason remains unfettered by law . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Joseph Milligan , 1816 .
ME 14:463
Palin could n’t name one newspaper she reads .
“ The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people , the very first object should be to keep that right ; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter .
But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Edward Carrington , 1787 .
ME 6:57
Palin used her power as governor to publicly call for “ backlash ” against bloggers and constituents who filed ethics complaints in Alaska .
“ The only security of all is in a free press .
The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed .
The agitation it produces must be submitted to .
It is necessary , to keep the waters pure . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Lafayette , 1823 .
ME 15:491
Palin wanted to be President so she could have the Department of Law ( sic , one assumes she meant the Department of Justice ) go after anyone who crossed her .
“ I am … for freedom of the press , and against all violations of the Constitution to silence by force and not by reason the complaints or criticisms , just or unjust , of our citizens against the conduct of their agents . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Elbridge Gerry , 1799 .
ME 10:78
Why Palin does not talk to the press or take unscreened questions :
“ Our citizens may be deceived for awhile , and have been deceived ; but as long as the presses can be protected , we may trust to them for light . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Archibald Stuart .
1799 .
And lastly , on Palin ’s job at Fox and refusal to take interviews with anyone who does n’t work at Fox :
“ The most effectual engines for [ pacifying a nation ] are the public papers … [ A despotic ] government always [ keeps ] a kind of standing army of news writers who , without any regard to truth or to what should be like truth , [ invent ] and put into the papers whatever might serve the ministers .
This suffices with the mass of the people who have no means of distinguishing the false from the true paragraphs of a newspaper . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to G. K. van Hogendorp , Oct. 13 , 1785 . (*) ME 5:181 , Papers 8:632
Thomas Jefferson was prophetic ; seems as if he almost saw Sarah Palin coming and went to great pains to warn us about the dangers of a person who tries to stifle freedom of the press .
One ca n’t help but wonder when the mainstream media will get over fawning over their Cash Cow Princess and start doing their jobs as agitators and protectors of liberty .
Note :
In 2009 , the countries where press was the most free were Finland , Norway , Ireland , Sweden and Denmark .
The United States currently ties for 20th on the list with the UK .
Figuring out how to get out of debt is one of the most freeing things any person can do with their finances .
The problem is that so many people do not see how to make their dream of a debt free life a reality .
According to a 2015 study on American debt , the average American household was more than $ 130,000 in the hole last year .
Amazingly , $ 15,762 of that amount was comprised of credit card debt – the worst kind of debt anyone can have .
Of course , other types of debt can hurt our finances , too .
Collectively , Americans owed $ 1.06 trillion on auto loans , $ 1.23 trillion in student loans , and $ 8.25 trillion on mortgages in 2015 .
Some of this debt was planned for and is still considered “ good debt , ” it still takes a toll on our finances – and our lives .
But , how did it get this way ?
Sadly , we are programmed to take on and accept debt from the moment we are born .
Starting from childhood , we are tempted with a barrage of television ads for cars , boats , and luxury items we can easily finance through any number financial products and loans .
“ Twelve months – same as cash ” is a phrase we all heard repeatedly growing up .
Ca n’t afford something ?
Hey , that ’s okay .
Just keep up with your loan and you ’ll be fine .
Visit a car dealership and the first question you ’re asked is how much you can afford to pay each month – not what you can afford to pay over all .
And the same is true nearly anything you can buy – from clothing to furniture .
Ca n’t afford it today ?
Just open a store credit card and you can pay it off later , they ’ll say .
Want to go to college ?
Just sign on the dotted line and you can borrow the money you need .
You might have to pay it back for ten , twenty , or even thirty years , but it will all be worth it , right ?
How to Get Out of Debt
If you ’re struggling to make ends meet or hoping for a life with less stress and worry , you need to learn how to see debt in a brand new way .
Instead of seeing debt and credit cards as the easiest way to afford what you want , you should start seeing debt for what it really is – a curse that stands between you and your lifelong goals .
There are numerous ways to get out of debt , and not everyone needs to choose the same path .
For some people , a slow and steady pace will work just fine .
But for others , the desire to get out of debt is so great that they will do anything to speed the process along .
The very first step anyone should take is to sit down with all of their bills and banks statements in order to figure out how much they owe and to whom .
Sometimes taking a comprehensive look at all of your debts is the easiest way to figure out where you should start .
And regardless , no matter what , the first step out is debt is coming to grips with exactly how much money you owe .
You may not like what you see , but you ’ll have to deal with it either way .
Credit card debt can be crippling .
Obtaining a personal loan with a lower interest rate to pay off credit card debt could be a great option .
Once you have confronted your debts , there are several strategies you can use to dig yourself out :
Try the debt - snowball method .
The debt snowball method for debt repayment is often touted as the best and most efficient way to become debt - free .
If you choose this option , you ’ll start the process by listing all of your debts in order from the smallest balance to the largest .
Once your debt reduction spreadsheet is ready , you ’ll create a budget that accounts for making minimum payments on all of your debts except for the smallest one .
When it comes to your smallest loan balance , you ’ll pay everything you can towards it until it ’s gone .
As each small balance is paid off , you ’ll move down the list , throwing all of your extra funds at the smallest balance and making minimum payments on the rest .
Over time , your small balances will be wiped off the face of the Earth , leaving only your largest balances behind .
Without forced payments on your small balances , however , you ’ll be able to snowball your payments towards your remaining , larger loans and get rid of them at a much faster pace .
The biggest benefit of the debt snowball method is that you ’ll get a lot of “ small wins ” early , and reduce the number of monthly payments you ’re making at a much faster pace .
Derek from LifeandMyFinances.com has a very helpful debt snowball calculator you should check out if you ’re interested in this method .
Take on the debt avalanche .
The debt avalanche works similarly to the debt snowball but takes a slightly different approach .
Instead of prioritizing your smallest balances first , you ’ll list your loans and balances by their respective interest rates instead .
Each month , you ’ll pay as much as you can towards your highest interest debt while making minimum payments on everything else .
Over time , your high interest debts will be paid off , leaving only low interest debts .
Month by month , you ’ll continue attacking all of your balances until they are gone – and gone for good .
While you may pay on some loans longer with this method , using the debt repayment plan of paying off high interest debts first ( instead of your smallest balances ) will save you more money in the long run .
Pay off debt faster with a 0 % APR credit card .
It can be difficult to accept the fact that a credit card might be the solution to credit card debt , but hear me out .
In reality , certain types of credit cards , 0 % APR and balance transfer credit cards , offer introductory offers that can help you save money and get out of debt .
Related : Best 0 % APR and Balance Transfer Credit Cards
With balance transfer credit cards , you ’ll get 0 % APR for anywhere from 12 – 21 months .
If you transfer several or all of your high interest balances over – then use your introductory period to absolutely destroy your debts – you ’ll save money on interest and become debt - free at a much faster pace .
When you ’re not forced to pay interest on your balances , every penny you pay goes directly towards the principal of your loan .
If you ’re thinking a balance transfer might actually work for your financial situation , here are some details on one of the best balances transfer cards on the market today :
Discover it® – The Discover it ® is another top balance transfer card that has taken the market by storm .
With this card option , you ’ll get 0 % APR on transferred balances for a full 18 months .
In addition , you ’ll also earn 1 point for every dollar you spend on the card , along with 5 points per dollar spent on the first $ 1,500 you spend in categories that rotate every quarter .
You can redeem your points for cash back or gift cards , and this card also comes without an annual fee .

Consolidate or refinance your debts .
By refinancing certain loans , you may be able to get a better deal and save money in the process .
With private student loans , for example , it can make sense to refinance with a different lender to get a loan with a lower interest rate and better terms .
If your current private student loans are charging higher interest rates than you believe you could get elsewhere , make sure to connect with SoFi or LendEDU .
Here ’s a review of SoFi if you want to learn more about how they can help .
You can also consolidate your high interest rate credit cards with a personal loan .
Consolidating your debts can help you get on a structured payment plan to help you get out of debt faster .
Debt consolidation loans are amortized over time ( similar to a mortgage ) and you ’ll end up paying less interest versus paying minimum payments on your credit cards .
Both online student loan providers can help you determine whether you could , in fact , get a better deal with a debt consolidation loan and get that student loan debt out of your life much faster .

the mortgage on your home began before 2008 , you may also be able to save money by refinancing your home at today ’s low rates .
While starting your loan over may extend your repayment timeline , having a lower monthly payment can free up cash to pay down other debts .
If you are able to refinance at a much lower interest rate , on the other hand , you might be able to get a fifteen - year mortgage for around the same monthly payment as your current , thirty - year loan .
If that ’s the case , you should at least consider that option to get out of debt faster .
By and large , the best option for your finances depends on how much debt you have , what kind of debt you feel comfortable carrying , and your individual goals .
Debt Settlement
If you are way behind on many debts and are unable to pay them off , you may be able settle your debts for a much smaller amount .
To do this , you will need to have a lump sum payment that you can offer the lender .
This works particularly well with old credit card and consumer debt .
You can also go through a debt settlement company , but you will pay more by using them .
With any type of debt settlement program make sure you get the agreement in writing and keep all receipts so that no one can come back later and accuse you of not paying off the debt .
Drastically cut your expenses .
If you ca n’t seem to get ahead , you ’re probably spending more money than you should most months .
If that ’s the case , it can pay off to drastically hack your monthly expenses to free up cash .
If you ’re not sure where to start , get out your bank statements from prior months to figure out where your money has been going thus far .
Are you spending a lot of money dining out at restaurants ?
Are your trips to the mall hurting your bottom line ?
Are your car payments killing your budget ?
The easiest way to hack your spending plan is to start with the low - hanging fruit .
While you ’re trying to pay down debt , stop dining out and start cooking at home .
Quit destructive habits like smoking if you can – or at least cut down .
Take a close look at your grocery budget , too .
If you ’re spending a lot of money on food each month , focusing on cheap and easy meals for a while can help you cut back .
Also , look at your “ discretionary bills , ” and consider cutting them out of your life .
If you ’re paying a lot for cable television , smartphones , entertainment , or subscriptions , it can pay off to cancel those services while you focus on paying off debt .
Just remember , any amounts you cut from your budget need to be thrown at your debts in whatever order you see fit .
If you end up spending that money elsewhere in your budget , you are n’t really helping yourself .
Get a part - time job or pick up a side hustle .
Once you have figured out the best way to pay off your debts and cut your spending , the other way to speed up your journey is to pick up a side hustle or take on a part - time job .
By earning income through additional labor – or through passive means – you can earn more cash you can use to pay down debt faster .

If I Receive a Large Sum of Money Should I Put it All Toward Debt ?
This is a great question for people who are just starting to pay off their debt and come into an inheritance or other windfall .
What is important is that we set ourselves up for success not just paying off debt .
Make Sure You Have a Savings Cushion
The question involving windfalls , and particularly inheritances , is almost always between paying off debt or investing .
I would suggest that there is a third option that ca n’t be overlooked in a lot of cases .
Before you either pay off debt or invest for the future , the first thing you need to do is to create a cash cushion for the present .
One of the biggest reasons for financial stress – and even for the inability to achieve long - term financial independence – is a lack of liquidity .
The absence of any kind of liquid savings forces you to rely on debt any time there is a cash shortage .
It does n’t take much imagination to realize that an absence of savings is a surefire recipe for a lifetime on the debt treadmill .
Unfortunately , it starts early with most people .
Because they never have a basic savings account , credit dependency becomes a lifestyle .
Debt can suck the life out of your finances , because it represents a perpetual drain on your income .
In addition , having enough savings to cover your living expenses for a few months will do more to reduce financial stress in your life than just about any other single strategy .
It eliminates worry over an unexpected expense , or even a temporary loss of a job .
For all of those reasons , my recommendation would be to first make sure that you have enough money in a savings account or money market fund to cover your living expenses or at least three months .
That will give you the breathing room that need to do everything else .
The Case for Paying Off Debt
Using an inheritance to pay off debt is usually a can ’t - miss strategy .
That ’s because the rate of interest that you pay on debt is just about always higher than what you can in an interest - bearing account .
For example , if you ’re paying 20 % on your credit card debt , but you can earn no more than 1 % in a savings account , you ’ll be losing 19 % per year if you put the money into savings , rather than toward paying off your credit cards .
Still another factor is income tax .
Interest earned is taxable , while interest paid on consumer debt is not tax deductible .
That means that even if the spread between interest on debt and interest on savings were closer , the tax imbalance would continue to work against you .
Some financial advisors recommend that you eliminate consumer debt , particularly credit cards and other unsecured lines of credit , before you even begin investing .
While I do n’t necessarily believe that advice applies in all cases , it ’s still a sound strategy .
After all , the elimination of a debt with a 20 % interest rate effectively translates into an investment that pays 20 % guaranteed !
There ’s also an imbalance in regard to rate of return .
For example , the interest rate that you pay on debt is usually locked in .
But the return that you earn on your investments is not , at least in the case of equity investments , like stocks and mutual funds .
In fact , those asset values can drop in a market decline , while your debt level will only fall to the extent that you make payments to reduce it .
Then there ’s the point that by paying off debt , you free up your income for other purposes , including savings and investments .
It ’s often true that people who have a lot of debt are never able to save and invest .
By paying off debt , you will be in a position to do just that , and that can change your financial life for the better forever .
You really ca n’t go wrong with paying off debt .
The Case for Investing the Money
A strong case can be made for investing an inheritance .
This is especially true if you currently have no investments , and do n’t have any history of having them .
Sometimes the money from a windfall can jump start you into investing .
You get a basic nest egg to invest , and then you start adding periodic contributions to the account .
The investment then grows steadily , through a combination of continuing contributions and investment returns .
Long - term , this is a sound strategy .
Your wealth will grow along with the size of your investment portfolio .
As you become wealthier , it ’s entirely possible that your debt problems will eventually become smaller .
That is , the amount of your investments can outstrip the size of your debt .
When it does , you ’ll be in a position to both pay off your debt , and still have investment assets for continued investing .
This can be especially true if the investing is being done through some sort of tax - sheltered savings , like an IRA , Roth IRA , or even a 401 ( k ) plan .
The fact that you have an inheritance can even free up more of your paycheck to contribute to an employer - sponsored plan .
In a tax - sheltered plan your investment value grows even faster , because there is no tax liability to reduce your rate of return .
This is a way to build your investment worth quickly .
And it goes without saying that it creates the kind of long - term financial stability that can improve your entire situation .
My Recommendation for Using a Windfall With Debt
Every circumstance is a little different , but in most cases , I would suggest a person choose the following – in order :
Set up a savings cushion .
The first recommendation is that you put enough of the windfall into a savings account or money market fund to cover at least three months of living expenses .
The savings cushion will give you the room you need to maneuver to seriously attack paying off her debt .
Use the balance of the inheritance to payoff debt .
Obviously setting up the savings cushion will leave her with even less money to pay off her debt .
But it would also leave her in a stronger financial position .
By using the remaining balance to pay down her debt , you will also lower her your debt payments .
Any savings from those reduced payments should be applied to paying off the credit cards sooner .
You should also look to find any other ways to either reduce your spending or increase your income to pay off the debt completely .
Begin investing only when the debt is paid off .
Investing for the future has a lot of advantages , but in Katie ’s particular situation I think that her priority has to be centered on improving her current circumstances .
If you invest money immediately , you risks losing some of the money – without improving her situation .
But if you create a savings cushion and pay off your debt first , you will be in a better position to throw everything you have at investing later on .
Interview with Jason Larkin – A Debt Survivor
Jason Larkins found himself being suffocated under $ 110,000 of debt at the early age of 23 .
He could have given up , filed bankruptcy , crawled under a rock and pretend it did n’t happen .
He did n’t though .
He made a commitment to pay if off and has currently paid off $ 60,000 of it .
Here ’s his story ….
First of all for those that do n’t know you , tell us a little bit about your background and why you started your blog .
Well , my name is Jason Larkins and I ’m a financial advisor with a Registered Investment Advisor firm located in Kansas City , MO .
The decision to become a coach / advisor really spurred from my personal struggle , and eventual successes , with money .
After a lot of pressure from one of my close friends , I started my blog , WorkSaveLive , in November 2011 .
After much thought and contemplation , I could n’t ignore the reality that having a blog would extend my reach and ability to impact thousands of peoples ’ lives – why only help 500 people a year when you can get thousands that visit your site on a monthly basis ?
What first caught my attention was your tweet of how you were able to pay off such a large amount of debt in a relatively short amount of time .
Can you talk about some of the reasons that led to you getting into so much debt ?
During my “ younger ” days ( yes , I ’m still only 27 ) I viewed myself as just a normal person .
Much of how I learned to manage money was through witnessing what my parents did as I was growing up , and seeing what my friends and others around me were doing at the time .
This lack of true financial education : knowing how to budget , understanding the importance of living on less than you make , and saving for the future , led to making some extremely stupid financial decisions such as :
Going to an out - of - state school to play football ( despite any scholarships )
Spending far more than I made ( taking friends out , partying , and eating out for every meal )
Having no understanding of priorities ( choosing to go out rather than paying my rent on time )
What was your “ aha moment ” that made you realize that your debt had gotten out of control ?
I ’ll preface this with : I know that many people reading this will be shocked about how dumb someone can be , but I ’m comfortable with what I ’ve learned and where I ’ve come so being brutally honest does n’t bother me .
I ’ll also willfully acknowledge that I was extremely stupid and stubborn at the time .
Despite receiving multiple collection calls a day , having a bank account that was negative for 30 days straight ( thank goodness I had another one ) , and being so afraid and stressed out that I did n’t know what to do , my ‘ AHA !’ moment did n’t come until :
A night that I took my girlfriend at the time ( wife now ) to eat at the Cheesecake Factory .
I had done a pretty good job of hiding all of my struggles from her , but in the middle of dinner I received a call from my roommate notifying me that our rent check had bounced .
I was responsible for paying all of the bills : the roommate would give me her portion of the money ( terrible idea at the time ) and I would “ pay ” the bills .
Who would n’t trust a roommate that was making $ 50,000 + / year at 21 and lived a life that appeared to be to be that of someone with no financial problems ?
So , realizing that I now had a negative balance in my OTHER checking account , I just looked at my girlfriend and told her the mess I was in .
I did n’t really want to borrow the money from her so I offered to ask the Cheesecake Factory if I could do the dishes for the night , but she ended up paying for dinner and loaning me $ 1,000 on top of that .
Since that day everything has changed .
Once you had the aha moment what steps did you implement to begin the get out of debt process ?
The first step was simply learning to get on a written budget and limit my spending .
At that age I thought I was invincible because I made quite a bit of money , but the reality is that I still had bills to pay and I could n’t keep living the lifestyle I wanted .
Dave Ramsey loves to say that finances is 80 % behavior and 20 % knowledge and I ’m a perfect example of that .
Budgeting is n’t hard .
Managing money well is REALLY SIMPLE !
The problem is the person you look at in the mirror .
It ’s the unwillingness to make sacrifices , to be disciplined , and to tell people “ NO ! ”
That ’s the difficult part and that ’s why so many of us fail .
In my upcoming book I talk about having a battle buddy .
Someone that supports you in all your endeavors .
How important was it having a battle buddy in getting out of debt ?
I do n’t know if I would have ever been able to do this on my own .
I dated my wife for 4 years and we ’ve now been married for 2 1 / 2 .
She ’s seen me at my worst and she ’s been with me through the best .
Despite our progress , we ’re certainly not at the end of our journey and even to this day it ’s vitally important to have somebody that ’s willing to tackle the mountain with me ; to encourage you when you fall and to be your cheerleader when you succeed .
What were some of the hardest obstacles that you faced in trying to pay off all your debt ?
There have been , and will continue to be , many obstacles .
Shortly after that Cheesecake Factory dinner I decided to make a career move and take a job making 50 % less than what I had been .
Talk about a tough time : I obviously did n’t know how to limit my spending when I was making around $ 60 k so thinking I could live off of $ 30,000 was rather scary .
However , after I had got on a strict budget I realized I could make the sacrifices necessary to drop down to $ 30,000 / year .
It was extremely challenging and the budget was very tight ( considering all of my debt payments ) but it worked out !
Our obstacle today is continuing the grind that getting out of debt is .
When you start $ 110,000 in the hole ( with the majority of the debt being student loans ) , the only way to get out is to sacrifice for a LONG period of time .
It ’s been 5 - 6 years now and we still have a few more to go .
Did you allow yourself to celebrate any milestones in the debt paying off process ?
The first year and a half that I was on “ the plan , ” there was no play or celebrations : no eating out , no vacations , no movies , concerts , or other entertainment .
It was all business .
It took me a little while but I eventually realized you ca n’t live like that forever , so we have scaled back our intensity and live life while still being responsible .
Over the past 6 years we ’ve : paid cash for two cars ( an old beater and two weeks ago we bought a 2011 Camry ) , we paid cash for our wedding , wedding rings , honeymoon , and we ’ve gone on two vacations in addition to that as well .
What advice would you give to others that are in a similar situation but feel hopeless that they ’ll never be able to actually pay all their debt off ?
Especially when you have a 2nd mortgage you ’re trying to pay off .
The remedy for hopelessness is progress and seeing that there is a light at the end of the tunnel .
I ’ve done some of the dumbest things a person can do , and I knew nothing about managing money , creating a budget , or living on less than you make .
If I can do it , then anybody can .
( That is n’t intended to sound arrogant or any other way somebody wants to misconstrue that ) .
It starts with getting on a budget and creating a plan .
I firmly believe that a budget is the foundation to establishing a solid financial plan .
Do n’t Let Debt Stand in the Way of Your Dreams
These days , living with debt is the norm – not the exception .
Nearly everyone you and I know is struggling with some form of debt .
Worse , most people are letting it hold them back from their dreams .
The best thing you can do for yourself – and your finances – is to pay down debt and avoid it like the plague .
Try not to keep up with others , and instead , build an enjoyable and realistic lifestyle you can actually afford .
Debt may be normal these days , but you do n’t have to be .
Dare to be different , and you ’ll be much happier – and much richer – in the long run .
Have you ever paid down debt ?
How much , and how did you do it ?

May 15 , 2010 --
The tremendous success of the April 19 - 22 World People 's Summit on Climate Change and Mother Earth Rights held in Cochabamba , Bolivia , has confirmed the well - deserved role of its initiator — Bolivia 's President Evo Morales — as one of the world ’s leading environmental advocates .
Since being elected the country ’s first Indigenous president in 2005 , Morales has continuously denounced the threat posed by the climate crisis and environmental destruction .
Morales has pointed the figure at the real cause of the problem : the consumerist and profit - driven capitalist system .
Morales is leading a powerful Indigenous movement pushing change in Bolivia and the region , which raises restoring harmony with nature as one of its key banners .
This revolutionary movement , with Indigenous and peasant organisations in the forefront , has pushed the traditional Bolivian elite from power through a combination of electoral battles and mass insurrections .
It has begun the struggle to create a new “ plurinational ” Bolivia — based on inclusion and equality for Bolivia ’s 36 Indigenous peoples .
There is an immense sense of Indigenous pride and empowerment in Bolivia , a country whose original inhabitants were traditionally excluded .
This revitalised Indigenous pride was a key feature of the Cochabamba conference , reflecting the important role of the region ’s Indigenous and peasant movements in environmental struggles .
The conference ’s final declaration contained a strong emphasis on “ the recovery and strengthening of the knowledge , wisdom , and ancestral practices of Indigenous Peoples ” as an alternative to the destructive capitalist model .
Vice - minister Raul Prada said the conference represented the start of a “ world revolution of Vivir Bien ” .
Vivir Bien is an Aymara indigenous concept that means “ living well and not at the cost of others ” .
Imperialism
Together with these elements of Indigenous “ cosmovision ” , the declaration included a strong anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist sentiment , again reflecting the mood of the summit .
It argued that , “ for there to be balance with nature , there must first be equity among human beings ” .
It squarely denounced “ developed countries , as the main cause of climate change ” , calling on them to assume “ their historical responsibility ” .
Imperialist capitalism , benefiting First World multinational corporations , has not only intensified divisions between rich and poor within countries and environmental destruction .
It has also entrenched divisions between developed and underdeveloped countries .
Having carved up the world among them , imperialist countries such as the United States , European countries and Australia have used their domination over Third World countries to keep them underdeveloped .
The economies of underdeveloped countries have been geared towards extracting raw materials for the benefit of the economies of the imperialist nations .
This gearing of Third World nations ’ economies to providing cheap raw materials for export , at the mercy of market prices often manipulated by speculators , rather than seeking a rounded internal development , helps keep these countries in a state of permanent dependency and poverty .
Perhaps no country demonstrates this system better than Bolivia .
Bolivia 's legacy of dependence
Four hundred years ago , the Bolivian mining town of Potosi was the third - largest city in the world .
Millions of tonnes of silver were extracted — helping finance a large part of Europe ’s industrial development .
Today , thousands of cooperative miners work Potosi ’s hollowed out silver mines in sub -human conditions to eke out a basic living .
Bolivia , whose resources made Europe rich , is South America ’s poorest nation — its economy dependent raw minerals and gas exports .
Breaking this dependency is a key challenge for the Bolivian government — and brings with it many difficulties .
In the 2005 election campaign , now vice - president Alvaro Garcia Lineras summed up this dilemma when he said Bolivia ’s choice was “ industrialisation or death ” .
The Morales government has reclaimed state control over gas and mineral reserves and nationalised 13 companies involved in gas , mining , telecommunications , railways and electricity .
This increased state intervention means the public sector has increased from 12 % of gross domestic product in 2005 to 32 % today .
With the 2006 nationalisation of gas reserves and signing of contracts with private companies in the sector more favourable to the state , the hydrocarbon sector alone has dramatically increased its contribution to the state budget from US $ 678 million in royalties in 2005 to $ 2 billion last year .
This extra revenue has allowed the government to increase social spending , particularly through new benefit payments to pensioners , families with children in school and pregnant women .
An estimated 2.8 million people out of Bolivia ’s population of 9 million receive one of these new payments .
All of the macroeconomic indicators show important improvements in Bolivia ’s economy .
Last year , Bolivia had the highest rate of economic growth in the region .
Having maintained a budget surplus for the past five years , the government has ensured its international reserves have reached a record US $ 9 billion .
Despite this , the government has largely proven unable to make serious headway with its industrialisation program .
Several of its key mining projects face serious strife ( see the article below ) and the country is yet to open a single gas processing plant .
A combination of troublesome relations with multinationals and a lack of technical staff , among other factors , help explain why .
As a result , Bolivia ’s economy — and therefore social programs — is arguably more dependent on extraction - based activity than five years ago .
Debates and dilemmas
This problem gets to the heart of debates that arose at the climate conference over difficult questions .
These include the involvement of progressive governments , such as in Bolivia , Venezuela and Ecuador , in oil mining in the Amazon , as well as the deepening of the extraction - based economic model in Latin America .
Alberto Acosta , the former president of Ecuador ’s constituent assembly that produced the world ’s first constitution that explicitly defends the rights of Mother Earth , said : “ It is necessary to question the capitalist logic and construct a post - capitalist society . ”
However , he added : “ We have to clearly point out those that are responsible [ for the climate crisis ] and look at our responsibilities .
“ While it is true that the rich are the principal culprits , our countries that are tied to the world economy with an extractivist logic guarantee that these processes of accumulation continue reproducing themselves . ”
It would be suicidal to argue that Bolivia should simply shut down its gas and mining industry , with the deadly social impacts that would entail .
The dilemma was summarised by former Bolivian hydrocarbon minister Andres Soliz Rada .
He described the “ trap ” Morales finds himself in , between “ his industrialist offers with which he achieved his re-election and the indigenist demands to comply with his proclaimed defence of the environment ” .
Morales expressed this dilemma when he responded to environmentalist and Indigenous groups who oppose oil exploration in the Amazon by saying : “ What will Bolivia live off ? ”
Without oil revenue , there would be no money for government benefits payments , he added .
Morales ’ comments might surprise some only familiar with his powerful denunciations of inaction on climate change on the international stage .
But the reality is his government ’s proposed industrialisation program and redistributive social spending is a big part of why it maintains high popular support .
This contradiction is enforced on Bolivia by the imperialist system .
Overcoming it ultimately requires rich nations to pay their climate debt — and help provide the means for poor countries such as Bolivia to develop sustainably .
In the meantime , Third World governments that seek to break the deadly cycle of poverty and underdevelopment will face difficult choices .
In 2007 , Garcia Linera explained : “ The outlook according to which the indigenous world has its own cosmovision , radically opposed to that of the West , is typical of latecomer indigenists or those closely linked to certain NGOs ...
Basically , everyone wants to be modern .
The Felipe Quispe [ Indigenous ] insurgents , in 2000 , were demanding tractors and internet . ”
One example of this was the recent tensions between Indigenous peasants groups over changes to the government ’s land reform law .
Indigenous organisations from the Amazonian region in the east strongly criticised former vice - minister of land , Victor Camacho , and the Unique Confederation of Rural Labourers of Bolivia ( CSUTCB ) peasant confederation , for trying to “ peasantise ” Indigenous communities via changes that would prioritise individual , and not collective , land titles .
This apparent contradiction between an “ Andean cosmovision ” ( a concept that seemingly leaves out the other 34 Indigenous groups based in Bolivia ’s non-Andean regions ) and Indigenous peasants demanding individual rather that collective land titles can be understood if we grasp the dynamic underlining the Morales government .
Indigenous nationalism
Rather than representing a desire to return to ancient Indigenous times , this government is the product of a new anti-imperialism whose roots lie in previous nationalist movements .
It surpasses previous nationalist experiments because , for the first time , it is not military officers or the urban middle classes leading the project , but Indigenous and peasant sectors .
Its solid core is represented not by Indigenous organisations of Indigenous peoples ( who are also peasants ) who have most questioned the apparent divorce between the government 's Panchamama ( “ Mother Earth ” ) discourse and its action .
It is represented by organisations of those peasants ( who are also Indigenous ) who benefited from previous land reforms by nationalist governments — and today own individual plots .
This is not to deny the important role the specific organisational , economic and political models of the country ’s Indigenous people play in the process .
This is what most clearly differentiates it from previous nationalist governments and is a crucial aspect of its revolutionary dynamic .
Nor can it be denied that the Bolivian government is the leading global advocate in defence of the environment and promoter of a global alliance to wage such a struggle , incorporating strong elements of Indigenous cosmovision in its discourse .
However , there is the need for a serious debate in Bolivia , which appears to be beginning post - conference , over how to begin a transition from its extraction - based and dependent economy towards a post - capitalist , sustainable society .
This will require going beyond romantic declarations of the birth of a new “ civilisatory and cultural perspective ” or a “ world revolution of Vivir Bien ” , and understanding the complex reality of Bolivian society and the difficult process of change underway .
Bolivia ’s mining dilemmas
By Federico Fuentes , Cochabamba
May 15 , 2010 -- Perhaps no other sector better exemplifies the challenge the Bolivian government faces in lifting the country out of the poverty and dependency afflicting South America ’s poorest nation than its all - important mining industry .
Mining minister and former miners ’ union leader Jose Pimentel told Green Left Weekly : “ Bolivia has been a mining country for more than 500 years , ever since the Spanish came and discovered the legendary wealth [ of the silver mines ] of Potosi .
And when we look at the situation today , we can say that a large part of the country continues to depend on mining . ”
For example , Pimentel said an estimated 90,000 workers affiliated to hundreds of cooperatives are attempting to subsist from mining “ in a rudimentary manner ” .
“ This sector impacts on important cities such as Potosi and Oruro , where practically the only productive activity is mining .
So to get rid of mining in one blow would not only bring with it social problems , but could even create situations of rebellions because large groups of people would be directly affected . ”
Moreover , revenue from mining has also become increasing important for the government ’s social spending aimed at lifting up the poor majority .
Rising global prices meant that mineral export revenue jumped in the first quarter of this year to US $ 464 million .
This represented 32 % of Bolivia ’s total export revenue — a 77.7 % jump in revenue compared to the same quarter last year .
With companies now forced to pay higher royalties and the state playing a more active role in the sector , the government has been able to redistribute a greater share of this wealth via its pro-poor social programs .
But the government is facing pressure from local Indigenous communities demanding that it comply with its environmental discourse .
It also faces troubles in its relations with multitnational mining corporations and the challenge of using a weakened state that was privatised and dismantled by previous neoliberal governments to state to promote its industrialisation drive .
Mutun
One example is the project to extract and process iron ore from Mutun , the eighth largest iron - ore mine in the world .
In 2007 , the government signed a contract with Indian company Jindal to exploit 50 % of the Mutun mine .
The agreement included the construction of an iron smelter and steel factory to ensure that value - added products would be exported ( not just raw materials , as is often the case with poor nations ) .
The project , involving a projected investment of $ 2.1 billon by Jindal , was presented as evidence that a stronger state working with private capital could develop the country ’s economy .
Yet , three years later , this dream is no closer to being realised .
Relations between the government and the company have taken a turn for the worst .
Due to Jindal ’s lack of compliance with its contractual obligations , the government announced in April its decision to collect $ 18 million in warranty bonds .
It accused Jindal of having invested only $ 12 million of the $ 600 million required by now under the terms of the contract .
Jindal has challenged the move , blaming government inefficiency in dealing with the relocation of local communities .
Having neglected to nationalise the land with the iron - ore deposits , the government has had to go through tedious and drawn - out negotiations to verify and buy out individual landholders .
This process has been further hampered by the fact that most landowners had no land titles to legally sell , forcing the government to delineate each landholding .
Some peasants unhappy with the amount of land designated to them have refused to sell .
In April , tensions also boiled over between local Indigenous communities and owners of the massive San Cristobal mine , Sumitomo Corporation , in Potosi .
San Cristobal accounted for 55 % of Bolivia ’s mineral exports last year , with Sumitomo netting around $ 1 billon in profit .
Locals are angry that in an area suffering from desertification , and where access to fresh water is increasingly scarce , Sumitomo extracts 50,000 litres of underground water a day , free of charge , while paying a tiny $ 38 million in royalties last year .
When this was publicly exposed , locals began to set up roadblocks , burnt down a local company office and overturned several train carriages carrying mineral exports from the mine to Chile .
The problem for the government is that under the current mining code , Sumitomo is able to make use of “ legal vacuums ” that place no obligation on the company to pay for its water usage .
Pimentel said this will have to change in the new code set be presented to the Plurinational Assembly later this year .
“ It is impossible to continue these kinds of mining practices . ”
He said the new law must “ enforce a more rational and efficient use of these resources ” .
Sumitomo claims such measures , and the protests , are putting in danger its investments and financial viability .
Lithium
Perhaps the government ’s biggest dilemma is the proposed , extremely lucrative , large - scale exploitation of the world ’s largest lithium mine .
An estimated 19 million tonnes of lithium , roughly half of the world ’s supply , is said to be located in Bolivia ’s Uyuni salt flats .
At stake is about $ 1 billon a year .
“ In the case of lithium ” , Pimentel said , “ we are now constructing a pilot plant to extract lithium as well as boron , potassium and magnesium .
Next year we hope to enter into the final stage of our project , with the creation of an industrial plant , the first job of which will be to produce lithium carbonate .
Afterwards , we will move towards industrialisation of lithium carbonate , producing things such as batteries , where naturally we will have to look for strategy partners that can guarantee us technology and markets . ”
There is no shortage of multinationals seeking to become “ strategic partners ” .
No official tendering process has opened , but rumours are French company Bollore - Eramet is frontrunner for the partnership , with its proposed “ Franco - Bolivian project for Bolivians to live well and in harmony with Pachamama [ Mother Earth ] ” .
Other contenders include Sumitomo and the South Korean Cores Corporation .
Cores is currently involved in the Coro Coro hydrometallurgical project to extract and process about 10 million tonnes of copper .
The project is criticised by Indigenous communities protesting the lack of prior consultation , and plans to divert local river ways to supply the mine with water .
This will directly affect about 300 peasant families .
The lithium deposits are located within one of Bolivia ’s most famous tourist attractions .
Concerns about the environmental impact of mining have been raised .
There are also concerns over the lack of transparency and public discussion regarding such a critical project for Bolivia ’s future .
Given the problems with the practices of the multinationals , which rather than helping Bolivia ’s industrialisation have kept Bolivia dependent on the extraction - based development model , there are serious questions about the sector ’s future .
Bolivia : ‘ No excuses for killing Mother Earth ’
By Federico Fuentes , Cochabamba
May 15 , 2010 -- Under the Bolivia 's constitution approved in January 2009 , the state now controls all minerals , metals , precious and semi-precious stones in the country .
While respecting previously granted concessions to private companies , it has restricted new concessions to joint ventures with the state
In 2007 , the Bolivian government returned 100 % control of the Huanuni tin mine to the state - owned Comibol .
On May 3 , the government nationalised the Glencore - owned antimony smelter , which has been out of operation for more than two years .
The decision was taken due to Glencore ’s 10 - year non-compliance with its investment commitments , instead choosing to begin dismantling the privatised smelter .
It follows on from the government ’s 2007 decision to nationalise the Glencore - owned Vinto tin smelter .
However , Comibol is far from having recovered from two decades of disinvestment and privatisation by successive neoliberal governments .
Explaining the need for “ strategic partners ” , Bolivia ’s mining minister Jose Pimentel told Green Left Weekly of the difficulty of accessing credit for industrialisation projects .
“ Multilateral or commercial banks generally give loans for infrastructure , electricity , highways but not for industrialisation .
This has been one of the factors why we have had to seek out strategic partners that can give us the necessary technology and invest capital , and guarantee markets for us . ”
But , facing trouble with its “ strategic partners ” , the government has recently indicated that it may be willing to move ahead independently where possible .
One example is the announcement it will begin mining 50 % of the Mutun iron - ore deposits .
To finance this , the government said it would use revenue from the sale of $ 11 million worth of iron ore reserves that Comibol has in storage .
Pimentel also said that after five years of steady economic growth , Bolivia ’s currency reserves “ have reached $ 9 billion and I think that some of the projects we have in the pipeline could be directly financed from there ” .
Bolivia is also discussing with Venezuela setting up a “ grand- national ” joint state mining company , within the framework of Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas ( ALBA ) , an anti-imperialist trading bloc launched by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004 .
“ This is a space that we see as much more important , given that sovereign peoples are beginning to negotiate among themselves in order to replace the transnationals . ”
Regarding environmental concerns , Pimentel said , “ while we can demand the companies improve their environmental practices by carrying out a more rational and efficient exploitation , we cannot ask the same of the workers in cooperatives who live directly from mining ...
We believe we have to carry out a policy of supporting small producers to solve environmental problems by creating the mechanisms whereby they can carry out their activities without large economic costs . ”
A new stricter mining code , combined with “ stringently assuring that mining companies respect all environmental problems ” , means there should “ be no excuse for the mining industry damaging the environment and killing Mother Earth ” , Pimentel said .

Google has admitted that for the past three years it has wrongly collected information people have sent over unencrypted wi- fi networks .
The issue came to light after German authorities asked to audit the data the company 's Street View cars gathered as they took photos viewed on Google maps .
Google said during a review it found it had " been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open networks " .
The admission will increase concerns about potential privacy breaches .
These snippets could include parts of an email , text or photograph or even the website someone may be viewing .
In a blogpost Google said as soon as it became aware of the problem it grounded its Street View cars from collecting wi-fi information and segregated the data on its network .
It is now asking for a third party to review the software that caused the problem and examine precisely what data had been gathered .
" Maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " wrote Alan Eustace , senior vice president of engineering and research .
" The engineering team at Google works hard to earn your trust - and we are acutely aware that we failed badly here . "
' Pushing the envelope '
Google said the problem dated back to 2006 when " an engineer working on an experimental wi- fi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast wi- fi data " .
That code was included in the software the Street View cars used and " quite simply , it was a mistake " , said Mr Eustace .
" This incident highlights just how publicly accessible , open , non-password protected wi- fi networks are today . "
Dan Kaminsky , director of penetration testing for security firm Ioactive , said there was no intent by Google .
" This information was leaking out and they picked it up .
If you are going to broadcast your email on an open wi- fi , do n't be surprised if someone picks it up . "
John Simpson , from the Consumer Watchdog , told the BBC : " The problem is [ Google ] have a bunch of engineers who push the envelope and gather as much information as they can and do n't think about the ramifications of that . "
Dr Ian Brown , an expert on privacy and cyber security at the Oxford Internet Institute , told BBC News the wi-fi data collection was part of an idea to accurately map a user 's location on Google Map and Street View .
" The idea was to use to the different signals and strengths from wi-fi and phones to position a users - think of it as a sort of GPS .
" However , there are concerns in many countries that Google has broken numerous data protection and privacy laws by collecting this data and I expect a clutch of lawsuits to follow , " he said .

Dark night skies , for the first time in history , are becoming an extinct phenomenon .
Researchers predict that at the current rate of increasing light pollution , by 2025 no dark skies will remain in the continental United States .
The two main culprits are light and air pollution .
Light , a natural and harmless part of our world normally , is out of place at night .
Light pollution is defined as the illumination of the night sky caused by artificial light , a problem born with the invention of the light bulb only 125 years ago .
Most light pollution , or sky glow , is completely unnecessary and is caused by bad lighting fixtures .
Many lights installed in homes , businesses , street lights and billboards are too bright and aimed upwards or sideways .
The light scatters through the atmosphere above and brightens the night sky , diminishing the view of it .
Air pollution also decreases night sky visibility , just like it does in the daytime .
Air pollution particles increase the scattering of light in the atmosphere , increasing sky glow .

More Than Just Aesthetics
More than simply aesthetics , light pollution is a serious problem for nocturnal animals .
Many animals depend on darkness in order to hunt , conceal their location , navigate , or reproduce .
Stray light disrupts their habitat , and even their life cycles .
Plants , too , can be affected .
A tree beneath a bright street light may lose its leaves in the fall later than neighboring trees without the same light to disrupt its natural pattern .

The National Parks harbor some of the last remaining dark skies in the country .
The National Park Service Night Sky Team was formed in response to the alarming increase of light pollution even in National Parks .
The team documented light from distant cities affecting night skies over 200 miles away .
The lights of Las Vegas , Nevada , for example , were visible from 8 different national parks .
The Night Sky Team visited Great Basin National Park in October 2004 and 2005 and tested the light levels to determine the darkness of the night skies .
The results ?
Great Basin 's night skies are among the darkest in the country , providing visitors a rare opportunity for stargazing !
What Can You Do ?
Unlike other forms of pollution , light pollution is completely reversible .
A few simple changes can make a big difference .
First , consider replacing outdoor lighting fixtures at home with shielded lights ( which direct all light downward ) , and block it from being needlessly projected into the night sky .
Reduce the wattage of outdoor bulbs and perhaps even increase energy savings when using a timer or a motion sensor so lights are on only when necessary .
In the evening , close blinds and drapes to prevent indoor light from escaping into the night sky .
Approach local schools , businesses , and cities about replacing conventional lighting fixtures with shielded lights for improved safety , visibility , and energy cost savings .

“ Where I was wrong , ” said President Obama at his press conference on Thursday , “ was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst - case scenarios . ”
With all due respect to the president , who is a very smart man , how is it possible for anyone with any reasonable awareness of the nonstop carnage that has accompanied the entire history of giant corporations to believe that the oil companies , which are among the most rapacious players on the planet , somehow “ had their act together ” with regard to worst - case scenarios .
These are not Little Lord Fauntleroys who can be trusted to abide by some fanciful honor system .
These are greedy merchant armies drilling blindly at depths a mile and more beneath the seas while at the same time doing all they can to stifle the government oversight that is necessary to protect human lives and preserve the integrity of the environment .
President Obama knows that .
He knows  or should know  that the biggest , most powerful companies do not have the best interests of the American people in mind when they are closing in on the kinds of profits that ancient kingdoms could only envy .
BP ’s profits are counted in the billions annually .
They are like stacks and stacks of gold glittering beneath a brilliant sun .
You do n’t want to know what people will do for that kind of money .

The researchers were investigating why women living in the northeastern United States are more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and they suspected they would find an association with air pollution .
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an autoimmune disease that causes pain , swelling , stiffness and loss of function in the joints .
Unlike osteoarthritis , the common arthritis that develops from wear and tear on joints and usually develops only as people age , RA can affect the young and old .
The disease can cause enormous suffering -- it may attack the eyes , mouth and lungs as well as joints .
According to the National Institutes of Health , there 's no known cause for RA and treatments include steroids and other drugs that can have serious side effects .
The new research , which was just published online in the journal , found that women in states like Vermont , New Hampshire and southern Maine were more likely to report being diagnosed with RA .
Dr. Veronica Vieira , DSc , associate professor of BUSPH environmental health , headed the study using a technique called spatial analysis .
Her research team used data from the Nurses ' Health Study , a long - term study of U.S. female nurses .
They noted where the women lived , their health status and behavioral risk factors for various diseases during the years from 1988 and 2002 ; the RA findings were based on 461 women who developed RA , compared to a control group of 9,220 .
Bottom line : women living at northern latitudes and receiving less sunlight were at risk of vitamin D deficiency and these were the women who had the greatest incidence of RA .
What 's more , the risk increased even more if women had been living in the north since the beginning of the study in l988 .
The researchers noted that vitamin D deficiency has previously been associated with a variety of other autoimmune diseases .

I do n’t take my responsibility as a blogger lightly , and I realize that many readers look to this site for reliable information on privacy and security issues with social networking applications .
Consequently , I strive to maintain high standards of accuracy and clarity in my posts .
Over the last few years , I ’ve set some personal rules for myself , such as reproducing a vulnerability before relaying it here .
I would never want to mislead my readers or betray their trust .
However , I must issue an apology regarding what I view as a significant error that I discovered today while researching a new idea .
In at least two recent posts , I misrepresented how much information Facebook applications are able to access without explicit authorization .
My apologies to Facebook for overstating such access .
Previously , I ’d stated that Facebook applications have access to your “ publicly available information ” and content marked accessible to “ Everyone ” prior to authorizing the application .
In one case , I stated this could be used by a fan page tab to identify users without explicit authorization .
As it turns out , applications only have this automatic access in certain circumstances .
According to Facebook ’s documentation , such access only occurs when users arrive at an application page from certain Facebook channels and can be affected by strong privacy settings .
I misunderstood this process and consequently applied in situations where it would not actually come into play .
As for fan pages , a tab apparently does not have automatic means of identifying a user and would need to request authentication to access such information .
It bothers no one more than me that I misled my readers on this point , and I will certainly strive all the more to avoid such an error in the future .
Saturday , April 17 , 2010 An NDA ?
Really ?
Q. I was fortunate enough to find a independent producer who wants to buy my script .
So far , they sent me the NDA [ non- disclosure agreement ] which I signed and a 1st draft of the option agreement , which was n't signed .
They say they are working on the final draft of the option and they 're working on funding the company so that I can get paid .
They also have about 3 or 4 other projects they 're developing .
You mentioned you can never trust a producer who says he knows where he might be able to get the money to make a movie(s ) .
I was just wondering , is the signed NDA enough of a legal document to prove they 're serious about making the movie and that my script has merit ?
Certainly not .
Asking you to sign a non-disclosure agreement does n't mean anything .
In fact it 's very odd to ask a screenwriter to sign an NDA .
What do they not want you disclosing ?
It 's your idea !
They keep promising me it 'll get done and that things are looking " great " , but I do n't know .
I 'm wondering if they overestimated how quickly they can get their company funded .
The 1st draft of the option said they 'd pay me quite well , but nothing was signed yet .
Now I 'm sitting and waiting for the final option .
It 's amateurish of them to send you a draft option and then promise you a real option later .
The draft option should represent their offer to you .
Your representative then uses it as a baseline to ask for more stuff , to close loopholes , to clarify ambiguities , generally to make it a better deal for you .
Then it goes back and forth between your rep and them until you both have something you can agree with .
Their saying things are going great may mean absolutely nothing whatsoever .
Producers almost always say things are going great .
Until it comes time to pay .
Then they say things are n't going as well as they 'd hoped and could they have more time , please .
As a practical note , agreements are almost never signed by the producer until the writer signs .
I do n't know why , that 's just the way it 's done .
I do n't really know what would happen , legally , if the producer took your signed deal and then failed to sign it .
I assume that your representative could insist that he sign it or the deal would be considered void .
Make sure your rep follows up to make sure the deal is actually signed by the producer .
It makes it harder to hold him to terms he has n't signed .
( It is not impossible however .
Under contract law , your working under a negotiated but unsigned agreement may create a contract , and their paying you almost certainly does .
But IANAL , this is not legal advice , and YMMV . )
My suggestion would be that you have a rep ( lawyer or agent ) send them your notes on their contract .
Their draft option almost certainly contains loopholes favoring them .
I would consider the project " available " to other people until you get a signed deal .
Until then , I would quietly continue to shop it around .
If you get a better offer , you can pit producer against the other , and that 's always fun .
Certainly not .

Public / private distinction for civil rights enforcement ignores the omnipotent power of private corporations
Anti-government ' Tea Party ' rhetoric misses real threat to liberty posed by unchecked corporate wealth and power ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 5/25/2010 , 2:57 pm PT
Guest essay by Ernest A. Canning
It is vital that the American people come to appreciate the danger to liberty as well as community posed by doctrinaire libertarianism .
Despite widespread coverage of Rand Paul 's absurd criticism of the provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act as applied to private businesses , there has been a dearth of analysis as to how this absurdity was brought about by the serious intellectual deficiencies in doctrinaire libertarian philosophy ; a philosophy which led to a second astounding Rand Paul remark .
In the face of horrendous safety records on the part of both Massey Energy , which had been found to have violated federal safety regulations thousands of times over the past several years , and BP , which had steadfastly fought off safety measures for deep water oil rigs , Rand summarily dismissed the significance of both the deadly West Virginia mine disaster and the deadly explosion at BP 's deep water facility that has produced the worst oil spill in U.S. history with the cavalier , " accidents happen . "
What Rand Paul has done is open a window into " libertarianism , " which , contrary to the current Wikipedia definition , does not merge into " anarchism . "
The principle distinction arises because , as explained by Noam Chomsky , anarchism challenges not only authoritarian government but all authoritarian societal structures , including the work place .
Libertarians like Ron and Rand Paul focus exclusively on individual liberty vis-a - vis the government .
They fail to appreciate that , especially in the 21st Century , the removal of government as a check against unfettered corporate wealth and power leads to " the tyranny of a corporate controlled economy " ...
Firestorm
As observed by Juan González of Democracy Now ! ( video below ) , Rand Paul , the Republican candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky , set off a " firestorm " of controversy when he criticized those portions of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act which applied to private businesses , implying , when he appeared on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show , that the 46 - year old federal legislation infringed on the First Amendment rights of private businesses .
RACHEL MADDOW : Should — Woolworth lunch counters should have been allowed to stay segregated ?...
RAND PAUL :... I do n’t believe in any discrimination .
I do n’t believe that any private property should discriminate either ...
But what you have to answer , when you answer ... is an abstract , obscure conversation from 1964 ... you have to say then that you decide the rules for all restaurants .
And then , do you decide that you want to allow them to carry weapons into restaurants ?
As observed by Prof. Blair Kelley on Democracy Now , Rand Paul 's public / private distinction bears an eerie resemblance to pro-segregationist arguments that older Americans like myself can all too well remember .
Amy Goodman discusses a fact , first reported by the blog barefoot and progressive , that " Rand Paul ’s former communications director , Christopher Hightower ... resigned in December after his MySpace page was found to have a post declaring ' Happy N - Word Day ' — but it used the full word — and showing a photo of a lynching around the time of the federal Martin Luther King , Jr. holiday . "
But it is a serious mistake to believe that Rand Paul 's position is either motivated by racism or that this entailed a not - ready - for - prime - time gaffe of a neophyte politician , as suggested by the commentator to Brad Friedman during a May 21 segment on Russian TV .
To the contrary , as Friedman noted , Rand Paul 's remarks flow directly from the " doctrinaire libertarian " philosophy more clearly articulated by Rand 's father , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) and the principles espoused by the original " Tea Party Movement " during the 2007/2008 Republican primary campaign before the movement was both co-opted and corrupted by the neo - fascist and health care industry - funded " Freedom Works , " under the auspices of former House Majority Leader Dick Army ( R - TX ) , billionaire publisher Steve Forbes and a bevy of insiders from the Reagan / Bush / Bush war against the middle - class .
The problem is not lack of sincerity on the part of Ron or Rand Paul .
It is a matter of the serious deficiencies in a philosophy which focuses exclusively on individual liberty , but , in fairness , I will cover first the positives in terms of policy that Ron Paul 's principled libertarianism produced .
Ron Paul policies that enticed progressive support
If you have n't done so , you would do well to watch the series of videos posted by Brad Friedman as he distinguished the principled policy positions advocated by Ron Paul from the empty rhetoric of the 21st Century " know - nothings " aka the " Tea Baggers . "
At a time when the Bush / Cheney regime was running roughshod over civil liberties and pursuing imperial conquest overseas , Ron Paul not only opposed the perpetual wars being waged in Afghanistan and Iraq but challenged the wisdom of maintaining an Empire .
" We ’re spending nearly a trillion dollars a year on a machine maintaining this empire … .
We are literally spending ourselves into oblivion , " Ron Paul said , adding :
We have a national ID card on our doorstep .
The way it ’s being implemented right now we have FISA courts , we have warrantless searches , we ’ve lost habeas corpus , we ’ve had secret prisons around the world and we have torture going on — that ’s un-American .
This whole idea that we ’re supposed to sacrifice liberty for security …
Do n’t we remember that when you sacrifice liberty for security , you lose both ?
Ron Paul 's son , Rand , has staked - out a principled position against corporate welfare , stating :
Federal bailouts reward inefficient and corrupt management , rob taxpayers , hurt smaller and more responsible private firms , exacerbate our budget problems , explode national debt , and destroy our U.S. dollar .
Even more importantly , any bailout of private industry is in direct violation of the Constitution .
It is a transfer of wealth from those who have earned to those who have squandered .
Rand falls short of his father 's principled libertarianism
Unfortunately , some of Ron Paul 's principled policies do not appear to be fully shared by his son , Rand , who states at his campaign web site that he favors the trial of " terrorists captured on the battlefield in military tribunals " and believes " the primary Constitutional function of the federal government is national defense . "
Although Rand told AntiWar.com 's libertarian - leaning Scott Horton that he was opposed to torture , he was also opposed to bringing George Bush before the bar of justice for war crimes , expressing what bordered on " the King can do no wrong " concept by noting that there were " arguments as to whether a President can be tried . "
Robert Scheer stated :
Rand Paul is a bit more inclined to waffle on an interventionist foreign policy than is his father .
While he would have insisted on a declaration of war before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq , he argues that Afghanistan , where the 9/11 attack was planned , was a legitimate target but that Iraq was not .
Rand not only confirmed Scheer 's observations during the Scott Horton interview , but enhanced concerns when he appeared incapable of distinguishing between al Qaeda and the Taliban , though he did say that he was opposed to a long - term occupation of Afghanistan .
Libertarian blind spots
There are two areas in which libertarian philosophy leads to absurdity .
a) Individual liberty without civic responsibility is destructive of community , an equitable economy and the environment
While no one doubts that individual liberty is vital in a free society , societies do not consist of groupings of autonomous individuals whose " liberties " never come into conflict .
The libertarian concept of an unlimited right of individuals and corporations to pursue wealth , along with their misplaced reliance on " market fundamentalism , " ignores the basic obligations we owe one another and to our planet whose ecological balance is vital to the very survival of our species .
While libertarians rail against " big government , " the real problem is not government per se but the extent to which the very purpose of government has been corrupted by special interests .
A brief examination of the principles espoused by Res Publica , " a community of public sector professionals dedicated to promoting good governance , civic virtue and deliberative democracy " elucidates the folly in exclusively focusing on " individual liberties . "
The most precious things we have are our “ res publica ” -- the things we have in common — our values , our principles , our community , our freedom , our earth .
We are concerned that a rising philosophy that celebrates individual selfishness ... is undermining our stewardship of these things ....
Do we pursue our self interests all the time , or do we strive for compassion , courage , truth , and dedication ?
Do pursuits of status , money , or success distract us from what really matters to us ?
Citizenship entails more than individual liberties .
It entails co-responsibility towards one - another , towards our local , state , national and world communities .
Brad Friedman 's recent observation that Rand Paul " calls for removing government entirely from all but those functions called for directly in the Constitution " is only partially accurate .
While Rand Paul recognizes one of the core purposes set forth in the Constitution 's Preamble ( to provide for the common defense ) , Rand ignores a second , vital purpose ( to promote the general welfare ) .
Thus , Rand " has spoken about abolishing the Department of Education , the Drug Enforcement Agency , and perhaps the Department of Agriculture . "
He " has expressed serious concerns about the Americans with Disabilities Act , " and , despite the provisions of the 16th Amendment which authorizes the federal government to collect an income tax , Rand Paul has gone so far as to question the government 's right to do so .
This too is consistent with libertarian philosophy .
Because libertarians focus exclusively on individual liberty , they see taxes as a burden rather than part of a mutual obligation we all owe to ourselves and to our society .
Yet it is the anti-tax , anti-government rhetoric which sways many of the less than well informed " Tea Party " followers who fail to understand that the true culprit is not " big government " but a " broken government " which lacks democratic accountability precisely because it has been corrupted by the very same economic elites who have taken over the " Tea Party movement . "
Under the cover of anti-government rhetoric , the hard - right , aided in no small measure by the corporate sector of the Democratic Party , has transferred power from public to private hands .
The transfer is so pervasive that many laws have not merely been written on behalf of , but actually written by corporate lobbyists .
Government agencies , like the Department of Agriculture , which were created to control corporate abuses of power have been emasculated because the people appointed to run those agencies hail from the very industries these federal agencies were intended to regulate .
The answer is not to abolish an agency like the Department of Agriculture , as Rand Paul proposes , but to eliminate the conflict between the public and private interest by removing all industry - connected political appointees and replacing them with individuals devoted to the public interest .
The problem is not democracy but what Chomsky described in Failed States as the " democracy deficit " — the significant gap between the policy positions of the American electorate and their elected " representatives ; " a gap made possible because of the substance deficit in the corporate owned media and the deceptive means by which elections are determined by one - sided propaganda ( paid - for political ads ) that only billionaires and corporate - favored candidates can afford to buy .
In Wealth and Democracy , Kevin Phillips , quoting Samuel Huntington , observed :
" ' Money becomes evil not when it is used to buy goods but when it is used to buy power …economic inequalities become evil when they are translated into political inequalities . '
Political inequality , in turn , leads to more dangerous economic inequalities …
b ) The conflict between individual and corporate liberties
The second and perhaps most glaring libertarian blind spot is an inability to recognize the conflict between individual and corporate liberties — a blind spot that emerged even while Rand Paul addressed the issue of government corruption during the Scott Horton interview .
Rand suggested that the problem of corporate First Amendment rights could be avoided with respect to contracts between the government and private corporations by inserting a clause that precludes that corporation from lobbying or donating PAC monies during the term of the contract .
While this would be a reasonable first step , the troubling feature of Rand Paul 's remarks was his assumption that the framers of the U.S. Constitution had intended to extend to corporations , including foreign - owned corporations , the same rights that apply to living , breathing human citizens .
As we previously observed in " Citizens United : A Case Which Will Live in Infamy " , within the context of a corporate - owned media which already controls 95 % of what Americans see , hear and read , by extending unfettered " free speech " rights to the totalitarian in structure entities we commonly refer to as corporations , the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in the Citizens United case choked off the " free press " rights of the American people — that is the Fourth Estate role envisioned by the framers of an independent media that would ensure the right of the people to have unfettered access to vital , democracy - sustaining information .
The Citizens United decision permits wealth to insure that the corporate - favored message is the only narrative the American people receive .
The core of Citizens United is not so much a matter of " free speech " as it is about the location of power .
It is that James Madison ’s prescient observation that " knowledge will forever govern ignorance " was given voice in the symbol chosen by Admiral John Poindexter for his Total Information Awareness Program — a pyramid topped by an all - seeing eye , beneath which appeared the words , Scientia Est Potentia : Latin for " knowledge is power " — a symbol that is perhaps best understood by thinking of J.R. Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings with billionaire oligarchs collectively playing the role of Lord Sauron .
Like most doctrinaire philosophies , Rand Paul 's libertarianism deals in absolutes .
Having assumed that corporations are entitled to the same " free speech " rights as living , breathing citizens , Rand adopts the extreme position that Congress had erred by including within the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 provisions that would bar discrimination by private companies who serve the public .
Since the Second Amendment includes the right to bear arms , Rand Paul equates a desire to sit down at a lunch counter bearing a weapon with the right of all members of the public to be served regardless of race , age or gender .
While he abhors racism , Rand suggests that the government is powerless either to prevent racist exclusion or the exclusion of guns from the lunch counter because government intervention would infringe on the free speech rights of a private company .
Amongst the crucial factors which Rand Paul fails to appreciate is that where race , gender and age are immutable characteristics over which one has no control , carrying a firearm is not .
More importantly , in advancing a public / private distinction for civil rights enforcement , Rand Paul fails to appreciate the all - encompassing presence of private corporations in nearly every facet of American life .
The absurdity of Rand Paul 's extremist remarks would perhaps have been more readily apparent if , for example , Rachel Maddow had cited privately - owned , commercial aircraft rather than lunch counters .
Anyone with half a brain can readily appreciate why it would be a very bad idea to allow citizens to carry loaded weapons onto commercial aircraft .
But , if we permitted commercial airlines to prevent African Americans from traveling by plane out of a concern for the airline 's " free speech " rights , we emasculate the civil rights of a major segment of the population and open the door to a return to a dark chapter in our nation 's history known as Jim Crow .
Those of us who have practiced law understand that rights cannot be treated as absolutes ; that the rights of one individual often conflict with those of another ; that both our legislatures and courts are designed to engage in a balancing of those rights , which , if not fettered by the corruption of special interests , should strive to protect individual rights to the extent possible while enhancing the general welfare .
An individual may have a right to inhale carcinogens in cigarette smoke but that does not mean that he or she has the right to expose others to those carcinogens by smoking in a crowded restaurant .

CORRECTION :
The article above had initially identified Scott Horton as an " attorney " .
In fact , the Rand Paul interview as referenced was with AntiWar.com 's writer and radio host Scott Horton and not Harper 's writer and attorney Scott Horton .
The article has been corrected to reflect the appropriate Horton .
We apologize to both of them for the error .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
I constantly hang out with great Americans from every imaginable walk of life all over this great country .
We all know a self - evident truth when we see it .
Truth , logic and common sense drive our lives and remain common and sensible to us all .
We clearly understand that the American dream is all about being the best we can be , working as hard as possible and being accountable in order to be an asset to our families , communities and country .
We expect our government to secure our borders , keep us safe from our enemies and play by the rules as laid out in the U.S. Constitution , Bill of Rights , golden rule and Ten Commandments and otherwise pretty much stay the heck out of our way .
We the people know that the government is supposed to work for us , not run amok and abandon all accountability as the out - of - control , gluttonous , criminal Fedzilla is now overtly guilty of doing .
The Tea Party is so simple , it ’s stupid .
It is named after the uprising of Americans sick and tired of tyrants usurping the new American freedom , lifestyle and dream .
Taxation without representation was merely the tip of that 1773 culture - war spear and now accurately represents the spirit of the 2010 Tea Party movement .
This glorious experiment in self - government is not supposed to be a spectator sport , as it has been reduced to being for so long .
As the boss of government , we the people were supposed to stay in touch with politics and politicians , making sure our will was the force behind policies and lawmaking .
Remember that ?
The Tea Party Americans do , and we are demanding its return immediately .
The New Deal was a raw deal , and the Great Society was for losers .
A handout creates the curse of dependency .
A hand up is nationalism at its finest .
Know it .
It is no surprise that the Glenn Becks and Sarah Palins of the world are so inspiring and in direct accord with the Tea Party .
To listen to these great leaders is to hear the pulse of the best that America has to offer .
Faith , hope , charity , honesty , a herculean work ethic and a vapor trail of positive energy is what the Tea Party stands for .
We do n’t believe in bailouts ; we demand accountability .
We do n’t want an exit strategy ; we want a victory strategy .
We ca n’t believe that Navy SEAL warriors were indicted for roughing up a murderous terrorist leader in their heroic , professional military action to bring in evil criminals .
We are deeply offended by the speaker of the House telling us that we can find out what ’s in the health care bill after Congress passes it and it becomes law .
This is outrageous , and it must stop now .
We refuse to accept any longer the rampant corruption , cronyism and outright abuse of power by willfully disconnected , arrogant bureaucrats .
Who can believe that Fedzilla is taking Goldman Sachs to task while denying that government waste and idiotic policies are behind the economic ruin ?
How can such a rookie president with zero experience call the shots when it comes to dealing with Iran developing nuclear arms ?
We are shocked that the president of the United States surrounds himself with self - avowed communists , Marxists , socialists , tax cheats , lawbreakers , far - left animal rights goons , Mao and Che fans , and czars whose records are so far out of whack with American values as to make the head spin .
We are mad as hell that Fedzilla continues to spend and waste more and more of our hard - earned tax dollars on laughable programs , bailouts , ridiculous so - called stimulus packages and other boondoggles that have failed miserably every time in the past and are failing miserably again .
It is sheer lunacy to repeat actions and expect a different outcome .
It is time to rein in Fedzilla .
The Tea Party is just that force to reckon with , and it clearly has the logical voice and dynamism to get it done .
A prime motivator for the Tea Party is the example of Martin Luther King Jr. , who so eloquently stated , “ Those who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension .
We are merely bringing to the surface a tension that is already there . ”
Dedicated to standing up for our rights and the American way through nonviolent direct action , just like the glorious and pivotal upgrade of the civil rights movement in the 1960s , the Tea Party represents a long overdue wake - up call for America and , more important , American politicians and their lapdog media megaphone .
All that being said , anyone with a working brain knows that Fedzilla is behind every problem America faces today .
And the real tragedy is that behind Fedzilla ’s failures and abuses is apathy .
America is a nation wall to wall with citizens who have abandoned their prime responsibility to stay on top of things .
We need to monitor our government , to research candidates , to vote intelligently .
The burden falls squarely on the shoulders of we the people who have bent over backwards and let these rotten bureaucrats trample the American dream .
Better late than never .
The Tea Party is a return to paying attention , remaining engaged and good - old American activism - the very soul of America .
I salute the Tea Party and pray to God that it builds steam , galvanizes energy and focus and enlightens enough Americans to begin the take - back of our country in November - and beyond .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) -
In the frightening pitch black of quake - stricken Haiti ’s night , religious songs rise from groups of people huddled in open spaces for safety and solidarity .

The chanting and clapping , mainly by women , echo from hill to hill , street to street , as Haitians pray for their dead and ask God to spare them more suffering after an earthquake that has killed thousands and flattened much of the capital .
While the widespread singing provides comfort , the jarring shrieks and sobs of injured children -- some lying in the street clutching bloody gashes -- are a haunting reminder of the untended suffering in Haiti .
“ Oh my God , who will help my country now ? ” said Manuel Deheusch , a Haitian businessman who came rushing back from neighboring Dominican Republic to check on his friends , family and properties .
“ The world has to help us now .
We can not sort out this mess ourselves , ” he added , shaking his head and whispering the names of families whose houses he saw flattened as he drove round Port - au - Prince in the early evening .
Scores of dead bodies litter the streets , some untouched , others covered with a sheet or piece of clothing .
Outside the Hotel Villa Creole , where journalists and aid workers gather to sleep the night , two bodies lie in the street right outside .
“ This is a near impossible task , ” said a local volunteer , trying to bring succor to the dozens of injured and frightened Haitians lying and sleeping in the street outside the hotel , itself damaged by the quake .
U.N. PEACEKEEPERS IN SHOCK
There appears to be little major relief work under way yet .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Neighboring Dominican Republic has sent in some truckloads of aid and a few ambulances , which came screaming back out of Haiti with some injured people before night fell on Wednesday .
In the city , Haitians pick over rubble forlornly , seeking loved ones .
“ The help has to come from outside now because the capability of the aid organizations inside has been smashed , ” said Mike Stewart , country director for the Hope for Haiti charity , which has set up a mini-hospital outside the Villa Creole .
Its workers were mainly treating people for broken bones and internal bleeding .
“ Ten who have come to us have died already , ” Stewart said .
“ There will be more dead by morning .
We need to operate but we do n’t have the equipment .
All the aid organizations have taken a huge hit , buildings smashed , people killed and so on . ”
U.N. peacekeepers -- 9,000 are stationed in Haiti -- dot the streets but look bemused , overwhelmed and worried about their own circumstances .
“ I have not even been able to call my wife yet .
She may think I ’m dead , ” said one Chilean peacekeeper , who asked not to be named .
He and some blue - helmet colleagues from other Latin American nations sat on a line of vehicles -- including a tractor , earth - mover , and two cranes -- facing a road covered in rubble that they had been tasked with clearing .
“ Where do we start ?
Just look at this , ” the soldier said .
“ And imagine what it ’s like in the areas we ca n’t get to . ”
While trying to absorb the magnitude of what has happened , Port - au - Prince residents also are terrified of more aftershocks and looting .
This reporter did not see a single policeman on the streets of the coastal capital .
Two aftershocks came and went on Wednesday , causing screams of terror to rise from the streets , and sending people running out of buildings .
While Haiti has seen plenty of violence in the past , this reporter saw a stoic and strangely calm atmosphere on the street and was several times politely requested to donate a bottle of water , which was quickly shared among many needy people .

Google CEO Eric Schmidt has a message for the staggering newspaper industry :
Things will get better .
Google CEO offers news biz advice
The chief executive of Google has a message for the staggering newspaper industry :
Things will get better .
And Google CEO Eric Schmidt told a group of newspaper executives Sunday evening that his growing company will be an integral part of those changes .

Newspapers will make money once again , he said , but it will be from online advertisements and an altered subscription model .
Schmidt said his firm is working on new ways to tailor advertisements and content for consumers , based on what stories they read .
" We have a business model problem , we do n’t have a news problem , " Schmidt said .
Speaking to the American Society of News Editors ’ annual convention at the J.W. Marriott in downtown Washington , Schmidt showered praise on the industry , calling journalism an “ art . ”
Schmidt said he reads three newspapers , and called their work indispensible .
And he blasted blogs , saying that any questions about the value of newspaper editors can be answered : " Look at the blog world . "
" High quality journalism will triumph , " he said .
But along with that praise came his advice about how the business should change : Organizations should refocus their attention on personalizing content and disseminating news through mobile devices – businesses in which Google is heavily involved .
Schmidt told the mostly full ballroom that “ new forms of making money will develop , ” and that Google is working on those forms .
But he declined to divulge many details about that work .
“ The web can ultimately be very good for news , ” Schmidt said .
“ Think about it :
You have more readers than ever , you have more sources than ever , for sure you have more ways to report and new forms of money .
New forms of making money will develop . ”
Schmidt , who hovered at the side of the lectern throughout his 25 - minute speech , was firm that there is a robust future for both display advertisements and subscriptions — revenue streams that have shrunk as dramatically as the volume of free content online has expanded .
Google , of course , has a stake in that free content .
It aggregates news through its search engine , directs users to sites with free content and has made the universe of free information much more accessible , even as the company has profited by displaying its own advertisements beside that information .
Much of Schmidt ’s advice seemed to point to changes that might emerge from forms of technology that Google is developing , has developed or could foreseeably develop .
Some of those advances in technology , he said , could create new revenue streams for news organizations .
News sites should use technology to predict what a user wants to read by what they have already read , he said – technology his company has .
Schmidt said he does n’t want “ to be treated as a stranger ” when reading news online .
He also said he wants to be challenged through technology that directs readers to a story with an opposing view .
Google , he said , can uncover why a news organization does n't have readers in specific areas .
Personalized technology for news could help in tailoring advertisements for individual readers .
The collaborative nature of the Internet – something that Schmidt thinks could save journalism – also has its downside , he said .
The barriers for entry are “ basically zero , ” which makes everyone at once a potential competitor and partner .
“ Figuring out when to compete , when to collaborate , when to go solo , when to work in a group strikes me as one of the sort of key questions for all of you to think about , ” Schmidt said .
“ I do n’t know the answer , by the way , but I know you ’ll have a combination answer to make it right . ”
One way newspapers can become commercially successful , he said , is to emulate Google : “ Prototype early and often , ” gather and analyze data and make decisions based off of hard data .
Boston Globe Editor Martin Baron told POLITICO after Schmidt 's speech that Google is " already a big part of our presence " : " The reality is all newspaper Web sites get a lot of traffic with Google . "
Baron , whose newspaper has been hit particularly hard in recent years , said Google is having a " dramatic impact " on the news industry , which he said needs to " adapt quickly " to the fast - changing media environment .
" What we need to do is probably sweat , but sweat from hard work , figuring it all out , " Baron said .
" I think that ’s why people are here , and that ’s why they invite somebody like Eric Schmidt .
If we can learn something , and apply those lessons to the way we do business , then all the better . "
Staci D. Kramer , the co-editor of ContentNext Media , which covers the economy of news online , said that Schmidt 's talk was " non-adversarial " to an industry that views his company with skepticism .
" What he said was ' you ’re right to worry , but do n’t write your own epitaph yet , '' " she told POLITICO .
" He ’s not saying you ’re wrong to worry , but do n’t worry about the wrong things .
It ’s all about the business model , it ’s not whether you ’re a valued or not - valued service , it ’s how do you get people to pay for that service .
Do you pay through advertising , subscriptions or a mix ?
That 's something we 're all working on . "
It ’s an equation that ’s not easily solved , Schmidt said .
" The fact of the matter is there are not simple answers to any of these questions .
And in order to really find them , you ’re going to have to run some experiments . "

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first treatment that uses a so - called cancer vaccine , a drug that trains the body ’s own immune system to fight the disease .
The drug , Provenge , developed by the Dendreon Corporation , was approved to treat advanced prostate cancer .
In clinical trials it extended the lives of patients about four months compared with a placebo .
Getting the immune system to attack cancer has tantalized scientists for decades , because it promises to have fewer side effects than the harsh chemotherapy now used .
But until now the approach has yielded little but disappointment .
“ The big story here is that this is the first proof of principle and proof that immunotherapy works in general in cancer , which I think is a huge observation , ” said Dr. Philip Kantoff , chief of solid tumor oncology at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the lead investigator in Dendreon ’s largest clinical trial for the drug . ”
Dr Al Hourani was working as a locum surgeon at Fairfield General Hospital A surgeon who cut off a patient 's testicle by mistake has been struck off the medical register .
Dr Sulieman Al Hourani was only supposed to take out a cyst but removed the whole right testicle instead .
The blunder happened at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury , Greater Manchester , in September 2007 .
Dr Al Hourani , who has returned to his native Jordan , was found guilty of misconduct by a General Medical Council ( GMC ) fitness to practise panel .
The locum surgeon was struck off in his absence and refused to engage in the proceedings .
The patient , known only as patient A , had gone in for the surgery in in September 2007 .
The panel is of the opinion that a period of conditional registration would not adequately reflect the serious nature of Dr Al Hourani 's misconduct
GMC panel Medical notes made it " perfectly clear " the procedure was to be " excision of right epididymal cyst " , a disciplinary hearing was told .
The hearing was also told that in August 2006 , Dr Al Hourani had injected himself with two milligrams ( mg ) of midazolam , a powerful sedative , which was meant for a patient .
Hospital staff said the doctor , who was on call , appeared unsteady on his feet and was later found in the doctors ' mess room " deeply asleep " and taken to A&E .
Dr Al Hourani was issued with a final warning over that incident but was eventually dismissed by his employers , Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust , in October 2007 over allegations he stole two boxes of dihydrocodeine tablets .
' Reckless disregard '
In its ruling , the panel stated : " The panel is of the opinion that a period of conditional registration would not adequately reflect the serious nature of Dr Al Hourani 's misconduct .
" The panel notes that Dr Al Hourani has not engaged with the GMC to date and considers that this demonstrates a lack of insight on his part that would make it unlikely that he would comply with any conditions imposed . "
The panel , sitting in Manchester , added it was " deeply concerned " about the incident in which he gave himself a sedative .
It " showed reckless disregard for patient safety " , the panel ruled .
" The panel is of the opinion that this demonstrates a lack of insight on Dr Al Hourani 's part and does not give the panel any confidence that such behaviour would not be repeated .
" Although Dr Al Hourani was charged with a single instance of dishonesty , the panel considers the nature of the dishonesty very serious and , combined with the other charges found proved , his behaviour put patients at risk and jeopardised public trust in the profession . "

Earth 's ozone hole , shown here ( in blue ) in 2006 , could be negatively affected by some efforts to mitigate climate change .
Three British scientists shocked the world when they revealed on May 16th , 1985 — 25 years ago — that aerosol chemicals , among other factors , had torn a hole in the ozone layer over the South Pole .
The ozone layer , which protects life on Earth from damaging solar radiation , became an overnight sensation .
And the hole in the ozone layer became the poster - child for mankind ’s impact on the planet .
Today , the ozone hole — actually a region of thinned ozone , not actually a pure hole — does n’t make headlines like it used to .
The size of the hole has stabilized , thanks to decades of aerosol - banning legislation .
But , scientists warn , some danger still remains .
First , the good news :
Since the 1989 Montreal Protocol banned the use of ozone - depleting chemicals worldwide , the ozone hole has stopped growing .
Additionally , the ozone layer is blocking more cancer - causing radiation than any time in a decade because its average thickness has increased , according to a 2006 United Nations report .
Atmospheric levels of ozone - depleting chemicals have reached their lowest levels since peaking in the 1990s , and the hole has begun to shrink .
Now the bad news :
The ozone layer has also thinned over the North Pole .
This thinning is predicted to continue for the next 15 years due to weather - related phenomena that scientists still cannot fully explain , according to the same UN report .
And , repairing the ozone hole over the South Pole will take longer than previously expected , and wo n’t finish until between 2060 and 2075 .
Scientists now understand that the size of the ozone hole varies dramatically from year to year , which complicates attempts to accurately predict the hole 's future size .
Interestingly , recent studies have shown that the size of the ozone hole affects the global temperature .
Closing the ozone hole actually speeds up the melting of the polar ice caps , according to a 2009 study from Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research .
So even though environmentally friendly laws have successfully reversed the trend of ozone depletion , the lingering effects of aerosol use , and the link between the ozone hole and global warming , virtually ensure that this problem will persist until the end of the century .
The former college student who in 2008 allegedly hacked into a Yahoo e-mail account used by Sarah Palin -- then governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential candidate -- goes on trial today in Tennessee and of this much you can be certain :
The case will be more of a media and political circus than groundbreaking legal proceeding .
Especially since Palin herself is expected to testify .
In the hot seat will be 22 - year - old David Kernell , who was a student at the University of Tennessee when he is alleged to have accessed Palin 's account , changed her password , and set the new one free on the Internet , thus ensuring that the governor 's e-mail and photographs - most personal , but some job - related - would spread like juicy office gossip .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Kernell got caught , and , because the allegedlys and allegeds you 've seen here so far are journalistic formalities , the key question arising from the trial will be whether his attorney can convince jurors to view the matter as more prank than crime .
Prosecutors do not appear to be of a like mind .
From an Associated Press story :
Convictions on all four felony charges - identity theft , wire fraud , intentionally accessing Palin 's e-mail account without authorization and obstructing an FBI investigation - could send Kernell to prison for up to 50 years .
" If I was the individual being charged I would be concerned , particularly the other party , " East Tennessee State University political analyst David Briley said .
" Politics and religion are pretty close to the vest here . "
Translation : Kernell is the son of a longtime Democratic lawmaker in a state that is red enough to have helped deny native son Al Gore the presidency in 2000 .
Personally , I am confident that the system will identify 12 Tennesseans capable of granting both Kernell and the state a fair and apolitical day in court .
I 'm also confident that the mainstream media will find that a much more difficult task .
As for the trial itself , with " I did n't do it " apparently not available as a defense , Kernell 's attorney has been grasping at technicalities ( a.k.a. our legal rights ) in an attempt to shake his client free or at the very least minimize the seriousness of his offense .
A challenge of the warrant that led to Kernell 's arrest was denied .
A pre-trial motion contending that Palin 's e-mail address and password could not constitute her " identity " for purposes of identity theft , because anyone could register any name they want online , was also rejected .
So , too , was a request that potential jurors be questioned regarding any strong opinions they may hold regarding Palin ( and who does n't have those ? ) .
Presuming there is n't a mid-trial plea bargain and prosecutors succeed in getting at least some kind of charge to stick , the question becomes what constitutes fair punishment .
I 'm thinking 50 years in the slammer is a bit harsh .
So , too , is requiring Kernell to carry a felony conviction for the rest of his life over even a criminally stupid stunt like this .
No , I 'm thinking prosecutors should see clear to negotiate a misdemeanor , a weekend or two behind bars ( at most ) and a fine that will have Kernell wishing he had to pay off student loans instead .
My prediction : Prosecutors are going to go for the throat .
Let the circus begin .

One of the first senators to cast a vote , Brown crossed the aisle this winter to support a Democratic jobs bill .
Snowe and Collins are well - known centrists , and Voinovich is retiring .
Snowe said she voted for the procedural motion after visiting with unemployed families across Maine over the recent two - week congressional recess .
" There are people who are in desperate need and depend on these unemployment benefits , " Snowe said .
" I visited a number of career centers in Maine and I talked firsthand with people who had been long - term unemployed or recently unemployed , and you know , they need their benefits and they do n't need this added anxiety about whether they 're going to get them .
We need to streamline programs , and if there 's ways to pay for it that would be great .
But let 's not add to their burdens . "
Under Senate rules , 30 hours of debate would have been required after Monday 's vote , but Republicans agreed to waive that requirement shortly before the Senate adjourned for the day .
The $ 9.2 billion bill would extend long - term unemployment benefits along with COBRA healthcare subsidies and an annual boost in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients .
The unemployment benefits would last until May 5 ; the other changes would end April 30 .
The benefits expired during the recent two - week congressional recess , after Sen. Tom Coburn Thomas ( Tom ) Allen CoburnCOVID response shows a way forward on private gun sale checks Inspector general independence must be a bipartisan priority in 2020 Congress must protect federal watchdogs MORE ( R - Okla . ) blocked the bill in March because it was n’t paid for .
Democrats said the benefits are emergency spending that does not need to be funded like other expenses , but Republicans say that approach is irresponsible .
The GOP is positioning itself to avoid a repeat of its public - relations defeat a month ago , when Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) took a similar stance against extending unemployment benefits .
In the face of growing media coverage , Republicans splintered and Bunning backed down .
This time around , Republicans appear more united .

“ When are we going to start recognizing the need to live within our means ? ” Coburn said in a floor speech Monday .
“ We ’re going to hear that we ’ve always done it this way , that we ’ve passed three other short - term extensions , and that we called them emergencies so we would not have to pay for them .
I would say it is time we not do it the way we ’ve always done it , because the way we ’ve always done it has gotten us $ 12.6 trillion in debt . ”
Democrats ramped up their promotional efforts preceding Monday ’s vote , targeting Republicans as obstructionists .

Over the years , I have had the opportunity and pleasure of working on a wide variety of cars and trucks .
The ones with hydraulic suspension systems were some of my all time favorites .
It combined huge amounts of electricity ( 8 - 10 Car batteries in 1 vehicle ) and the unimaginable power of hydraulics .
The hostile symphony that appeared when these two forces came together made for months of non stop entertainment .
We bounced cars around , lifted 1 wheel off the ground for “ 3 - wheel motion ” , dragged them around , and laughed hysterically at just how ridiculous it all was .
Looking back , it was some of the most fun that I have ever had working on cars .
It was endless work , tons of money , long days , late nights , and I enjoyed every single second .
Pictured above is my friend Chris ’s old 1989 Chevy truck .
The amount of work put into that truck by he and I was unmeasurable .
From what I understand , it ’s gone from the earth for good , but the lessons learned from that truck will be around for decades to come .
Mental Note : 8 car batteries in parallel will liquify and throw a wrench more than your expect .
What is it about advanced capitalism that reproduces primitive Soviet - style customer service experiences ?
Mrs. K and I went shopping this morning and found a wallet on the floor .
It belonged to …well let ’s just call her “ Mrs. Smith ” for the sake of the story .
Mrs. Smith ’s purse was stuffed with pretty much every kind of plastic card you can imagine except for anything with a personal address or phone number on it .
But we thought that ’s not a problem .
Mrs. Smith is a Barclays Bank customer and we can just phone her telephone banking hotline and then Barclays can pass our phone number to Mrs. Smith and she can come and collect her purse .
Simple ; after all , what bank would n’t want to help a valued customer stressing out about her lost payment cards and personal data .
Or so we thought .
After the IVR labyrinth , we got a “ human ” .
Let ’s not name names , but imagine that he ’s called Edwin .
“ Hello Edwin , we ’d like to advise you that we ’ve found a purse belonging to one of your valued customers . ”
“ Yes madam … ”
“ Yes .
It does n’t have any of her personal contact details , so we phoned you . ”
“ Just drop the card into a local Barclay ’s branch . ”
“ Great idea , but it ’s a whole large purse full of lots of personal things and we know that she ’ll be worried about having lost it .
Please can you contact your customer to tell them the purse has been found and pass on our contact details . ”
“ One moment please … I ’m sorry madam , we do n’t do that . ”
“ But what about your valued customer wasting her whole Sunday trying to find her purse ?
Then spending Monday cancelling all her cards .
When you could just phone her now . ”
“ I ’m sorry madam .
It ’s company policy .
I suggest you hand it in at your local police station .
Causes of call centre customer service failure
How does a call centre end up being so utterly rubbish ?
Here are a few thoughts :
Employee micro-management expunging any sense of personal initiative or responsibility .
Compliance culture ditto .
Management of outsourced call - centres through strictly detailed service level agreements .
If management by target worked , the shops would be full of great products from North Korea .
They are n’t and it does n’t .
Badly scoped outsourcing arrangements and strict silos between inbound and outbound teams .
Outsourced call - centres are often run as projects .
The essence of good project management is to deliver exactly what ’s expected .
The essence of good service management is to deliver above expectations .
These are two opposite management “ values ” .
Over Sunday lunch , we imagined Mrs. Smith cancelling the rest of her day in a futile search for her purse .
While Edwin clocked up another exemplary day of customer service by handling our call in less than 60 seconds .
We ’ve left the text of this blog post in Mrs.
Smith ’s purse so that she can discuss the meaning of customer service with her bank .
Eli Roth Takes to MySpace , Defends Peaches Geldof Against Her One Night Stand's Mommy
One week after Reddit user thatcoolguyben posted about his heroin laced one night stand with ( with pictures verifying his story ) , , the 21 year - old 's horror director boyfriend , addresses the issue with no one other than ...
Meredith Bluett - Mills .
Thatcoolguyben 's mother .
On MySpace .
Writing on his blog on April 2nd , 2010 , , 37 , lashed out against Bluett - Mills , calling her son a liar , " deeply troubled , " and suggested that his actions are " sociopathic . "
He insists that thatcoolguyben , 23 , took details from past stories of Peaches ' drug troubles , but claims she is clean now .
noted thatcoolguyben 's own troubled history , from holding a girl hostage at knife point in her dorm , to witness tampering , to being kicked out of Drew University .
Here is the letter in full : April 2nd , 2010 To : Meredith Bluett - MillsFrom : Eli RothRe : Your son BenDear Meredith , You do n't know me , but my name is Eli Roth , and I am the boyfriend of a young woman named Peaches Geldof .
Her name might ring a bell , as .
If you do know Peaches , like many in America you probably know her from the gossip blogs as the daughter of Sir Bob Geldof .
However , in the United Kingdom people have been reading her newspaper columns and magazine articles since the time
If you lived in England you 'd also know her as not just a television presenter and fashion model , but you might have seen one of her three documentaries that aired on British television , the first of which she produced when she was 15 years old .
I realize this might be difficult for you to comprehend , as your 23 year old son Ben was expelled from Drew University and so far as I can tell makes a living as an " artist " , but Peaches accomplished all of this before the age of 21 .
Perhaps a need for attention at any cost drove Ben to write such a destructive story , but upon closer examination , Your son Ben appears to have a deeply troubled past with women , as internet searches show he was accused of holding a girl hostage at knifepoint , and was then later was accused of witness tampering in the ensuing trial .
Whether you choose to believe it or not , your son Ben is a liar .
There are photos of Ben drunk with Peaches , and he concocted a racy story which involved them using heroin .
I know you are quite familiar with how young adults can be irresponsible when alcohol is involved , as your son Jacob , who is the same age as Peaches , was once arrested for public drunkenness ( see # 3148 ) .
Ben posted his heroin - fueled sex story on a message board and then posted topless photos of them together as " proof , " and instantly his story was everywhere .
At first Peaches and I thought nothing of the posting - the story was simply too preposterous .
But look closely at the specifics of your son's story : he did not pick a drug associated with sex like ecstasy or cocaine , he chose heroin .
Why ?
Because not only has Peaches openly talked about drug use in her past , her mother tragically died from a heroin overdose when Peaches was young .
Ben 's story becomes much more salacious if he paints Peaches as heading down a similar path .
Peaches does not have a squeaky clean image by any means , in fact , she 's known for being brutally honest and open about her past mistakes in life .
Your son took details from Peaches teenage tabloid stories to make the story more believable , no matter how contrary they are to who she is today .
Imagine if I had a photo of Ben with a knife next to a girl and after some internet research posted a story that he had held yet another girl hostage at knifepoint ?
What if there were new photos of your son Jacob drunk and someone made up a story about how he was drunk in public again , and the press painted him as an alcoholic ?
Peaches lawyer immediately came out with a statement categorically denying the heroin accusations , but it was too late , your son had already done the damage .
Your son did not just post a false drug story on a message board .
And for what ?
Some psychotic story your son made up that people were all too ready to believe because it fell in line with stories from the past .
Stories your son clearly read before he made up that post .
He knew exactly what he was writing , the details were far too calculated .
And that made it all the more destructive .
These stories also send a dangerous message to anyone who has ever made a mistake , that no matter how you change someone can make up a sick story about you and everyone will revert to the worst image of your past .
The instantaneous connectivity of the internet spread this venom to newspapers all over the world , so now I am hoping this letter reaches you through the same medium .
The night Ben posted the photos a mutual acquaintance called him and asked him to take down the photos and the story , and Ben 's response was " Fuck off , " so clearly he was not bothered by what he did at the time .
I would send a copy to your at your Palo Alto address that I got from Jacob 's arrest on the internet , but I do n't know if you reside at that residence anymore .
Maybe by examining the person your son hurt , he would attempt to be more like Peaches and become an artist beyond hanging himself from meat hooks .
Ben writes such creative fiction , he could ask Peaches how she got her book deal .
Or perhaps like Peaches he could write for newspapers and magazines published around the globe , although even that 's getting difficult for Peaches now that your son has painted her as trouble with a hurtful story fabricated around details from a painful past .
I hope or your other children can help Ben realize the damage he has caused to ( yet another ? ) young woman , and teach him how to behave like a human being .
Perhaps you are the source of his anger , in which case I hope you both are able to find happiness without damaging other people 's lives .
Sincerely , Eli RothLos Angeles , California " Source 3 ( for the classy photo of Eli and his shnuggle bunny ) Thank you , Eli Roth , for your psych 101 analysis of your girlfriend 's one night fling and defending her innocence and honor .
I 'm sure you both can talk about the degradation of women by watching Hostel I &II together .
I see that like Stephenie Meyer , you used Microsoft Word 's thesaurus to your advantage .
It must be very hard for Peaches , leeching off her father 's fame and using nepotism to fuel her own .
This man is clearly destroying her life .
Poor little rich girl and her creeper boyfriend who goes after not the blogger , but his mother . : resubmitted with picture resized and cut added
Controversial anti-gay activist Dr. George Rekers , who is now embroiled in his own gay controversy after admitting to hiring a gay male prostitute to carry his bags on a European trip , was paid by a team of lawyers headed by Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum in a court case defending Florida ’s ban on gays adopting children .
Florida is the only state that bans all gays and lesbians from adopting children , though the ACLU is attempting to overturn the law .
Attorneys for McCollum paid Rekers at least $ 60,900 and perhaps as much as $ 87,000 for expert testimony in the appeal of the case .
But in his testimony , Rekers claimed gays make inferior and even dangerous parents and that adopted kids living in gay households , even after 10 years , would be better off removed from the home and placed with straight parents .
Here are some excerpts from that cross-examination by ACLU of New York 's James Esseks with Rekers on the stand :
Q . You have been retained as an expert witness for the State , correct ?
A. Yes .
Q. Before agreeing to be retained by the State , you insisted on getting a retainer , an advance payment from the state .
Is that correct ?
A. Yes .
Q. What was the amount of that advance payment ?
A. $ 60,900 .
Q . Do you intend to bill the State for more funds , in addition to that amount ?
A. Perhaps .
The Court : Was it 16 or 60 ?
Ms. Bass : $ 60,900 .
The Witness : Right , yeah , based on $ 300 an hour .
A source in the Department of Children and Family Services said Rekers ’ compensation went up to $ 87,000 .
Here is part of what the state got for all that money :
Q. Well , Dr. Rekers , earlier you testified that Native - Americans have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than the general population does , right ?
A. Yes .
Q . It ’s a very significantly elevated rate of alcohol abuse , I mean compared to the general population ?
A. Yes .
Q. So if Native - Americans have significantly higher rates of alcohol abuse , and if they also have significantly higher rates of psychiatric disorders , and if they also have higher rates of relationship instability , is that enough for you to say that all of a sudden they should be categorically excluded ?
The Court : I think you can add violence to that , as well .
The Witness : Yeah , violence , yeah .
Q . And violence , as well .
A. Yeah , if it turned out that a majority of the individuals in the Native - American population , that a majority of them were high risk for one of these things happening , as a lifetime prevalence , there could be a parallel rationale for excluding them , as adoptive parents , because it would be not only them , they would tend to hang around each other .
So the children would be around a lot of other Native - Americans , who are doing the same sorts of things , you know .
So it would be a high risk , and , in fact , since you can’t perfectly predict human behavior , the best you can do and the best the State can do is to look at risk levels , and if a particular kind of household poses multiple high risks for condition that would be detrimental for children , then that would be a rationale for excluding that group .
Miami-Dade County Judge Cindy Lederman later dismissed Rekers ’ testimony calling it “ far from neutral and unbiased . ”
She said “ Dr. Rekers ’ beliefs are motivated by his strong ideological and theological convictions ” and so Lederman could “ not consider his testimony to be credible nor worthy of forming the basis of public policy . ”
The ACLU , which is representing gay adoptive father Martin Gill , was stunned to hear Rekers ’ paid expert testimony .
Spokesman Brandon Hensler admitted to being amused by Rekers ’ current gay prostitute controversy .
And he further questions why Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum would hire Rekers as an expert witness .
" I can't know for sure what Bill McCollum knew or did n't know , ” said Hensler .
“ But in the end it is his responsibility .
He is the Attorney General and it is the Attorney General who is appealing this case . "
A ruling is expected any day .
Meanwhile , Rekers is disputing but not denying a New Times article that he hired a 20 - year - old male prostitute to accompany him on a trip to Europe .
Rekers was photographed carting the man 's bags through Miami International Airport this week after the two returned from the trip .
On a statement on his blog , written in the third person , Rekers denied having any sexual involvement with the younger man .
" Dr. Rekers did not even find out about his travel assistant 's internet advertisements offering prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress , " he wrote .
Leaders of two conservative groups Rekers helped run are now distancing themselves from him .
The National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) , which describes itself as “ a professional scientific organization dedicated to assisting individuals dealing with unwanted homosexual attractions , ” says “ we extend our sympathies .
“ NARTH takes seriously the accusations that have been made , and we are currently attempting to understand the details behind these press reports . ”

California will vote on an initiative this November to legalize marijuana .
It might even pass .
But it turns out that the pot growers of Humboldt County are having second thoughts about the whole thing :
Recently , “ Keep Pot Illegal ” bumper stickers have been seen on cars around the county .
In chat rooms and on blogs , anonymous writers predict that tobacco companies will crush small farmers and take marijuana production to the Central Valley .
With legalization , if residents do n’t act , “ we ’re going to be ruined , ” said Anna Hamilton , a radio host on KMUD - FM ( 91.1 ) in southern Humboldt County .
…. Legalization could take many forms .
But the conventional wisdom here is that fully legal weed might fetch no more than a few hundred dollars a pound , as more people grow it and police no longer pull up millions of plants a year .
Illegal marijuana “ is the government ’s best agricultural price - support program ever , ” said Gerald Myers , a retired engineer and former volunteer fire chief who moved to the county in 1970 .
“ If they ever want to help the wheat farmers , make wheat illegal . ”
I guess pot cultivation will be a little less fun when it becomes just another business .
On the other hand , surely there ’s a benefit to being able to go to sleep each night not worried about DEA agents busting down your door and hauling you off to prison ?
A large crowd gathered on the University of Michigan Diag for a rally to kick of the beginning of Hash Bash in Ann Arbor , Mich . on April 3 , 2010 .
Angela J. Cesere | AnnArbor.com
Hampered in recent years by waning interest and uncooperative weather , the first - weekend - of - April marijuana fest drew about 5,000 to the heart of downtown Ann Arbor Saturday .
The Hash Bash is back .
Before the weekend , emcee Adam Brook said weather , more than any other factor , would determine the size of the weekend 's crowd .
The weather did n't disappoint , reaching 70 degrees by noon before rain and wind set in at 1:30 p.m .
Diane Brown , a spokeswoman with the University of Michigan Department of Public Safety , said the crowd was larger than usual - but no problems occurred .
Campus officers made 10 arrests Saturday , all for marijuana possession .
One was a U - M student , Brown said .
The penalty for smoking pot at the Hash Bash varies greatly between campus and city property .
On city property , getting caught with a joint means a $ 25 fine ; on state property , it 's up to a year in jail .
Most hash bashers wait until the Monroe Street Fair on city streets to toke up .
But now that Michigan has a medical marijuana program allowing upward of 10,000 patients to smoke marijuana under the protection of state law , many others in the crowd took the liberty to smoke , whether on university property or not .
The Hash Bash began with a " High Noon " rally on the Diag .
From the steps of the Hatcher Graduate Library , Brook explained that campus police enforce state law , not the more liberal Ann Arbor statute .

Minutes later , Brook asked the medical marijuana patients in attendance to pull out their cards and their marijuana .
Not only did registered patients smoke with impunity , so too did many healthy - looking young people .
After an hour of speakers , including John Sinclair , the Hash Bash headed south to the Monroe Street Fair .
Vendors and a sound stage lined Monroe Street , and hundreds of people passed marijuana in ciphers on the lawn southeast of the Law Quad .
Now that marijuana has been approved for medicinal use in Michigan and in 12 other states , many at Saturday 's event pushed for full - blown legalization .
" California should be the model , " said James Peters of Decker , Mich .
" They 're talking about legalizing it outright - why should you have to be a patient to smoke ? "
Tommy Cummings of Westland said he was surprised Michigan even got to the point of legalizing medical marijuana .
Michigan is the only midwestern state that currently allows medical marijuana .
California , which pioneered medical marijuana in 1996 , is rallying momentum for a ballot initiative to legalize pot .
" Who could 've ever guessed it would get to this point ? "
Cummings asked .
" Why stop now - why not legalize it altogether ?
Look around .
It happens anyway . "

Formula 1 teams have decided to ban the controversial ' F - duct ' aerodynamic device pioneered by McLaren this year .
The device , which increases a car 's speed down the straights , has since been adopted by Ferrari and BMW Sauber but will no longer be allowed in 2011 .
It was controversial because some teams felt it contravened the rule that bans movable aerodynamic devices .
The vote to forbid it next year was taken at a meeting of teams ' organisation Fota on Sunday in Spain .
McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh , the chairman of Fota , confirmed to BBC Sport that the teams had voted to ban the systems .
Before the meeting , McLaren had written a letter to all the teams saying that they felt banning the system was the wrong thing to do .
But their plea was rejected .
The system - which McLaren actually call a ' J - switch ' within the team - works by channelling air through a hole in the monocoque in the cockpit area through the car and on to the rear wing .
This increases the airflow on to the wing and makes it ' stall ' , ie stopping it creating downforce .
The system is only used on the straights , where the reduction in downforce on the car reduces drag and makes the car able to reach a higher top speed .
It is operated by the drivers , who are able to open and close the hole at will .
McLaren drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton are understood to do so using their knees .
Ferrari 's system , by contrast , is operated by the driver 's left hand .
Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso has appeared at times in Spain to have only one thumb on the steering wheel as he operates the ' F - duct ' with one hand and changes the car 's brake balance with the other .
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said this had influenced the teams ' decision .
" It 's a clever piece of engineering and hats off to the guys who invented it , but some of the solutions this weekend look a little bit marginal when you see drivers driving with no hands basically .
So I think there is a safety issue and a cost issue to take into account . "
Alonso denied there was any inherent danger in how the Ferrari drivers were operating the system .
" I always have hands on the wheel , " the Spaniard said .
" All the drivers operate the brake balance these days , and the button for changing the front wing and there are other buttons as well .
I think there is nothing wrong with that . "

The hierarchy at Brawn were incensed at the way they felt that story was spun by Button 's camp , insisting they offered him more than he is getting from McLaren and claiming that the world champion was the one to break the partnership .
Button later admitted that he went to McLaren for " the challenge " and that Ross Brawn did want to keep him .

Following on earlier news that a California court would be releasing documents related to a search warrant for the lost next - generation iPhone that ended up in the hands ofhas now posted the full documents released by the court .
The documents indicate that 's Jason Chen was considered in the requests to be a suspect in three felonies , including purchase or receipt of stolen property , theft of trade secrets , and malicious damage to another person 's property ( the prototype iPhone ) valued at over $ 400 .
The documents also include testimony that Brian Hogan , the finder of the iPhone , had received $ 8,500 from Gizmodo for the device , with an additional bonus payment to be made if Apple releases the expected device this summer .
The affidavit from Detective Matthew Broad outlines a series of events , including a discussion with Apple executives which revealed that Hogan 's roommate had contacted Apple after Hogan connected the iPhone to her computer , fearing that the lost or stolen device would be traced back to her .
Hogan 's roommate cooperated fully with authorities and assisted them when Hogan and an acquaintance removed several pieces of evidence from his apartment .
The evidence , which included a desktop computer , USB flash drive and memory card , and stickers from the iPhone prototype , were found in a church , under a bush , and in a gas station parking lot .
Hogan 's roommate relates a story very similar to that previously related by Hogan to Gizmodo , suggesting that another bar patron had picked up the iPhone and given it to him thinking it was his .
It is unclear exactly how Apple engineer Gray Powell lost the iPhone , although he noted that the last thing he remembered was placing it in a bag he had brought with him to the bar .
The bag was later knocked over , and it is possible that the phone fell out at that time .
Hogan 's roommate also noted that she and other attempted to talk him out of selling the prototype iPhone by pointing to the effect it could have on Powell 's career , but he was unswayed .
Hogan reportedly said , " Sucks for him .
He lost his phone .
Should n't have lost his phone . "
The documents also include an email from Gizmodo editor Brian Lam to Apple CEO Steve Jobs in which he offered an explanation for his publication 's actions and expressed disappointment that Gizmodo had been receiving less attention from Apple than other media outlets recently .
The thing is , Apple PR has been cold to us lately .
It affected my ability to do my job right at iPad launch .
So we had to go outside and find our stories like this one , very aggressively .
Apple also documented damage to the prototype iPhone upon its return , noting that a ribbon cable had been broken , a screw had been inserted incorrectly causing an electrical short , snaps for the back plate had been broken , and several screws had been stripped .
Overall , the investigation remains ongoing and neither Chen nor Hogan has been charged in relation to the case .
The entire affidavit is fascinating to read and is available in its entirety ( PDF ) , via Wired .
I took my daughter to see the new My Little Pony : The Movie ( 2017 ) which I admit that I enjoyed as a daddy - daughter activity and since I ’m a brony myself , I got to see it on the big screen too .
My daughter loved it and I thought the film was ok , super safe plot with less of the charm of the show itself .
But serviceable for fans and kids .
How to win at online casino real money .
But what I wanted to talk about today is a repeating lesson from these predictable plots that it really should be a tv tropes ( but I could n’t find what it ’s called if it exists ) .
In both the History of England podcast and other historical stories there is this saying that comes up over and over again .
“ Always pay your mercenaries ! ” this is because if you do n’t , they ’re usually the ones with the physical power to clobber your untrustworthy ass back into the dirt and take your now liberated land , your treasury or anything of value as payment instead .
And it ’s happened A LOT in history .
Best personal loans online with no credit check .
In kids films and tv shows this trope is repeated over and over again .
It ’s a way to show how a second in command can flip sides from an untrustworthy big bad guy to the side of good .
Usually because the big bad has promised something and then either can’t deliver or just wo n’t because they believe their now unbeatable .
Les jeux de machine a sous pour gagner de l'argent .
I find the trope to be handled clumsily usually .
CBD oil for sale at low price .
It ’s wheeled in to fit in a plot that needs an about face , but it does n’t usually earn it .
This is because the big bad has to be very stupid .
Not just unusually cruel or nasty ( which is how it ’s framed ) but actually dumb .
This does n’t teach kids that there ’s a sense of trust and professionalism that your enemies will have between themselves , but that they ’re going to be unrealistic bumbling back stabbers .
( take note UK Tory party ! )
To have a good bad guy , they have to have motivation AND competence .
A thin plot will often have “ take over the world ” fill in for motivation and for competence , well that ’s a combination of sheer luck or destroying the competence of the good guys .
Thin narrative gruel when a writer employs both at the same time .
So if you feel like having a world where military conflict is going to appear from time to time , you have employ some military nous and really think about what a conflict would look like .
You do n’t have to have brutal murders in your pastel pony show , but you do have to imagine good and bad guys as competent agents able to deduce strategies and counter strategies .
Why do I expect so much from kids shows ?
Because I ’ve seen just how many great kids shows can be done right .
When watching Avatar the Last Airbender , did anyone think the Fire Lord Ozi was a fool who would n’t pay his generals or mercenaries ?
No .
We thought he ’d pay them and then set fire to us in our dreams , he ’s a scary SOB .
Even Azula kept her ‘ friends ’ close and only lost it when she tried to over power them with a fear base power play .
When Azula turned on people , it was earned , there was a journey the character had gone through and alienation seemed very likely as she misunderstood how politics is really played with friendships and rarely with threats .
So when I see the Storm King refuse to honour his agreement with Fizzlepop Berrytwist and cause her to switch sides and turn him to stone … well there just was n’t really anything developing that .
Storm King is a jerk , but he ’s not earned anything because let ’s be honest the villains do n’t get much screen time and we just ca n’t understand their relationship at all .
We can only assume that the Storm King has no idea how to pay mercenaries , despite seemingly being in charge of both a sizeable army and long term control of a sizeable amount of land .
All things that require logistical competence .
So .
Do n’t have invading armies if you ca n’t read military basics and a bit of history .
That ’s all I ’m saying .
Or at least , read the Saxon invasion of England for ideas about how defaulting your mercenaries will play out .
This is the kind of game where the losing side will be described as ‘ brave ’ in the headlines , but tonight , maybe Fulham were not brave enough .
The game was decided by a scrappy late goal , and Fulham will feel unfortunate to have lost – but the reality is that Atletico were the better side , and the one who showed more attacking intent throughout .
Atletico ’s formation was as expected – the only slight question was who would start at right - back , where Tomas Ujfalusi got the nod .
The two central midfielders sat deep , knocking passes out to either flank , whilst Sergio Aguero had a free role and tended to drift to the left , whilst Diego Forlan played relatively deep for a central striker , confusing the Fulham backline with his movement .
Fulham were also largely as anticipated , and also saw a slight surprise right - back , with Chris Baird in for John Pantsil .
A half - fit Bobby Zamora led the line , Zoltan Gera played just behind him , with Dickson Etuhu playing deep infront of the Fulham defence .
Although Atletico started the game on top , Fulham defended well early on .
Baird stuck to Simao Sabrosa , and Paul Konchesky was tight on Jose Antonio Reyes , giving the Atletico wide players no time or space on the ball to spin and run at the Fulham defence .
The marking on the centre - forwards was slightly less tight – Forlan was tracked across the pitch reasonably strictly by Brede Hangeland , but Sergio Aguero was given slightly more freedom when dropping deep , and he was Atletico ’s biggest threat throughout the match .
Fulham were occasionally threatening when getting forward .
There was little subtlety to their attack - long balls forward to Zamora was the name of the game , and two of his knock - downs created half - chances on the edge of the area for Simon Davies , whose runs in from the left were a clear threat , and Zoltan Gera .
The full - backs on either side were rarely getting forward to support the inverted wingers , which led to a fairly narrow game .
The first time a Fulham full - back did get into an attacking position , however , resulted in Atletico taking the lead .
Konchesky was caught high up the pitch , and Jose Antonio Reyes sprinted into the space he had vacated – the first time Atletico were really able to counter and use their pace .
The ball eventually found its way to Aguero , whose scuffed volley was diverted in by Diego Forlan .
Fulham responded fairly quickly when Davies again took up a good position inside the box and finished well – and although the move initially seemed to have broken down and Fulham were slightly fortunate to get a second opportunity to shoot , credit should go to them for getting four men into the box , and for having faith in their ability to engineer a second chance .
It was a difficult game to call at half - time , but arguably the decisive moment came when Fulham had to replace Zamora , and bring on Clint Dempsey .
Zamora is clearly unfit and did well to struggle through the first half , but Fulham ’s gameplan was forced to change , and they looked less comfortable with Dempsey on .
A major problem appeared to be tiredness .
Fulham seemed to hit a brick wall after 60 or 70 minutes , and whereas Zamora ’s ability to hold the ball up and buy time may have seen them get away with it , Dempsey ’s desire for neater link - up play was testing the energy levels of Davies and Damien Duff , and Fulham simply could n’t get enough men forward into attack .
There was one instance in the second half where Gera and Dempsey briefly found themselves with the ball and with space to run into , but when they looked to the flanks , Davies and Duff were thirty yards behind them and clearly exhausted .
It was also disappointing that Fulham did n’t try a simple ball in behind the defence more often – the one time they did , Gera would have been in on goal but for a heavy first touch .
This Atletico side is far from solid defensively – 58 goals conceded in 37 league games this season – but Fulham did n’t test their back four enough , especially in the final hour .
That said , the Spanish side did n’t deserve to be infront either , for they were not creating enough themselves .
The fact that Qique Sanchez Flores replaced his two wide players , Simao and Reyes , speaks volumes , especially considering the relative lack of attacking intent from the two central midfielders in their system .
The game was as tense and tight as you would expect , which made for a decent spectacle , but in the end it was two similar sides cancelling each other out – similar to Fulham ’s game in this stadium in the semi-final against Hamburg .
The similarity in shapes meant that there were no free players on the pitch , but the man who found himself with most time on the ball was the Atletico right - back , Ujfalusi .
He constantly found himself in space on the right - hand side ( especially after the introduction of Erik Nevland pushed Gera to left - wing ) but was ponderous on the ball and his delivery was poor .
If Atletico had a rampaging right - back to provide a real threat , they surely would have wrapped the game up , but Ujfalusi ( comfortable at full - back , but a centre - back by trade ) was not the man to unlock the Fulham defence ) .
As the game went into extra-time , Fulham were hanging on .
Murphy continued to retain the ball well , but Dempsey and Nevland gave it away too cheaply , and Fulham ’s back four had no respite .
Hangeland in particular looked on the verge of collapse , and Aguero hit the side - netting from a yard out just before half - time in extra-time .
With Fulham ’s tiredness plain to see , it ’s hard to imagine why Hodgson did n’t use his final substitution until the 28th minute of extra-time , when Fulham had conceded .
Maybe he did n’t want to lose his shape ( or was keeping penalty - takers on the field ) , but when the ten outfield players were so exhausted , a bit of energy was required – telling Jonathan Greening to come on and simply run his legs off for half an hour surely would have been a better option than persisting with the awfully tired Gera , for example .
Atletico ’s winner came in slightly fortunate circumstances , and it was the Aguero - Forlan partnership again which proved deadly .
Forlan ’s strikes to defeat Fulham were reminiscent of the way Pippo Inzaghi pounced twice for Milan to defeat Liverpool in a European final in 2007 – there was more than a shade of luck about the goals , but deep down , you know that the ’ sixth sense ’ goalpoachers like Inzaghi and Forlan possess means you must give credit to them for being in the right place at the right time .
Fulham ’s inevitable response was to shove Hangeland upfront and hit long balls – and they looked rather dangerous in those two minutes with the Norweigan upfront , as if to emphasize how much they missed the focal point of Zamora .
A little bit of luck in the penalty area and the game could have been so different , but even the fiercest Fulham supporter must concede that Atletico were always more likely to get that luck , simply because they got the ball into the area more often .

Stolen Head of Philip K. Dick Android Discovered in Russian Pirate Bust
The missing head of the Philip K. Dick android has finally been discovered in St. Petersburg , confiscated in an Interpol sting against the Russian software piracy syndicate " Little Bear . " " They were using the head basically as a portable hard drive to transport pirated ebooks , movies , games , and data between Russia and South America , " said Detective Andrei Supernov .
" I think they thought it was funny .
" Worth over $ 25,000 , the head is able to conduct conversations , recognize faces in a crowd , make eye - contact , and quote long passages from Dick 's own body of work , downloaded into the head with permission from the Dick Estate .
The head has been missing for over four years , ever since its creator , computer scientist David Hanson , left it on a plane during a press junket for the film " A Scanner Darkly . " From the New York Times After a lawsuit against America West in 2008 went nowhere , Hanson had given up hope on ever recovering the PKD head .
" I figured it was a paperweight somewhere , " said Hanson .
" Or worse : in some landfill .
" Interpol has been investigating the Russian pirate syndicate " Little Bear " for eight months , and only came upon the head last weekend after rousting a St. Petersburg travel agent who was serving as their Russian front .
"
We were just as surprised as anyone to find this thing , " said Detective Supernov .
" At first I thought the head was real and I was sick to my stomach .
Then they told me it was a computer , and so I was going smash it in front of them to prove a point about computer crime .
But then they told me how much it was worth .
" Investigators still have no idea how " Little Bear " managed to intercept the head en route between San Francisco and Las Vegas .
The head will be returning to the United States next week , where it will be rejoined with the body .
"
Unfortunately , Little Bear erased all the Dick stories in order to make room for stolen movies and video games , " said Detective Supernov .
" Now the head quotes episodes of " Three 's Company . "
Remember Chrome OS , Google 's stripped - to - the - browser operating system ?
It 's reportedly ready for prime time , with Chrome OS devices from Acer leading the way .
Acer will launch some kind of Chrome OS hardware in two weeks , at the Compudex Taipei trade show , according to VentureBeat 's unnamed sources .
The report does n't say what kind of devices will be revealed -- Acer previously said it would be first with a Chrome OS netbook -- but netbooks , smartbooks and tablets are all possibilities .
It 's also not clear when the Chrome OS products will actually ship .
Google demonstrated Chrome OS in November .
If you 've ever used the Chrome Web browser -- or any Web browser for that matter -- you 've got a pretty good idea of what Chrome OS is like .
It 's a glorified browser , with app icons linking to Web sites , and very little in the way of local storage .
The idea is that most people spend most of their computing time on the Web , so why not throw out everything else and concentrate on that ?
( Click on the image for a closer look at the Chrome interface . )
A June teaser of Chrome OS devices fits nicely within the timetable that Google announced last year , but it still feels like ages since we were debating the merits of such an operating system .
So much has happened since Google demoed Chrome OS , in both software and hardware , that it feels like the original vision for a fast , light and secure operating system is no longer such a mind - blowing idea .
For instance , Apple launched the iPad in April , and hardware makers are scrambling to compete with their own tablets .
The iPad turns on instantly and flies through the Internet , which is exactly what Chrome OS wants to do , and it does lots of things offline as well .
Then there was the rise of Android , which last quarter beat Apple 's iPhone in sales share for the first time .
Android seems like an ideal tablet OS , as its app marketplace would scale up nicely and hook the people who already own Android phones .
Meanwhile , debates abound on whether the netbook is dying .
I do n't think the evidence supports an imminent death of netbooks , and in any case the line between netbooks and small laptops is increasingly blurry .
Still , a Chrome OS netbook does n't seem as cutting - edge as it did last November .
Where does that leave Chrome OS ?
An instant - on smartbook with killer battery life could be fun , but the important thing is that the Web - based operating system arrives , period .
I think of Chrome OS as an experiment , a look ahead to when fast Internet connections are always available , and when Web apps can truly replace native software .
We 're not there yet , but I 'd love to see what it 's like .

Tale - Yax , a 32 - year old native from Guatemala , acted as a hero when he tried to rescue a woman from a knife - wielding thug in Queens at 5:40 am .
The rescue attempt resulted in the him being repeatedly stabbed in the chest by the thug .
He fell down on the sidewalk in a pool of blood but interestingly more than 25 cold - hearted pedestrians walked across him without doing anything .
One even took pictures with their cellphone .
The 911 call was placed at 7:23 a.m. , almost 2 hours after the incidence .
“ That should n’t have happened , ” said Hugo Alfredo Tale - Yax ’s cousin , Edwin Tacam .
“ Hugo would n’t have done that . ”
The native of Guatemala had eked out a living doing odd jobs but was out of work and had recently lost his home .
“ He lost his life trying to help someone else .

This weekend , up to 300 Newegg customers who pulled the trigger on a new Intel Core i7 - 920 processor found themselves puzzling over a clever fake instead .
Who 's to blame ?
It 's not exactly clear -- Newegg initially said that the processors were " demo units , " but has now posted a statement to Facebook saying that supplier IPEX shipped counterfeit chips and has had its contract revoked .
That 's good news for D&H Distributing , another Newegg supplier that responded to an initial wave of finger - pointing by issuing legal nastygrams to sites covering the story , thus ruining whatever good vibes the truth 's generated .
Finally , here 's the statement Intel just sent us , explaining in no uncertain terms that these are counterfeit parts :
" Intel has been made aware of a limited number of counterfeit i7 920 packages in the marketplace , specifically Newegg , and is working to how many and / or where they are being sold .
The examples we have seen are not Intel products but are counterfeits .
Buyers should contact their place of purchase for a replacement and / or should contact their local law enforcement agency if the place of purchase refuses to help .
Intel is getting samples to inspect and until then we can say that everything in the package appears fake .
Some of the photos of the processor look like it is a casting and not even a real processor of any kind .
Newegg has moved quickly to replace the suspect units . "
No matter who 's at fault here , the damage has been done .
We 'll never build another PC without losing precious seconds carefully examining its CPU first .

Okay , so the last time we told you about an inexpensive Android tablet / MID things did n't turn out so well .
So , this time we bring you one to appreciate from afar -- no credit card needed nor , as you 'll see , wanted .
It 's seven - inch , 800 x 480 device from Eken that is selling for $ 680 RMB in China .
That translates to $ 99.53 currently that , at first glimpse , looks to be quite a bargain .
Sure , it has only 2GB of storage , but you can expand that to 32 GB with SD .
The VIA 8505 processor certainly wo n't be confused for a Snapdragon but despite that the device pledges only two hours of battery life on a charge .
To top it off it 's stuck with good 'ol Android 1.5 installed , leaving us to conclude that this is hardly a bargain after all .
Shucks .

Just thinking of these dust mites living in your pillow by the millions , eating your dead skin and hair is enough to make you sick ( literally and figuratively ) .
The are a major cause of asthma and allergies ; especially in vulnerable individuals , such as children and the elderly .
According to the American College of Asthma , Allergy & Immunology , approximately 10 percent of Americans exhibit allergic sensitivity to dust mites .
The American Lung Associations tells us " Dust mites are not parasites ; they do n't bite , sting or burrow into our bodies .
The harmful allergen they create comes from their fecal pellets and body fragments .
Dust mites are nearly everywhere ; roughly four out of five homes in the United States have detectable levels of dust mite allergen in at least one bed . "
Do n't you feel better now , know they do n't bite or sting ; and your allergic reaction is only due to burying your face in a pillow full of their feces ?
And you may feel better knowing , according to WebMD , that " Dust mites like to eat dead skin from pets and humans .
You probably shed enough skin a day to feed a million dust mites . "
In the spring , pollen aggravates allergies , and dustmite infestations make it worse .
The Fall and Winter months are a particular problem , as we close up our houses and the concentrations of dust mites and their feces increases inside .
And with dustmites at their multiplying peak during warm , wet weather , read on to find out what you can do about dust mites !
House dust mites are microscope bugs that primarily live on dead skin cells regularly shed from humans and their animal pets .
Dust mites are generally harmless to most people .
They do n't carry diseases , but they can cause allergic reactions in asthmatics and others who are allergic to their feces .
People sometimes confuse dustmites with bed bugs .
See this page about bed bugs and if you are going to a hotel or motel , check this page for tips specific to staying in hotels and motels .
Skin cells and scales , commonly called dander , are often concentrated in lounging areas , mattresses , frequently used furniture and associated carpeted areas , often harbor large numbers of these microscopic mites .
Since the average human sloughs off 1/3 ounce ( 10 grams ) of dead skin a week .
That gives dust mites a lot to eat .
Cats and dogs create far more dander for dust mites to eat .
A typical mattress can contain tens of thousands of dust mites .
Sick yet ?
Nearly 100,000 mites can live in one square yard of carpet .
Ready to convince your spouse to start bathing regularly ?
Did you know a single dust mite produces about 20 waste droppings each day , each containing a protein to which many people are allergic .
Yuck !
The proteins in that combination of feces and shed skin are what cause allergic reactions in humans .
Depending on the person and exposure , reactions can range from itchy eyes to asthma attacks .
And finally , unlike other types of mites , house dust mites are not parasites , since they only eat dead tissue .
Gross , but true .
Common Name Scientific Name North American House Dust Mite Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes European House Dust Mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ( Trouessart )
Beds are a prime habitat ( where 1/3 of life occurs ) .
A typical used mattress may have anywhere from 100,000 to 10 million mites inside .
( Ten percent of the weight of a two year old pillow can be composed of dead mites and their droppings . )
Mites prefer warm , moist surroundings such as the inside of a mattress when someone is on it .
A favorite food is dander ( both human and animal skin flakes ) .
Humans shed about 1/5 ounce of dander ( dead skin ) each week .
About 80 percent of the material seen floating in a sunbeam is actually skin flakes .
Also , bedroom carpeting and household upholstery support high mite populations .
The University of Manchester performed a 2005 medical study of pillows that found up to 16 species of fungi in a single pillow .
They tested feather and synthetic pillows in a range of ages , finding thousands of spores of fungus per gram of pillow ; more than is found on an average used toothbrush .
And just when you thought they were confined to your home and bedroom , there is a news story in USA Today in which Jill Holdsworth is an infection preventionist and president of the DC Metro Chapter of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says the car can be another place where dust mites live and a very big place to pass bacteria back and forth if you are not careful , saying " The No. 1 hot spots would be anywhere that you touch with your hands , " Holdsworth said .
These areas include the steering wheel , radio , gear shift , cup holders and car seats . "
For most people , while they are disgusting , house dust mites are not actually harmful .
However , the medical significance of house dust mites arises because their microscopic cast skins and feces are a major constituent of house dust that induces allergic reactions in some individuals .
There is a genetic predisposition to dust mite allergies , but like many allergies it can also develop over time .
According to Darryl C. Zeldin , acting director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Services , in the Wall Street Journal ( January 5 , 2010 , Page D2 ) , 18 % to 30 % of Americans are allergic to dust mites ' waste products , and almost 50 % of American homes have allergen levels that are high enough to cause sensitivity in people who were nt previously allergic to dustmites .
In other words , high levels of dust mites and their wastes , can cause previously non-allergic people to develop an allergy .
In addition to producing allergic reactions , dust mites can also cause nasal polyps growths within the nose ( see this article at 24 Medica ) .
The constituents of house dust are show in the following figure :
Organisms in household dust :
Constituents of House Dust * ash , cigarette ; ash , incinerator ; combustion products ; fiber , synthetic textile ; fibers : wool , cotton , paper and silk ; fingernail filings ; food crumbs ; glass particles ; glue ; graphite ; hair , human and animal ; insect fragments ; oil soot ; paint chips ; plant parts ; pollen ; polymer foam particles ; salt and sugar crystals ; skin scales , humans ; skin scales , pets ; soil ; spores , fungal ; stone particles ; tobacco ; wood shavings * Drawn primarily from van Bronswijk , 1981 .
For those individuals , inhaling the house dust allergen triggers rhinitis allergica or bronchial asthma .
People with allergies to house dust usually also have allergic reactions to house dust mite fecal material and cast skins .
Studies have shown that the most potent house dust allergens can be extracted from the feces produced by dust mites .
Other important allergen - producing organisms that are found in house dust are found in Figure 1 .
The rest of this fact sheet , based on Chapter 10 , " Mites , " in Common - Sense Pest Control by Olkowski , Daar and Olkowski , will discuss biology of dust mites and will emphasize non-chemical control tactics .
An allergist , a medical doctor specially trained to treat allergies , should be consulted for proper diagnosis and treatment of allergies .
One of the most strongly allergenic materials found indoors is house dust , often heavily contaminated with the fecal pellets and cast skins of House Dust Mites .
Estimates are that dust mites may be a factor in 50 to 80 percent of asthmatics , as well as in countless cases of eczema , hay fever and other allergic ailments .
Common causes of allergy include house dust mites , cat dander , cockroach droppings and grass pollen .
Symptoms are usually respiratory in nature ( sneezing , itching , watery eyes , wheezing , etc. ) , usually NOT A RASH .
However , there are reports of a red rash around the neck .
Other allergic reactions may include headaches , fatigue and depression .
The wheeze - inducing proteins are digestive juices from the mite gut which are quite potent .
An exposure to the mites in the first , crucial year of life can trigger a lifelong allergy .
There is no cure , only prevention .
One must control house dust mite levels .
Beds are a prime habitat ( where 1/3 of life occurs ) .
A typical used mattress may have anywhere from 100,000 to 10 million mites inside .
( Ten percent of the weight of a two year old pillow can be composed of dead mites and their droppings . )
Mites prefer warm , moist surroundings such as the inside of a mattress when someone is on it .
A favorite food is dander ( both human and animal skin flakes ) .
Humans shed about 1/5 ounce of dander ( dead skin ) each week .
About 80 percent of the material seen floating in a sunbeam is actually skin flakes .
Also , bedroom carpeting and household upholstery support high mite populations .
How to Recognize the Symptoms of Allergies to Dust Mites
The protein substances in the dust mite feces produces antibodies in humans who are allergic when these are inhaled or touch the skin .
These antibodies cause the release of histamines which causes to nasal congestion , swelling and irritation of the upper respiratory passages .
The Mayo Clinic , WebMD and NIH collectively provide this list of typical symptoms of an allergy to dust mites ;
You may experience all or just some of them :
Hay fever ,
Watering eyes ,
Runny nose ,
Sneezing ,
Asthma , difficulty in breathing ,
Infantile eczema
Itchy , red or watery eyes
Nasal congestion
Itchy nose , roof of mouth or throat
Postnasal drip
Cough
Facial pressure and pain
Frequent awakening
Swollen , blue - colored skin under your eyes
In a child , frequent upward rubbing of the nose
A doctor can use skin tests and blood tests to confirm a suspected dust mite allergy .
In a news story in the New York Times ( March 4 , 2011 ) Dr. Diego Saporta , an otolaryngologist in Elizabeth , N.J. , who specializes in allergy management . , says to ask :
Do I have persistent sniffles and sinus headaches ?
Do I often wake up with scratchy eyes ?
Do I sneeze repeatedly first thing in the morning ?
" Sometimes symptoms are obvious , but sometimes they are subtle , " said Dr. Saporta says .
" Your only symptom might be chronic nasal congestion . "
What else makes the symptoms worse ?
Poor ventilation
High humidity
High temperatures ( above 70 F / 20 C )
Indoor air pollution such as tobacco smoke or car fumes .
Walking over a rug , sitting down in a chair , or shakings the bed clothes , makes the dried dust mite feces become airborne , making allergic person 's symptoms worse .
House dust mites , are too small to be visible to the naked eye ; they are only 250 to 300 microns in length and have translucent bodies .
It takes at least a 10X magnification to be able to correctly identify them .
The adult mite 's cuticle ( covering ) has simple striations that can be seen from both the dorsal ( top ) view and from the ventral ( bottom ) view .
The ventral view of the house dust mite reveals long setae ( hairs ) extending from the outer margins of the body and shorter setae on the rest of the body .
Through the microscope , one will see many oval - shaped mites scuttling around and over one another .
There are eight hairy legs , no eyes , no antennae , a mouthpart group in front of the body ( resembles head ) and a tough , translucent shell , giving a " fearsome appearance . "
Adult females lay up to 40 to 80 eggs singly or in small groups of three to five .
After eggs hatch , a six - legged larva emerges .
After the first molt , an eight - legged nymph appears .
After two nymphal stages occur , an eight - legged adult emerges .
The life cycle from egg to adult is about one month with the adult living an additional one to three months .
The diet is varied with the primary food source , consisting of dander ( skin scales ) from humans and animals .
However , needed nutrients can be provided from fish food flakes , pet food , fungi , cereals , crumbs , etc .
Many mite species live in bird 's nests , in barns , among stored grain , straw , etc .
House dust mites are cosmopolitan in distribution with much of the research previously done in Europe .
One of the major limiting factors in mite survival and population development is the availability of water for sorption .
Highest mite densities occur in the humid summer months and lowest in drier winter periods .
Dust mite populations are highest in humid regions and lowest in areas of high altitude and / or dry climates .
Due to the large quantity of skin scales sloughed off daily by humans , mites have an abundant food supply .
Dust mite antigen levels are measured in bed dust , floor dust , and room air samples .
Detection in room air was best during cleaning and bed - making activities .
House dust mite presence is often suspected before they are actually seen and accurately identified .
Requests for control often come from individuals who have been diagnosed by medical personnel as allergic to the house dust mite or the allergens produced .
The presence of house dust mites can be confirmed microscopically which requires collecting samples from mattresses , couches or carpets .
Also , it requires the use of a microscope with sufficient magnification and the technical ability to recognize house dust mites under the microscope .
In general practice , testing is unnecessary .
dustmites are extremely common in household environments .
They virtually always show up in a test , so testing just adds expense .
A better question than " are dust mites present ? " is " How can I control or remove them ? "
What Can You Do ?
A number of researchers , like those at the University of Nebraska , have studied dust mite control and have a set of recommendations that are proven to be effective .
Recommendations focus on " dust control . "
One must reduce the concentration of dust borne allergens in the living environment by controlling both allergen production and the dust which serves to transport it .
For the bedroom environment you will want to use some or all of the following methods .
We have listed them in order of practicality combined with effectiveness . :
The most effective means is to enclose the mattress top and sides with a plastic cover or other dust mite impervious cover ( available here , click on allergy bedding on the left in the new page ) , thoroughly vacuuming mattress pillows and the base of the bed .
Put an airtight plastic or polyurethane cover over your mattress .
This is the method recommended by Consumer Reports ( see their article here ) .
This tip is number one for a reason : it is in your bed ( including the baby 's crib ) that you are closest to the mites and their feces and enclosing the mattress and pillows in a dust mite cover virtually eliminates the mites here .
like the dustmite - proof fitted sheets .
Mattresses covered with " fitted sheets " help prevent the accumulation of human skin scales on the surface .
These sheets have the advantage of being waterproof , too , which helps protect your mattress from spills , babies and toddler 's waste , too .
Reduce temperature and humidity : Dust mites love warm , humid conditions , above 70 F ( 21 C ) and 50 % or greater humidity .
Temperature : Keep the thermostat in the house below 70 degrees .
Humidity : The National Institute of Health says an effective control of mites would require the maintenance of relative humidity 's below 50 percent .
Here is a range of dehumidifiers from a large basement or ground floor model , to a small room model .
The big ones are pricey , but they last for many , many years .
( we have one in the office that is 20 years old ! )
A study ( Feb 2005 ) by Kingston University ( London UK ) shows that simply by leaving your bed unmade each morning , with the sheets to be exposed to the air , allows the sheets to dry out , and substantially reduces the numbers of dust mites .
Now , you have a legitimate reason not to make your bed !
Some researchers feel it is important to focus on decreasing indoor humidity , especially during the winter period to reduce dust mite populations .
One might forsake humidifier use during winter periods ( or limit it to the bedroom only at night , then ventilate the room during the day ) .
It will help to use dehumidifiers during high - humidity periods , or use central air conditioning .
So if you use a humidifier in the winter , adjust it to produce 35 % to 45 % humidity .
Some humidifiers have this control built in ; with others , you 'll need a humidity gauge ( usually sold with a thermometer at Costco , Sam's Club , Wal - Mart , Target , etc. ) .
And generally , homes that have their air conditioners on constantly in the summer and dry heat in the winter have lower mite counts than non-air conditioned homes .
Wash your sheets , pillows and blankets in very hot water .
Wash the sheets and blankets at least every two weeks .
Wash your pillow every week or put a dust mite - proof cover ( available here ) on it and wash once per year .
Your pillowcase goes over the dust mite cover .
How hot is hot ?
The water used to wash your sheets and blankets should be at least 130 F ( 54 C ) .
Set your washing machine to it 's hottest setting .
If the water does n't seem to be coming out hot , you may want to check your hot water heater - you may not realize that most household hot water heaters have a knob that can adjust the temperature of the water it produces .
For fabrics that may not be washed in hot water ; just pop it into the freezer for 24 to 48 hours to kill dust mites .
And for those who travel and stay in hotels ( or with less hygienic friends and family ) :
Take a dust mite impervious cover ( available here ) , along for when you stay at hotels - just think how disgusting their pillows must be !
Use Synthetic fabrics : Replace feather and down pillows with those having synthetic fillings .
Replace woolen blankets with nylon or cotton cellulose ones .
And do n't forget the children 's stuffed animals : be sure to get washable stuffed animals in the future !
Memory foam mattress manufacturers claim that their mattresses create an environment that is unfavorable to dust mites .
Even so , an encasement ( dust mite impervious cover ) is still advised , also because it can stop bedbugs ( which are a rapidly growing problem ) Clean weekly :
Weekly change pillowcases , sheets , and under blankets , and vacuum the bed base and around the covered mattress .
Clean flooring : Use a damp mop or rag to remove dust .
Never use a dry cloth or broom , since this just stirs up mite allergens .
Clean daily : Daily damp dust the plastic mattress cover .
Frequently wash all bedding ( blankets , mattress pads and comforters ) in hot water ( 130 degrees F [ or 60 C ] weekly ) .
Cold and warm water wo n't kill mites .
Also wash curtains .
Steam clean surfaces and materials that cannot put put through the washing machine :
Using pure steam dissolves dirt and grime , while removing germs and bacteria from the surfaces that you 're cleaning .
Steam is also an economical and environmentally friendly thing to do .
There is no longer the need to use harsh and toxic chemicals .
It is also a great way to kill dust mites and bed bugs .
See this steam cleaner : New Vapamore MR100 Primo Steam Cleaner .
Remove carpeting and install laminate flooring , wood , tile , linoleum , or vinyl floor covering .
Remove cloth drapes and blinds .
( If you have carpet , vacuum every day . )
Vacuuming your carpets and upholstery every week can help .
See the caution about vacuuming below under tips .
Vacuums with high - efficiency filters pick up more dust mites , but even standard vacuums work well enough .
Freezing and sunlight kills mites but does not remove their residue .
In addition to freezing temperatures and washing items in temperatures greater than 130 degrees F , extended exposure to sunlight , and low levels of humidity also destroy the mites .
Children 's soft cloth toys :
Regularly place soft toys in the freezer for 24 hours before you wash them , or wash them in hot water .
Removing them , or at least reducing the numbers of them on the beds , will help , too .
Air Purifiers :
While it is better to stop the dust mites at the source , reducing the dust levels in the air is a good secondary measure .
Some pest control firms sell air purifiers to eliminate the food source of house dust mites .
Although ozone air purifiers emit a low level of ozone ( activated oxygen ) that attaches to fungus , mold , and bacteria on skin flakes , EHSO does not recommend ozone generators ( neither does the US Food and Drug Administration ) .
The same ozone that is oxidizes the dust mites is bad for your health .
Air purifiers that use HEPA filtration are more effective and safe to use .
Various types of air purifiers can be attached to the central air return to decrease irritants .
Most filters remove 50 to 70 percent of material .
HEPA filters will remove up to 99 percent of the material ; not just dust mite feces , but also all types of other allergens , like animal dander , dust , pollen , cockroach feces , etc ...
See this page for information about selecting an air purifier .
Furnace Air Filters : Clean or replace the air filters on your furnace or air conditioner at least once a month .
Filters that are rated to trap allergens are obviously more effective than plain spun glass .
Services to Kill Dust Mites and Clean Mattresses ?
There are companies offering a service , using steam or ultraviolet light , to kill dust mites in mattresses and remove them .
The Wall Street Journal ( January 5 , 2010 , Page D2 ) had an article by Laura Johnnes titled " Does Mattress Cleaning Treat Dust - Mite Allergies ? "
Their conclusion , including that of Dr. Peyton Eggleston , a pediatric allergist and professor at Johns Hopkins Children 's Hospital in Baltimore , was that there is n't any scientific research or evidence to back up the service companies claims , and that the dust mites would probably return to previous levels within a month or two .
This substantiates the approaches above , including encasements ( see number 1 , above ) .
A cleaning might make sense if the mattress is fairly new ( 1 to 3 years ) and you encase it after the cleaning .
Multiple Allergies
It should also be noted that people are rarely allergic to only dust mites .
When a person has an allergy to dust mites , they are usually also allergic to other allergens .
In a report on WebMD ( April 2008 ) , Allergist Jonathan A. Bernstein , MD , of the University of Cincinnati says , " You have to recognize that people can be sensitive to multiple allergens -- as well as to non-allergic triggers such as odorants , irritating chemicals , tobacco smoke , mildew , and things of that nature , so these studies with just one or even two or three interventions are fraught with limitations .
Just to target dust mites and then to say these interventions do n't work is out of context with patients ' real lives . "
In that WebMD article , which initially implies that dust mite prevention methods are ineffective , the researchers insist that " reducing allergens in the home and in the office will help patients suffering from dust - mite allergy and asthma . "
They say reducing dust mites is a good place to start .
In other words , if you use methods that
reduce dust mite populations ,
trap dust in HEPA filter air purifiers ,
reduce humidity , which allows dustmites , molds , and other allergens to flourish ,
reduce surfaces that collect allergens ( curtains , carpets , etc. ) , and

Chemical Control
No pesticides are currently labeled for house dust mites .
However , two non-pesticide products , Acarosan and Allergy Control Solution are available for treatment of house dust mites and their allergens .
The active ingredient of each is benzyl benzoate and tannic acid .
Benzoic acid esters , such as benzyl benzoate , are very effective acaricides in both laboratory and field evaluations .
Health risks appear to be slight as benzoates are rapidly metabolized in the body to hippuric acid , which is excreted in the urine .
Most acaricidal studies for house dust mite control have been done in Europe .
Before pesticide recommendations are made in the United States , approval will be needed by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
For additional information , telephone 1-800 - 7ASTHMA .
( 800-727-8462 )
Get dustmite proof bedding covers , special laundry detergent , pillow cases , etc. .
This is one of our partners , and one of the few places we 've found that carries a range of dustmite proof covers and other materials :
Keep temperature under 70 and humidity levels below 50 percent .
Dust mites as well as other allergens thrive on high humidity .
Homes with air conditioning constantly have lower mite counts then non-air conditioned homes .
This can be accomplished with a couple of relatively inexpensive and long - lasting dehumidifiers .
These have the advantage of making the air more comfortable in the summer , reducing the need for air conditioning .
Wash bedding , rugs , children 's soft toys and pet 's bedding frequently
" Frequently " means at least every two weeks in very hot water .
Do n't be like these Brits : according to a news story in the Daily Mail , a poll suggests that " more than half a million Britons only wash their sheets three times a year , allowing some 10 million bugs and dust mites to settle in for a night cap alongside them . "
Keep the house clean
Dust mites , pollens , animal dander , and the allergy causing agents can be reduced , although not eliminated through regular cleaning .
Use a good HEPA vacuum .
Most non-HEPA vacuums actually cause the problem to worsen because the filter bags in most models are not efficient and cause allergen levels to rise .
A good HEPA vacuum , like the Hoover Wind Tunnel series will pick up at least some dust mites and their eggs and trap all it picks up .
Some vacuums are now being designed to kill dust mites .
Halo Technologies says its uprights , including the $ 400 UVX , kill dust mites , flea eggs , and germs using UV light .
Consumer Reports has n't yet tested those claims because this model was n't very good at the basic tasks of cleaning carpets and picking up pet hair .
Watch here for future developments .
Use a good air filter to remove airborne allergans - Most store bought air filters an not capable of trapping mites and their by - products .
One should also look for a filter that has anti-microbial properties , to prevent the filter from becoming a breeding ground for allergens .
Filters that call themselves " washable " should be avoided because it just is not possible to wash 100 % of the biological contaminants out of them and they will also become a breeding ground .
The Honeywell brand with inexpensive replaceable prefilters and long - lasting HEPA filters work well for us .
News Related to Dust Mites
March 2010 - Eco-Dustmite Home - The Telegraph , a large newspaper in the United Kingdom , has an interesting story about the dustmite - proof house that Britain 's biggest - ever lottery winners moved into .
It is a �4 million eco-palace with the humidity of the Sahara desert and a garden that stores heat from the sun .
The low humidity of the house was designed to defeat dust mites .

The integrity of climate research has taken a very public battering in recent months .
Scientists must now emphasize the science , while acknowledging that they are in a street fight .
Climate scientists are on the defensive , knocked off balance by a re-energized community of global - warming deniers who , by dominating the media agenda , are sowing doubts about the fundamental science .
Most researchers find themselves completely out of their league in this kind of battle because it 's only superficially about the science .
The real goal is to stoke the angry fires of talk radio , cable news , the blogosphere and the like , all of which feed off of contrarian story lines and seldom make the time to assess facts and weigh evidence .
Civility , honesty , fact and perspective are irrelevant .
“ Scientists must not be so naive as to assume that the data speak for themselves . ”
Worse , the onslaught seems to be working : some polls in the United States and abroad suggest that it is eroding public confidence in climate science at a time when the fundamental understanding of the climate system , although far from complete , is stronger than ever .
Ecologist Paul Ehrlich at Stanford University in California says that his climate colleagues are at a loss about how to counter the attacks .
“ Everyone is scared shitless , but they do n't know what to do , ” he says .
Researchers should not despair .
For all the public 's confusion about climate science , polls consistently show that people trust scientists more than almost anybody else to give honest advice .
Yes , scientists ' reputations have taken a hit thanks to headlines about the leaked climate e-mails at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , UK , and an acknowledged mistake about the retreat of Himalayan glaciers in a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But these wounds are not necessarily fatal .
To make sure they are not , scientists must acknowledge that they are in a street fight , and that their relationship with the media really matters .
Anything strategic that can be done on that front would be useful , be it media training for scientists or building links with credible public - relations firms .
In this light , there are lessons to be learned from the current spate of controversies .
For example , the IPCC error was originally caught by scientists , not sceptics .
Had it been promptly corrected and openly explained to the media , in full context with the underlying science , the story would have lasted days , not weeks .
The IPCC must establish a formal process for rapidly investigating and , when necessary , correcting such errors .
The unguarded exchanges in the UEA e-mails speak for themselves .
Although the scientific process seems to have worked as it should have in the end , the e-mails do raise concerns about scientific behaviour and must be fully investigated .
Public trust in scientists is based not just on their competence , but also on their perceived objectivity and openness .
Researchers would be wise to remember this at all times , even when casually e-mailing colleagues .
US scientists recently learned this lesson yet again when a private e-mail discussion between leading climate researchers on how to deal with sceptics went live on conservative websites , leading to charges that the scientific elite was conspiring to silence climate sceptics ( see page 149 ) .
The discussion was spurred by a report last month from Senator James Inhofe ( Republican , Oklahoma ) , the leading climate sceptic in the US Congress , who labelled several respected climate scientists as potential criminals — nonsense that was hardly a surprise considering the source .
Some scientists have responded by calling for a unified public rebuttal to Inhofe , and they have a point .
As a member of the minority party , Inhofe is powerless for now , but that may one day change .
In the meantime , Inhofe 's report is only as effective as the attention it receives , which is why scientists need to be careful about how they engage such critics .
The core science supporting anthropogenic global warming has not changed .
This needs to be stated again and again , in as many contexts as possible .
Scientists must not be so naive as to assume that the data speak for themselves .
Nor should governments .
Scientific agencies in the United States , Europe and beyond have been oddly silent over the recent controversies .
In testimony on Capitol Hill last month , the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency , Lisa Jackson , offered at best a weak defence of the science while seeming to distance her agency 's deliberations from a tarnished IPCC .
Officials of her stature should be ready to defend scientists where necessary , and at all times give a credible explanation of the science .
These challenges are not new , and they wo n't go away any time soon .
Even before the present controversies , climate legislation had hit a wall in the US Senate , where the poorly informed public debate often leaves one wondering whether science has any role at all .
The IPCC 's fourth assessment report had huge influence leading up to the climate conference in Copenhagen last year , but it was always clear that policy - makers were reluctant to commit to serious reductions in greenhouse - gas emissions .
Scientists can't do much about that , but they can and must continue to inform policy - makers about the underlying science and the potential consequences of policy decisions — while making sure they are not bested in the court of public opinion .

Highly sensitive ( compared to less highly sensitive ) individuals show greater brain activation in visual attention areas of the brain when making judgments of subtle changes in scenes .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
People who are shy or introverted may actually process their world differently than others , leading to differences in how they respond to stimuli , according to Stony Brook researchers and collaborators in China .
About twenty percent of people are born with this “ highly sensitive ” trait , which may also manifest itself as inhibitedness , or even neuroticism .
The trait can be seen in some children who are “ slow to warm up ” in a situation but eventually join in , need little punishment , cry easily , ask unusual questions or have especially deep thoughts .
While such traits are relatively familiar because they are easy to observe , the researchers , have found evidence that for those with this innate trait , the actual underlying difference is in the brain ’s attention to details .
The study was conducted by Jadzia Jagiellowicz , Xiaomeng Xu , Arthur Aron , and Elaine Aron at Stony Brook University , along with Guikang Cao and Tingyong Feng of Southwest University , China and Xuchu Weng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , China .
This research , designed to validate the fundamental role of deeper processing of information , was published in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience .
Sensory perception sensitivity ( SPS ) , a personality trait characterized by sensitivity to internal and external stimuli , including social and emotional ones , is found in over one hundred other species , from fruit flies and fish to canines and primates .
Biologists are beginning to agree that within one species there can be two equally successful “ personalities . ”
The sensitive type , always a minority , chooses to observe longer before acting , as if doing their exploring with their brains rather than their limbs .
The other type “ boldly goes where no one has gone before . ”
The sensitive ’s strategy , sometimes called reactive or responsive , is better when danger is present , opportunities are similar and hard to choose between , or a clever approach is needed .
It is not an advantage when resources are plentiful or quick , aggressive action is required .
Perhaps because those studying human personality have not focused on genetics and evolution until recently , these two fundamental innate styles in humans have been largely overlooked .
Stony Brook researchers Elaine and Arthur Aron had already found that those with a highly sensitive temperament are , compared to others , more bothered by noise and crowds , more affected by caffeine , and more easily startled .
That is , the trait is about sensitivity .
Further , they proposed that this is all part of a “ sensory processing sensitivity . ”
In other words , the simple sensory sensitivity to noise , pain , or caffeine is a side effect of an inborn preference to pay more attention to experiences .
Hints of this processing sensitivity were found in the observation that , compared to the majority of people , the sensitive ones among us tend to prefer to take longer to make decisions , are more conscientious , need more time to themselves in order to reflect , and are more easily bored with small talk .
However , the theory that what created the difference was processing rather than mere sensitivity needed to be validated .
The research team used a questionnaire already known to separate the sensitive from the non-sensitive .
Then the team used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) methods to compare the activity of the brains of sensitive and non-sensitive participants while they were in the process of looking for small differences in pictures .
Neuroimaging has been increasingly used to investigate other individual differences , especially neuroticism and introversion , and how these affect emotion and cognition .
The Stony Brook team proposed that differences in neuroticism and introversion are often due to something more fundamental , i.e. differences in the attention given to the processing of sensory information .
For example , a number of researchers are finding that children who are highly sensitive and raised in a stressful environment are prone to anxiety and depression , which are the components of neuroticism , and to shyness , which is sometimes the cause of introversion .
However , when raised in an enriched , supportive environment , those with this “ differential susceptibility ” are actually happier , healthier , and more socially skilled than others .
In both outcomes , it seems that sensitive children are paying more attention to subtle cues indicating , for better or worse , what others are thinking and feeling .
Visual images are transformed into thoughts about those images when the brain associates the images with input from other senses , as well as with emotional reactions .
This requires some attention , which is often motivated by emotions and is especially critical for noticing small changes .
The investigators had 16 participants compare a photograph of a visual scene with a preceding scene , and asked them to indicate with a button press whether or not the scene had changed .
Scenes differed in whether the changes were obvious or subtle , and in how quickly they were presented .
Sensitive persons looked at the scenes that had the subtle differences for a longer time than did non-sensitive persons , and showed significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in associating visual input with other input to the brain and with visual attention ( i.e. , right claustrum ; left occipito - temporal ; bilateral temporal , medial , and posterior parietal regions ) .
These areas are not simply used for vision itself , but for a deeper processing of input .
This difference that was observed between those who were highly sensitive and those who were not held up even when statistically adjusting for any differences in neuroticism and introversion , making these other traits by themselves unlikely reasons for the difference .
Rather , it seems that what makes some people sensitive is a difference in what is going on at a deep level of processing , however happy or unhappy their external lives .

Those used to referring to the GTA as simply the “ 905 ” versus the “ 416 ” will soon have a new figure to factor in the equation — the 365 .
The CRTC announced yesterday that the so - called 905 is set to become the first region in Canada to have a third area code .
Beginning in 2013 , on top of the existing 289 and 905 area codes , regions around Toronto will also have a third : 365 .
And , according to the Canadian Numbering Administrator , the “ 416 ” — which already has 416 and 647 — will soon follow with a third area code of its own .
According to the CNA , a group that reports to the CRTC and a consortium of phone carriers , the third area code is being added because the “ 905 ” region is expected to run out of telephone numbers by March 2014 .
Rapid growth in the suburban regions and rising use of wireless devices are cited as the reasons .
Each area code has a potential of about 7.5 million unique phone numbers .
There are actually more combinations possible than that , but certain numbers , such as those beginning with 911 or 666 , for example , are deemed unusable .
Glenn Pilley , director of the CNA , explained that the problem is not that we are running out of unique numbers , but rather that we are running out of central office codes , which make up the first three digits of a seven - digit phone number .
This also explains why the surrounding regions will need a third area code before Toronto does .
Central office codes are assigned to separate phone carriers such as Rogers or Bell .
But , because the “ 905 ” is made up of 200 separate communities , or “ local exchanges , ” phone carriers need to obtain separate central office codes for each community , regardless if they need them or not .
( A phone number in Mississauga , for example , cannot share a central office code with , say , Pickering . )
Toronto , in contrast , is considered one large community , or local exchange .
This means carriers burn through central office codes much slower in the city than they do in the surrounding communities .
But not that much slower , says Pilley .
Toronto proper will probably need to add a third area code in 2014 .
But no number has been designated yet .
The new area codes may not do much to change the ingrained habit of referring to the city and suburbs as “ 416 ” and “ 905 . ”
After all , the 289 and 647 area codes were introduced back in 2001 without much impact .
All over the world , cities are referred to by their famous area code .
Vancouver , for example , is often simply called the “ 604 , ” though it has a second , 778 , area code .
The rivalry between Edmonton and Calgary ’s sports teams is sometimes referred to as a clash between the “ 780 ” and “ 403 . ”
Such numbers sometimes become a signal of cultural identity or status .
In an old Simpsons episode , Homer is enraged to discover that the town of Springfield has been split into two area codes — one , he believes , for the rich , and one for the poor .
And in the Sex and the City movie , Carrie Bradshaw is distraught after receiving a new cellphone with the area code 347 .
“ Oh no , ” she says .
“ I ’m a 917 girl .
Always have been . ”
Dr. Shauna Brail , of the Urban Studies Centre at University of Toronto , said people associate desirable and undesirable qualities with area codes .
Telephone numbers beginning with 647 or 289 , for example , may lead to the assumption that the phone ’s owner is a newcomer , something businesses or individuals may not want .
There are also deeper cultural connotations , she said .
After the Golden Horseshoe was divided into “ 416 ” and “ 905 ” back in 1993 , people began to associate them with different socioeconomic statuses .
“ I do think people identify their area code and location with some choices around lifestyle , investment and around prosperity . ”
“ Some of it boils down to choice .
People who choose to pay maybe more for a house in the 416 for a smaller space — they ’ve chosen where to invest their dollars .
They ’re also making a choice about transportation costs and about their perception of where ’s best to raise their family . ”
The 416 , she added , is also often associated with more liberal political views .
Others , Brail said , may resist a new area code simply because they do n’t like change .

For some , having to remember a new code is just another nuisance .
Callers who accidentally get the numbers mixed up and call 356 , for example , could accidentally find themselves speaking with someone in New Jersey .
“ It seems kind of traumatic to add on a whole new area code , but I think people are resilient and eventually , they do adjust , ” she said .
“ That being said , I am one of those people who refuses to get a 647 number . ”
“ What I have learned from these people [ Tibetans ] has forever changed my life ,
and I believe their culture contains an inner science particularly
relevant to the difficult time in which we live .
My desire is to share some of
the profound hope for our future that they have shared with me . ”

THE PROPOSED common core national education standards for K - 12 — which will impose higher academic standards on younger children — contradict decades of early education theory and research about how young children learn best and how to close the achievement gap .
The imposition of one - size - fits - all standards on young children can’t solve the problems of an education system that is fundamentally unequal .
Children in wealthy school districts receive many times the resources that children in poor communities do .
The United States stands out in sharp contrast to the many countries that take a central and equal approach to school funding .
Our unequal funding only adds to the disadvantages , such as hunger and lack of health care , that so many children bring to school resulting from the widening income disparities in our nation .
The proposed standards focus exclusively on teaching isolated reading and math skills starting in kindergarten .
Academic learning is separated from social , emotional , and physical growth .
But theory , research , and experience tell us that meaningful learning in young children does not come from rote skills .
Children build knowledge through hands - on experience with materials , peers , and teachers in meaningful ways that relate to what they already know , to their developmental levels , and their interests .
If adopted , the national standards will lead to more rote learning by all young children , but especially our poorest young learners who are in overcrowded classrooms with less qualified teachers who will have to resort to more direct instruction rather than hands - on , experiential learning .
Even if we did see better test scores after an implementation of national standards , it ’s unlikely that children would be able to apply the skills learned by rote to real - life situations , use them to solve new problems , or discover the satisfactions inherent when learning is meaningful .
This will set young children up for school failure later on when transfer of knowledge and self - motivation become crucial to school success .
The increase in teacher - directed instruction that has resulted from No Child Left Behind has already pushed play out of the curriculum in kindergartens countrywide .
This is a far greater problem than many realize .
Play is the cornerstone of social , emotional , and cognitive learning and healthy development .
It is through play that children develop the foundation for cognitive concepts , problem solving skills , and critical thinking which is essential for later academic learning .
Play generates imagination and creativity , planning and self - regulation .
It helps children develop a love for learning .
The No Child Left Behind
Act , with its high - stakes testing beginning in 3rd grade , has led many schools , especially in poor communities , to start the drill and testing regime in kindergarten .
This shift , even before the release of the new standards , has eroded the foundation young children need for school success .
We wo n’t make genuine progress in closing the achievement gap in our nation ’s schools until we address the underlying inequities that are its root cause .
Imposing more standards and tests is a misplaced , misleading , even harmful approach .
If these standards are imposed , we will see a continuing achievement gap and new levels of stress and failure among young children .
Worst of all , we will have missed an opportunity to give our nation ’s children the best possible education , the one they deserve and the one our future depends on .

Wow , this kid is SUCH a little shit .
It definitely makes for a total lol - worthy commercial though !
Kind of reminds me of those times when you ’re a kid and you tell your parents to not leave you by yourself in public because you ’re worried somebody will steal you , and then they respond with something along the lines of , “ Oh , do n’t you worry – if anybody steals you they will have you back by dinner because you are such a bad child it will drive them crazy . ”
Eh ?
Anyone ?
Remember that ?
No ? Interesting … looks like that little half ginge brat and I have more in common than I thought , perhaps I should not have been so quick to throw him under the bus …

Unprecedented fine for ranchers in uncontacted tribe ' coverup '
May 6 , 2010
Members of the Paraguayan Ayoreo - Totobiegosode group on the day they were contacted for the first time , in 2004 .
© GAT / Survival
In an unprecedented move , Paraguayan authorities have fined the Brazilian cattle - ranching firm accused of illegally clearing forest which is home to the last group of uncontacted Indians outside the Amazon basin .
‘ The company , Yaguarete Pora SA , concealed key information about the existence of indigenous people in the area where it had a licence to work , ’ said Paraguay ’s Environment Ministry ( SEAM ) , which imposed the fine .
Yaguarete failed to acknowledge that the rich forest it is bulldozing in order to graze cattle is the ancestral territory of uncontacted Ayoreo - Totobiegosode Indians , some of whom have recently been seen nearby .
SEAM ’s response is to fine the company approximately 75 million guaranies ( $ 16,000 / £ 10,500 ) and order it to write a new report , an ‘ Environmental Impact Assessment ’ , before considering whether to issue the company with a new licence .
SEAM made it clear that some Totobiegosode , who have already been contacted , have confirmed the existence of uncontacted relatives in the area where Yaguarete has been working .
Yaguarete recently accused Paraguay ’s Environment Minister , Oscar Rivas , of working for Survival International after Survival ’s exposé of the company ’s destruction of thousands of hectares of the Totobiegosode ’s forest , and the subsequent cancellation by SEAM of Yaguarete ’s licence to work there .
Survival director , Stephen Corry , said today , ‘ Whilst this fine sends out a welcome message , SEAM should n’t only fine Yaguarete : it should ban the company from working there .
That forest is the ancestral territory of the Totobiegosode , and the Indians have been trying to gain land title to the area since 1993 .
Destroying that forest is both immoral and unconstitutional . ’
One of the most consistently jarring things about having a small child is how many conversations begin like this :
Another parent – often the expensively - educated New York Times - reading mother of at least one boy –will say , with the air of someone who is imparting a profoundly original thought , “ You know , I always thought gender was socially constructed , but gosh , it ’s just amazing how different boys and girls really are . ”
Her inevitable conclusion ?
It ’s all in their intractable little natures .
Here ’s my internal monologue at these moments :
Um , really ?
If your little boy enjoys trucks , as well as hitting other kids over the head with same , you ca n’t imagine any other reasons besides testosterone ?
And if your little girl wants to wear pink it ’s just got to be those pesky double - X chromosomes .
Because your friends and relations , your daycare , your playground , your nanny – and most uncomfortably , you – could n’t possibly be part of anything so distasteful as “ society . ”
I ’m sure your little girl is never told how pretty she is when she dresses like Ariel the Mermaid .
Your little boy has never met anyone who would tell him that Dora is just for girls , or looks away uncomfortably when he pretends to breast - feed a baby doll .
Blaming biology for everything , and using it to help us dodge responsibility for changing social relationships , is all the rage .
The child - rearing advice industry does n’t help .
Just yesterday I got an email from BabyCenter.com – which has an estimated 44.8 million page views per month – telling me “ How girls and boys brains are different . ”
BabyCenter goes on to explain that “ Most experts now agree that basic biology is the main reason that boys act so ‘ boyish ’ and girls act so ‘ girlish . ’ ”
BabyCenter explains in some detail that socialization plays a role , noting the influence of marketing and TV , but clearly sends the message that there ’s a scientific consensus that it ’s mostly about Mother Nature .
But that ’s not so .
Neuroscientist Lise Eliot , author of Pink Brain , Blue Brain : How Small Differences
Grow into Troublesome Gaps found , after an exhaustive study of the subject , “ surprisingly little solid evidence of sex differences in children ’s brains . ”
Sure , there are some biological differences between boys and girls , but we make them much bigger than they need to be .
Instead of trying to challenge that , we cling to determinist pseudo - science that encourages us to roll our eyes , shrug and embrace the status quo .
Let ’s stop this nineteenth - century madness .
The Interior Department will announce Thursday that is it postponing oil drilling in the Arctic until at least 2011 amid widening fears that an oil spill there could be many times worse than the blowout in the Gulf of Mexico .
The decision by Secretary Ken Salazar will halt permit approvals for new exploratory drilling this summer in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas so that additional information can be gathered on proposed drilling technology and to evaluate what capability exists to respond to an oil spill in often ice - laden Arctic waters .
The postponement is included in a broader Interior Department report that that will be released Thursday detailing new regulations and policies on oil drilling .
An administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made , said the decision is consistent with the White House ’s desire to take a “ cautious , science - based approach ” for determining which areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off Alaska may be appropriate for oil production .
The decision directly affects Shell Oil Co. , which had all - but - final authorization to drill five new exploratory wells in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas , three of which it had planned to begin this summer .
Salazar this year cancelled four additional lease sales , which had been scheduled in the 2007 - 12 offshore leasing program .
The move was to allow officials to determine the potential effects of oil drilling on the fragile Arctic environment , which is the only remaining habitat for threatened polar bears , endangered bowhead whales and many other species .
“ Secretary Salazar determined that the country must take a cautious approach in the Arctic , and gather additional scientific information about resources , risks and environmental sensitivities before making decisions about potential future lease sales , ” the official said .
Many of the nation ’s biggest environmental organizations and many Alaska Natives , who survive by hunting and fishing along the Arctic coast , have demanded a suspension of new drilling in the Arctic .
“ It is with heavy hearts that we look upon the Gulf of Mexico spill as a reminder of the risks involved in exploratory drilling in our oceans , ” the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope , which represents 9,000 native residents of Alaska ’s North Slope , said in a recent letter to Salazar .
“ As the country scrambles to clean up the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , Shell Oil is getting ready to drill exploratory wells in the Arctic Ocean , one of the most remote and extreme environments on Earth , ” the letter said .
“ The Arctic coast does not have the infrastructure in place , nor is there technology available , to respond effectively to a blowout or oil spill offshore . ”
As was the case with the BP exploratory rig that exploded in the gulf , the federal Minerals Management Service in Alaska concluded that there was no need to conduct a full environmental impact report for Shell ’s proposed drilling in the Arctic .
Federal officials concluded the chances of such a spill were too remote .
Yet in its findings , the agency ignored several concerns raised by government scientists , among them that an oil spill could have devastating consequences for polar bears .
Meanwhile , the Trans - Alaska Pipeline , which transports oil from the North Slope to tankers 800 miles away in Valdez , remained shut down for a second day Wednesday after thousands of gallons of crude spilled into a containment area as a result of a power failure during scheduled testing at a pump station in central Alaska .

The desalination plant has roused Australian passions in the city of Melbourne
By James Melik
Business reporter , BBC World Service
On the southern coast of Australia , the state of Victoria is now in its tenth year of drought .
The authorities blame the current shortage of water on the weather phenomenon known as El Nino .
The warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean has shifted weather patterns - increasing rain in some places but dramatically cutting it in others , like Australia .
Everyone agrees there is an increasing need for more water - but disagreements arise when it comes to deciding how to provide it .
Farmers are experiencing a lot of pain - there was a stage when a farmer was committing suicide every day
Tony Kelly Yarra Valley Water Aquasure - comprising of the French firm Suez , the Australian utility company Thiess and Macquarie Capital , has been awarded a tender to construct a desalination plant .
It is is expected to supply 150 billion litres of water to Melbourne each year .
The project is the biggest public - private partnership in the history of Australia , costing A$ 3.5 bn ( $ 3.1bn , £ 2.1 bn )
There is however , strong opposition and a group called Watershed is meeting on 2 March to formulate its strategy on how to get it cancelled .
Deteriorating conditions Regardless of the opposing views on global warming , the evidence of dried up reservoirs is there for all to see .
" Over the last six years the flow into our reservoirs has been lower than anything experienced over the last 10 , 20 or even 100 years , " says Tony Kelly at Yarra Valley Water .
Water levels are at their lowest since records began 140 years ago " Over a 12 - month period we went from no restrictions to very severe restrictions , " he says , " and we face the awful prospect of Melbourne running out of water . "
" Farmers are also experiencing a lot of pain , " he adds .
" There was a stage when a farmer was committing suicide every day . "
Utility companies traditionally rely on surface water but they can no longer do so .
" People need to think about long - term management of water , " Mr Kelly says .
Alternative solutions Companies are looking at new ways of getting water and new ways of re-using old water .

An inefficient shower head uses between 15 - 20 litres a minutes Each flush of a toilet can be between three and 11 litres A full load of clothes can use between 100 and 300 litres Furthermore , local authorities are encouraging citizens to use less water and the target is to get individuals to use no more than 155 litres of water a day .
Watershed believes this is the best solution to tackle the problem .
In the city , there are bans on watering gardens outside set times , and on washing cars .
There are grants to sports clubs to change the turf to grass that needs less water and there has been a big growth in the sale of huge green water tanks to collect rain water off the roofs of houses .
Apart from the tanks , there are other water - saving devices like switches that only allow so much water for a bath , or a shower head that lets less water through .
Economic reality
The desalination plant will suck water from the Tasmanian sea and after treatment , it will supply about a third of Melbourne 's water .
There are desalination plants around the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf states have no option but to use them , but it an expensive way of obtaining water .
" We have to have more that 100 megawatts of power , " says Chris Herbert of Aquasure .
" A gigantic wind farm will be needed to supply the amount of energy we need . "
He says that desalinated water probably costs two or three times more than if you had to build a dam and reticulation system , but it would have cost more a few years ago .
" The energy consumption to produce a litre of water has declined as technology has improved , " he says .
Stephen Cannon at Watershed says this creates a necessity to make a profit from water .
The first pipes for a desalination plant near Melbourne were laid in February " With this level of expensive " new " water in the system , where will the incentive be for a sustainable water policy over the coming decades ? " he asks .
He says the state government has abandoned a business case to make use of recycled water from an upgrade to the Eastern Treatment Plant .
That means 100 billion litres of Class - A recycled water will be pumped out to sea .
" The government has said it will be able to find a use for only 40 billion of this 100 billion litres , " he says .
He believes large savings could be made by not using potable water where it is not required and by delivering water efficient devices into all homes and businesses .
" What will be the fate of these options when a consortium has designed contracts with its profits in mind ? " he adds .
Ecological concerns Mr Cannon says the initial objective of Watershed was to prevent a desalination plant being built .
But as pipes are already being laid , he says the second objective it to get the best outcome upon completion .
The main concern of environmentalists is the disposal of the concentrated brine once it has been extracted from the water .
Original plans showed that Aquasure intended to pipe the effluent 1.8 kilometres out to a flat sandy area , to aid dispersion .
Because of the costs involved however , that pipe is now expected to go only half that distance .
Dr Jochen Kaempf , an oceanographer at Flinders University , is particularly concerned about the impact that would have on marine life .
" There is a severe risk and there will be severe consequences for the ecology of the region , " he warns .

The more that we learn about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the more we realize that there is a whole lot more going on than we have been told .
It just seems like things get more bizarre by the day .
So what do we know for sure ?
Well , we do know that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has officially passed the Exxon Valdez disaster as the biggest oil spill in U.S. history .
We also know that the environment along the Gulf coast is being absolutely devastated and that the American Dream is being absolutely destroyed for millions of Americans who live in the region .
But now there have been new revelations , which if true , mean that this nightmare is far worse than any of us imagined .
Not that this nightmare of an oil spill needs to get any worse .
ABC News correspondent Sam Champion and Philippe Cousteau Jr. recently took cameras down underneath the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to see what was really happening out there under the water and what they found was absolutely stunning ….
But now there are new claims that the scope of this environmental disaster is ever worse than we could have dreamed .
Matt Simmons , an energy adviser to former president George W. Bush , recently went on national television and claimed that “ there ’s another leak , much bigger , 5 to 6 miles away ” from the leaking riser and blowout preventer which we ’ve all been watching on the underwater cameras … .
So could Simmons possibly be right ?
The truth is that we just do not know at this point .
But for such a high ranking former member of the U.S. government to make a claim like this is extraordinary .
Someone in an official position should either debunk the claims being made by Simmons or should confirm them .
But the real nightmare in all of this may be the incredibly toxic dispersant that BP has been using in the Gulf of Mexico .
You see , this dispersal agent , which is being pumped directly into the leak over a mile under the Gulf of Mexico , is four times more toxic than oil .
In fact , it is one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever created .
So not only will the millions of gallons of this dispersal agent be an absolute nightmare for the Gulf , it will also be an absolute nightmare for wherever this water is carried .
Are you starting to get the picture ?
Meanwhile , Barack Obama continues to declare that Washington is “ in charge ” and is pledging to do whatever is necessary to “ shut this down ” .
But these days it seems like anything that Washington is “ in charge ” of ends up becoming an even bigger mess .
Let ’s pray that someone can find a way to stop this leak and that the danger from this dispersal agent is not nearly as bad as some are suggesting .
But as we sit here today things look like they are rapidly going from bad to worse .

A male sparrow searches for a mate
Three new breeding sites of one of the world 's rarest birds , the Worthen 's sparrow of Mexico , have been found .
The discovery of nests in the states of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila confirms the bird needs desert scrub to breed .
Such information may help conservationists formulate a plan to save the species from extinction .
Just a few hundred Worthen 's sparrows survive , and until the latest discovery little was known about where and how the bird reproduces .
Details of the new breeding locations are published in the Journal of Field Ornithology .
Vital sparrow eggs
Worthen 's sparrow ( Spizella wortheni ) was originally discovered in the United States , where just a single bird was caught on 16 June 1884 , near Silver City , New Mexico .
No Worthen 's sparrows have since been captured in the country , where it is now thought to be extinct .
Formerly , the bird also ranged over much of the Mexican Plateau .
However , now it is found in just a handful of places in northeastern Mexico , says Dr Ricardo Canales - del Castillo , who works at the Conservation Biology Laboratory of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon in San Nicolas de los Garza , Mexico .
That makes it one of the rarest sparrows in North America .
What is more , although flocks of the sparrow are sometimes seen in winter , little is known about where the bird lives and breeds in the summer , information that is crucial to safeguarding the species 's future .
Caught in the act
So Dr Castillo and colleagues decided to search out places where the sparrow might be hiding .
SPARROW SPOTTING
Worthen 's sparrow stands just 13 cm tall on average and is identifiable by its distinctive head pattern , sporting a grey head with a rufous crown , brown stripe and pink beak Overall it is similar in appearance to the far more common field sparrow , though it has a unique plumage and song , a dry chipping trill that last two to three seconds
The species nests from May to July , usually laying three to four eggs
This was particularly difficult because of the sparrow 's behaviour : Worthen 's sparrows do not migrate , but they move on from nesting sites as soon as the breeding season ends .
So the researchers had to catch the birds in the act of egg - laying and rearing .
Over the past 30 years , the sparrows have only been seen in a 25 km squared area in northeastern Mexico , with most of its historical breeding sites since converted to agriculture .
These historical records also suggested the sparrows like to breed in valleys full of desert scrub and grassland , habitat also filled by prairie dogs .
So Dr Castillo 's team targeted areas of similar habitat , particularly searching around the La Soledad valley in the municipality of Galeana , home to one of Mexico 's most important prairie dog locations .
They found nests at San Rafael in Galeana , Nuevo Leon and at La Carbonera in the same state .
Another nests were also found at San Jose del Alamito just over the border into the state of Coahuila , but still within the La Soledad valley .
Overall , the researchers recorded 51 individual sparrows , which is half the 100 to 120 individuals that survive in the wild , according to the latest data held by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
" Our most optimistic estimate is that 500 individuals remain , " Dr Castillo told the BBC .
Knowing where the sparrow breeds could help protect it in the future , as conservationists can now attempt to preserve grasslands and associated shrubby areas , he says .
One such project under way , coordinated by the Bird Conservation Alliance , is seeking to purchase prime grassland habitat in the Saltillo Savannah in Mexico , which will also help preserve habitat vital for other species such as long - billed curlews , burrowing owls , mountain plovers , Sprague 's pipits and Ferruginous hawks .
Gibbons portrayed as absentee governor while state in crisis
By the summer of 2008 , Gov. Jim Gibbons ’ whereabouts were often unknown — even to his senior staff .
Only he and his longtime scheduler had access to the governor ’s calendar .
As a result , senior staff were often forced to “ wing it , ” as one said .
Some weekend days in spring and summer , he was not to be disturbed — he was mowing the significant lawn at his Reno home .
When Gibbons was absent or unavailable and something needed to get out , staff would use what is known as an “ autopen , ” a device that replicates a signature , to sign official documents and letters .
Some staff would joke , “ The autopen was the busiest employee in the state , ” a former administration official said .
For them , the autopen became a symbol of Gibbons ’ tenure .
As Nevada endured the worst crisis in its history , he was for months — perhaps years — disengaged from the day - to - day duties of governing , uninterested in public policy and often absent .
That is the portrait that emerged in interviews with more than a dozen current and former aides , legislators and lobbyists .
Many former staff members would not comment , even when granted anonymity .
Now , fighting for his political life in next month ’s Republican primary , Gibbons has recently become more engaged , including during the February special session of the Legislature to close a more than $ 800 million budget hole .
Yet in that fateful summer of 2008 , Nevada needed leadership as the state ’s fortunes were rapidly sinking : unemployment rising by half a percentage point per month , neighborhoods being emptied by foreclosures , Strip projects stalling , state government facing a fiscal crisis .
The governor ’s staff began to prepare its 2009 budget , knowing programs would have to be dramatically cut in response to plunging tax revenue .
In a series of meetings , Gibbons ’ core staff gathered to determine how they would balance the budget .
Gibbons never attended nor did he provide policy direction beyond “ no tax increases , no fee increases , ” according to a former official , whose account was confirmed by others .
In his stead , one of Gibbons ’ biggest campaign contributors , Monte Miller , and Jim Denton , an outside political adviser , joined by conference call .
They would make decisions on weighty matters such as whether to include a room tax increase , what services to cut and the level of pay reduction state employees should take .
At one meeting , late in the process , Health and Human Services Director Mike Willden laid out a grisly set of cuts , including forcing people off kidney dialysis .
“ I said then that I was n’t going to be killing people , ” a former staffer said .
After doing what they could to preserve funding for schools and the indigent , they resolved to cut the rest from higher education .
That cut , totaling 37 percent , was roundly criticized by Republicans and Democrats and received no serious consideration .
Still , for the former official , it was better than the alternative .
Gibbons , in a Sun interview last week , disputed the account of his absences .
“ I did engage in the meetings .
We were constantly discussing how the budget should be developed , ” he said .
“ I met with directors individually and collectively almost every week .
Maybe I was n’t in every one of these meetings .
Maybe I was n’t asked to be in every meeting , ” he said .
He did allow , however , that he believes in delegating .
“ That ’s why you have staff , to do a lot of the leg work so that when the decisions about whether the choice is this , or this , or this , those are the times when leadership comes into play , ” he said .
Indeed , even former staff critical of Gibbons acknowledged he ultimately decided the size of the cut in state worker pay .
One problem with his approach , however , is that Gibbons has had significant staff turnover .
In office more than three years , he is on his third press secretary , third counsel and third chief of staff .
Miller has since defected to the camp of Gibbons ’ Republican opponent , Brian Sandoval .
Denton is no longer in Gibbons ’ employ .
For Jim Rogers , the wealthy businessman and former university system chancellor who gave money to Gibbons ’ 2006 campaign , the verdict on Gibbons is clear .
And although his words are harsher than most , his critique is representative of the state ’s business and political elite : “ I ’ve never seen anybody in that kind of position who has been that incompetent . ”
Those who defend Gibbons usually say he was just unlucky .
State Sen. Mark Amodei , a Carson City Republican whom Gibbons recently appointed to the Colorado River Commission , said the governor had “ absolutely abysmal timing .
It ’s a global economic event . ”
True enough .
When Gibbons was elected , unemployment was 4 percent .
It ’s now 13.6 percent .
The average price of an existing home in Las Vegas was $ 287,500 .
Now , it ’s $ 120,000 .
More than 70 percent of Nevada mortgages are underwater , meaning homes are worth less than what is owed .
No state was hit harder , while being so woefully unprepared .
In other words , Nevada needed leadership .
A prominent business lobbyist who has counseled Nevada governors since the 1970s acknowledged the difficult circumstances , but said Gibbons ’ sin was a lack of response .
“ I ’m not blaming him for the national recession .
But Nevada ’s unemployment seems to be dramatically higher than anywhere else , other than maybe Detroit .
Any of the prior governors would have been more visible in dealing with the issue , ” he said .
A former aide to Gov. Kenny Guinn , the Republican who preceded Gibbons , said Gibbons should have confronted the problems , especially the foreclosure crisis , head on : “ I do n’t know that there was much any governor could do , but you ’ve got to be in there getting the updates , trying to understand what ’s happening and stop the bleeding . ”
Gibbons took a rather nonchalant approach to the foreclosure problem from the get - go .
By February 2007 , just after he took office , Nevada had earned its dubious distinction as the nation ’s leader in foreclosures .
In September 2007 , with the housing market on the verge of collapse , Gibbons stood before the Nevada Development Authority and extolled the wonders of the Nevada economy before announcing a “ summit ” to explore solutions to the foreclosure problem .
After the summit , in October , he refused to call the situation a crisis and said bankers had agreed to try to renegotiate adjustable - rate loans .
“ I ’m convinced the way out is addressing each individual problem one at a time , ” he said , adding it could take “ some months ” for the problem to fix itself .
That was , for the most part , his policy prescription .
It hewed to his ideology : the free market , now and forever .
Gibbons turned out to be spectacularly wrong — it was a systemic crisis that would require massive government intervention , and would take years , not months , to unwind .
In the Sun interview , Gibbons blamed the crisis on government rather than the avarice and imprudence of players in the financial services industry .
He depicted lenders as victims : Banks were forced to give loans to borrowers who could n’t repay , he said .
But as countless government investigators and journalists have shown , no one forced Countrywide or Washington Mutual or other failed subprime lenders to make bad “ stated income ” loans — they did so with gusto because it drove profits and therefore executive bonuses .
A few months after the summit , another crisis developed when health inspectors discovered unsafe practices at the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada had put 40,000 Nevadans at risk for hepatitis C .
State policy says the center ’s offices should have been inspected every three years .
Instead , the center went seven years without review by the state ’s small staff .
Again Gibbons ’ ideological dogmatism was challenged .
He downplayed the problem and questioned whether the state needed to conduct more frequent inspections .
“ It ’s premature for a change like that , ” he said .
Gibbons compared inspecting Nevada ’s 50 surgical centers to hiring enough state troopers to catch every speeder .
“ We could inspect ( surgical centers ) annually and then pretty soon , have we done overkill ? ” he said .
As the hepatitis C crisis unfolded , word leaked of Gibbons ’ pending divorce from his wife of 20 - plus years , Dawn .
There were other embarrassing personal revelations — his using a state cell phone to text a female friend more than 800 times during the 2007 legislative session .
The economy continued to worsen .
And Gibbons withdrew from the job , his former staff says .
His lowest point may have come during the 2009 legislative session .
He was unseen , isolated and without influence .
He vetoed dozens of bills , but most were overridden with the support of Republican senators , including the tax - and - spend package that temporarily made state government solvent .
Republicans frequently and publicly criticized him — an unheard of break with tradition .
He began to recover from this slumber last summer , Gibbons observers say .
And in recent months , the Gibbons administration has been more aggressive , and the governor at times more engaged .
Observers attribute his newfound energy to his divorce settlement , the new staff he brought in last summer and the re-election campaign .
Current Chief of Staff Robin Reedy said Gibbons has been interested in policy .
She said he sets goals and asks staff to come back with suggestions .
For example , Gibbons asked staff to look at education reforms , she said .
They returned with a list of conservative ideas , including eliminating collective bargaining and the Education Department .
She said during the special session in February that Gibbons grabbed Deputy Chief of Staff Lynn Hettrick and walked over to the Legislature and demanded a deal to close a more than $ 800 million budget hole .
His staff proudly marveled that Gibbons sat through 90 - minute meetings with lawmakers , calling it unprecedented .
It did n’t seem to register that the real revelation was that the governor had n’t previously been in a 90 - minute meeting .
Democrats and Republicans who have endorsed his opponents praised his engagement during the special session .
Yet Reedy disputed the notion that the governor ’s involvement reflected a change .
Leading up to the 2009 session , she said , it was clear Democrats who controlled the Legislature were going to raise taxes and use their majority to attack the governor .
“ The governor was n’t going to give them any ammunition , ” Reedy said .
“ He did a cost - benefit analysis .
There was no point in going over there . ”
Gibbons ’ tenure and governing philosophy can probably be summed up in a statement he made recently to fellow conservatives in Elko , near where Gibbons owns some beatific land he ’ll retire to , perhaps soon .
“ You become sort of the anti-governor because you have to reduce budgets . ”
Sun reporter Michael J. Mishak contributed to this story .
A ceremony has been held in Western Australia to mark the repatriation of the bodies of two Special Air Service soldiers who were declared missing in action in Indonesia in the 1960s .
Lieutenant Kenneth Hudson and Private Robert Moncrieff were conducting an SAS patrol during the Indonesian confrontation in March 1966 when they were swept away during a river crossing .
They were never seen again .
Their remains were found last month and returned to Perth today .
After a ceremony at the Royal Australian Air Force base north of Perth , their coffins were draped in Australian flags and returned to their families to be buried later this week .
Minister for Defence Personnel , Materiel and Science , Greg Combet , has thanked the Indonesian armed forces , as well as the local people in West Kalimantan , for their help in recovering the soldiers ' remains .
Lieutenant Hudson was born in Brisbane , while Private Moncrieff grew up in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales .

Cinch : A Ruby IRC Bot Building Framework
By Peter Cooper
Cinch ( or GitHub repo ) is a new Ruby " microframework " for creating IRC bots .
Effectively , Cinch is a library that both abstracts away all of the complexities of dealing with IRC servers and presents a DSL for rolling out your own functionality .
Cinch 's Hello
Bot example demonstrates how you can easily create a bot that connects to an IRC server ( irc.freenode.org ) , joins a channel ( # cinch ) and then replies to greetings :
irc = Cinch .
setup : verbose => true do server " irc.freenode.org " nick " Cinchbot " channels %w ( # cinch ) end irc .
plugin " hello " do | m | m . reply " Hello , #{m.nick} ! " end irc .
run
Cinch is n't the first attempt at building a DSL for creating bots in Ruby .
Autumn is perhaps the most famous existing library , but it 's extremely heavy compared to Cinch .
Cinch vs Autumn is almost like Sinatra vs Rails .
Other libraries include Rbot and Butler .
Update : I 've been reminded in the comments that Isaac is another IRC bot DSL that 's very much like Cinch .
If you prefer to get nearer the wire and see how the IRC protocol works , this Ruby code snippet provides basic IRC functionality .
Globalization Marches
On : Growing popular outrage has not challenged corporate power
Noam Chomsky
In These Times , March 26 , 2010
Shifts in global power , ongoing or potential , are a lively topic among policy makers and observers .
One question is whether ( or when ) China will displace the United States as the dominant global player , perhaps along with India .
Such a shift would return the global system to something like it was before the European conquests .
Economic growth in China and India has been rapid , and because they rejected the West ’s policies of financial deregulation , they survived the recession better than most .
Nonetheless , questions arise .
One standard measure of social health is the U.N. Human Development Index .
As of 2008 , India ranks 134th , slightly above Cambodia and below Laos and Tajikistan , about where it has been for many years .
China ranks 92nd — tied with Belize , a bit above Jordan , below the Dominican Republic and Iran .
India and China also have very high inequality , so more than a billion of their inhabitants fall far lower on the scale .
Another concern is the U.S. debt .
Some fear it places the U.S. in thrall to China .
But apart from a brief interlude ending in December , Japan has long been the biggest international holder of U.S. government debt .
Creditor leverage , furthermore , is overrated .
In one dimension — military power — the United States stands alone .
And Obama is setting new records with his 2011 military budget .
Almost half the U.S. deficit is due to military spending , which is untouchable in the political system .
When considering the U.S. economy ’s other sectors , Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and other economists warn that we should beware of “ deficit fetishism . ”
A deficit is a stimulus to recovery , and it can be overcome with a growing economy , as after World War II , when the deficit was far worse .
And the deficit is expected to grow , largely because of the hopelessly inefficient privatized health care system — also virtually untouchable , thanks to business ’s ability to overpower the public will .
However , the framework of these discussions is misleading .
The global system is not only an interaction among states , each pursuing some “ national interest ” abstracted from distribution of domestic power .
That has long been understood .
Adam Smith concluded that the “ principal architects ” of policy in England were “ merchants and manufacturers , ” who ensured that their own interests are “ most peculiarly attended to , ” however “ grievous ” the effects on others , including the people of England .
Smith ’s maxim still holds , though today the “ principal architects ” are multinational corporations and particularly the financial institutions whose share in the economy has exploded since the 1970s .
In the United States we have recently seen a dramatic illustration of the power of the financial institutions .
In the last presidential election they provided the core of President Obama ’s funding .
Naturally they expected to be rewarded .
And they were — with the TARP bailouts , and a great deal more .
Take Goldman Sachs , the top dog in both the economy and the political system .
The firm made a mint by selling mortgage - backed securities and more complex financial instruments .
Aware of the flimsiness of the packages they were peddling , the firm also took out bets with the insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) that the offerings would fail .
When the financial system collapsed , AIG went down with it .
Goldman ’s architects of policy not only parlayed a bailout for Goldman itself but also arranged for taxpayers to save AIG from bankruptcy , thus rescuing Goldman .
Now Goldman is making record profits and paying out fat bonuses .
It , and a handful of other banks , are bigger and more powerful than ever .
The public is furious .
People can see that the banks that were primary agents of the crisis are making out like bandits , while the population that rescued them is facing an official unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent , as of February .
The rate rises to nearly 17 percent when all Americans who wish to be fully employed are counted .
Bringing Obama to heel
Popular anger finally evoked a rhetorical shift from the administration , which responded with charges about greedy bankers .
“ I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat - cat bankers on Wall Street , ” Obama told60 Minutes in December .
This kind of rhetoric was accompanied with some policy suggestions that the financial industry does n’t like ( e.g. , the Volcker Rule , which would bar banks receiving government support from engaging in speculative activity unrelated to basic bank activities ) and proposals to set up an independent regulatory agency to protect consumers .
Since Obama was supposed to be their man in Washington , the principal architects of government policy wasted little time delivering their instructions : Unless Obama fell back into line , they would shift funds to the political opposition .
“ If the president does n’t become a little more balanced and centrist in his approach , then he will likely lose ” the support of Wall Street , Kelly S. King , a board member of the lobbying group Financial Services Roundtable , told the New York Times in early February .
Securities and investment businesses gave the Democratic Party a record $ 89 million during the 2008 campaign .
Three days later , Obama informed the press that bankers are fine “ guys , ” singling out the chairmen of the two biggest players , JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs : “ I , like most of the American people , do n’t begrudge people success or wealth .
That ’s part of the free - market system , ” the president said .
( Or at least “ free markets ” as interpreted by state capitalist doctrine . )
That turnabout is a revealing snapshot of Smith ’s maxim in action .
The architects of policy are also at work on a real shift of power : from the global work force to transnational capital .
Economist and China specialist Martin Hart - Landsberg explores the dynamic in a recent Monthly Review article .
China has become an assembly plant for a regional production system .
Japan , Taiwan and other advanced Asian economies export high - tech parts and components to China , which assembles and exports the finished products .
The spoils of power
The growing U.S. trade deficit with China has aroused concern .
Less noticed is that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan and the rest of Asia has sharply declined as this new regional production system takes shape .
U.S. manufacturers are following the same course , providing parts and components for China to assemble and export , mostly back to the United States .
For the financial institutions , retail giants , and the owners and managers of manufacturing industries closely related to this nexus of power , these developments are heaven sent .
And well understood .
In 2007 , Ralph Gomory , head of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , testified before Congress , “ In this new era of globalization , the interests of companies and countries have diverged .
In contrast with the past , what is good for America ’s global corporations is no longer necessarily good for the American people . ”
Consider IBM .
According to Business Week , by the end of 2008 , more than 70 percent of IBM ’s work force of 400,000 was abroad .
In 2009 IBM reduced its U.S. employment by another 8 percent .
For the work force , the outcome may be “ grievous , ” in accordance with Smith ’s maxim , but it is fine for the principal architects of policy .
Current research indicates that about one - fourth of U.S. jobs will be “ offshorable ” within two decades , and for those jobs that remain , security and decent pay will decline because of the increased competition from replaced workers .
This pattern follows 30 years of stagnation or decline for the majority as wealth poured into few pockets , leading to what has probably become the greatest inequality between the haves and the have - nots since the end of American slavery .
While China is becoming the world ’s assembly plant and export platform , Chinese workers are suffering along with the rest of the global work force .
This is an unsurprising outcome of a system designed to concentrate wealth and power and to set working people in competition with one another worldwide .
Globally , workers ’ share in national income has declined in many countries — dramatically so in China , leading to growing unrest in that highly inegalitarian society .
So we have another significant shift in global power : from the general population to the principal architects of the global system , a process aided by the undermining of functioning democracy in the United States and other of the Earth ’s most powerful states .
The future depends on how much the great majority is willing to endure , and whether that great majority will collectively offer a constructive response to confront the problems at the core of the state capitalist system of domination and control .
If not , the results might be grim , as history more than amply reveals .
​ The Humboldt County , California Board of Supervisors accepted $ 170,000 from the federal government for “ marijuana related law enforcement work ” last Tuesday morning , despite one man ’s advice to the contrary .
“ Respect the sacred herb , ” Tad Robinson said during the public comment portion of the meeting .
“ Say ‘ No DEA , this is not what we want our law enforcement to do in Humboldt County . ' ”
Redwood Times .
The funding , from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration , will be used to pay Humboldt County Sheriff ’s deputies overtime “ for the eradication of marijuana . ”
The money will also pay for the salary and overtime of reserve officers , reports Donna Tam at the
​ Third District Supervisor Mark Lovelace said he wanted to clarify how the DEA funding might be impacted if marijuana is legalized in California ’s November election .
Lovelace , apparently reluctant to give up the War On Pot which brings in fat six - figure federal grants for local law enforcement to piss away on doomed marijuana eradication efforts , was seemingly terrified by the prospect of the county government having to wean itself off the juicy federal “ drug enforcement ” teat .
“ There will always be a need for law enforcement when it comes to marijuana , whatever the need may be , ” he said .
Humboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp said his office will follow California law , whatever it may be in the future .
“ We really do n’t believe — even if there is legalization in November — illegal drug activity and enforcement efforts will disappear , ” the sheriff said .
L.E.A.P released a statement about Obama 's intentions to give us a better approach to the ' war on drugs ' model which EVERYBODY knows is more than just a failure .
It 's a counterproductive stratehy that has directly resulted in what Kerlikowske said about drugs being even more of an issue .
The drug czar is saying all the right things about ending the ' war on drugs ' and enacting a long - overdue balanced strategy focused on a public health approach , " said Neill Franklin , a former Baltimore cop and incoming executive director of LEAP , according to a release .
" Unfortunately the reality of the budget numbers do n't match up to the rhetoric .
Two - thirds of the budget is dedicated to the same old ' war on drugs ' approach and only a third goes to public health strategies .
My experience policing the beat tells me that it 's certainly time for a new approach , but unfortunately this administration is failing to provide the necessary leadership to actually make it happen instead of just talking about it . "
The White House characterized law enforcement 's role in the strategy as " critical , " but placed much of its emphasis on creating new community treatment centers and exploring new options for eradicating addiction .
It also points at prescription drug abuse as the nation 's fastest - growing drug - related health problem .
" It 's great to see the administration starting to talk like they want to actually change failed drug policies , " Franklin added in the LEAP advisory .
" But we can't let them get away with claiming that they 've ended the ' war on drugs ' while we continue to arrest 800,000 people a year on marijuana charges alone . "
Back to the AP article : John Walters the Drug Czar under Bush begs to differ with the idea it 's all been for naught :
Walters insists society would be far worse today if there had been no War on Drugs .
Drug abuse peaked nationally in 1979 and , despite fluctuations , remains below those levels , he says .
Judging the drug war is complicated : Records indicate marijuana and prescription drug abuse are climbing , while cocaine use is way down .
Seizures are up , but so is availability .
" To say that all the things that have been done in the war on drugs have n't made any difference is ridiculous , " Walters said .
" It destroys everything we 've done .
It 's saying all the people involved in law enforcment , treatment and prevention have been wasting their time .
It 's saying all these people 's work is misguided . "
Freak .
Anyway , be sure to click the link and read the AP article .
Some on the Left feel that AP is not the most credible organization these days ; I am arguing it 's relative but quite important .
It 's AP that 's been one of the MAJOR news / news - relaying organizations who have helped feed the general public a steady diet of misinformation , particularly about " marijuana " .
Now here they are ripping it to shreds .
They see the connection between our war on drugs and the Mexican Cartel violence .
In a closely related article , Dr. Ethan Nadleman talks about cannabis reflrm as a civil rights issue .
Of all our drug law reform efforts , however , marijuana law reform should be at or near the top of our racial justice priorities .
Why ?
Of the 1.8 million drug arrests made last year , 750,000 were for nothing more than possession of a small amount of marijuana .
That represents more than 40 % of all drug arrests .
The best available national evidence indicates that roughly the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana — but that black people are roughly three times more likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana .
*****
Clearly marijuana prohibition is unique among American criminal laws .
No other law is both enforced so widely and harshly yet deemed unnecessary by such a substantial portion of the populace .
Recent polls show that over 40 % of Americans think that marijuana should be taxed and regulated like alcohol ; it 's roughly 50 % among Democrats , independents , adults under age 30 and voters in a growing number of western states .
What 's difficult to understand is how and why the number of people arrested annually for marijuana possession has roughly doubled during the past 20 years — even as support for ending marijuana prohibition has also doubled during the same period of time .
He talks about how race is a main factor in this , while I constantly blame the GOP as they have made this their religion since Nixon declared a war on drugs .
It 's a litmus test for GOP biggies if they want to go anywhere .
: Sarah Palin had to stop smoking the weed and renounce it ( bad example for the children , she said ) .
I believe the arrest rates have gone sky high because of all the anti-marijuana propaganda - reefer madness - that has polluted the airways since Reagan 's days .
LOTS of people ( still ) believe it !
Whips people into a fervor .
Again , the truth is the war on drugs is an unmitigated disaster that has caused far more strife and waste than it thought it could prevent .
It 's been 40 years of fail .

Touchdown ( TD ) PCR offers a simple and rapid means to optimize PCRs , increasing specificity , sensitivity and yield , without the need for lengthy optimizations and / or the redesigning of primers .
TD - PCR employs an initial annealing temperature above the projected melting temperature ( T m ) of the primers being used , then progressively transitions to a lower , more permissive annealing temperature over the course of successive cycles .
Any difference in T m between correct and incorrect annealing will produce an exponential advantage of twofold per cycle .
TD - PCR has found wide applicability in standard PCR protocols , including reverse transcriptase - dependent PCR , as well as in the generation of cDNA libraries and single nucleotide polymorphism screening .
TD - PCR is particularly useful for templates that are difficult to amplify but can also be standardly used to enhance specificity and product formation .
The procedure takes between 90 and 120 min , depending on the template length .
The GOP ’s back room talks with Wall Street began to explode in the faces of Republican senators yesterday .
“ The public deserves to know what carve - outs Republicans are offering Wall Street , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on television .
He was referring to a trip to the financial district several weeks ago by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP senators where they met with Wall Street titans on the issue of finance reform .
Killing the financial reform bill ’s $ 50 billion fund that would come directly from bank profits to resolve problems caused by collapse of a mismanaged financial institution is a key element of the bill that the senators were told to crush , many sources report .
Instead of taxpayers paying for bailouts , the banks would pay upfront into a “ pre-fund , ” capitalized at $ 50 billion .
Many on Capitol Hill , Reid included , believe that when McConnell went to Wall Street he asked the financiers what their number one concern was regarding finance reform .
The senator , after hearing that the pre-funded resolution authority was the hot topic on Wall Street , promised to go back to Washington and kill at least that part of the bill , they say .
Recognizing the mass revulsion at last year ’s taxpayer bailout of the banks , they have tried to do Wall Street ’s bidding on this issue by falsely claiming the resolution authority is just another such bailout .
Supporters of the bill point out that the liquidation fund in the bill is designed to keep creditors at failing banks from jumping ship so fast that they would cause widespread panic before the bank ’s operations could be wound down .
Richard Trumka , president of the AFL - CIO , said last week that his federation supports set - up of a pre-funded resolution authority but backs “ strengthening it even more with measures that would require workers ’ salaries , pensions and benefits to be moved to the top of the list of issues that have to be resolved . ”
The Senate bill , already approved by the Senate ’s banking committee , stipulates several major reforms in addition to a bank pre-funded resolution authority .
The other major reforms include :
● establishment of a consumer protection agency ,
● curbs on the trading of derivatives
● procedures that would allow the breaking up of large banks when and if they fail .
Sam Webb , chair of the Communist Party USA , described the bill as “ a step forward but what are missing , ” he said , “ are stronger measures that would break up the big banks before they fail and stronger measures that would increase capital requirements for the banks . ”
Webb said , “ Beyond the issues with the bill , however , a big opportunity was missed here .
We need to put the banks under public control .
Although this is not in the cards now , the public would have supported that .
The anger about the role of the financiers in the economic collapse and their responsibility for the joblessness is there .
We and others must make the case for public control of the banks .
They are there to serve the economy and the people , not the other way around . ”
Mass demonstrations for finance reform and for taxes on the banks that can be used to create jobs are in the works .
Unions are expecting more than 10,000 to march on Wall Street itself April 29 .
Mental_floss takes a look at seven bands and their colorful drummers .
Real or fictional , these musicians left their mark on our pop culture landscape .
Rockers who find novelty in trashing hotel rooms should bow their heads in shame and take a lesson from the original master , Keith Moon .
Dubbed " Moon the Loon " for his frenetic craziness , the infamous drummer for The Who took mess - making to heights unseen outside the closets of teenage girls .
One famous incident happened after a hotel manager told Moon to turn down the " noise " in the lobby ( which just happened to be Moon playing some of The Who 's songs on cassette ) .
This could have been the manager 's way of subtly letting Moon know that rocking out to his own music is about as lame as wearing a Who T - shirt to a Who concert , but the drummer did n't see it that way .
In response , Moon walked the manager back to his hotel room and had him wait in the hall while while he trashed the place in true rock star fashion .
Then just to ensure a grand finale , the drummer blew the door off its hinges with a cherry bomb .
He then turned to the manager and said , " That was noise . "
The two returned to the lobby , where Moon restarted the tape deck and said , " This is The Who . " ( image credit ; Wikimedia user Leahtwosaints
When a guy 's drumsticks are so big and heavy that they 're referred to as " trees " , you probably do n't want to pick a fight with him - even if he , say , throws you off stage during your own performance .
Such was the case with Led Zeppelin drummer John " Bonzo " Bonham , who had a habit of making it very clear when he thought someone else 's drumming was sub-par .
According to Zeppelin manager Richard Cole , Bonham saw nothing wrong with jumping up on stage , replacing the other band 's drummer , and giving the audience " the best show " he could muster .
In similar stage - hog form , Bonham was known to take his trademark " Moby Dick " and extend it to a masochistic hour - long experience , leaving one to wonder why fans did n't take a lesson from Bonham and jump on stage to end the ego - fest .

Who 's the craziest drummer of all time ?
Jim Henson 's Animal , of course .
The drummer in the all - Muppet group Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem Band , Animal 's Ritalin poster - boy ways were inspired by none other than Keith Moon .
But not even " Moon the Loon " could claim to be covered in hair , or wear broken shackles around his neck and wrists .
It took not one , but TWO , behind - the - scenes talents to pull of such an impersonation .
Frank
Oz performed the voice of Animal ( he was also responsibel for the vocal stylings of Miss Piggy and Yoda from " Star Wars " ) , but had no part in the drumming itself .
For that , Henson hired Britain 's leading big - band drummer Ronnie Verrall .
Ironically , it was Verrell 's turn as the " WO - man " crazy Animal that would finally allow him to collaborate with drummer / idol Buddy Rich , as well as some not - so - sought - after idols : a pig , a frog , and a Gonzo .
If it were n't for Stewart Copeland , the famed rock group The Police would probably have never formed .
Of course , if it were n't for Stewart Copeland , they probably would n't have broken up .
Copeland and lead singer
Sting were constantly at each other 's throats , resulting in creative arguments , sabotage , and yes , even fisticuffs .
Copeland , who felt his creation slipping away as Sting 's popularity eclipsed his own , often resorted to completely throwing out Sting 's musical compositions in favor of his own re-worked arrangements .
In retaliation , Sting would often have Copeland isolated in a separate studio during recording sessions .
Which , we suppose , is another way of saying , " Do n't stand so close to me .
" Practice might make perfect for some people , but not for Bernard " Buddy " Rich .
Easily the world 's greatest jazz drummer , Rich never took a lesson and refused to even consider stooping to something as silly as rehearsing .
The son of vaudeville performers , Rich hit the stage in 1921 when he was only four years old ( where he was billed as " Traps , the Drum Wonder " ) and soon became the second - highest paid child entertainer in the world .
Later in his career , he led some of the most successful big bands ever , and played with such greats as Tommy Dorsey , Dizzy Gillespie , and Louis Armstrong .
But his driven and competitive nature came complete with a volatile temper , which Rich was happy to showcase .
He was notorious for screaming at his band members for hours on end ( which they secretly recorded ) and fearlessly ridiculing pop stars during public interviews .
Oh , and Rich also always needed to have the last word , even on his deathbed .
While lying in a hospital after surgery , a nurse asked Rich if anything was bothering him .
His response : " Yes ... country music . "
Most drummers are known for their ability to play ( shocker ! ) the drums , but John Fishman rolls his eyes at such a cliche notion .
Chief envelope - pusher of the envelope - pushing band Phish , Fishman , besides being a drummer , is also a gifted virtuoso on the 1965 Electrolux vacuum cleaner .
By putting the device in reverse mode s that it blows air out of the tubing , Fishman is able to create a squealing sound when he covers the opening with his mouth .
It seems like an , er " acquired taste " to us , but the band 's , shall we say , unique audience gleefully accepts it as music , so who are we to judge ?
In fact , the instrument is so popular that Fishman created a similar device called the " bag- vac " by combining an Electrolux vacuum with a set of bagpipes , which ( finally ) legitimized housecleaning in a kilt .
Men of the world , rejoice !

While rock drummers are notorious for dying too young , no band has had more trouble keeping the slot filled than legendary ( and utterly fictional ) rock group Spinal Tap .
Here 's a recap of how just a few of their so - called drummers have disappeared .
>>
In 1969 , original drummer John " Stumpy " Pepys , also known as the Peeper , is killed in a bizarre gardening accident that the police claim is " best left unsolved . " >>
Eric " Stumpy Joe " Childs ( from the band Wool Cave ) is hired , yet tragically dies in 1974 from choking on someone else 's vomit .
The originator of the vomit is still unknown however , because - as Tap bassist Derek Smalls so insightfully points out - " you ca n't really dust for vomit " .>>
Peter " James " Bond steps in but dies from spontaneous human combustion .>>
Mick Shrimpton is hired to fill Bond 's shoes ( and sticks ) , but he , too , spontaneously combusts .

UN peacekeepers from the Congo have successfully airlifted endangered baby gorillas out of the conflict zone where they were rescued .
The four babies were flown from the conflict zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Kasugho Sanctuary in the North Kaivu province on Tuesday .
Six other gorillas are to be flown into the sanctuary on June 10 in an attempt to help the the other four form a sustainable , viable population back in their natural habitat .
The illegal trade in bush meat and live baby gorillas has been a boon to local militant groups , and this rescue mission is hoped to be a first step in both saving the gorillas and helping to stop the war .

BEAUTY by : Charles Baudelaire AM as lovely as a dream in stone , And this my heart where each finds death in turn , Inspires the poet with a love as lone As clay eternal and as taciturn .
Swan - white of heart , a sphinx no mortal knows ,
My throne is in the heaven 's azure deep ; I hate all movements that disturb my pose , I smile not ever , neither do I weep .
Before my monumental attitudes ,
That breathe a soul into the plastic arts ,
My poets pray in austere studious moods , For I , to fold enchantment round their hearts ,
Have pools of light where beauty flames and dies ,
The placid mirrors of my luminous eyes .

Dwyane Wade has a big decision to make on where he 'll sign this offseason .
And before he makes his choice , he said he 'll talk it over with fellow big - ticket free agents LeBron James and Joe Johnson .
Wade told the Chicago Tribune that he's not sure when the three players will talk , but they 've been discussing their futures informally for a while now .
" [ Free agency ] has been three years coming , " the Miami Heat superstar told the Tribune .
" We 've discussed it prematurely , at different times .
[ But ] you do n't know what guys are thinking and where they 're going .
I think we 'll all sit down , and before one of us makes a decision , all of us will have spoken to each other and [ listened to the ] thinking .
" A lot of decisions [ will be based on ] what other players are willing to do and what other guys want to do .
So it 's not just a ' me ' situation here .
We all have to look and see what each other is thinking . "
A source told ESPN The Magazine 's Chris Broussard that the Toronto Raptors ' Chris Bosh also will join Wade , James and Johnson when they discuss free agency .
" Bosh will definitely be there , " a source said .
Wade 's agent , Henry Thomas , said Thursday that no formal sit - down sessions among the headliners of this summer 's class are scheduled .
James , Wade and Bosh became close while playing together on the U.S. Olympic basketball team that won the gold medal at the Beijing Games .
While they 've pondered the possibility of playing together in the NBA , only two of the stars are likely to wind up on the same team once the dust clears .
James , coming off back - to - back playoff disappointments with his home - state Cleveland Cavaliers , will be the most sought - after free agent this summer , but Wade should be a close second .
Johnson 's stock might have fallen after his lackluster playoff series for the Hawks against the Orlando Magic , averaging just 13 points as Atlanta was swept .
Bosh , Toronto 's All - Star forward , has reportedly given the Raptors a list of five teams he will consider signing with next season -- Toronto , Chicago , the New York Knicks , Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers .
Sources told Broussard that the New Jersey Nets are also a possibility for Bosh .
On his Twitter account , however , Bosh refuted that he had given the Raptors a list of teams he would accept in a sign - and - trade deal .
Free agency begins July 1 .
One team that could have a problem signing Wade is his hometown Chicago Bulls .
The Bulls have money to spend this offseason and are expected to be one of the main suitors for James , in particular , but will their perceived disloyalty to former stars cost them a chance at the coveted players in the 2010 free - agent class ?
In a victory for anonymous critics of corporations , a federal judge in San Francisco has rejected a company 's attempt to force Yahoo to identify the online commenter who called the firm 's chief executive a " known liar " who believes " humanity exists to be fleeced . "
" The First Amendment protects the rights of individuals to speak anonymously , " U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said in ruling against USA Technologies .
She said a target of anonymous online attacks must have evidence that the postings violated its rights and caused serious harm before enforcing a subpoena to disclose the speaker 's identity .
USA Technologies filed a suit in its home state of Pennsylvania in August 2009 against the poster known as Stokklerk and sent a subpoena to Sunnyvale 's Yahoo , which hosts a message board about the company , demanding the person 's Web address .
The suit claimed defamation and securities fraud , alleging that Stokklerk had financial interests in denigrating the company .
Stokklerk went to federal court in San Francisco , Yahoo's home district , to quash the subpoena .
Illston sided with the online critic , saying USA Technologies had offered no evidence of Stokklerk 's financial involvement and could not prove defamation based on mere insults .
Stokklerk 's comments last year about the company and its chief executive , George Jensen , were expressions of opinion rather than false statements of fact , the threshold for a libel case , Illston said in Monday 's ruling .
The August 2009 posting that referred to Jensen as a " known liar " was " hyperbolic opinion , " Illston said , because Stokklerk connected it to Jensen 's assurances to investors that the company would be profitable that year .
It was not .
USA Technologies also said it was libeled by Stokklerk 's description of the company as a " soft Ponzi " and assertion that two top executives had " skimmed " more than $ 30 million from " the hugely unprofitable venture . "
But Illston said both postings were clearly meant as criticisms rather than as accusations of lawbreaking .
Attorney Matt Zimmerman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco , which represents Stokklerk , said suits such as USA Technologies ' are a common tactic of companies trying to suppress criticism .
Lawyers for USA Technologies did not return messages seeking comment .

Given the past history of how so - called “ anarchist ” groups are so easily infiltrated and provocateured by the authorities to commit meaningless acts of violence that only serve to discredit political causes , we should be alarmed by the possibility that anarchist plans to “ crash the tea parties ” will present the perfect opportunity for the establishment to create a flashpoint with which to demonize constitutionalists as unruly extremists .
According to leading anarchist website Infoshop News , “ On April 15th thousands of right - wingers will attend rallies in cities and towns across the United States .
The organizers of this nationwide day of protest call it a tea party .
This tea party movement that emerged only a year ago is a coalition of conservatives , anti-Semites , fascists , libertarians , racists , constitutionalists , militia men , gun freaks , homophobes , Ron Paul supporters , Alex Jones conspiracy types and American flag wavers . ” ( Emphasis added ) .
In one paragraph , the so - called “ anarchists ” have regurgitated wholesale the exact same rhetoric that the corporate - owned media , their supposed adversaries , have been spewing ceaselessly for months on end – that anyone who opposes big government ( which is what “ anarchists ” are supposed to do ) , is a racist and an extremist , while also lying about the origins of the Tea Party which in fact was started by Ron Paul supporters as early as 2007 .
The anarchists ’ primary reason for wanting to crash Tea Party demonstrations , because “ If the tea party movement takes over this country they will really hurt poor people by getting rid of social programs like food stamps , unemployment benefits , disability benefits , student aid , free health care , etc , ” is completely at odds with the traditional anarchist political doctrine of extremely limited or no government whatsoever .
As Kurt Nimmo points out , these people are not anarchists at all , they are statists , teenage socialist punks who like to call themselves “ workers ” but a good portion of whom have probably never worked a day in their life .
They make for perfect puppets through which the establishment can manipulate to demonize its real political adversaries .
Apparently the bizarro world of corporate media dominated political propaganda has infected the “ anarchists ” ( at least the Infoshop variety ) who now sound like Democrats .
Once upon a time , anarchism was a political philosophy that stood in opposition to government .
The term anarchism derives from the Greek anarchos , meaning “ without rulers . ”
But apparently the Infoshop strain of anarchist has deviated from the original definition — they now appear to be indistinguishable from state - loving “ progressives ” who also consider Libertarian Tea Party activists “ anti-Semites , fascists , libertarians , racists , constitutionalists , militia men , gun freaks , homophobes , Ron Paul supporters , Alex Jones conspiracy types and American flag wavers . ”
Note the pairing of “ fascists ” and “ libertarians ” in the above .
Libertarians are the polar opposite of fascists .
“ All within the state , nothing outside the state , nothing against the state , ” said the grand daddy of fascism , Benito Mussolini .
Does this sound like Libertarianism ?
Anarchists were at the front in the battle against fascism in Spain .
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organization Arditi del Popolo that went up against Mussolini ’s Blackshirts .
But that was then and this is now .
Now so - called anarchists specialize in making anti-war demonstrations look like a re-run of the Days of Rage in 1969 .
Anarchists think they are fighting the state by smashing windows at McDonalds and providing the corporate media with scary images of black - clad youths trashing bank lobbies .
As we have constantly warned , the latter half of April represents the most dangerous time period for when we can expect violence to be staged or provocateured which will instantly be blamed on tea partiers , libertarians and constitutionalists .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
A brief history of how anarchist groups have been infiltrated and steered by authorities to commit mayhem and violence in order to justify a crackdown on free speech and the right to assemble has never been more prescient .
We have documented numerous different occasions where the black bloc anarchists were completely infiltrated by the authorities to provide a pretext for a police state crackdown .
A recent example occurred at last year ’s G20 summit in Pittsburgh , where footage showed three burly older men who look completely out of place with black bandanas over their face walking alongside young protesters during a march against police brutality in a You Tube clip entitled “ G20 Epic Undercover Police Fail ” .
The clip would be hilarious if it was not so disturbing .
Protesters walking behind what are obviously badly disguised cops claim they broke cameras and acted aggressively towards genuine protesters , as well as carrying gas canisters .
During a peaceful demonstration on the same night , riot cops savagely attacked protesters with batons and rubber bullets while also assaulting and arresting students who were n’t even part of the demonstration .
Following the SPP protests in Canada three years ago , Quebec provincial authorities were forced to admit that three rock - wielding black mask - wearing “ anarchists ” were in fact police infiltrators used to gather information on protesters .
Video shows two of the provocateurs pick up rocks and try to incite violence before they are outed as cops by legitimate demonstrators .
The two thugs then tried to slip behind police lines before their fellow officers were forced to stage their arrest .
Again , the fact that they were cops in disguise was later admitted by authorities .
Watch the video .
Alex Jones ’ film Police State 2 : The Takeover exposed how the black bloc anarchists were completely infiltrated and provocateured by the authorities during the violent 1999 WTO protests in Seattle .
The authorities declared a state of emergency , imposed curfews and resorted to nothing short of police state tactics in response to a small minority of hostile black bloc hooligans .
Police allowed the black bloc to run riot in downtown Seattle while they concentrated on preventing the movement of peaceful protestors .
The film presents clear evidence that the black bloc anarchist group was actually controlled by the state and used to demonize peaceful protesters .
Watch the video below .
At the WTO protests in Genoa 2001 a protestor was killed after being shot in the head and run over twice by a police vehicle .
The Italian Carabiniere also later beat on peaceful protestors as they slept , and even tortured some , at the Diaz School .
It later emerged that the police fabricated evidence against the protesters , claiming they were anarchist rioters , to justify their actions .
Some Carabiniere officials have since come forward to say they knew of infiltration of the so called black bloc anarchists , and that fellow officers acted as agent provocateurs .
At the Free Trade Area of Americas protests in Miami in late November 2003 , more provocateuring was evident .
The United Steelworkers of America calling for a congressional investigation , stated that the police intentionally caused violence and arrested and charged hundreds of peaceful protestors .
The USWA suggested that billions of dollars supposedly slated for Iraq reconstruction funds are actually being used to subsidize “ homeland repression ” in America .
The leadership of the black bloc has been completely usurped by the authorities and anyone who still professes to be a member of the group is either supremely naive or completely stupid .
To dress up like terrorists , all in black with ski masks and bandanas ( like the police ) immediately sends out a negative message to the watching public and demonizes legitimate protesters .
The fact that many tea party members have seemingly taken the bait makes a potential flashpoint all the more likely .
As Raw Story reports , some tea partiers have implied that they will resort to violence if the anarchists get in their way .
“ Be aware anarchists , you WILL be HUGELY outnumbered , ” writes “ Rick Mercer ” at Fox Nation .
“ You wo n’t have the numbers you like to help yourself feel anonymous .
And some of us DO legally carry concealed weapons to protect our rights .
MAKE MY DAY , PUNK ! ”
Of course , only complete idiots or federal provocateurs could think that engaging in violence would further their cause – this is exactly what the establishment wants .
They want to see fights between “ anarchists ” and tea partiers so that the police can have the excuse to crack the heads of both groups and the footage can later be replayed over and over on the news and cited to characterize any dissent as violent and unruly .
This provides the much cherished “ agitprop ” the system will exploit to demonize its political enemies .
Do not engage in violence of any kind .
Turn the other cheek .
The establishment hates credible , peaceful political rallies that stick to the message rather than falling victim to the tricks of violent provocateurs .
If you are attending a rally later this month , make sure you take video cameras and plenty of batteries .
If anyone tries to start violence , get it on tape , and you may soon find that , just as happened in Quebec , the perpetrators are a lot less “ anarchist ” and more “ statist ” than you would have imagined – and in many cases are working directly for the state itself .

Amaga con realizar un boicot en contra del censo nacional ; considera que está destinado al fracaso , debido a la ausencia de una apropiada metodología en su aplicación
[ email protected ]
La jerarquía de la Iglesia católica anunció que está dispuesta a hacer un boicot al Censo Nacional de Población 2010 , que realizará a partir de la próxima semana el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía ( INEGI ) , debido a que entre las preguntas del cuestionario “ no es claro para la gente las opciones para definir su pertenencia a la Iglesia católica en México ” .
En el editorial del semanario Desde la Fe , dijo que “ hay manipulación y un debilitamiento estadístico de la Iglesia católica ” en el cuestionario , por lo que de no cambiarse la papelería del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía en esta semana harán un llamado a los fieles , “ capilla por capilla ” , a no participar en el censo , debido a que “ responde a intereses perversos e inconfesables ” .
Bajo el nombre de “ Censo tramposo ” , el editorial cuestionó el profesionalismo del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía y preguntó : “ Si esto sucede con la pregunta para conocer el número de fieles en la Iglesia católica romana , ¿qué nos podemos esperar de rubros como el empleo , la educación y en especial la pobreza ? ” .
Para la Iglesia católica , romana y apostólica en México , el censo está destinado al fracaso , debido a la ausencia de una “ apropiada metodología ” en su aplicación .
La publicación acusó que el procedimiento pretende manipular el número de fieles , puesto que la papelería con la cual deberán contestar los mexicanos presenta 12 opciones “ amañadas ” .
Señaló que en el registro de las Asociaciones Religiosas ante la Secretaría de Gobernación ( Segob ) SGAR - 1 - 92 , la Iglesia católica está registrada baja el nombre de “ Iglesia Católica , Apostólica , Romana en México ” , y ahora el INEGI “ rasuró el apellido de nuestra Iglesia ” .
Indicó que , arbitrariamente , se colocó el nombre de “ Iglesia Católica , Apostólica , Romana , Reformada ” o bien , Católica Tradicional , Católica Nacional Mexicana , Católica de los Apóstoles en Tiempos Posteriores o Católica del Rito Latino , entre otras , al lado de “ Católica Romana ” , cuando incluso la primera no aparece en el registro de la Secretaría de Gobernación como parte del directorio de Asociaciones Religiosas en el año 2009 .
“ Es claro el objetivo de disminuir estadísticamente a la Iglesia católica ” .
Aseguró que el INEGI responde “ ante los malsanos intereses al no considerar la asesoría de las Asociaciones Religiosas involucradas ” , afirmó .
La Iglesiadijo que , a pesar del que el instituto presume que en el censo que aplicará del 31 de mayo al 25 de junio próximos hay 115 años de experiencia , lo que se advierte es “ ineptitud ” en el mal diseño del cuestionario , lo que garantiza de antemano “ un solo resultado : el aparente debilitamiento estadístico de la Iglesia católica ” .
A partir de estos resultados , la Iglesia católica lamenta que lo que se tendrá al finalizar en el “ Censo 2010 ” serán cifras con las cuales “ acérrimos enemigos de la Iglesia católica tendrán en sus manos las esperadas herramientas para intentar restar fuerza a una institución que , pese a todo , continúa manteniéndose como una de las más respetables y con el mayor número de fieles del país ” .
Pedro Arellano , presidente del Consejo Editorial del semanario eclesiástico Desde la Fe , informó al finalizar la misa dominical en la Catedral metropolitana de la ciudad de México que se realizaron dos encuestas en parroquias y el mismo Arzobispado en el Distrito Federal , a partir del cuestionario de INEGI , y el resultado “ fue verdaderamente alarmante ” , puesto que solamente dos de cada 10 católicos respondió “ correctamente ” a la religión que dice que pertenece .
Pink Floyd and its label , EMI , are battling over online royalties stemming from a contested clause in their decade - old contract .
The developer of The Dark Side of the Moon and other top - selling albums claims its contract with EMI requires its music to be sold as an entire album , not the single tracks that EMI has permitted iTunes to distribute .
The band 's attorney , Robert Howe , told a London court on Tuesday , " It 's a matter of fact that the defendant has been permitting individual tracks to be downloaded online and that therefore they have been allowing albums not to be sold in their original configuration , ” Bloomberg News reported .
The case highlights the common dispute between rights holders and publishers over how to deal today with royalties for intellectual property born and contracted prior to the explosion of online digital sales .
Pink Floyd , however , said more was at stake than royalties in the internet age .
The psychedelic - music band 's musical craft is being misrepresented when sold in singles , Howe said .
" Pink Floyd is well - known for performing seamless pieces .
Many of the songs blend into each other , " Howe told the High Court of Justice , Chancery Division .
EMI told the court that the restrictions do not apply to online sales .
When Pink Floyd 's latest contract was crafted in 1999 , " iTunes did n't even exist , " EMI attorney Elizabeth Jones said .

LOS ANGELES -- Kobe Bryant signed a three - year contract extension Friday worth nearly $ 90 million that will keep him with the Los Angeles Lakers through the 2013 - 14 season .
The deal will begin after next season .
Bryant is making $ 23 million this season and is due to earn $ 24.8 million next season .
" It 's very rare to have a player play his entire career in one city , so I 'm very excited , " he said after the Lakers beat Utah 106 - 92 .
Bryant could earn $ 27.4 million in 2011 - 12 , $ 30.2 million the following season and more than $ 32 million in his final year , when he would be 35 .
Asked if it would be his last contract , Bryant replied , " I doubt it , but it 's possible . "
Bryant has spent his entire 14 - year career in a Lakers uniform .
The extension coincides with the length of the deals signed by teammates Pau Gasol and Ron Artest .
Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum 's contracts run through the 2012 - 2013 season , keeping the core of the team intact for at least the next three years .
" We are extremely pleased that we were able to reach an agreement and come to terms on the extension at this time , " Lakers general manger Mitch Kupchak said before Friday 's game against Utah .
" Kobe has been a cornerstone of the Lakers for well over a decade , helping to lead us to four NBA championships and in the process developing into one of the greatest players in basketball history . "
Rumors had been swirling Bryant was interested in opting out of his contract and testing the free agent waters with the likes of LeBron James and Dwyane Wade .
" I knew I was going to be here , " Bryant said .
Kupchak was also confident a deal was going to get done before the end of the season .
" It 's something that could have been done much earlier , " Kupchak said .
" Quite frankly the only thing that we decided was important when discussing the extension during the negotiation was we did n't want it going into the playoffs .
So there really was n't really a time frame on either side . "
Kupchak said he would n't negotiate a contract with a player during the postseason and if the Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals , he would have only had a week or two to get a deal done with Bryant before the July 1 deadline for him to opt out .
" Then you 're entering an area where there 's some real deadlines and you do n't want to do that unless you have to , " he said .
" My position all along is Kobe started as a Laker and should end his career as a Laker so in my mind I always thought he'd end up as a Lakers and we 're fairly assured he will end his career as a Laker , " Kupchak said .
" Of course , in four years he 'll be 35 years old and maybe we 'll go through this again but I think at that point after all the years if he did chose to play some more he would chose to play in Los Angeles . "
Bryant , who is averaging 27.2 points , 5.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists this season and has helped the Lakers win four NBA titles , may have gotten a deal done earlier but wanted to wait until the team first signed Gasol .
He signed a three year contract extension with the Lakers Dec. 24 .
" There was a period when we were talking to Kobe and it looked like we could get Pau done so I spoke to [ Bryant 's agent ]
Rob Pelinka and asked if we could take a break and try to get this done and that took a month , a month and a half and they said no problem , " Kupchak said .
" That 's maybe why it took longer than it could have but neither side felt there was a timeline where it had to get done there was always a certainty that it would get done . "
While Bryant wanted to make sure he would be surrounded by Gasol , Bynum , Odom and Artest for the foreseeable future , he never brought up Phil Jackson 's name during contract negotiations .
The 64 - year - old coach 's contract is up at the end of the season and he has yet to decide if he will return .
" It was not a factor in the negotiation with Kobe , " Kupchak said .
" It never came up . "
Jackson said even if he came back , Bryant and the core group would have to get used to playing under a new coach at some point .
" I 'm not going to buy into anything for three or four years , " Jackson said .
" I do n't think that 's in the cards at all .
But I can look at a season , one year at a time right now and feel comfortable with the commitment I can generate to get through another year and push the team hard enough to get them through a year .
When you talk about those long - term things , there 's got to be a change here in the near future where there needs to be a successive coach who is able to deal with these players help them on with their game . "
Kupchak was n't sure if Bryant 's contract extension would influence Jackson 's possible return but reiterated the team wanted him to return as the coach .
" I do n't think the organization 's position with Phil has changed , " Kupchak said .
" At the end of the season we 'll go to Phil and say , ' What 's your timeline ? '
And he already indicated his timeline will include a physical checkup .
And at that point in time he will indicate if this is something he'd like to continue to do and we 'll sit down and talk .
I personally sat down with Phil and indicated I 'd love to have him back as the coach .
He obviously does a wonderful job but it falls under his timeline . "
Bryant , a 12 - time All - Star who was voted league MVP in 2008 , never talked about his contract situation with his teammates , but Gasol said no one in the locker room was surprised with the news of the extension .
" I thought it was only a matter of time and that it would get done sooner or later , " Gasol said .
" The core of the team will stay together for a while and that was the goal of the franchise and I 'm immensely happy for each and every one of the guys including myself .
It 's a great that Kobe got that extension signed .
We 're all very happy for him . "

The strange case of John Westwood ... or Dr Jekyll and Mr Portsmouth
Most days he is just John Anthony Westwood , a mild - mannered antiquarian book dealer with a royal warrant for picture framing in a peaceful national park market town .
Come this weekend , however , he will transform himself into John Anthony Portsmouth
Football Club Westwood , better known as Pompey John , tattooed talisman of the terraces — from which he is occasionally evicted — the man who put fan into football fanatic .
Instead of browsing sales and house clearances to find priceless first editions to add to the shelves in his shop in Petersfield , Hampshire , he will don his bright blue wig and stovepipe hat , pull on his ex-chef ’s chequered trousers and bare his tattooed torso to the elements for the sake of his team , as relegated Pompey play underdog to newly - crowned champions Chelsea in tomorrow ’s FA Cup final .
The only links between the books he leaves behind will be that Charles Dickens lived in the city and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once played in goal for Portsmouth Association Football Club , an amateur side , under the pseudonym AC Smith .
Do n't judge a book ...
John Westwood in the tranquil surrounds of his Petersfield shop
Meanwhile , Westwood ’s only regret — although probably not for the fans next to him in the stands — is that the Wembley authorities have banned him from bringing his bell or trumpet or drum .
‘ I ’ve been told I have to have a licence , ’ says Westwood , 47 .
‘ It ’s all about health and safety .
‘ To be honest there is more atmosphere in my pub these days than at most football
grounds . ’
His obsession with the south coast club began when he was 13 and his father Frank took him to his first game : Portsmouth versus Brighton , which Pompey won 1-0 .
‘ It was a 32,000 crowd and the place was just rocking .
Unbelievable , ’ he says .
‘ I thought there and then that I was going to be a Pompey fan until the day I died .
‘ It has become my passion , my life .
It ’s Jekyll and Hyde , if you like .
I leave the books behind me when I step out of the shop .
No more minding my p’s and q’s and having to be polite to customers and the customer always being right .
At the weekends I just become myself . ’
It has not been without its sacrifices and pitfalls .
Westwood ’s marriage to wife Linda collapsed because of his obsession with Portsmouth .
He said : ‘ I have only been married once and that was enough .
Linda thought I would
change but if you marry me you marry Portsmouth .
It ’s sad really but you only get one life . ’
The couple , who remain friends and meet up for family occasions , have two children , Marcus , 19 , and Yasmin , 15 .
‘ They think I ’m nuts but they understand my passion , ’ he says .
Cover story : Westwood 's up for the fight as Pompey John in the away end at Craven Cottage
Westwood has also had his fair share of troubles on the road with his team when the heady mixture of beer and adrenaline saw him ejected from some grounds and banned from others .
‘ I have been ejected from a few grounds in the Premier League especially because I stand out from the crowd and I make a bit of noise . ’ he says .
‘ Football is a bit politically correct these days and they do n’t like people who show passion . ’
In many ways , he says , it is good that Portsmouth will start next season in the Championship because he reckons the Barclays Premier League is merely a vehicle for four or five clubs to dominate .
He said : ‘ When we were winning in the Premier League it took the gloss off it .
It ’s more fun to be the underdogs and two fingers to the rest of them .
There will always be a Pompey — we are not worried about winning or losing . ’
On Saturday , a friend will drive Westwood and his friends to Wembley in the Petersfield Book Shop minibus .
They are leaving at 9 am to give plenty of time ‘ for a few beers and some chat with the Chelsea fans ’ .
‘ Our second Cup final in two years , ’ he says .
‘ Unbelievable . ’
‘ We never thought we would see one and now we ’re in another . ’
Before he sets off , his mother Ann will issue her usual warning : ‘ You take care now . ’
Westwood said : ‘ She said that in the shop once as I was going out and this titled Lady who was browsing the books said , without looking up , “ Oh no , do n’t do that .
We like reading about you in the papers ” . ’
Comics braniac Grant Morrison resuscitates a slipstreaming Dark Knight in the highly anticipated six - part miniseries Batman : The Return of Bruce Wayne .
The time travel starts with the late Paleolithic era , judging by the panels above and below , which debuted Thursday on DC Comics blog The Source .
Those who know their Morrison remember that his sprawling , apocalyptic Final Crisis ended with Superman cradling what was left of the Dark Knight after a titanic fight with multiversal nemesis Darkseid .
Now Morrison is dragging a time - lost Bruce Wayne back to the future , with help from a rotating cast of stellar artists : Chris Sprouse , Frazer Irving , Lee Garbett , Yanick Paquette , Cameron Stewart , Ryan Sook and Andy Kubert , who crafted the series ' compelling covers .
Morrison 's six issues , the first of which arrives May 12 , will plunk Bruce Wayne into various pulp scenarios , from a colonial village to pirate - infested high seas to the Wild West and forward through time into the character 's more familiar noir - scapes .
" It 's Bruce Wayne 's ultimate challenge , " Morrison told USA Today last year .
" Batman vs. history itself ! "
We 'll speak later with Morrison about Bruce Wayne 's ominous return , as well as his forthcoming Batman and Robin collection , Patrick Meaney 's biopic and much more .
For now , feast your eyes on Bruce Wayne 's strange return in these panels from Issue No. 1 of Batman : The Return of Bruce Wayne .
Then let us know your thoughts about Morrison 's run on the iconic superhero in the comments section below .

CNN will have complete coverage of the 2010 South by Southwest Interactive Conference at www.cnn.com/TECH and @cnntech on Twitter .
Austin , Texas ( CNN ) --
The company behind the Web browser Opera is weeks away from submitting it to Apple 's iPhone store for approval , a spokesman said Friday .
The result , according to the Norwegian company , would be a browser up to six times faster than the iPhone 's default Web tool , Safari .
The question raised by the plans -- and the major publicity push Opera made last month at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona , Spain -- is whether Apple will approve the application -- in effect creating competition for its own product .
At the South By Southwest Interactive festival in Austin , Opera spokesman Thomas Ford demonstrated for CNN the Opera Mini app being developed for the iPhone .
" I can't positively say the time frame , but I can say it 's very soon , " Ford said when asked when the app would be officially submitted to Apple .
Asked whether it would be weeks or months , he said " weeks . "
In the smartphone market , Opera currently is available on BlackBerry , Windows Mobile and Android platforms .
Opera Mini is huge on non-smartphone mobile phones , accounting for much of its more than 50 million monthly users worldwide , according to the company .
But the company clearly covets the iPhone 's devoted and active user base .
At the Barcelona conference , the company pushed Opera Mini hard -- an unusual approach for an application that has n't yet been submitted , much less approved .
But Ford downplayed the notion that the push was meant to put pressure on Apple .
" This is a very , very complete beta , " he said .
" We were definitely ready to show it to people .
We wanted people to see what it would do . "
Apple did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this report .
While developers have sometimes complained that the Cupertino , California - based computer giant 's standards for apps are sometimes hard to understand , Apple has been consistently clear on one point -- apps are n't accepted if they duplicate a function the iPhone already does .
Opera argues that Mini and Safari are different , saying Opera Mini is quicker at downloading regular Internet pages while Safari 's design makes it more apt for more data - intensive functions , such as editing a Google document .
Opera 's process involves running Web pages through their servers , stripping away all but the most essential data so the pages load quickly .
Whether that 's enough of a distinction for Apple to allow another Web browser onto the iPhone remains to be seen .
" I would n't say we 're trying to back Apple into a corner , " Ford said .
" We feel that we 're very much following their rules . "
A very wise man once told me , " You can have the greatest team in the history of hockey , and they can lose in the first round because the other team 's goalie plays out of his mind for four games . "
The converse of what my dad told me is that you can have a fantastic team and lose because your goalie plays like a backup for four games .
In the San Jose Sharks case , they lost because their goalie performed like he has since the lockout .
It 's a shame that it was a sweep , really , because it 's pretty clear that these were the two best teams in hockey .
Perhaps the Sharks can take the Prince Of Wales Trophy ?
The two teams were evenly matched except for that one pesky position .
I do n't know if the Sharks , their fans or the mainstream media have learned the correct lesson from this playoff run though .
The fans are calling for a rebuild and parts of the mainstream media are looking for a big - ticket goaltender .
Soon , very soon , executives are going to realize that big contracts for goaltending are not worth it , and that throwing $ 4,000,000 plus at a goalie with one or two decent years harms their teams in the long run .
Until then , we 'll have goalies with enormous contracts like Evgeni Nabokov .
San Jose 's best bet next season ?
Pay Tomas Greiss and Martin Biron and use the $ 3,000,000 that 's leftover to bolster the rest of the roster .
Scoring Chances for Western Conference Finals ,
Games 30321 , 30322 , 30323 , 30324
For those of you who are new to the concept of tracking scoring chances , a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
Vic Ferrari makes this all possible with his tools to evaluate Corsi , head - to - head ice time and scoring chances .
I 'm tracking this series with the Sharks as the home team , so in any unlabeled sequence , the first number is for the Sharks , the second for the Blackhawks .

The Hawks stuck with the hard match of Dave Bolland on Joe Thornton for the entire series .
It paid dividends at home when McClellan started bouncing Thornton around as Bolland got the best of him any time he was on the ice except with Couture and Devin Setoguchi .
And the juggling ended with both the Toews and Sharp lines beating the heck out of the Malhotra - Marleau - Heatley line .
Of note :
Niklas Hjalmarsson Brent Sopel and Brian Campbell and it did n't matter much to him .
He was n't seeing much of Joe Thornton , but his managed minutes look excellent by this count .

How long can the International Space Station really operate – until 2020 , or 2028 or beyond ?
I recently had the chance to talk with Mark Uhran , NASA ’s Assistant Associate Administrator of the ISS .
We were both attending a conference on water sustainability at Kennedy Space Center , but Uhran took the time to talk with me about the state of our space station , NASA ’s new budget and how that might affect ISS operations , and — speaking of water — how is the urine recycling system working these days ?
You can also hear an audio version of this interview on the March 28 edition of 365 Days of Astronomy .
Universe Today : How are things going as far the extension of the ISS ?
I heard there was recently a meeting with the international partners where they said it could be extended to 2028 if need be .
Mark Uhran :
We ’ve made the decision in the United States as part of the President ’s budget proposal to Congress , so we ’re over the hump here in the US .
And then we began a series of meetings with the partners starting in Japan last week .
Of course each of the partners has been working with us for the past 12 - 18 months , but they are fully prepared to approach their governments and ask for an extension .
There are no technical obstacles to extending to at least 2020 , and we ’re also going to be doing an evaluation to what the ultimate lifetime of the ISS might be .
That evaluation is in process .
So we ’re looking at whether we can go as long as 2028 , but that remains to be seen .
Universe Today : Since we ’re here talking about water , how are things going with the recycling system up there on the station .
I know there have been some glitches here and there .
Uhran :
The station has been a real testbed for developing regenerative water and air technologies .
We knew at the time deploying these systems they would be in a testbed mode , and it would probably take about a year to shakedown all the systems and we are making steady progress towards doing just that .
All the systems are working today – that ’s not to say they will be working tomorrow .
We certainly do expect them to go up and down throughout the course of the year as we fine tune them and work out the details .
By the end of this year we hope to add a Sabatier ( carbon dioxide reduction system ) reactor that will allow us produce yet further water on orbit .
Hauling water is a very expensive proposition for us .
Once the Sabatier is up there later this year , we ’ll have basically the entire designed system deployed and I ’m confident by this time next year we ’ll have worked out all the filtration issues , the film formation issues , and precipitant issues and we ’ll have this tuned so that it is basically available 90 % of the time , which is an outstanding availability rate .
So , this has been very worthwhile from our point of view not just because of the cost of hauling water to the space station but for the implications for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit .
Universe Today :
The new NASA budget , which eliminates Constellation , how do you see that affecting space station operations ?
Uhran :
Well , space station is relatively small factor in that new budget .
We ’ve been extended , which is a major achievement from our point of view .
But in terms of financial constraints , we are pretty well prepared now to go ahead and operate until the end of the decade , as well as to ramp up our research program on the station .
With the assembly process being completed , the crew time now becomes available for supporting research .
So most of our activities this year are geared towards repositioning our utilization program so that when the shuttle stops flying and the commercial cargo resupply services begin we are ready to ramp up that program aggressively , and that ’s going very well .
Universe Today : I ’ve been here at Kennedy Space Center for about a month and a half and a lot of the people here are talking about a possible extension for the space shuttle program .
What are your thoughts on that ?
Uhran :
Well , the shuttle was certainly required for the assembly phase because we were hauling 20 metric ton elements up to orbit .
It literally is the equivalent of a six - wheeler truck .
But for the utilization phase , we can continue to maintain and operate the space station at much lower supply rates ; typically 3 metric tons on a half a dozen to a dozen times a year .
So there are other vehicles both that our international partners bring to the table as well as we ’re hoping that the commercial US industry will demonstrate in the next 12 - 24 months that really will meet our needs once those are available .
So although we ’d all like to see the shuttles continue to fly forever , we really do n’t have a requirement on space station for that kind of relatively heavy lift capability .
Universe Today : Another issue that has been sort of looming for the space station is the solar alpha rotary joints ( SARJ ) .
Any progress on understanding why they are n’t working as hoped ?
Uhran :
Well , they are working now .
And the failure analysis has been completed .
So we know the root causes of the problem .
The most challenging mechanisms in any spacecraft system are rotating mechanisms .
So the control moment gyros , the solar array rotary joints , the thermal radiator rotary joints – they are all rotating mechanisms .
And we ’re passing power through those mechanisms , which adds to the complexity .
So we think that we have all these under control .
It turned out with the SARJ that we have determined the cause of the failure , and we ’re doing , really two things .
We ’re operating the system more gently – we ramp it up more slowly , we stop it more slowly .
That does n’t put as much load on the system .
And we find that is applicable to all our systems .
The more gently we can operate them the less loads they bear and the longer their lifetime .
So we ’ll be operating the system more gently and we ’ll be lubricating them more regularly .
So between those two approaches , we ’re pretty confident we wo n’t have any more problems with the SARJ .
We do have a couple of tricks in our pocket in the case that we do see further problems but we think we can get there with the two remedial actions we ’ve got now .
Universe Today :
To do the lubrication requires a spacewalk ?
Uhran :
It ’s an EVA based activity , yes .
It is relatively simple .
And not even that time consuming .
We were lubricating before , we ’ll just increase the frequency .

1.1.2 History
Lisp is a family of languages with a long history .
Early key ideas in Lisp were developed by John McCarthy during the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence .
McCarthy 's motivation was to develop an algebraic list processing language for artificial intelligence work .
Implementation efforts for early dialects of Lisp were undertaken on the IBM 704 , the IBM 7090 , the Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) PDP - 1 , the DEC PDP - 6 , and the PDP - 10 .
The primary dialect of Lisp between 1960 and 1965 was Lisp 1.5 .
By the early 1970 's there were two predominant dialects of Lisp , both arising from these early efforts : MacLisp and Interlisp .
For further information about very early Lisp dialects , see The Anatomy of Lisp or Lisp 1.5 Programmer 's Manual .
MacLisp improved on the Lisp 1.5 notion of special variables and error handling .
MacLisp also introduced the concept of functions that could take a variable number of arguments , macros , arrays , non-local dynamic exits , fast arithmetic , the first good Lisp compiler , and an emphasis on execution speed .
By the end of the 1970's , MacLisp was in use at over 50 sites .
For further information about Maclisp , see Maclisp Reference Manual , Revision 0 or The Revised Maclisp Manual .
Interlisp introduced many ideas into Lisp programming environments and methodology .
One of the Interlisp ideas that influenced Common Lisp was an iteration construct implemented by Warren Teitelman that inspired the loop macro used both on the Lisp Machines and in MacLisp , and now in Common Lisp .
For further information about Interlisp , see Interlisp Reference Manual .
Although the first implementations of Lisp were on the IBM 704 and the IBM 7090 , later work focussed on the DEC PDP - 6 and , later , PDP - 10 computers , the latter being the mainstay of Lisp and artificial intelligence work at such places as Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , Stanford University , and Carnegie Mellon University ( CMU ) from the mid-1960 's through much of the 1970's .
The PDP - 10 computer and its predecessor the PDP - 6 computer were , by design , especially well - suited to Lisp because they had 36 - bit words and 18 - bit addresses .
This architecture allowed a cons cell to be stored in one word ; single instructions could extract the car and cdr parts .
The PDP - 6 and PDP - 10 had fast , powerful stack instructions that enabled fast function calling .
But the limitations of the PDP - 10 were evident by 1973 : it supported a small number of researchers using Lisp , and the small , 18 - bit address space ( 2^18 = 262,144 words ) limited the size of a single program .
One response to the address space problem was the Lisp Machine , a special - purpose computer designed to run Lisp programs .
The other response was to use general - purpose computers with address spaces larger than 18 bits , such as the DEC VAX and the S - 1 Mark IIA .
For further information about S - 1 Common Lisp , see ``S - 1 Common Lisp Implementation . ''
The Lisp machine concept was developed in the late 1960's .
In the early 1970's , Peter Deutsch , working with Daniel Bobrow , implemented a Lisp on the Alto , a single - user minicomputer , using microcode to interpret a byte - code implementation language .
Shortly thereafter , Richard Greenblatt began work on a different hardware and instruction set design at MIT .
Although the Alto was not a total success as a Lisp machine , a dialect of Interlisp known as Interlisp - D became available on the D - series machines manufactured by Xerox --- the Dorado , Dandelion , Dandetiger , and Dove ( or Daybreak ) .
An upward - compatible extension of MacLisp called Lisp Machine Lisp became available on the early MIT Lisp Machines .
Commercial Lisp machines from Xerox , Lisp Machines ( LMI ) , and Symbolics were on the market by 1981 .
For further information about Lisp Machine Lisp , see Lisp Machine Manual .
During the late 1970's , Lisp Machine Lisp began to expand towards a much fuller language .
Sophisticated lambda lists , setf , multiple values , and structures like those in Common Lisp are the results of early experimentation with programming styles by the Lisp Machine group .
Jonl
White and others migrated these features to MacLisp .
Around 1980 , Scott Fahlman and others at CMU began work on a Lisp to run on the Scientific Personal Integrated Computing Environment ( SPICE ) workstation .
One of the goals of the project was to design a simpler dialect than Lisp Machine Lisp .
The Macsyma group at MIT began a project during the late 1970's called the New Implementation of Lisp ( NIL ) for the VAX , which was headed by White .
One of the stated goals of the NIL project was to fix many of the historic , but annoying , problems with Lisp while retaining significant compatibility with MacLisp .
At about the same time , a research group at Stanford University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory headed by Richard P. Gabriel began the design of a Lisp to run on the S - 1 Mark IIA supercomputer .
S - 1 Lisp , never completely functional , was the test bed for adapting advanced compiler techniques to Lisp implementation .
Eventually the S - 1 and NIL groups collaborated .
For further information about the NIL project , see ``NIL --- A Perspective . ''
The first effort towards Lisp standardization was made in 1969 , when Anthony Hearn and Martin Griss at the University of Utah defined Standard Lisp --- a subset of Lisp 1.5 and other dialects --- to transport REDUCE , a symbolic algebra system .
During the 1970's , the Utah group implemented first a retargetable optimizing compiler for Standard Lisp , and then an extended implementation known as Portable Standard Lisp ( PSL ) .
By the mid 1980's , PSL ran on about a dozen kinds of computers .
For further information about Standard Lisp , see ``Standard LISP Report . ''
PSL and Franz Lisp ---a MacLisp - like dialect for Unix machines --- were the first examples of widely available Lisp dialects on multiple hardware platforms .
One of the most important developments in Lisp occurred during the second half of the 1970's : Scheme .
Scheme , designed by Gerald J. Sussman and Guy L. Steele Jr. , is a simple dialect of Lisp whose design brought to Lisp some of the ideas from programming language semantics developed in the 1960's .
Sussman was one of the prime innovators behind many other advances in Lisp technology from the late 1960 's through the 1970's .
The major contributions of Scheme were lexical scoping , lexical closures , first - class continuations , and simplified syntax ( no separation of value cells and function cells ) .
Some of these contributions made a large impact on the design of Common Lisp .
For further information about Scheme , see IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language or ``Revised ^3 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme . ''
In the late 1970 's object - oriented programming concepts started to make a strong impact on Lisp .
At MIT , certain ideas from Smalltalk made their way into several widely used programming systems .
Flavors , an object - oriented programming system with multiple inheritance , was developed at MIT for the Lisp machine community by Howard Cannon and others .
At Xerox , the experience with Smalltalk and Knowledge Representation Language ( KRL ) led to the development of Lisp Object Oriented Programming System ( LOOPS ) and later Common LOOPS .
For further information on Smalltalk , see Smalltalk - 80 : The Language and its Implementation .
For further information on Flavors , see Flavors : A Non-Hierarchical Approach to Object - Oriented Programming .
These systems influenced the design of the Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) .
CLOS was developed specifically for this standardization effort , and was separately written up in ``Common Lisp Object System Specification . ''
However , minor details of its design have changed slightly since that publication , and that paper should not be taken as an authoritative reference to the semantics of the object system as described in this document .
In 1980 Symbolics and LMI were developing Lisp Machine Lisp ; stock - hardware implementation groups were developing NIL , Franz Lisp , and PSL ; Xerox was developing Interlisp ; and the SPICE project at CMU was developing a MacLisp - like dialect of Lisp called SpiceLisp .
In April 1981 , after a DARPA - sponsored meeting concerning the splintered Lisp community , Symbolics , the SPICE project , the NIL project , and the S - 1 Lisp project joined together to define Common Lisp .
Initially spearheaded by White and Gabriel , the driving force behind this grassroots effort was provided by Fahlman , Daniel Weinreb , David Moon , Steele , and Gabriel .
Common Lisp was designed as a description of a family of languages .
The primary influences on Common Lisp were Lisp Machine Lisp , MacLisp , NIL , S - 1 Lisp , Spice Lisp , and Scheme .
Common Lisp : The Language is a description of that design .
Its semantics were intentionally underspecified in places where it was felt that a tight specification would overly constrain Common Lisp esearch and use .
In 1986 X3J13 was formed as a technical working group to produce a draft for an ANSI Common Lisp standard .
Because of the acceptance of Common Lisp , the goals of this group differed from those of the original designers .
These new goals included stricter standardization for portability , an object - oriented programming system , a condition system , iteration facilities , and a way to handle large character sets .
To accommodate those goals , a new language specification , this document , was developed .
All that was bad enough .
Then last night , Sen. Lisa ( " Lease - A " ) Murkowski ( R - BP ) blocked an effort to raise the liability cap on oil companies from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
BP has already spent $ 350 million ; costs will probably reach the billions before the cleanup is done .
There is nothing to stop BP from declaring its liabilities finished and walking away while oil still clogs the beaches of Mobile Bay .
Murkowski's motivations have everything to do with the prominence of BP in her state 's oil and gas industry ( . PDF ) .
Her campaign coffer contains $ 426,000 of oil and gas industry cash .
This action amounts to a billion - dollar taxpayer BAILOUT of a foreign corporation , and a very wealthy one at that , in exchange for a relative pittance .
But all is not lost .
In fact , this is a crisis we cannot afford to waste .
We should be no less active than Senate Democrats , who plan to hold this same bill up for a vote every day next week .
From Greg Sargent :
" Senate Democrats , led by Senators Menendez , Lautenberg and Nelson , are going to continue next week to pass common - sense legislation to ensure that BP pays for the full cost of cleanup and that taxpayers in Nevada and across America are protected .
" Inexplicably , Republicans are protecting negligent oil companies like BP and blocking our efforts to prevent a BP bailout .
Through their obstruction , Republicans are leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay for BP 's negligence . "
All that 's lacking here is a handy buzzphrase , so I nominate " STOP THE BP BAILOUT . "
The taxpayer should n't be hit with a single thin dime of the cleanup expenses ; every penny should come from the company that screwed up so badly .
The populist center of the American conversation CAN be moved to the left .
I saw retired Army General Honore on CNN today ; as I met and briefed him in 1998 , I am comfortable reporting him to be a very conservative man .
He 's a Republican with political ambitions , yet I heard him say today that if necessary , the president should nationalize the company 's assets to resolve the situation .
Make no mistake : the damage is even worse than you probably know .
Honore pointed out that the minimal oil spilling after Hurricane Katrina knocked out the fishing , oyster , and shrimping industries for 18 months .
This disaster is going to leave boats and crews unemployed for years , if not destroy their livelihood altogether .
( In fact , the oil may still be flowing from the seabed years from now . )
The resulting costs will inevitably fall on social services provided by the taxpayer .
That 's why everyone , everywhere should start calling their Senator to demand they STOP THE BP BAILOUT .
We must call comment lines , write letters to the editor , and otherwise get the word out that WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS BAILOUT OF OF A FOREIGN CORPORATION .
We must call on the tea party to join us in STOPPING THE BP BAILOUT .
( They wo n't , and that is the point . )
Yes , polls recently showed a majority of Americans still support offshore drilling ; but polls always lag events .
We can turn this tide of offshore drilling by hoisting the right upon its own BAILOUT - hating petard .
This is the perfect season for us to respond to the ideological overreach called Citizens United .
We can make this conversation take place on progressive terms if we demand Congress STOP THE BP BAILOUT .

Attacks uncovered in an eight - month investigation but there is no evidence of Chinese government involvement
A cyber -spying operation traceable to China stole classified Indian security documents and obtained emails from the office of the Dalai Lama , according to an eight - month investigation .
Hackers misused online services , including Twitter , Google groups and Yahoo Mail .
The companies ' systems were not themselves compromised , but their services were used to send instructions to compromised computers , ultimately taking orders from servers based in Chongqing .
Email addresses found by researchers could also be linked to individuals in nearby Chengdu .
The intruders penetrated dozens of high - level government networks , embassies and international organisations and stole confidential , sensitive and private documents , according to a report by US and Canadian researchers based at the Munk school of global affairs , at the University of Toronto .
The report , Shadows in the Cloud , stresses there is no evidence that China or any other government was involved in the cyber - spying network .
But it adds : " An important question to be entertained is whether the People 's Republic of China will take action to shut the Shadow network down . "
It points out that the hackers may not have political motives and that it is possible another government is running a " false flag " spying operation .
It concludes that the network is probably run by individuals with ties to the Chinese criminal underworld , but that some of the information gathered may end up in the hands of some part of the Chinese state .
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang
Yu said : " I do n't know what evidence these people have , or what their motives are . "
She said China could investigate if it were provided with evidence , adding : " Our policy is very clear .
We resolutely oppose all internet crime , including hacking . "
The report comes shortly after Google closed its Chinese mainland - based search service , citing increased internet censorship and a Chinese - originated cyber - attack that targeted the emails of human rights activists as well as intellectual property .
The Toronto researchers , from the Information Warfare Monitor and Shadowserver Foundation , warn that organisations are increasingly dependent on the security of the bodies with which they exchange information , adding : " The vulnerabilities of one actor can quickly and unintentionally compromise unwitting third parties . "
Greg Walton of the foundation said the report was a wake - up call for governments and other bodies .
While some states , including the UK , had already begun to take targeted malware attacks very seriously , others had been complacent , he said .
The UK intelligence and security committee 's annual report for 2009 - 10 , published last month , noted : " We have been told by GCHQ [ the government communications centre ] that the greatest threat of electronic attack to the UK comes from state actors , with Russia and China continuing to pose the greatest threat . "
Walton said educating users was essential , adding that the attacks were effective not because they were particularly sophisticated in technical terms , but because of their " organisational sophistication and adaptive social engineering " .
Hackers knew whom to target and how to ensure they opened malware - laden emails .
Investigators used a range of techniques such as analysing malware samples and registering expired domain names previously used in attacks as command and control servers .
This allowed them to monitor incoming connections from computers that had been compromised and collect information on both victims and the methods used by hackers .
They also traced email addresses .
The researchers thought one hacker had links to the University of Electronic Science and Technology in Chengdu .
A spokeswoman said the institution had not seen the report but was surprised by the claim .
Investigators linked another hacker 's account to a Chengdu resident , who told the New York Times : " That is not me … I 'm a wine seller . "
The network stole Indian government material including security assessments in sensitive regions and documents about the country 's relationship with other nations .
It also obtained reports on Indian missile systems by compromising the systems of independent analysts and took a year 's worth of emails from the Dalai Lama 's office .
Personal information about individuals – including travel details and banking documents – was compromised .
" We have heard about the hacking report and the concerned department is looking into the case , " Sitanshu Kar , spokesman for the Indian defence ministry , told Reuters .
Thirty - nine of the 41 Republicans in the Senate -- plus freelance highwayman Ben Nelson -- have voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the Wall Street reform bill .
What does that mean ?
That means they 've demanded extended debate ... on the question of whether or not they should begin debating the bill .
Wow !
That 's a lot of debate those guys want to have !
You can see them lining up to take the floor here , because that 's how serious they are about needing that extra debate time !
( screen capture courtesy of Karoli )
See 'em all down there ?
Remember , they 're not about obstruction .
They just want more time to talk things out and find " bipartisan compromise . "
You can tell by the way they 're all having to be restrained from rushing to the floor to discuss their Very Serious proposals for reform .
In fact , not long after the Republicans insisted there had to be yet more debate on the question of whether or not to begin debate , but then disappeared from the floor , Majority Leader Harry Reid called for a " live quorum call , " during which the Sergeant at Arms is instructed to require the physical presence of every Senator on the floor .
That really shook things up for the GOP , and I just have to share with you the very important points they added to the extended debate they demanded yesterday evening :
That 's a full transcript of every word uttered on the Senate floor by a Republican following their demand for extended debate .
Zip. Zero .
Not a word .
I 'm pleased to see that most traditional media outlets were able to correctly decipher what was going on procedurally , and have mostly called the Republicans out on it .
But this is an aspect most of them are still missing : the filibuster is supposedly defined as " extended debate , " not just a way of saying " stop doing stuff because I say so . "
So I think people have every right to ask , " Where 's the damn debate ? "
So , what happens next ?
Well , as you know , Harry Reid is entitled to ask ( once ) for reconsideration of yesterday 's cloture vote , which he 's expected to do today .
In addition , he filed another motion for cloture yesterday , which becomes " ripe " for a vote one hour into tomorrow 's session .
That one , too , can be reconsidered later if there still are n't 60 votes to start the debate that Republicans were so eager to have more of .
And then another cloture motion and another and another , each with the opportunity to reconsider , can be filed .
The game can go on as long as they like .
Or , as you 're only too well aware , someone can opt to cave .
Does n't that all seem a little silly , though ?
Republicans are demanding extended debate on whether or not to start debate , and then they wo n't even show up to debate .
But we must n't change the filibuster rule , we are admonished , because that would prevent the minority from being able to protect their right to ... the extended debate they 're refusing to have .
That , by the way , is good reason to make the motion to proceed a non-debatable issue , so that you can't filibuster the debate on whether or not to begin debate .
That just does n't make any sense if you really insist on defending the filibuster as a minority 's right to demand more debate .
It 's worth noting , then , that Sen. Michael Bennet 's ( D - CO ) proposal for filibuster reform contains just such a provision .
But in the meantime , we 're stuck here in the absurd position of having Republicans demanding more debate on whether or not to begin debate , without actually showing up to debate it .
And they 're aided in this absurdity by Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) who insists with equal absurdity that he can't vote for cloture because :
" We do n’t have a final bill , and I ’d hate to vote for cloture on a motion to proceed when I do n’t know what the ultimate bill is going to be . "
That , as I already pointed out in Today in Congress , is prime Senatorial Steak Sauce , meant to cover the taste of the bad meat underlying it .
Bills go through this little thing they call " floor consideration , " which often includes debate and voting on " amendments , " which means that the " ultimate bill " is n't decided until it 's time to vote on final passage .
Nelson knows this , and knows you know this , but does n't care , because filibustering has become so detached from its underlying purposes that nobody can even keep it straight anymore .
So if it was n't enough for you to want to see the filibuster reformed or eliminated due to Republican abuse ( up to and including this move of demanding more debate on whether or not to debate , but never actually debating ) , then maybe you 'll be convinced by the fact that doofuses like Nelson are able to use it to demand more debate ( which they 'll also not participate in ) on whether or not to begin the process of formulating a " final bill , " so that he can finally make an informed decision about whether or not to allow his colleagues to debate it .
Or something .
Gotta protect that venerable institution of the filibuster that the founders designed !
Except they did n't actually design it at all , which is a story for another day .

Bernie Goldberg made the mistake of firing back at Jon Stewart after the comedian called out hypocrisy at Fox News .
After Goldberg ’s attack , Jon Stewart took the fight to the next level by inviting a chorus to sing “ go f*ck yourself ” to Goldberg .
The feud started last week when Goldberg accused liberals of making generalizations about the Tea Parties .
Jon Stewart discovered that Goldberg and Fox News also had a habit of making generalizations about liberals .

After a slew of examples of hypocrisy by the conservative news network , Stewart concluded his segment last Thursday by simple telling them to “ go f*ck yourself . ”
Goldberg began his response by admitting some level of hypocrisy .
“ Does Stewart have a point here ?
Are we being hypocritical by generalizing about some people ? ” Bill O’Reilly asked Goldberg Friday .
“ He does .
I ’m am pleading giulty .
That ’s a sincere plea of guilty , ” answered Goldberg .
But Goldberg could n’t stop there without launching an attack on Stewart .
“ Clearly you want to be a social commentator more than just a comedian , and if you want to be a good one , you better find some guts , ” said Goldberg .
It was apparent to Stewart that Goldberg did n’t understand the mechanics of comedy .
“ To say that comedians have to decide whether they are comedians or social commentators , comedians do social commentary through comedy .
That ’s how it ’s worked for thousands of years , ” explained Stewart .
ADVERTISEMENT
Goldberg was n’t done with the insults .
“ Guess what ?
You are not nearly as edgy as you think you are .
You are just a safe Jay Leno with a much smaller audience but you get to say the f- bomb , ” he quipped .
“ Okay .
That ’s going to leave a mark , ” joked Stewart .
“ If you think I ’m Leno with the f- bomb then you know less about comedy than you do about media and politics . ”
“ Look , I ’m sorry I told you to go f*ck yourself last week and that other time like time six months ago when I told you to go f*ck yourself .
I know that I criticize you and Fox New a lot but only because you ’re a terrible , cynical , disingenuous news organization , ” deadpanned Stewart .
ADVERTISEMENT
Then Stewart decided to take a different approach .
Accompanied by a keyboardist and sultry backup vocals , Stewart offered words of accord to the Fox News pundit .
“ Baby , I do n’t want to fight , baby .
And I know you ’ve been hurt before by them liberal elites , ” said Stewart .
ADVERTISEMENT
But Bernie Goldberg , I ’ll tell you this , ” exclaimed Stewart .
“ I do n’t need to satisfy your version of what fair satire is or should be .
I ’m not fair .
I ’m not balanced .
You are criticizing me for not living up to your tagline ! ”
Stewart was just getting warmed up .
“ And you dismiss any criticism as evidence of how the rest of the media persecute you .
You like to pretend , Bernie Goldberg at Fox News , that the relentless conservative activism of Fox News is the equivalent , oh the equivalent of the disorganizes liberal influence you find at NBC , ABC and CBS . ”
“ But Fox News , you may be able to detect a liberal pathogen in their bloodstream .
However faint .
But Fox
News is such a crazy overreaction to that perceived threat , you ’re like an autoimmune disorder , ” Stewart revealed .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I ’m not saying the virus does n’t exist in some small quantity but you ’re producing way too may antibodies .
Fox News , you ’re the lupus of news , ” he said .
“ I guess what I ’m saying is this .
As long as fair and balance is how you sell yourselves … ” Stewart prompted the chorus to finish his sentence .
“ Go f*ck yourself , ” they repeatedly sang out .
“ Go f*ck yourself !
Go f*ck yourself ! ”

And no , I 'm not even remotely referring to Todd Palin , who was arrested for a DUI in 1986 .
Hell , I 'm not even referring to Palin 's ex-brother - in - law and former Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten , who she forced out of a job because he was involved in a nasty divorce with her sister , then fired the Public Safety Commissioner , Walt Monigan , when he refused to do so .
After all , aside from the actual Palin " Troopergate " scandal , Wooten is himself alleged to have Tasered his own stepson and illegally shot a moose .
So , who is it this time in the ongoing , never - ending Sarah Palin follies ?
Willow Palin .
Well , before I go any further , let me make one thing clear :
This is NOT about what WIllow may have done ; she 's a 15 - year old kid .
I 'm not attacking her ; the alleged crime was n't anything horrific , and teenagers screw up and do stupid things .
Adults , on the other hand , are supposed to act like ... you know , adults .
Grown-ups .
This is about what Sarah and Todd Palin may have done in response to the alleged crime .
Having said that , may I present for your consideration two articles that explain more about the latest in the Jerry Springerization of the national zeitgeist :
AlaskaWTF.com has learned that Willow Palin , the 15 - year - old daughter of the worst mother in Alaska , was the ringleader of a group of Colony High School students involved in a burglary and vandalism that occured at a vacant house in Palmer .
Over $ 20,000 in damage was caused to a home that was for sale and empty at the time .
Sources close the the case have confirmed that Willow will not be charged in the destructive crime spree while her fellow vandals , without a famous mother to protect them , are left to face the music .
For more on the story , see the more - detailed article from The Immoral Minority , which claims :
When Sarah was confronted with Willow ’s involvement she at first said that it was impossible since Willow was out of town .
However when Troopers interviewed the other teens , every single one of them identified Willow as a participant , and further revealed that it was she who directed the other teens to the house , which she knew to be empty , for the sole purpose of having a party ...
Now confronted with this new information you may assume that the Palins would do the right thing and surrender their daughter to the authorities , allow her to suffer the consequences of her actions , and then treat this as a painful but necessary learning experience .
If you believed that for even an instant then you do n’t know squat about Sarah Palin .
No instead Sarah circled the wagons ( There are rumors she even hired legal counsel ) and she started to call in favors .
Scandal had to be avoided at all cost .
( This was right around the time that her contract with Fox News was being announced . )
According to sources close to the Alaska State troopers there was a secret weekend meeting .
This meeting took place between the Palin ’s and some very highly placed people involved in the juvenile justice department .
Directly after this secret meeting the word came down to the juvenile justice probation officer , Chris Evans , that ONLY the boys who had participated would be charged with the crime .
The girls would only be identified as “ witnesses ” and face no criminal penalties .
Now , I realize that today is April Fool 's Day , but both of these articles have been up for two or three days already .
Normally I 'm not comfortable with " Did XYZ do something horrible ? ? ? " headlines , where the entire story is rumor and speculation , but come on -- every element of this story fits exactly with the Sarah Palin modus operandi to a T : Trashy , tacky crime followed by massive cover - up and abuse of power attempt by Sarah .
Still , as I 've never previously heard of either of the above blogs , I figured I should at least check in with the most reliable source for Alaska - based political - related news , The MudFlats .
They could n't directly confirm it , but the gist was that reliable sources are indicating that it's a legitimate story .
Well , the Palins do claim to represent Real America .
How sad for the future of this nation if that 's true .
I ’m a city girl from New York .
I ’m also 82 and half - blind , so what am I doing deer hunting with my son , Sam , at the end of October in Montana ?
We ’re in the foothills of the Swan Mountains near Kalispell , south of Glacier National Park .
For the last four days , Sam and I have been tramping dawn to dusk over tree debris that loggers call “ clear - cut . ”
We have n’t eaten since we left his cabin before dawn .
Now it ’s snowing , and I ’m wet , tired and bloody cold .
Because Sam wanted to make sure I would n’t blow his head off by mistake , I learned how to load and fire a . 22 - caliber rifle in September at a shooting range off Fifth Avenue in Manhattan .
I found out you needed only one eye to line up the sights .
But when I got to Montana , it was n’t a .22 Sam handed me but a .270 Winchester with a scope .
He showed me how to haul it up , push it hard into my shoulder and jam my cheek along the stock , but the gun was so heavy I could ­barely keep it still .
Even if I see a deer , I thought , how will I aim this wobbling bazooka ?
Sam calls hunting “ earning your food . ”
Although I ’ve spent a lifetime buying , cooking and eating food , this would be the first time I ’d ever hunted and sought to kill .
Others had always done that for me .
By noontime on this fifth deerless day , I have seen nothing but snowflakes and ravens .
The air has been so milky that I fantasize coyotes , wolves , mountain lions , bears .
Sam has pointed out the scat of all these , fresh and glistening , along with deer scat .
But the whitetail stay invisible .
I ’ve liked the challenge , but I ’ve also yearned to go home — not to Sam ’s cabin but to my overheated New York apartment .

If you ’ve been watching the news or reading the paper lately , you may have heard about a legal marijuana substitute known by names such as K2 , space , spice , magic potpourri , and the like .
The name K2 is presumed to be named after the real K2 , a mountain in the Karakoram Range , that is the second highest peak on earth after Mt Everest .
The mountain is high , this fake weed gets you ‘ high ’… clever , eh ?
So what is this stuff anyway ?
Basically these products contain synthetic chemicals that are similar to THC ( tetrahydrocannibinol ) which is the active chemical in marijuana or Cannabis .
The most widely used chemical in these products is known as JWH - 018 , which was discovered by Dr John W Huffman , an organic chemist researching cannabinoid receptors at Clemson University .
THC ’s medicinal usefulness is not lost on scientists , and research is ongoing , with the hope of finding a similar chemical that will produce the analgesic , anti-nausea effects of marijuana but without the euphoric effects responsible for its legal status and overall stigma .
There are 2 cannibinoid receptors in the body : CB1 and CB2 .
CB1 is responsible for the ‘ high ’ : euphoria , altered space - time perception , and alteration of visual , auditory and olfactory senses .
These synthetic cannabinoids in K2 / Spice bind to the CB1 receptor with a 3 - 4 fold higher affinity than THC , which likely explains its increased side effects such as agitation , anxiety , high blood pressure and increased heart rate .
The products are sold as ‘ herbal ’ even though the chemical is synthetic and is sprayed on random herbs ( likely to keep in step with the marijuana culture ) .
The products are sold in stores and online as incense / potpourri or as a smokable product .
Labels may feature psychedelic art and claim to be herbal or a natural high .
Concerns with K2 / Spice ( in addition to the aforementioned increased adverse effects ) are that these particular chemicals have never been studied in humans ( unlike marijuana , which has ) so both short and long term medical effects are unknown .
Other issues have to do with the production of the product , since it is completely unregulated :
Buyers have no way of knowing which exact chemical or in what concentration the herbs are sprayed with .
There may be tremendous variability from batch to batch with regards to potency .
Unknown purity of the synthetic compound ; there could be unknown toxic elements in the final product due to the manufacturing process .
The product and chemical make - up of the synthetic solution can change from manufacturer to manufacturer .
Some may not even put the correct ‘ active ingredient ’ in it .
Even though K2 causes more side effects than smoking marijuana , there are two big reasons it is a big seller : it is technically legal in many states including Illinois , and there is no blood or urine test to screen for it .
There have been successful efforts to ban it in some European countries and states in the US .
If you have any questions about exposure to K2 / Spice or any other drug , call 1-800- 222-1222 for free confidential medical advice .
Like the Avengers or the Justice League , a slot on a Capcom cross -over fighter roster is a treasured and highly sought - after position in the fields of super heroes and world warriors .
And , according to the latest Game Informer issue ; Deadpool , Dante ( young Devil May Cry 3 : Dante ’s Awakening skin ) , Felicia ( Darkstalkers ) , and Captain America can count themselves among the combatants for the upcoming Marvel vs. Capcom 3 .
The magazine “ Impressions ” spread also includes a lot of gameplay updates on the title , as well as some sweet new screens , all of which can be found after the jump .
• MvC3 is using the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom scheme to be more accessible , but will retain stuff like Hyper Combo cancels , Snapbacks and assists .
• The game will have the alpha , beta and gamma assist types , just like in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 .
• MvC3 aims to knock down the wall of complicated controls and open up the field of strategic fighting to all comers .
This means fusing the accessible controls of TvC with tried and true MVC2 gameplay .
• The game has simplified launch attacks which are universally performed with one button , the Exchange button .
This can also be pressed along with certain directions to slam opponents into the ground , leaving them susceptible to combos .
Players can also hit the Exchange button in midair to tag in other team members on the fly .
You can also counter exchange moves by guessing the correct exchange move to input at the same time as your opponent .
• Deadpool ’s teleportation device will comically malfunction if you spam his teleport move .
Also , he breaks the fourth wall by beating his opponents with his health bar .
• Chris Redfield uses his weapons from Resident Evil 5 , his shotgun and the “ shock stick . ”
• Moves from the previous games seemed to have been retained .
Wolverine and Hulks ’ Supers are shown .

Travel Lessons
Here is a list of some of the lessons you can pick up when you are traveling which can all be applied in your daily life as well .
1. Nothing as Precious as Real Human Bonds :
One thing that is undeniable to anybody travelling is the great number of people one actually gets to meet .
New faces , perhaps new cultures , new languages is what each of those encounters with someone new brings but at the heart of it lies the true human spirit .
Everyone has a story to share and when you are traveling you might actually find the time to sit down with that stranger and share a coffee and a few laughs and figure out how similar lives are even half way across the world .
But somehow all this disappears the moment we step back home .
We have the mobile phones with text messaging and the internet with chat sites and social networking .
Is that really the way to connect with another human being ?
2. Keeping it Light :
This is one of the best advices that you can receive before you head out for a journey , maintaining a light travel bag and carrying only our most important things is what you should do when you are traveling .
This way you do n’t end up losing the things you are carrying because you can keep an eye on everything you are carrying because these are fewer in number .
Does n’t the same apply to daily life as well ?
If you are carrying thousands of responsibilities on your shoulders , trying to keep another thousand people happy and pleased with you ; there will come a day when you ’ll end up losing many of those which you could n’t handle .
Keep it light by fixing your priorities .
3. Be Prepared to Get Surprised :
So even though you though you were thinking everything is going as planned on your trip ; your flight gets delayed , your hotel is not booked in time , you are deserted in a place where you ca n’t find transport etc etc .
There are so many surprises that you can face when you are traveling but very soon you learn to deal with them , you just carry some extra food with you in your bag and a lot of water .
In the same way you should be prepared for all the dirty dishes life is going to hand out to you .
If you ’re prepared for them then half the battle is won .
You must remember that the world is not conspiring against you , you are just leading a normal life that you will have to deal with .
4. Enjoy Every Moment :
Just like those unpleasant surprises there are also actually plenty of great moments that you will get a chance to enjoy as well when you are traveling .
The scenic beauty or a moment of revelation or just meeting new people and enjoying great food .
The fact is that there are such great moments in our daily life as well but we might just be overlooking them .
The best way to live one ’s life is to recognize those great moments and just live in them and enjoy them as long as they last , because just like a new place you visited ; who knows if you ’ll ever be going back .
5 . Some of the Best Results Come out of Spontaneity :
Sure you have your tickets paid for and your hotel rooms booked but have you ever tried detouring for a day to a place that was not on your agenda .
This would be much more than just an adrenaline rush and it feels great .
Even in life you have to experiment a bit ; the structure can be planned so that you are in control but do n’t be afraid of taking a few risks and being spontaneous and sometimes even changing plans .
Whether the result is good or bad it will definitely be a whole new experience for you and a life changing one perhaps .
6 . Follow Your Instinct not the Crowd :
Any traveler who has taken a risk and visited a spot or tried outs something that no tourists to that place have tried out before usually find untouched beauty and treasures that are going to last them a lifetime .
Even in life , there is always place for you to listen to recommendations but you must also try following your own heart , it might just lead you to a spectacular view .
7 . It ’s not all about the Fancy Hotel Room :
It never really is .
The view matters , the places you visit matters and most of all who you are with matters .
Make the same applications in your daily life as well - how you choose to live your life and derive joy out of is what will make your life special and certainly so if you have the right friends , family and loved one .

The federal government has disclosed for the first time that Canada will not fund abortions in its G8 child and maternal health - care initiative for developing countries .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced late in 2009 that Canada , as the host of the upcoming G8 meeting in June , would champion maternal and child health in developing countries .
But until Monday , no one in the government had disclosed whether abortion would be included in the corresponding programs Canada supports .
International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda said the government would consider funding family planning measures such as contraception , but not abortion under any circumstances .
" We 're saying that we 're using the definition in our discussions of family planning , which does not include abortion , " Oda told reporters on Monday in Halifax , where she was meeting with her G8 counterparts .
" We 're not debating abortion ; we 're clarifying family planning . "
Oda 's comments reiterated those made earlier in the day by her parliamentary secretary , Conservative MP Jim Abbott , in response to a question from Bloc Québécois MP Johanne Deschamps .
The clarification follows months of confusion over whether abortion would be included in Harper 's G8 initiative during which Oda and Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon appeared to give contradictory answers .
In March , under questioning from the opposition , Harper would only say that the government would not be " closing doors against any options , including contraception . "
Opposition parties have accused the government of deliberately muddying the waters of its position to hide the reversal of what has been Canada 's position on maternal health in poor countries for almost three decades .
International health and women 's groups have also said any omission of abortion would be at odds with the G8's established goals at previous summits .
Tories ' reopened abortion debate ' : Rae
In March , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the health initiative should include access to safe and legal abortion .
But Canadian officials say they will instead focus the G8 plan on other measures aimed at improving the health of women and children in poor countries — including safe drinking water and vaccination programs .
Liberal MP Bob Rae said the government has taken an ideological stand on the issue .
" They just reopened the abortion debate , " Rae told reporters outside the House of Commons .
" We are saying to the countries that are the poorest : ' We wo n't apply the law that we have in Canada . ' "
NDP MP Paul Dewar said the government has caused confusion with its lack of clarity ahead of the G8 meeting and that its position will cause problems with other G8 members at this summer 's summit in Ontario 's Muskoka region .
" It 's just unusual to see the ignorance of a government that claims to be a member of the G8 , " Dewar said .
But Oda denied the government 's position would create division within the G8 , saying her counterparts all support Canada 's initiative .
" There is no division on what it includes or not includes , " she said .
" Canada 's initiative , that they support , is saving the lives of mothers and children under the age of five , and that does not mean supporting abortions . "
The authorities said they did not know of any arrests yet from frauds related to the new health care law .
But they said cases were being investigated by the police and the antifraud divisions of state insurance departments .
The Nevada Independent Insurance Agents , a trade organization , has collected 25 different fax messages offering bogus health coverage , sometimes for as little as $ 29.95 per month .
“ A $ 10 or $ 40 prescription card included , ” advertises one fax , which contains the image of a caduceus , the emblem for doctors , but no company name .
“ We can also provide dental care for you , ” says another that bears an image of an ugly tooth and offers customer service in Spanish .
Kay Lockhart , the organization ’s president , said the term Obamacare was popular among dishonest marketers because it was familiar to the public ; the Tea Party movement uses the term to refer derisively to the health care law .
In response to the frauds , the Nevada organization has started running advertisements statewide that spoof an imaginary fraudulent company called Swindol , Frod and Rhipoff Health Insurance .
“ Not far from the truth , ” the advertisements warn .
“ Question the company and their plan . ”
In Mobile , Ala. , Tina Waller , the president of the Better Business Bureau of South Alabama , said she received questions earlier this month from a middle - aged woman who was offered “ one of the last 20 spots ” on a government health insurance plan .
The woman did not have insurance and had learned about the discount plan from a friend who bought it from a telemarketer .
Ms. Waller investigated the company , concluded it was fraudulent and reported it to the authorities .
( CNN ) -- Saying BP has " from day one , frankly not fulfilled the mission it was supposed to fulfill , " Interior Secretary Ken Salazar expressed frustration Sunday with the delay in stopping an underwater oil gusher 33 days after an oil rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico .
" I have no question that BP is throwing everything at the problem , " Salazar said .
" Do I have confidence that they know exactly what they 're doing ?
No . "
But he and other federal officials likened the task to an " Apollo 13 " mission .
Complete coverage of the Gulf oil spill
Marcia McNutt , director of the U.S. Geological Survey , told reporters that while BP has failed to meet its own schedule for stopping the gusher , their schedule was probably not feasible from the outset given that the tasks involve construction , mobilizing equipment and fabricating devices .
" I think everyone has to understand that the kinds of operations they 're doing in the deep sea have never been done before , " said McNutt , who is helping lead a team of scientists from the Department of Energy , NASA and others in helping find a solution to the leak .
Salazar and Homeland Secretary Janet Napolitano will lead a bipartisan Senate delegation to the region Monday , authorities said .
Lisa Jackson , Environmental Protection Agency administrator , was headed to Louisiana on Sunday .
Oil has been spewing into the Gulf since late April , when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon -- which BP was leasing from rig owner Transocean -- exploded and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana .
BP has estimated oil is flowing out of the well , located beneath 5,000 feet of water , at the rate of about 5,000 barrels a day ( 210,000 gallons ) .
However , some have estimated the flow rate far higher , and critics have claimed BP is attempting to downplay the spill , its magnitude and possibly its effect on the environment .
Speaking from BP headquarters in Houston , Texas , Salazar said Sunday , " I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading .
We are 33 days into this effort and deadline after deadline has been missed . "
Initially , BP said it would attempt to kill the spewing well , some 5,000 feet below the surface , on May 18 , Salazar said .
" That has not yet happened . "
The team of scientists , he said , is a team of " all - stars . "
" If there is a way to kill this well , they will find it .
If there is a way to stop this pollution from spreading , they will find it . "
Earlier Sunday , BP 's managing director defended his company against a perceived lack of credibility , insisting that " nobody is more devastated " by an underwater oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico .
" All of us at BP are trying to solve the problem , " Robert Dudley said on CNN 's " State of the Union . " " ...
We 've been open about what we 're doing . "
Asked about comments made by Rep. Ed Markey , D - Massachusetts , who alleged BP has " lost all credibility , " Dudley said .
" Those words hurt a little bit . "
" We are all united in wanting the same result , " McNutt said , referring to BP and the federal government .
" We want to stop polluting the ocean , and we want to kill this well .
We are all on the same page about that . "
But Salazar pointed out the explosion and subsequent spill was " never supposed to happen in the first place , " and occurred because of the failure of safety measures designed to prevent such an incident .
If the government finds out that BP is " not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , and we 'll move forward to make sure everything is being done to protect the people of the Gulf Coast , the ecological values of the Gulf Coast and the values of the American people , " he said .
Later this week , BP will attempt to execute a so - called " top kill , " in which thick , viscous fluid twice the density of water is pumped at a high rate into the site of the leak to stop the flow so the well can then be sealed with cement .
If the top kill does not work , the company will try a " junk shot , " which would involve plugging the well with rubber and other substances , Dudley said .
" And then we 've got a third step we can take .
It 's something called loss circulation material . "
McNutt pointed out , however , possible complications remain as far as the top kill .
" Do n't think we 're out of the woods yet , " she said .
Dudley told CNN the rate of oil flow is imprecise , comparing it to popping a soda can and measuring the rush of gas and soda that comes out .
BP is looking at a variety of options to permanently stop the flow of oil , he said .
" We 've got the best minds on this . "
" There 's a series of options here , " Dudley said .
" I believe that activity will begin either late Tuesday or at dawn on Wednesday , because we need daylight .
There is no certainty at these kind of depths .
But we all want it to work .
And we 've all got steps that we 'll put in place immediately if it does n't . "
" We 're going to keep trying to shut off this well , " he said .
" We 're not going to wait until August , " when a relief well that could allow the leaking well to be closed off will be completed .
On BP 's credibility , U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen told " State of the Union " :
" When I give them direction or the federal on - scene coordinator gives them direction , we get a response .
I 've got ( BP CEO ) Tony Hayward 's personal cell phone number .
If I have a problem , I call him .
Some of the problems we have had that we 've worked through are more logistics and coordination issues . "
Asked whether he trusts the company , Allen said , " I trust Tony Hayward .
When I talk to him , I get an answer . "
But , shown a clip of Hayward 's recent comments on Britain 's Sky News in which he said the environmental impacts of this disaster is likely to be " very , very modest , " Allen said , " Obviously , they are not modest here in Louisiana . "
i Report : How is the spill affecting you ?
" We need to be putting all hands on deck there .
And we do n't want to perpetuate any kind of notion at all , whether it 's BP or the United States government , that this is anything less than potentially catastrophic for this country , " he added .
On BP 's flow estimates , " I 've said from the start , I do n't think anybody can know to a virtual certainty how much oil is coming out of that pipe down there .
...
From the start , we deployed resources in anticipating a catastrophic event . "
" There 's great frustration and we all understand it , particularly the president , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN Sunday , " but everything that is humanly possible is being done to cap this oil well from leaking oil and for dealing with the spread of the oil on the surface and underneath the surface right now . "
In response to Crowley 's question on whether a long - term fix could elude officials until August , Dudley said the company will put another containment device over the top of the well to recover the oil if no other options pan out .
Asked whether he would call the spill catastrophic , Dudley said , " Oh , Candy , absolutely .
You see the films of the oil washing on some of the beaches in Louisiana .
This is catastrophic for , well , every employee of BP .
It is catastrophic for the 24,000 people down there working on the spills that we 've let some get through these defenses . "
He pledged the company is doing all it can to clean up the spill and stop the leak , but acknowledged that the spill will leave lasting damage .
" We will undoubtedly measure and investigate the effects of this spill for many , many years to try to determine and learn the long - term impacts on this .
We are committed to both cleaning it up , studying it , understanding it . "
" In terms of not trusting BP , there 's nobody -- nobody -- who is more devastated by what has happened and nobody that wants to shut this off more than we do and learn what happened so this never happens anywhere , to anyone anywhere in the world again , " he said .
Also , Louisiana officials Sunday demanded the federal government approve their plans to dredge up walls of sand to protect delicate inland estuaries .
They said the Army Corps of Engineers and agencies overseeing the spill have been slow to respond .

With director , co-writer and brother Joel , writer - producer Ethan Coen was part of the most celebrated brother act in recent entertainment memory .
He helmed a series of stylish , irreverent and cinema - savvy movies that charmed critics while thrilling an initially small , but loyal band of viewers .
Though they evinced a powerful fascination with film genres - particularly screwball comedy and film noir - the Coen Brothers earned a great deal of respect from the Hollywood community despite their penchant to work outside the system .
These self - conscious movies - within - movies possessed humorous camera movements , richly textured landscapes , and powerhouse performers spouting beautifully artificial dialogue .
While some complained that the brothers were nothing more than slick stylists , the Coens , nonetheless , achieved a rare feat in entertainment : making the movies they wanted with little - to - no outside interference .

Red Bull Racing will try out its version of the F - duct at this weekend 's Turkish Grand Prix as it bids to maintain its advantage at the head of the field .
As part of a raft of updates that the team is introducing for Istanbul , world championship leader Mark Webber has confirmed that the team will try out a F - duct during Friday 's free practice sessions .
" Yes , we will give the F - duct a go tomorrow , " Webber said during a pre-event press conference in Turkey .
" We will give it a chance . "
The F - duct provides a straight - line speed advantage through helping stall the rear wing , with McLaren having led the way in pioneering the concept at the start of the season .
BMW Sauber , Williams and Ferrari were the first teams to introduce their versions of the design , while Force India and Red Bull Racing will be using their devices for the first time in Istanbul this weekend .
Although Red Bull Racing heads into the Turkey event as clear favourite for victory , Webber thinks there is no guarantee that his team will be ahead of the opposition this time out .
" I think it will be hard to do it again like Barcelona , " said Webber , referring to the team 's total domination of qualifying in Spain .
" Venue to venue things can move around , and we saw in Barcelona that things could be a bit different .
" Lewis [ Hamilton ] was our closest competitor at that track , so if we had Turkey after Barcelona you could say McLaren would be our closest challenger here .
But we are mindful that if Ferrari or Mercedes have a clean weekend then lots of guys can come towards us .
We are not taking anything for granted . "

Workers on the Arabian Gulf overlook a supertanker owned by Saudi Aramco , the oil company that used a suck - and - salvage American technology to recover 85 percent of its previously unreported spill in 1993 and ' 94 .
There 's a potential solution to the Gulf oil spill that neither BP , nor the federal government , nor anyone — save a couple intuitive engineers — seems willing to try .
As The Politics Blog reported on Tuesday in an interview with former Shell Oil president John Hofmeister , the untapped solution involves using empty supertankers to suck the spill off the surface , treat and discharge the contaminated water , and either salvage or destroy the slick .
Hofmeister had been briefed on the strategy by a Houston - based environmental disaster expert named Nick Pozzi , who has used the same solution on several large spills during almost two decades of experience in the Middle East — who says that it could be deployed easily and should be , immediately , to protect the Gulf Coast .
That it has n't even been considered yet is , Pozzi thinks , owing to cost considerations , or because there 's no clear chain of authority by which to get valuable ideas in the right hands .
But with BP 's latest four - pronged plan remaining unproven , and estimates of company liability already reaching the tens of billions of dollars ( and counting ) , supertankers start to look like a bargain .

The suck - and - salvage technique was developed in desperation across the Arabian Gulf following a spill of mammoth proportions — 700 million gallons — that has until now gone unreported , as Saudi Arabia is a closed society , and its oil company , Saudi Aramco , remains owned by the House of Saud .
But in 1993 and into ' 94 , with four leaking tankers and two gushing wells , the royal family had an environmental disaster nearly sixty - five times the size of Exxon Valdez on its hands , and it desperately needed a solution .
Pozzi , an American engineer then in charge of Saudi Aramco 's east - west pipeline in the technical support and maintenance services division , was part of a team given cart blanche to control the blowout .
Pozzi had dealt with numerous spills over the years without using chemicals , and had tried dumping flour into the oil , then scooping the resulting tar balls from the surface .
" You ever cooked with flour ?
Absorbent , right ? " Pozzi says .
Next , he 'd dumped straw into the spills ; also highly absorbent , but then you 've got a lot of straw to clean up .
This spill was going to require a much larger , more sustained solution .
And fast .
That 's when Pozzi and his team came up with the idea of having empty ships park near the Saudi spill and pull the oil off the water .
This part of the operation went on for six months , with the mop - up operations lasting for several years more .
Pozzi says that 85 percent of the spilled oil was recovered , and it is precisely this strategy that he wants to see deployed in the Gulf of Mexico .
Yesterday , I spoke to Pozzi and his business partner , longtime Houston lawyer Jon King , about their proposed solution , and the difficulties they 've encountered trying to assist in the disaster , with both BP and the government .
While BP is attempting its very difficult maneuvers to contain the gusher at the source , they say , nothing is being done to adequately address the slick itself .
Dispersant is being used by the ton , some of the oil is being burned , and there have been other efforts , which taken together , Pozzi likens to " a flea on an elephant 's ass . "
The two men have been trying to rally support since just after the rig blew up , without much success .
This has been typical of their experience :
JON KING : Well , we went down to the BP headquarters in Houma , Louisiana , and we did n't have an appointment so they would n't let us in .
Then I called the president of BP and I talked to his secretary and she put me in touch with somebody , but the somebody she put me in touch with did n't know who we should talk to .
Nick contacted a gentleman that he used to work with at BP , and he threatened to sue Nick for not going through channels .
And I said , " Great .
I 'd love BP to sue us for trying to help them .
That would be wonderful . "
NICK POZZI : Keep in mind that what supertankers typically do is they sit in the middle of the ocean waiting for all the traders to come up with the right price .
When they feel that the price is right , the tankers that are full , they take off , and they can be anywhere in the world in a few days .
Right now there are probably 25 supertankers , waiting for orders , full of oil .
So all they got to do is come to Texas , in the Gulf , unload the oil , and then turn around and suck up all this other stuff and pump it onto shore into on - shore storage .
It 's not rocket science .
It 's so simple .
It 's a Robinson Crusoe fix , but it works .
This past Monday , Pozzi and King spoke with Captain Ed Stanton , who is commanding the United States Coast Guard for much of the affected coastline .
Stanton requested a quick proposal in writing , and said he would " take it up the chain of command . "
Below is the proposal , to which Pozzi and King are still awaiting a response .

Subject : Procedures Developed thru Lessons Learned
Re : Salt Water Clean-Up
Importance : High
Dear Captain Stanton ,
Per your request this morning , this is to confirm our conversation with yourself , Mr. Nick Pozzi , and I .
My colleague , Nick Pozzi , has worked for over 40 years in the energy industry the majority with Saudi Aramco in the Middle East .
During that time , Nick 's team was part of the first responders that successfully cleaned similar sized spills of sweet and sour crude with the best technology available from the late 1980's thru the 1990's when he retired .
The primary equipment that was used to remove the crude from the Arabian Gulf was Super Tankers .
The Super Tankers were used to store everything , run thru on - shore three - phase separators and sent to on - shore tank farms for additional clean up using centrifuges .
The more the oil spreads the more tankers will be needed .
Nick would be willing to provide a conceptual non-technical drawing to visualize this process .
This process not only cleaned up the ocean but it saved the local environment , minimized shoreline damage , and recovered approximately 85 % of the crude oil .
( Nick may be required to get permission from Saudi Aramco thru the Houston , Texas office in Sugar Land to provide you with any further details as to what information he is allowed to disclose to you regarding the various projects that he worked on . )
Nick does not know what the appropriate channels are to effectuate this process but feels , if asked , the Saudi Government may be willing to assist as he believes , that with the right calls , tankers could be on the scene in 2 days .
Please feel free to call Nick or I , if you need any additional information or have any questions .
Sincerely ,
Jon King
Nick Pozzi

Last - minute maneuvering in the Senate allowed the Federal Reserve to sidestep legislation that would have exposed its interest - rate decision - making to congressional auditors .
Pressure from the Obama administration led Senate lawmakers to alter a provision pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. , Vt. ) that was gaining momentum despite opposition from the Treasury and the Fed .
It would have largely repealed a 32 - year - old law that shields Fed monetary policy from congressional auditors .

They were selling miracles on Eighth Street last week .
Whatever 's wrong with you , the New Living Expo has got just the miracle for it .
A whole wonderful building full of miracles .
Major credit cards accepted .
It could be a magic bracelet ( results not guaranteed ) , or a magic stick ( your results may vary ) , or a magic meditation magnet ( no refunds ) .
It could be a $ 1,200 dumbbell made out of copper wire and quartz crystals .
It could be a $ 249 silver amulet for warding off cell phone radiation .
As they say in the miracle trade , it 's good for what ails you .
" I do n't know if any of this stuff works , " said Gail Henigman of San Francisco , a New Age dabbler who has been coming to the show for years .
" But it 's fun to look at everything .
If you believe something works , maybe it does .
Who knows ? "
It was the ninth annual New Living Expo , and for three days hundreds of people with lots of money , ailments and positive thinking jammed the Concourse Exhibition Center to wander aisles full of seers , gurus , psychics , chiropractors , masseuses , healers , shamans , clairvoyants , soothsayers and pitchmen .
For sale was every possible amulet , crystal , cure , nostrum , balm , wand and widget .
Take a stroll down the first aisle .
There , in one booth , a dozen people were sitting in a circle with their bare feet soaking in small tubs of brown goop .
The tubs were hooked up with wires to a $ 1,200 machine that , according to a brochure , was sucking out toxins and parasites and " enhancing the vital energy " through the customers ' toes .
Each of the barefoot people had paid $ 20 to stick their feet in the tubs , which were turning brown either because of the sucked - out toxins or because a tub of water tends to darken when a person puts his feet into it .
' Doing something '
" It 's supposed to be inserting negative ions into my body , " said Winter Ladue , a San Francisco ferry deckhand who apparently cannot get enough dirty water merely by sailing on San Francisco Bay .
" Anyway , I wanted to see if it worked .
It 's certainly doing something .
I do n't know what . "
After 20 minutes , Ladue dried off her 10 toes and proclaimed them to feel " tingly . "
She was unsure about the toxins and the parasites and the vital energy but , she said , she was no worse for wear and she has spent $ 20 on plenty of worse things .
Nearby , David Gibson was selling crystal bowls for $ 400 .
You rub them with a special stick , and they hum .
That makes you feel good , and it makes Gibson feel good , too .
" The bowls create a sense of peace , " he said .
" But you have to be careful .
They 're fragile .
If you break the bowl , there 's no refund . "
Janna Waldinger was selling a thing called a Turbo Sonic .
It looks like an upright bathroom scale .
You stand on it and it wiggles .
It cost $ 15,000 .
It 's good for breaking up clumps of blood cells , she said , and is not the kind of thing you want anywhere near a crystal bowl .
Waldinger took one look at this reporter and told him to stand on the Turbo Sonic right away .
His cells were in need of de-clumping .
Take a look at the video screen , she said .
Check out the pictures of clumped - up cells .
" Your blood cells are all stacked up , " she said , and she turned the dials on the Turbo Sonic until the frequency meter read 14.2 and the force meter read 0.31 and the little lights were going blink , blink , blink .
All systems were go .
The Turbo Sonic began shaking and shimmying like an old Maytag on spin cycle .
" Can you feel it ? " said Waldinger .
" We 're awakening every cell to full vitality . "
After five minutes , the treatment was over .
Now the blood cells were un-clumped .
But they would n't stay unclumped .
For that , you have to stand on the Turbo Sonic every day .
The smart thing , she said , was to buy one and take it home .
Fortunately , most of the stuff at the show costs less than a Turbo Sonic .
There are miracle pills made from red wine that you give your dog to make him live longer .
Those cost $ 30 .
There 's a bottle of miracle skin lotion used by people who milk cows .
That costs $ 35 .
There 's a miracle plastic bottle you use to squirt water up your nose .
That costs $ 20 .
There 's a woman who converses with a customer 's dead relatives .
That costs $ 100 .
This reporter eavesdropped .
Her conversation seemed to be a trifle one - sided .
And in a half dozen auditoriums , fairgoers could listen to 100 or so lectures about the wonders of bamboo charcoal , near - death experiences , infrared light , fairies , God and gallstones .
Secret minerals
As for clumped - up blood cells , another thing that 's good for those was down the next aisle .
It 's a Quantum Age Water Stir Wand .
It costs $ 50 and it looks like a purple swizzle stick .
You use it to stir a glass of water .
Sealed inside the wand , said saleswoman Darlene Wilson , is a secret combination of minerals .
If she were to tell what they were , she said , it would n't be a secret anymore .
This reporter stirred a glass of water with the purple stick and drank it .
It tasted like water .
" Now you 're hydrated , " Wilson said .
Hydrated is what you want to be inside a prefab sauna , which is what another vendor was selling .
A sauna is not particularly New Age and it was hard to figure out what it was doing at the fair .
But it bounces less than a Turbo Sonic .
The sauna guy said you can take it home for $ 2,500 , today only .
And inside the sauna was Henigman , the woman who said she did n't know if any of the stuff at the show works .
She seemed to be game to try everything , however .
In one hand was a cup full of the purple - wand water and in another was a tangerine - mango energy potion .
" I love this whole show , " she said .
" Sure there are scams and snake oil .
But I do n't think anyone 's getting hurt .
Nobody 's forcing anyone to buy anything .
You have to have a little common sense . "
The sauna was up to 120 degrees .
She was sweating and , despite being hydrated with purple - wand water and tangerine - mango energy potion , her common sense said it was time to open the sauna door , which she did .
" It does feel really good to get out of a sauna , " she said .
" It 's hot in there .
I 'm feeling a lot better already . "
TINY rocket motors could one day be used to fire drugs into the human gut .
Radio - controlled capsules are already used to manoeuvre drugs to specific sites in the digestive tract to test their effectiveness .
Various methods can be used to release the drug once it gets there , but in many cases much of it remains in the capsule .
So Deyu Li of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee , and colleagues have developed a more forceful drug release system : a capsule with a drug- ejecting piston that is driven by a tiny solid - fuel rocket motor ( Sensors and Actuators A : Physical , vol 159 , …
OFF THE EASTERN SEABOARD – Name a recent U.S. military operation , and you can pretty much guarantee that a specially modified Air Force plane was somewhere in the vicinity , trying to influencing the minds of the people below .
It 's called the Commando Solo .
Ordinarily , civilians are not allowed on board .
The 193rd Special Operations
Wing operates a fleet of three of these EC - 130J aircraft , cargo haulers that have been converted into flying radio and television stations .
These " psychological operations " aircraft can broadcast their own signal over AM and FM radio , UHF and VHF television bands – or override broadcast stations on the ground , something they apparently did during operations in Bosnia and Iraq .
I recently accompanied a Commando Solo crew on a training mission .
It was an unusual opportunity to see the crew at work testing their radio and television equipment at full power .
The crew calls it " 200 - mile work " :
In order to avoid interference with domestic frequencies – the aircraft can crank up to 1,000 watts of effective radiated power – the aircraft flies more than 200 miles off the East Coast .
Once we 're safely out over the Atlantic , says Weapons Systems Officer Lt. Col .
Mike Rice , " it 's game on . "
As Weapon Systems Officer , Rice is responsible for aircraft defensive systems and data links .
He also backs up the pilots during all phases of flight .
The Weapons Systems Officer is also something like a station manager :
He creates the broadcast plan , ensures it is broadcast to the highest level of fidelity possible and oversees a five - man mission crew .
These aircraft play a crucial role in reaching – and persuading – vulnerable civilian populations .
During the recent Haiti earthquake - relief mission , Commando Solo aircraft based out of Puerto Rico relayed live broadcasts of Voice of America call - in shows in Creole , Haiti 's national language .
During breaks in the programming , the plane broadcast public service announcements , giving earthquake victims information on everything from emergency sanitation to food - distribution points .
But Commando
Solo also has a key mission in combat zones .
As Danger Room reported in 2001 , these aircraft played a crucial role in post -September 11 operations , reinforcing anti-Taliban messages , and helping persuade Afghans that U.S. intentions were good .
Commando Solo radio broadcasts helped fill an important information gap in a country where a large part of the population was illiterate , and where television reception can be extremely spotty .
In other words , the aircraft needs to be able to operate anywhere globally ; the broadcasting systems have to compatible with worldwide broadcasting formats and television encoding systems .
This training mission is straightforward :
They set up different orbits and drop out different antennas .
The EC - 130J crews also practice aerial refueling , and occasionally perform some high - speed training missions with special operations forces .
A four - hour training flight is much more " event - intensive " than a real - world mission , where the main goal is to get on station and start broadcasting .
I listen to some of the back - and - forth radio chatter , as the crew spools out various antennas :
A vertically - polarized broadcasting antenna is lowered by a cable attached to a 500 - pound weight .
A horizontal trailing wire antenna is unreeled out of the back , sort of like casting a fishing line .
This is a view of an antenna being reeled in , as seen through a periscope in the floor of the aft cargo compartment .
During the training mission , the crew also monitors a bank of receivers , to listen to and test a broadcast that 's being pumped out by the aircraft .
www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpcZthWQHqU
It 's not your father 's Vietnam - era C-130 .
The Commando Solo planes are built around the modern C - 130J , which has a fully glass cockpit and modern avionics .
And of course , there 's a microwave in the cockpit , which makes life for the crew a bit easier on a long mission .
This is the first flight as aircraft commander for Lt. Matthew Plasterer .
During the pre-flight brief , he asks Technical Sgt. Jeremy Smith a crucial maintenance question : " Is the microwave working ? "
Smith answers in the affirmative .
" Yeah , that 's almost a red ' X ' [ major maintenance issue ] if it is n't , " Plasterer grins .
Much of the crew are part - timers : Officially , the wing is part of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard , although most of its missions are for Air Force Special Operations Command .
The vice wing commander , Col. Jerry Otterbein , pictured here , is a commercial pilot for American Airlines in civilian life .
The day 's broadcast ?
Well , this is a training flight , so the crew is not playing a special , pre-packaged broadcast .
Today 's broadcast during the four - hour flight is a double feature : First , a DVD of Transformers , followed by a screening of Hancock .
Not that the crew is enjoying the in - flight movie .
Because this is a training exercise with lots of different events – Weapons Systems Officer Rice describs his checklist as a " sushi menu " of different procedures – the crew stays quite busy during the flight .
Conditions in the back of the aircraft are quite cramped , and the aircraft has a pretty substantial cooling system to keep all the electronics from overheating .
Television broadcasts are limited to one analog channel ; depending on where they are broadcasting , the crew has to re-tune the system , relying on international frequency guides .
In the future , however , the system might eventually need an upgrade .
" With the world going to a digital format , we do n't have the capability , " Rice says .
" It 's purely analog . "
Measuring the effectiveness of a bomber or a strike fighter is fairly straightforward :
The art of bomb damage assessment , measuring the size of a bomb crater or effective blast radius of airdropped weapons .
What about when your weapon is a television or radio signal , and your goal is the somewhat more nebulous aim of " influencing " a target ?
" The biggest challenge is measuring our effectiveness , " said Rice .
" We do n't have a way to look at it – we do n't have BDA .
In Haiti , however , " it was pretty evident that we were making a difference , " Rice adds .
Many Haitian broadcasters were knocked out , and the military airdropped hand - cranked radios so Haitians could get timely information on relief efforts and food distribution .
For example , Rice says they might change a delivery point for a delivery of humanitarian packages ; a Commando Solo plane would broadcast the information ; and within hours , Haitians would start forming queues at the new distribution point .
" Haiti was one of the few times where we got clear feedback , " he said .
With operations like Iraq , the results are a bit more intangible .
Rice says many of the Commando Solo broadcasts during early phase of Operation Iraq Freedom were simple rebroadcasts of the BBC :
It was perceived as a more neutral , and therefore more trusted , outlet , by Iraqis .
In Afghanistan , lots of the broadcasts post - 9/11 were simple Afghan pop music .
After years of rule by the Taliban , which forbade pop music , Afghans were eager to tune in .

It is not entrapment for law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse or to conceal their identities .

News May
Happy Summer everyone !
The really good news is that despite the lack of updates enormous progress has been made all thanks to the help of Nathan Clark our new local mechanical engineer and Chris Yanc our software developer .
The 64 prototype ( photos to follow ) actually wove for the first time at Mini Maker Faire Cleveland .
Unfortunately , the design of the heddle hooks snagged with each other and ended up being a bit imprecise so it wove a good mess .
We already redesigned the heddle holders and have to redesign the heddles next to make the 64 thread successfully weave a bit better .
A special shout out to Steve Otlowski ( one of the awesome folks we met at the faire ) who gave us some wonderful ideas to try on the heddle redesign .
We have to fine tune the lifting mech , but all the commands get sent via software to the Arduino and the Centipede shield .
Here are some photos :
We are now using a 1600W power supply which gives us enough power to expand to 320 , which is our next step once we are back in the states in August .
We have been on osloom hiatus since Mini Maker Faire as we are currently on a Fulbright / Artist - in - residence at quartier21 / Museumsquartier in Vienna ( working on a different project ) .
One side effect of the muscle wire actuators is the fact that the loom is so quiet ( it is a bit uncanny ) .
Upon our return we will meet with Nathan and Chris and get the kinks out to accurately weave with 64 threads .
The main problem remaining is to design the heddles more accurately and we will be working on that in August but probably a bit thru fall as well .
Once we get back to the US we are going to start the documentation of the hardware and schematics and releasing as we get them tweaked and finalized – the electronics and software will come out first while we tweak the heddles ) .
As far as timeline , we are looking by the end of Fall 2013 .
Again our sincerest apologies this has taken so long but since this is all based on volunteer labor and this is complicated at best .
Once the plans are good to go we hope some of you will help develop and refine for the full scale osloom .
Thanks for your continued support ( and incredible patience ) .
Margarita , Markus and the osloom team .
Earlier this year , Apple made several changes to the App Store to address complaints that apps with nothing other than a prurient purpose had infiltrated the App Store .
Part of the problem was that kids could still access screenshots for " racy " apps .
Apple also began removing a number of these apps after it received complaints from the Parents Television Council .
Though the group thinks
Apple has some room for improvement , it will be focusing its future efforts on other platforms that are growing in popularity , such as Android , which currently lack Parental Controls .
Parents Television Council is notorious for complaining to the FCC about the sexual or violent nature of TV shows , griping about foul - mouthed YouTube comments , and campaigning against kids being able to buy M- rated video games .
The group targeted the App Store earlier this year because Apple 's devices — particularly the iPod touch — are so popular with kids and teens .
The watchdog group had concerns that some apps could be accessible to children , that App Store pages had Web links that led to yet more objectionable content , and that in the case where Parental Controls were activated , kids could still browse and preview these apps .
Apple ultimately responded by cleaning out a number of these contentious apps and started blocking screenshots in iTunes in addition to the blocks already present in the on -device App Store app .
" Whenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable content we review them , " Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told Ars at the time .
" If we find these apps contain inappropriate material we remove them and request the developer make any necessary changes in order to be distributed by Apple . "
PTC applauded Apple 's actions .
" Apple has taken a positive first step towards eliminating kids ' access to sexually explicit and pornographic content on its product lineup and we applaud the company ’s efforts , " the group 's president , Tim Winter , said in a statement .
PTC does think there 's more that Apple could do .
In particular , the group is concerned that there is no filtering options for Mobile Safari as there are for desktop browsers .
This is even more important on a mobile device , PTC 's national grassroots director Gavin McKiernan told Ars , because parents can't sit with the child and monitor their browsing as they could on a desktop PC .
" We 're not up in arms against Apple , though , " McKiernan said .
" We think there 's room for improvement , but we are definitely pleased with their response to our complaints . "
PTC also thinks other mobile platforms need to take similar measures .
Steve Jobs recently dinged the Android platform as being a " porn phone " during Apple 's iPhone OS 4.0 unveiling , partly by virtue of its ability to run any app from any source .
" You know , there 's a porn store on Android and it has nothing but porn apps , " Jobs told journalists during a Q&A session .
" You can download them ; your kids can download them . "
PTC agrees with Jobs that this is a problem , as no other smartphone platform offers a system like Parental Controls .
" We plan to draw attention to other platforms , such as Android , or Verizon 's Vcast service , that are n't really doing anything , " McKiernan told Ars . "
We definitely want to see progress from some of the other handheld devices . "
Despite PTC 's singular " think of the children " focus , the group insists it is n't interested in wholesale censorship , as some of its previous campaigns might lead one to believe .
" Our goal is on limiting children 's access to objectionable content " and ensuring parents have the ability to limit this access when deemed necessary , McKiernan told Ars .
" We take no stance on the ability of adults to access legal images , movies , or whatever the case may be . "
On the fifth anniversary of the fall of Egypt 's president Mubarak , this is an account of the uprising , and the ebb and flow of the Egyptian revolution , by Wahid , an activist in Cairo .

Maddie Chambers over at Mad ’s Hobbit Hole has made a miniature Bag End hobbit hole replica from the Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the Ring movie .
It is simply amazing .
It may not be directly related to tabletop gaming , but it is still a beautiful piece of miniature scenery .
As both a huge Lord of the Rings fan and a fan of miniature tabletop scenery this is just a very exciting piece .
But do n’t just take my word for it , here are a couple sample pictures :
There are a TON more pictures over at Maddie ’s blog along with details on how she accomplished this so be sure to check that out !
She ’s even written up a work in progress post with details on how she put this all together .
This piece is really an inspiration for any miniature builder .

Gather the materials needed to build an “ on - the - ground ” tumbling composter .
[ 1 ]
An inexpensive and less complicated way to build your own tumbling composter is by creating an “ on the ground ” tumbling composter , which is simply a container outfitted to hold compost that you “ turn ” by simply rolling the container across the ground .
Purchase or obtain a large cylindrical container with a lid that fits tight .
A garbage can works best , and is likely the easiest to find .
Select either a plastic or metal garbage can that will hold at least 30 gallons ; large containers used for composting hold 55 gallons .
Wash the garbage can or container thoroughly if it has been used .
Additional materials you ’ll need include [ 2 ] : Two 48 " lengths of 1/2 " metal / aluminum pipe
One 36 " length of 1/4 " steel threaded rod ( zinc plated )
Four 2 " long 1/ 4 " bolts
Eight 1/4 " nuts
A 1/4 " metal drill bit
A 7/8 " drill bit
Drill
Hacksaw
Measuring tape
Ear and eye protection
2 elastic bungee cords that are the same length as the can 's diameter ( optional )

Drill two holes into the lid and bottom of your container using a 7/8 ” drill bit .
The holes you ’ll drill into the lid need to be 4 ” from the outer edge of the lid and directly across from each other , or specifically 180 degrees apart .
The holes at the bottom of the container need to be 2 ” from the edge .
You ’ll need to place the holes at the bottom in a sunken part of the container ’s base because you ’ll be sticking metal or aluminum pipes through these holes and you want your tumbling composter to be able to stand upright once assembled .

3 Create aeration holes all over your container .
Drill several holes , about 15 - 20 , into the top and bottom and along the sides of the container using your drill and a 1/ 4 ” drill bit .
Space the holes evenly .
The holes will allow oxygen to flow freely throughout your tumbling composter .

Drill two holes straight through each end of your two metal or aluminum pipes using a 1/ 4 " metal drill bit .
Make sure to place them as close to the end of pipes as possible .
Doing so will enable your tumbling composter to stand up properly .

5 Drill two additional holes into each pipe , and then thread your rod through those holes .
Once the pipes and connected rod are placed inside the container , the rod will need to rest in the middle of the container .
Therefore , your two additional holes must measure at half the height of your container .
Measure the height of your container and divide that measurement by two .
The number you come up with will be the length you measure on your two pipes to determine where your two holes will be drilled .
Use your 1/4 " metal drill to drill the two holes straight through the pipe .
Before you thread your rod through the new holes , it ’ll need to be cut down to size in order to fit inside your container .
To do this , measure the diameter of the container at the point where the pipes ’ holes will be .
You found this point earlier by dividing the height of your container by two .
When you come up with the diameter of the container , cut the rod 1 ” shorter than that , so it ’ll fit easily inside the container .
Slide one end of the rod through one of the pipes until the pipe is about 3 ” from the other end of the rod .
Then screw onto the rod two of the 1/4 " nuts .
Start at the end of the rod that is farthest from the pole .
Each nut should be about 4 " from each end of the rod .
Once secured , the first nut will be right next to the pole , while the second nut will be about 4 " from the end of the rod .
Once the second nut is secured , slide the rod through the second pipe , stopping when the pipe touches the 1/4 " nut .
Secure the two pipes by screwing an additional 1/4 " nut on the outer edges of the rod next to each pipe .
Once the pipes and connected rod are placed inside the container , the rod will need to rest in the middle of the container .
Therefore , your two additional holes must measure at half the height of your container .
Measure the height of your container and divide that measurement by two .
The number you come up with will be the length you measure on your two pipes to determine where your two holes will be drilled .
Use your 1/4 " metal drill to drill the two holes straight through the pipe .

Secure the pipe and rod structure to your container .
Place the structure inside the container and then turn the container on its side to make it easier to thread the ends of the pipe through the two 7/8 ” holes in the bottom of the container .
Secure the pipes by sliding a 2 ” bolt through the 1/4 " holes you drilled into the ends of the pipes , and then screwing two 1/ 4 " nuts onto the ends of each bolt .
Stand the container upright and then secure the lid by threading the tops of the pipes through the two 7/8 ” holes .
You ’ll need to drill holes into the length of the pipes just above the lid , so that once bolted the lid will stay secure when you roll it on the ground .
Use a marker to mark the spots where you ’ll drill your holes , and then to ensure your holes are even , disassemble your tumbling composter , and lie the pipes flat on the ground when you drill them .
Drill two holes straight through each pipe using the metal 1/4 " drill bit , and then reassemble your tumbling composter .
Place the structure inside the container and then turn the container on its side to make it easier to thread the ends of the pipe through the two 7/8 ” holes in the bottom of the container .

Fill your tumbling composter with composting ingredients and secure the lid .
To secure the lid , follow the same method used to secure the pipes to the bottom of the container .
Use two bolts and nuts on each side of the bolts , after you ’ve filled your tumbling composter with composting ingredients .
Slide one bolt through each of the 1/4 " holes you 've just drilled , and then secure those bolts by attaching a 1/4 " nut to each end of the bolts .
If necessary , you can secure bungee cords over the top of the container by laying them in a crisscross pattern over the lid and securing the cords either underneath the handles of the lid or through a few newly drilled holes .
From London now comes news that incoming Foreign Secretary William Hague will order an official investigation into whether British intelligence agents were complicit in Binyam Mohamed 's torture .
As the BBC and the Guardian reported late last week , Hague will be appointing a judge to lead the inquiry , which will examine whether U.K. government officials knew about or participated in the mistreatment of Mohamed and several other British - based former detainees .
As Hague explained in announcing the plan ,
So far [ British government ] ministers have stuck to the mantra that 'we never condone , authorize , or co-operate in torture . '
But this does not dispel any of the accusations .
If anything , there is now a direct and irreconcilable conflict between such ministerial assurances and the account given by Mr. Mohamed .
That must be resolved .
While the previous Labor party administration frequently cited national security concerns in seeking to withhold information from the courts about torture allegations , Hague insisted that the U.K.'s security is best protected by dealing directly with allegations of abuse :
We cannot sweep these allegations under the carpet .
Until the full facts are known , Britain 's name and reputation will be dragged through the mud — not least by the terrorists and extremists who will exploit these allegations for their own propaganda .
It is vital to remember that torture does not help us defeat terrorists ; it helps them to try to justify their hostility towards us .
Hague 's announcement followed the publication last week of a " Coalition agreement " outlining the agenda of the incoming Tory — Liberal Democrat government and picked up on pre-election calls by both parties for an official government investigation into Binyam Mohamed 's allegations .
The inquiry Hague will order reportedly could include immunity for former intelligence service agents who come forward with evidence .
" Although immunity deals are rarely granted to those who are complicit in torture , lawyers who advised Tory shadow ministers in the run-up to the election concluded that it is possible , " the Guardian reported .
" Such a deal would be of clear benefit to the two M15 and M16 officers who are currently at the centre of a Scotland Yard investigation into their alleged criminal wrongdoing . "
Meanwhile , that same report suggests that following the British appeals court earlier this month barring the use of secret evidence in a civil suit brought by Mohamed and five others who were subject to rendition and torture , " Government lawyers are expected to offer out - of - court settlements worth millions of pounds " in the cases .
As we await further developments , it 's worth reflecting on the widening difference between the U.K. and the U.S. on the question of accountability for torture .
In stark contrast to the Obama administration 's post- election " Do n't Look Back " posture , Britain 's new leaders appear determined to do what they said must be done when they were the minority , opposition parties .
And no one , as far as I can tell , is accusing them of doing anything other than upholding their principles .

So just what is Prop 14 ?
And why is it so bad ?
Basically , Prop 14 would set up a system in which every voter gets the same primary ballot , with every candidate running listed on it , and the candidates with the two highest percentages from that ballot move on to the general election .
( Currently , independent California voters actually are able to vote in any primary they want to . )
Write - in votes would be prohibited in the general election .
Something worth noting is that this is not a proposition for an " open primary , " as some claim .
An open primary would allow voters to choose which primary to vote in regardless of registration , but that is NOT what this is .
This would establish a " top two primary . "
That does n't sound so bad at first , but it turns out that the alleged reasons for implementing it are false .
This system is already in place in Washington state and Louisiana ( that bastion of transparent , honest politics ! ) had a similar system for most of the past forty years , so there is information available to compare these claims to .
Ballot access expert and San Francisco resident Richard Winger explores these claims briefly :
Louisiana has used " top - two " for state office since 1975 .
Many Louisiana gubernatorial elections have advanced candidates to the runoff who did not appeal to the center .
In 1991 , former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke reached the gubernatorial runoff , just as he had reached the U.S. Senate runoff in 1990 .
In 1995 , the gubernatorial runoff was between Mike Foster , a very conservative Republican , and Cleo Fields , who had supported Jesse Jackson for president .
In 1999 , the runoff was between Foster and William Jefferson , who was not a moderate either .
California experience also shows that " top - two " does n't ease partisanship .
California used a system in 1998 and 2000 called a blanket primary , in which all candidates from all parties ran on the same ballot and all primary voters used that ballot .
Political scientists who studied the California Legislature say the state Senate was just as polarized and the Assembly almost as polarized during the blanket primary years ...
Prop. 14 would do great damage to the social fabric , because it would stifle dissident voices .
Prop. 14 would eliminate the Peace and Freedom Party from the ballot ( because that party has 58,000 registered members , and Prop. 14 eliminates all parties with registration under approximately 100,000 members ) .
Prop. 14 also eliminates write -ins .
We know from the experience of Washington and Louisiana that minor party members never place first or second in the primary , so they can't campaign in the crucial six months between June and November when the voters are most interested in political ideas .
The people who place first or second in " top - two " systems are the incumbent and the challenger with the most money and name recognition .
A system that does n't include the disaffected in the general election is courting trouble .
When people can't air their grievances and ideas in election campaigns , they often turn to less desirable modes of protest .
The general election is for everybody , even political minorities
In another piece , he talks about how Prop 14 avoids the problem of California 's broken government rather than fixing it :
The real solution to solve California 's budget gridlock is to eliminate the rule that the budget can only be passed with two - thirds of the legislators in each house .
To those who fear that Democrats would pass an unacceptable budget if they could pass a budget with a majority vote , consider that we Californians have the recall , the initiative , and the referendum , to rein in a legislature that might otherwise be too powerful .
We have enough checks on the legislature already .
We should let the majority party in the legislature govern .
If the voters elect a majority party , let that majority party pass its budget .
If we do n't like that budget , we not only have recall , initiative or referendum , we can defeat the majority party in the next election and replace it .
But having given one party a majority in the legislature , we should let it pass the budget it wants .
It 's worth noting that Winger is actually an active Libertarian .
You read that right - a LIBERTARIAN is advocating that allowing Democrats to pass the budgets they choose is a better solution to this problem than a top two primary .
Why is he so opposed ?
Well , the main reason Winger opposes Prop 14 is that it would pretty much eliminate all third parties in California , as he said .
That 's not to say it would get rid of much - hated spoilers - in fact , during the primary , it would probably be rare to see a candidate get a majority of the vote .
And with a bunch of Democrats , Republicans , and whatever else running in the same primary , you can bet that many races would see the top two winners get ten percent of the vote or less .
This is hardly the majoritarian solution it claims to be .
In fact , there is n't much " there " there in the case supporting Prop 14 .
In a recent radio debate between Richard Winger and the referendum 's author , Lt. Gov. Moldonado , Winger frequently cited statistics and facts , while Moldonado spouted off shallow talking points .
Take a listen for yourself ( the whole show is about Prop 14 , but the debate begins at about 12 minutes and lasts for the rest of the show ) :
Yet , if there is a lack of " there " in Prop 14 , there certainly is n't a lack of money .
The " Yes " campaign has raised well over $ 2 million , with big donors like Hewlett - Packard ( $ 100,000 ) , the California Chamber of Commerce 's California Business PAC ( $ 205,000 ) , Pacific Life Insurance Company ( $ 25,000 ) , and the CEO of Netflix ( $ 257,328.40 ) .
This is not some kind of grassroots push for electoral reform - in fact , it 's exactly the opposite .
Prop 14 is a major way for big business to take control of our elections .
Spending in elections is predicted to increase if this passes , so companies that can afford to spend a hundred thousand dollars on a single ballot measure would surely benefit .
And an added benefit of this passing would be that it makes defeat for a modest public campaign finance proposition ( Prop 15 ) more likely .
From Ballotpedia :
Opponents of the Top Two Primary measure say that it is conflict with another measure on the June 8 ballot , the Fair Elections Act .
If the two propositions are in conflict , Section 4 of Article XVIII of the California Constitution decrees , " If provisions of 2 or more measures approved at the same election conflict , those of the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail . "
Richard Winger says : " The two election law measures that will be on the June 2010 California ballot do not fit together .
The public funding measure has at least eight sections that presume that political parties nominate candidates for state office , and that independent candidates do not appear on the primary ballot .
But the top - two open primary sets up a scheme under which parties would not have nominees for state office , and also provides that independent candidates would run in the primary . "
And finally , Richard Winger 's point that this would mean the death of California 's third parties , which are some of the strongest third parties in the nation currently .
In the San Francisco Chronicle , Winger writes ,
Washington used a Top 2 system for the first time in 2008 .
For the first time since statehood , the November ballot had no minor party or independent candidates for any congressional race , or any statewide state race .
Louisiana has used a Top 2 system for state office since 1975 , and never has a minor party candidate qualified for the second round .
Furthermore , Prop. 14 is far more hostile to minor parties than the version of Top 2 used in Washington state and Louisiana ... ... under Prop. 14 , how parties remain ballot - qualified will change drastically .
Under existing California law , a party remains ballot - qualified if it polls 2 percent for any statewide race in a midterm year .
But under Prop. 14 , parties wo n't have nominees .
The only way for parties to appear on the November ballot in a presidential election will be either to have approximately 100,000 registered members , or to submit a petition ( each election ) of approximately 1 million signatures .
Prop 14 is clearly undemocratic .
It does n't really do anything about the divisiveness of California politics , it increases spending in elections , and it shuts out the voice of many candidates and hundreds of thousands of California citizens .

For the second year in a row , an Alabama coalition of churches and advocacy groups was thwarted in its effort to repeal a state sales tax on groceries that amounts to $ 4 on every $ 100 food bill .
On April 8 , Alabama Arise failed to find the two - thirds vote in the legislature needed for the full house to vote on a Fall ballot measure that would repeal the tax — so burdensome to the poor — and replace it with a 1 percent tax hike on the wealthiest 4 percent of the state .
Although tea party activists win national headlines with their anti-government , anti-tax message , they are not the only tax activists in the trenches these days .
Liberals and progressives ( including many in mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches ) are making the case that raising state taxes on the wealthy and large , profitable companies is vital to protecting funding for government programs hit hard by the recession .
Oregon faced a $ 4 billion hole in 2010 — one - quarter of its budget .
In a January referendum , a union - led coalition which included some congregations won permanent tax hikes on individuals who make more than $ 125,000 and families earning over $ 250,000 ; corporations will pay anywhere from $ 150 to as much as $ 100,000 or more , depending on profitability .
As one advocate explained , quoting Luke , “ Taxes should be based on ability to pay .
A few pennies from a poor woman ’s purse cost her more than many pieces of gold from a rich man ’s hoard . ”
That is the logic of progressive taxation , which works on the idea that your second $ 50,000 should be taxed at a higher rate than your first .
Even in the best of times , states have notoriously regressive tax systems that burden lower - income people .
But only 5 out the 30 states that raised taxes last year targeted the wealthy , and the conservative spirit in the land means that sometimes liberal religious activists take what they can get .
The North Carolina Council of Churches is a member of the NC Together coalition that convinced the state legislature last year to raise sales taxes rather than just try to fill the budget hole with service cuts .
“ It was better to have a regressive tax shared by everyone than lose services , ” said Rev. George Reed , the council ’s director .
This year , the council and statewide coalition is campaigning against corporate tax breaks to help close a $ 1.5 billion gap in the 2011 budget .
Two - thirds of Alabama Arise are religious organizations .
Its defeat on April 8 ( despite majority support among Alabamans ) means Alabama will continue to be , with Mississippi , one of only two states that burden their poor with a full state sales tax on groceries without any relief for low - income families , * amounting to about $ 450 per year for a family of four .
And it will remain one of three states that allows the wealthy to deduct their federal income tax payments from their state taxes .
Majorities nationwide support raising taxes on the wealthy , despite vigorous campaigns by the Right — including the conservative Christian Family Research Council — who argue against the progressive income tax and other tax systems that demand more from those who can afford it .
In 2003 , FRC Action hired Tom McClusky from the National Taxpayers Union to help make the case with conservative evangelicals who , polls suggest , were not embracing the Republican Party platform on taxes as much as they might .
I interviewed McClusky three years ago just after his group hired an additional tax specialist and as the group was coaching state - level Family Policy Councils to question the progressive income tax and help make the Bush tax cuts permanent .
He used arguments saying regressive tax systems are better for families , and that the federal government should step back from a role in helping the poor .
“ We think the options that are out there should be looked at , be it a flat tax or sales tax , just something that makes it simpler on families , ” he said .
“ Money is best in the hands of families , and they know how best to spend it on for their children . ”
“ Helping out the poor , that ’s certainly something that the Bible tells you to do , but it does n’t tell you to turn to the tax collectors to help the poor .
It ’s more to turn to yourselves to help the poor …
We do n’t believe it ’s the role of the federal government to find an answer , a one - size fits all answer . ”
The Reagan Revolution thirty years ago made tax cuts for the wealthy mainstream , and “ starving the state ” has been part of the conservative strategy for cutting government programs ever since .
Economic conservatives in the Heritage Foundation began reaching out to social conservatives in the 1990s to win support for tax cuts even for the wealthy , and the success of that outreach can be seen not only in McClusky ’s work at FRC Action but in Mike Huckabee ’s support for a national sales tax , and the antitax politics of Christian conservatives like Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann .
Trickle - down economics has trickled down to Christian conservatives , as a September 2009 study by John C. Green , et al , shows .
85 % of conservative religious activists support tax cuts to encourage investment and 61 % say that those cuts should only go to upper - income people .
But they are not only powered by their embrace of right - wing economic theory ; as conservative Christians build their own universe of ( often all - white ) Christian academies and charities , they divest from the idea of being part of a common national enterprise .
Challenging this sentiment in the name of faith are Roman Catholics , Methodists , Episcopalians , and Presbyterians .
“ I understand that there ’s a strong anti-tax sentiment out there , ” says Rev. Reed of the NC Council of Churches , which works not with individual congregations but presbyteries and dioceses .
But we ’re not starting from scratch on tax issues .
Some of our denominations have statements on tax issues .
The Roman Catholics talk about taxes and the common good .
Our perspective is that first of all taxes are okay and we base that on some specific things in the Bible .
The story of Jesus ‘ rendering to Caeser ’ holding a coin in his hand ; Joseph storing up grain in the good years for feeding in bad years .
Also , we look to scripture for guidance and see Jesus feeding the hungry , his acts of compassion .
In a democracy some of that has to be done working together through government and taxation because the task is so big and affects all of us .
We ’re doing it for the common good , through taxation and the services taxes support .
Gwen Gray is a member of Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery , Alabama , which is part of the Arise coalition .
You know , Jesus talked about the poor often .
And he talked about the people who were in power , and how their laws and policies affect the very poor and made them poorer or made them less equal .
And so it ’s very relevant for a ministry in any church to look at how we can lobby to make a difference for the least of our citizens .
About two - thirds of the Alabama coalition ’s 150 members are congregations or other religious organizations .
Seventeen are Methodist , twelve Episcopalian , nine Presbyterian , and 20 Roman Catholic .
But Tom Duley , president of Alabama Arise ’s board , and executive director of Urban Ministries ( an inner-city mission of the United Methodist Church in Birmingham ) says their job is harder as frequent government scandals leave many assuming that the government is corrupt and inefficient and that any tax increases would be squandered .
“ It is a hard struggle .
We talk to small groups at churches and civic clubs and other places just trying to get the word out and explain what the actual facts of the matter are , ” he said .
“ Obviously we do n’t have any money for media and those sorts of communication avenues so we have to do it one on one , a little bit at a time . ”
And while his Christian faith arouses his concern for “ the least of these , ” “ there are people who do n’t see it that way and there are Christians who do n’t see the government as the rightful or correct vehicle through which those sorts of concerns could be lived out . ”
Kimble Forrister , coordinator of Alabama Arise , says some people in the small groups cannot even name what their taxes pay for .
We usually go around the room and have everybody say who you are , where you ’re from and what is one thing that your taxes paid for in the last week that benefited you .
And sometimes there ’s people in the meeting who can not think of a thing .
They cannot think of a single thing that their tax dollars paid for that has an impact on their lives .
And you have to say , well , how did you get here ?
What did you drive on ?
And then they say , ‘oh yeah , That ’s right .
Tax dollars pay for roads . ’
That sense of alienation from the benefits of government services means some whites support the grocery tax precisely because they think government mostly benefits poor blacks who they see as not paying their fair share .
I think our most compelling argument at the legislature this year is your budget woes are so severe that there ’s not really much you have to offer to families in distress , but here ’s one vote you can make that will help low - income families and wo n’t cost the budget a penny because we ’re replacing the revenue .
But the effort failed , as the coalition ’s outreach to Republican legislators failed .
They did not secure any additional Republican support than they had last year , when one GOP legislator supported the grocery tax repeal .
Parties are so divided and progressive tax movements can only succeed where Democrats have healthy majorities in the statehouse — as in Oregon .
And with congregations and nonprofits constrained from partisan politicking , they do n’t have a say in whether that will be case .
But Arise is n’t giving up .
In 2006 , they won a great victory after a long struggle when the state raised the threshold for when it begins taxing income , from $ 4,600 a year to $ 12,600 .
That still left the state with lower - middle income people paying 10.5 % of their income to the state and localities while the wealthiest one percent pay only 4 % of theirs .
Citizens for Tax Justice ranks Alabama as one of the ten worst states in overburdening the poor and middle class .
Arise is regrouping and thinking about proposing a grocery tax repeal strategy that is not revenue neutral but actually raises additional revenue from the wealthy as a way to secure the support of teachers and other government workers facing cuts .
And , Forrister said , in retrospect maybe they should not have bothered spending so much time trying to secure additional Republican support .
* This line originally implied that only two states tax groceries when in fact only two states tax groceries at the full tax rate with no exceptions for low - and middle - income residents .

Ever had a conversation or incident with someone that left you upset for a day or two ?
Maybe there 's someone in your life , perhaps a boss or family member , that this happens with regularly ?
Energy is exchanged in conversation and in events , and if this happens , you 've likely gotten a dose of bad energy .
If this happens regularly with certain individuals , it 's likely that they 're accustomed to spreading it , and also that you 're not sure how to let it go .
Especially for the more sensitive among us , negative energy can sometimes be hard to let go .
Letting the energy dissipate on its own can sometimes take a day or two , but it 's a real bummer when someone else 's poor communication , lack of consciousness , or proneness to being emotionally triggered and verbally or otherwise attacking others affects us long after the moment the incident happened in .
Fortunately , though , there are a few ways to expedite the removal of negative energy from us and shorten the amount of time it drags down our own consciousness .
One easy way is to simply brush it off .
When people often offer this well intentioned advice , they are n't speaking literally - but here we are .
Literally , take one hand and brush your arms , legs , head , and back .
Understand that energy literally sits around us so wipe your body clean , like you were removing a layer of dust from your skin .
You 'll instantly feel better as the cloud of bad energy is brushed from your immediate surroundings .
It 's best to do this outside and ideally in nature .
As the primary method , any other method should be used after this one .
Another technique is to shrug it off by shrugging your shoulders , literally .
Energy , especially the energy of resentment , which is the feeling that someone has done something wrong to you , often sits in our shoulders - along our gallbladder meridian .
By shrugging your shoulders up and down several times , you 're helping that energy move and when it moves , it can be removed - instead of sitting stuck inside you .
Blowing it off is another technique that can help and again , literally .
So breathe deeply and exhale quickly and forcefully through your mouth .
This will help remove the poor energy from your internal environment .
Sea salt can also transmute negative energy .
An easy solution is to combine a couple tablespoons of quality sea salt with a couple tablespoons of coconut or olive oil .
Then , mix it with a cup of hot water to dissolve the sea salt and pour it slowly over your head and body in the shower .
Massage it into your scalp and body for a few minutes to create your own at - home negative energy cleansing spa treatment .
Afterward your skin will feel wonderful and the energy will be transmuted .
Soaking in a bath with a cup of sea salt is also a nice way to relax while releasing bad energy .
As with many problems in the body , deep body cleansing can help too .
This is especially true , if you 're the one who 's spreading the negative energy because it 's likely you 're holding quite a bit inside - and it often stays stuck and held in place by toxicity .
Colon and liver cleansing are particularly helpful because stuck emotions often reside in the colon , and a toxic liver easily feels anger .
In fact , if your liver is clean , it 's difficult to feel anger on any sort of regular basis .
However , stuck emotions that trigger us or drag down our consciousness can be anywhere in the body and if this is the case , deeper cleansing will be needed to remove them .
More : Kim Evans is a natural health writer and author of Cleaning Up !
The Ultimate Body Cleanse offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book , people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems , as well as just losing excess weight , thinking more clearly , and feeling better .
Kim 's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible .
She 's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them .
Here 's a little from the upcoming book ...
In Isaiah 22:20 , it says , " And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant , namely Elia . "
But , because these prophecies are cryptic and they are n't meant to be understood until they are understood , it 's only the last three letters .
A few lines later , it says , " From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them .
" Here , you just take out any three middle letters , and again , it 's the name of the person bringing you this message , or the sacred secret of the prophecy .
Actually , if you take those two passages , Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them .
In Numbers 1:1  1:18 , it 's talking about " the family " and mentions Pagiel .
It also twice mentions February 1st , ( Kim 's birthday ) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old .
Kim 's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old .
In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing .
Kim 's middle name is Jo and her older sister 's name is Brandi .
There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name .
Of course , it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades .
It 's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing , if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace .
In this text , he even says things like , " You 'll never see the father unless you clean your colon . "
But , this is paraphrased ...
In the Bible Jesus says things more like , happy are those who wash their robes , as they can enter the tree of life .
The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God 's paradise .
He also said , first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean .

[ pictured : children murdered by the U.S. government during the Waco Massacre ]

19 Apr 2010 | The Agitator
In today ’s New York Times , Bill Clinton once again tries to tie the Oklahoma City bombing to those of us who hold “ the belief that the greatest threat to American freedom is our government , and that public servants do not protect our freedoms , but abuse them . ”
Of course he sort of proves those of us who do believe such things right by continually using April 19 to tie us to a deranged murderer instead of acknowledging , taking some responsibility for , or expressing any remorse whatsoever for another anniversary we observe today : the Clinton administration ’s slaughter of 76 people , including 20 children , at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco .
Waco gets all of a sentence in Clinton ’s op -ed .
Clinton twice invokes America ’s founders in the piece :
He refers to George Washington ’s suppression of the whiskey rebellion , and he explains that the founders “ constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear . ”
I was born on April 19 , so I know a bit about today ’s history .
It ’s not just the anniversary of Waco and Oklahoma City , it ’s also the anniversary of the battles of Concord and Lexington — the first shots of the American Revolution .
That would of course be an occasion of citizens rising up to violently overthrow the government that most Americans — including Clinton — tend to celebrate .
And it ’s probably worth noting that we threw off the yoke of the crown for violations of human freedom and dignity that were a hell of a lot less severe than what we put up with today .
( Today is also the anniversary of the beginning of the Warsaw ghetto uprising — a reminder sometimes violence against those who have deemed themselves in charge is unequivocally justified . )
I do n’t think Clinton is calling for censorship of people who , as he puts it , “ demoniz[e ] the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws . ”
But I do think he ’s trying to marginalize those of us who criticize the government — to shunt us to the fringe .
And he ’s laying groundwork so that the next time some idiot flies a plane into an IRS building , or some madman opens fire on a couple of cops , he can move the ball a bit more toward pinning the bodies on those of us who dare to criticize the now insurmountable federal deficit , the mass looting of the taxpayers that is the public pension system , or the panoply of drug war , criminal justice , and police militarization abuses you read about on this site — to rattle off just a few examples .
I ’ve never really felt the need to distance myself from people like Tim McVeigh or Joseph Stack because I ’ve never felt any affinity or kinship with them .
But just for the record , let me say that taking up arms against the government is moronic and reprehensible for a host of reasons , not least of which is that there is n’t a chance in hell you ’re going to win .
Beyond that , atrocious as Waco was , murdering a bunch of federal workers , their children , and bystanders , none of whom had anything whatsoever to do with Waco , was n’t just morally repugnant , it was an act of insanity and delusion ( McVeigh actually thought the bombing could have sparked a revolution ) .
And even if one were depraved enough to find some moral justification in Oklahoma City , think of what it did for McVeigh ’s cause : Instead of April 19 being the day we remember and lament the Clinton ’s administration ’s monumental fuck - up , and possibly reflect on massive power of government to simply eliminate people it deems weird or fringe or threatening , Clinton , armed with moral rectitude provided by McVeigh , now gets to take to the pages of the New York Times to celebrate government , and to denounce and marginalize the people who dare to criticize it .
The really mendacious thing about the crap Clinton spews at about this time every year is that unlike the tortured nexus he tries to build between government critics and Timothy McVeigh , his responsibility for the charred bodies at Waco is pretty damned easy to chart .
He gets to gloss over all of that now .
The thing is , Mr. Former President , if I may address you directly , is there are far too may public servants who , as you put it , “ do not protect our freedoms , but abuse them . ”
I document them every day on this site .
And so despite your admonition , I will continue to criticize them for it .
And when , for example , they out and out murder innocent people in the name of a senseless , wasteful , and fundamentally illiberal policy ( a policy , incidentally , that you enthusiastically support , despite your admission that you yourself have broken the country ’s drug laws ) , I ’ll go ahead and , to borrow your word , demonize them for it .
And you know what ?
I wo n’t feel the slightest tinge of guilt about doing so .
Nor will I feel the least bit of responsibility for acts of anti-government violence , past or future , even when they ’re committed in the name of one or more ideas I might otherwise endorse .
Because fundamentally and categorically , I repudiate the use of force and violence to impose my beliefs , political philosophy , or policy preferences on other people .
Until you can say the same thing , Mr. Former President ( and we both know you can ’t ) , you can spare me your goddamned lecture .

Brown University , although it receives billions in federal funds , does not guarantee its students procedural due process - well , at least not if you 're a young white male :
A former student has sued Brown University in federal court , saying university officials interfered with his efforts to clear his name after another student , the daughter of a prominent Brown alumnus and donor , accused him of rape .
[ The media refused to report the whole story .
I will .
Her name is Marcella Beth Dresdale .
Her father 's name is Richard C. Dresdale . ]
In documents unsealed Monday , the former student , William McCormick III , said the university had failed to follow its own disciplinary policies and sent him home to Wisconsin after the woman ’s father made calls to top university officials .
The rape accusation was never reported to the police by Brown or the woman , according to the lawsuit .
Within a month , Mr. McCormick had agreed to a private settlement with the woman ’s lawyer : if he withdrew from Brown , she would not file criminal charges .
Surely there 'd be some physical evidence if there were a rape .
McCormick was a 250 - pound wrestler .
That 'd be strong enough to rape 99 % of C& F 's male readership .
Nevertheless , Brown never investigated the rape .
Did they even have sex ?
If so , when ?
When were they alone ?
Again , Brown did not investigate .
They simply took the word of a rich girl who did n't like how McCormick looked :
According to his lawsuit , Mr. McCormick arrived at Brown in the fall of 2006 as a star wrestler and straight - A student with a financial aid scholarship to attend the university .
He was assigned to live in the same dorm as the female student .
In the first few days of school , the lawsuit describes the two as becoming “ friendly , but not romantic . ”
But Mr. McCormick quickly drew attention in the dorm , the lawsuit says : his 250 - pound frame cut a “ physically imposing figure , ” and the woman ’s friends began describing him as “ creepy ” and called him her “ stalker . ”
Remember yesterday 's post ?
What does it mean to say a guy is " creepy " or is a " stalker " ?
It simply means that the guy is not someone the woman is attracted to .
If McCormick wore a pink Polo with popped collars , no doubt the little rich girl would not have viewed him as a creepy stalker .
But since he was a non-douchebag and came from a humble family , he was creepy .
How dare a regular American show interest in her ?!
Those of you who have young men in college should also take heed :
After the student amended her complaint to include rape , Brown officials met with Mr. McCormick and presented him with a one - way ticket home to Wisconsin .
According to the lawsuit , they denied his requests for a copy of the complaint against him and he was not given an opportunity to provide his version of events .
He was told only that he faced a complaint of “ sexual misconduct , ” the lawsuit asserts .
No hearing ; no discovery ; no cross-examination ; no due process .
That Brown is a private college means nothing .
Even private institutions are not allowed to discriminate based on gender .
Brown nonetheless discriminated against McCormick because he happened to have been born a man .

Manchmal hat man den Eindruck , als setze die schwarz - gelbe Koalition in Berlin einfach nur die Politik ihrer " großen " Vorgängerin fort .
In der Datenschutz - und Internetpolitik allerdings ist ein Wandel offensichtlich .
Hier ist eine liberale Handschrift erkennbar , die von der Union nicht nur geduldet , sondern offenbar kräftig nachgezeichnet wird .
Denn man hat gelernt .
Nach der unglücklichen Internetpolitik der Union in der letzten Legislaturperiode soll nun die gestern gestartete Enquetekommission " Internet und digitale Gesellschaft " eine Expertise erarbeiten .
Es soll erst nachgedacht werden , bevor man handelt .
Das ist gut so .
Denn von der Leyens Internetsperrgesetz war schon am Wahlabend Makulatur .
Die Kinderpornografie grassiert zwar nach wie vor , aber die liberale Bundesjustizministerin Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger ( FDP ) will sich nun damit " Zeit lassen " .
Das Bundesverfassungsgesetz kippte die Vorratsdatenspeicherung - die Justizministerin will auch hier " nichts überstürzen " beim neuen Gesetzesanlauf , der laut EU - Rahmenrichtlinie her muss .
Und man sah die schwarze Flagge der Piratenpartei geradezu im Wind knattern über dem Leitantrag der Justizministerin auf dem jüngsten Bundesparteitag der FDP .
Und die Union ?
Widerstand zwecklos ?
Nein , Widerstand unerwünscht .
Die CSU hat sogar eine eigene Beauftragte zur Abwehr der Piratenpartei und lässt ihre Verbraucherschutzministerin gegen die " Datenkrake " Google zu Felde ziehen .
Bei der CDU wird Bundesinnenminister Thomas de Maizière als " Minister für Entwarnung " gefeiert .
Kein Ernstfall mehr ?
Das kommt darauf an , was man unter Ernstfall versteht .
Entspannt hat sich jedenfalls nichts an den Frontlinien des Cyberwar , bei der zivilen und militärischen Bedrohung im Netz .
Sie ist " anhaltend hoch " , hört man aus den Lagezentren .
So ist die Qualifizierung de Maizières als " blauäugig " in Kreisen der entpflichteten Stäbe seines Vorgängers Schäuble noch eine der freundlicheren .

Von Wikipedia , der neuen Volksenzyklopädie , erfahren wir in diesen Tagen , dass weniger als 0,5 Prozent der Mitglieder die Beiträge schreiben .

Bei wikileaks.org , einer Art Enthüllungsguerilla im Internet , die jüngst mit einem Videobeweis für die Tötung von Zivilisten durch US - Soldaten im Irak weltweit Schlagzeilen machte , stellen sich ähnliche Fragen .

Mit ihrem bemerkenswerten Neuanfang setzt die deutsche Internetpolitik auf die Fähigkeit der Internetgesellschaft zur Selbstkontrolle und - organisation .

Um Verkehrsregeln im Netz wird auch diese Bundesregierung nicht umhinkommen .

Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) has a has a twisted sense of logic , if MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann is to be believed .
In a hearing with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Wednesday , Graham said he opposed stopping persons on the no-fly list from buying guns but at the same time advocated taking away their Miranda rights .
“ The problem I have is that the watch list , when you look at the numbers , has so many problems with it that I think it`s not appropriate to go down the road that we`re going because a constitutional right is involved , ” Graham remarked .
“ And before we subject innocent Americans who have had done nothing but have the wrong name at the wrong time , to having to go into court and pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back , I want to slow down and think about this . ”

But he said , while he ’s okay with no - fly list members buying guns , he does n’t want them to know about their right to remain silent .
“ I want to stop reading these guys their Miranda rights , ” he said .
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann invited The Huffington Post ‘s Lawrence O’Donnell to discuss Graham ’s thinking .
“ Let me start with the head - up - the - butt logic question here , ” Olbermann began .
“ Senator Graham is willing to say a terror suspect should have his Miranda rights suspended but somebody on a terror watch list should have the same rights as anybody else to buy a gun or some actual explosive that will blow up ? ”
“ Well , what do you want here , Keith ?
Consistency ?
This is a United States senator after all , ” said O’Donnell as Olbermann snickered .

“ And pandering is difficult , especially reactionary pandering in the aftermath of these kinds of tense events .
And so , Lindsey Graham , once again , got desperately lost in his wanderings around the Constitution and what he feels like respecting in a given moment and what he feels like ignoring , ” O’Donnell continued .
“ And so , this one is about as funny and simple - minded as it gets .
To catch him on tape that close together , with conflicting thoughts , is a particularly fun day in those Senate hearings , said O’Donnell .
Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee , Bloomberg explained that the “ terror gap ” allows suspects on a federal watch list to buy firearms .
“ That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security , ” said Bloomberg .

“ It is time to close this ‘ terror gap ’ in our gun laws , ” he told the committee .

" Less than five years ago , Bob Dylan was scuffling in New York - sleeping in friends ' apartments on the Lower East Side and getting very occasional singing work at Gerde 's Folk City , an unprepossessing bar for citybillies in the Village .
With his leather cap , blue jeans and battered desert boots - his unvarying costume in those days - Dylan looked like an updated , undernourished Huck Finn .
And like Huck , he had come out of the Midwest ; he would have said ' escaped . '
The son of Abraham Zimmerman , an appliance dealer , he was raised in Hibbing , Minnesota , a bleak mining town near the Canadian border .
Though he ran away from home regularly between the ages of 10 and 18 , young Zimmerman did manage to finish high school , and went on to spend about six months at the University of Minnesota in 1960 .
By then , he called himself Bob Dylan - in tribute to Dylan Thomas , according to legend ; but actually after a gambling uncle whose last name was similar to Dylan .
" In the fall of that year , he came East to visit his idol , Woody Guthrie , in the New Jersey hospital where the Okie folk - singing bard was wasting away with a progressive disease of the nervous syste1 m .
Dylan stayed and tried to scrape together a singing career .
According to those who knew him then , he was shy and stubborn but basically friendly and , beneath the hipster stance , uncommonly gentle .
But they argued about his voice .
Some found its flat Midwestern tones gratingly mesmeric ; others agreed with a Missouri folk singer who had likened the Dylan sound to that of 'a dog with his leg caught in barbed wire . '
All agreed , however , that his songs were strangely personal and often disturbing , a pungent mixture of loneliness and defiance laced with traces of Guthrie , echoes of the Negro blues singers and more than a suggestion of country - and - western ; but essentially Dylan was developing his own penetratingly distinctive style .
Yet the voice was so harsh and the songs so bitterly scornful of conformity , race prejudice and the mythology of the Cold War that most of his friends could n't conceive of Dylan making it big even though folk music was already on the , rise .
" They were wrong .
In September of 1961 , a music critic for The New York Times caught his act at Gerde's and hailed the scruffy l9 - year - old Minnesotan as a significant new voice on the folk horizon .
Around the same time , he was signed by Columbia Records , and his first album was released early the next year .
Though it was far from a smash hit , concerts and club engagements gradually multiplied ; and then Dylan scored his storied triumph at the Newport Folk Festival in 1962 .
His next LP began to move , and in the spring of 1963 came his first big single : ' Blowin ' in the Wind . '
That same spring he turned down a lucrative guest shot on ' The Ed Sullivan Show ' because CBS would n't permit him to sing a mordant parody he 'd written about the John Birch Society .
For the nation 's young , the Dylan image began to form : kind of a singing James Dean with over tones of Holden Caulfeld ; he was making it , but he was n't selling out .
His concerts began to attract overflow crowds , and his songs - in performances by him and other folk singers - were rushing onto the hit charts .
One of them , ' The Times They Are A - Changin ' , ' became an anthem for the rebellious young , who savored its message that adults do n't know where it's at and can't tell their children what to do .
" By 1965 he had become a major phenomenon on the music scene .
More and more folk performers , from Joan Baez to the Byrds , considered it mandatory to have an ample supply of Dylan songs in their repertoires ; in one frantically appreciative month - last August - 18 different recordings of Dylan ballads were pressed by singers other than the composer himself .
More and more aspiring folk singers - and folk - song writers - have begun to sound like Dylan .
The current surge of ' protest ' songs by such long - haired , post - beat rock -'n '- rollers as Barry McGuire and Sonny and Cher is credited to Dylan .
And the newest commercial boom , ' folk - rock , ' a fusion of fold - like lyrics with an r -'n '-r beat and background , is an outgrowth in large part , of Dylan 's recent decision - decried as a ' sellout ' by folknik purists - to perform with a roch -'n '- roll combo rather than continue to accompany himself alone on the guitar .
Backed by the big beat of the new group , Dylan tours England with as much tumultuous success as he does America , and the air play for his single records in both countries is rivaled only by that of the Beatles , Herman 's Hermits and the Rolling Stones on the Top 40 deejay shows .
In the next 18 months , his income - from personal appearances , records and composer 's royalties - is expected to exceed $ 1,000,000 .
" Withal , Dylan seems outwardly much the same as he did during the lean years in Greenwich Village .
His dress is still casual to the point of exoticism ; his hair is still long and frizzy , and he is still no more likely to be seen wearing a necktie than a cutaway .
But there have been changes .
No longer protesting polemically against the bomb , race prejudice and conformity , his songs have become increasingly personal - a surrealistic amalgam of kafkaesque menace corrosive satire and opaque sensuality .
His lyrics are more crowded than t!ver with tumbling words and restless images , and they read more like free - verse poems than conventional lines .
Adults still have difficulty digging his offbeat language - and its message of alienation - but the young continue to tune in and turn on .
" But there are other changes .
Dylan has become elusive .
He is no longer seen in his old haunts in the Village and on the Lower East Side .
With few exceptions , he avoids interviewers , and in public , he is usually seen from afar at the epicenter of a protective coterie of tousle - topped young men dressed like him , and lissome , straight - haired young ladies who also seem to be dressed like him .
His home base , if it can be called that , is a house his manager owns near Woodstock , a fashionable artists ' colony in New York State , and he also enjoys the run of his manager 's apartment on dignified Gramercy Park in New York City .
There are tales told of Dylan the motorcyclist , the novelist , the maker of high - camp home movies ; but except among his small circle of intimates , the 24 - year - old folk hero is inscrutably aloof .
" It was only after a long period of evasion and hesitation that Dylan finally agreed to grant this ' Playboy Interview ' - the longest he 's ever given .
We met him on the 10th floor of the new CBS and Columbia Records building in mid-Manhattan .
The room was antiseptic : white walls with black trim , contemporary furniture with severe lines , avantgarde art chosen by committee , everything in order , neat desks , neat personnel .
In this sterile setting , slouched in a chair across from us , Dylan struck a refreshingly discordant note - with his untamed brownish - blond mane brushing the collar of his tieless blue plaid shirt , in his black jacket , gray vaudevillian - striped pipestem pants and well - worn blue - suede shoes .
Sitting nearby - also long - haired , tieless and blackjacketed , but wearing faded jeans - was a stringy young man whom the singer identified only as Taco Pronto .
As Dylan spoke - in a soft drawl , smiling only rarely and fleetingly , sipping tea and chainsmoking cigarettes - his unspeaking friend chuckled and nodded appreciatively from the side lines .
Tense and guarded at first Dylan gradually began to loosen up , then to open up , as he tried to tell us - albeit a bit surrealistically - just where he 's been and where he 's going .
Under the circumstances , we chose to play straight man in our questions , believing that to have done othervise would have stemmed the freewheeling flow of Dylan 's responses . "
PLAYBOY : ' Popular songs , " you told a reporter last year , " are the only art form that describes the temper of the times .
The only place where it 's happening is on the radio and records .
That 's where the people hang out .
It 's not in books ; it 's not on the stage ; it 's not in the galleries .
All this art thev've been talking about , it just remains on the shelI .
It does n't make anyone happier . "
In view of the fact that more people than ever before are reading books and going to plays and art galleries , do you think that statement is borne out by the facts ?
DYLAN : Statistics measure quantity , not quality .
The people in the statistics are people who are very bored .
Art , if there is such a thing , is in the bathrooms ; everybody knows that .
To go to an art gallery thing where you get free milk and doughnuts and where there is a rock -'n '- roll band playing :
That 's just a status affair .
I 'm not putting it down , mind you ; but I spend a lot of time in the bathroom .
I think museums are vulgar .
They 're all against sex .
Anyhow , I did n't say that people " hang out " on the radio , I said they get " hung up " on the radio .
PLAYBOY : Why do you think rock ' n ' roll has become such an international phenomenon ?
DYLAN : I can't really think that there is any rock ' n ' roll .
Actually , when you think about it , anything that has no real existence is bound to become an international phenomenon .
Anyway , what does it mean , rock ' n ' roll ?
Does it mean Beatles , does it mean John Lee Hooker , Bobby Vinton , Jerry Lewis ' kid ?
What about Lawrence Welk ?
He must play a few rock -'n ' - roll songs .
Are all these people the same ?
Is Ricky Nelson like Otis Redding ?
Is Mick Jagger really Ma Rainey ?
I can tell by the way people hold their cigarettes if they like Ricky Nelson .
I think it 's fine to like Ricky Nelson : I could n't care less if somebody likes Ricky Nelson .
But I think we 're getting off the track here .
There is n't any Ricky Nelson .
There is n't any Beatles ; oh , I take that back : there are a lot of beetles .
But there is n't any Bobby Vinton .
Anyway , the word is not " international phenomenon " ; the word is " parental nightmare . "
PLAYBOY : In recent years , according to some critics , jazz has lost much of its appeal to the younger generation .
Do you agree ?
DYLAN : I do n't think jazz has ever appealed to the younger generation .
Anyway , I do n't really know who this younger generation is .
I do n't think they could get into a jazz club anyway .
But jazz is hard to follow ; I mean you actually have to like jazz to follow it : and my motto is , never follow anything .
I do n't know what the motto of the younger generation is , but I would think they'd have to follow their parents .
I mean , what would some parent say to his kid if the kid came home with a glass eye , a Charlie Mingus record and a pocketful of feathers ?
He 'd say , " Who are you following ? "
And the poor kid would have to stand there with water in his shoes , a bow tie on his ear and soot pouring out of his belly button and say , " Jazz , Father , I 've been following jazz . "
And his father would probably say , " Get a broom and clean up all that soot before you go to sleep . "
Then the kid 's mother would tell her friends , " Oh yes , our little Donald , he 's part of the younger generation , you know . "
PLAYBOY : You used to say that you wanted to perform as little as possible , that you wanted to keep most of your time to yourself .
Yet you 're doing more concerts and cutting more records every year .
Why ?
Is it the money ?
DYLAN : Everything is changed now from before .
Last spring .
I guess I was going to quit singing .
I was very drained , and the way things were going , it was a very draggy situation - I mean , when you do " Everybody Loves You for Your Black Eye , " and meanwhile the back of your head is caving in .
Anyway , I was playing a lot of songs I did n't want to play .
I was singing words I did n't really want to sing .
I do n't mean words like " God " and " mother " and " President " and " suicide " and " meat cleaver . "
I mean simple little words like " if " and " hope " and " you . "
But " Like a Rolling Stone " changed it all : I did n't care anymore after that about writing books or poems or whatever .
I mean it was some thing that I myself could dig .
It 's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself do n't dig you .
It 's also very deadly entertainment wise .
Contrary to what some scary people think , I do n't play with a band now for any kind of propaganda - type or commercial - type reasons .
It 's just that my songs are pictures and the band makes the sound of the pictures .
PLAYBOY : Do you feel that acquiring a combo and switching from folk to folkrock has improved you as a performer ?
DYLAN : I 'm not interested in myself as a performer .
Performers are people who perform for other people .
Unlike actors , I know what I 'm saying .
It 's very simple in my mind .
It does n't matter what kind of audience reaction this whole thing gets .
What happens on the stage is straight .
It does n't expect any rewards or fines from any kind of outside agitators .
It 's ultra-simple , and would exist whether anybody was looking or not .
As far as folk and folk - rock are concerned , it does n't matter what kind of nasty names people invent for the music .
It could be called arsenic music , or perhaps Phaedra music .
I do n't think that such a word as folk - rock has anything to do with it .
And folk music is a word I can't use .
Folk music is a bunch of fat people .
I have to think of all this as traditional music .
Traditional music is based on hexagrams .
It comes about from legends , Bibles , plagues , and it revolves around vegetables and death .
There 's nobody that 's going to kill traditional music .
All these songs about roses growing out of people 's brains and lovers who are really geese and swans that turn into angels - they 're not going to die .
It 's all those paranoid people who think that someone 's going to come and take away their toilet paper - they 're going to die .
Songs like " Which Side Are You On ? " and " I Love You , Porgy " - they 're not folk - music songs ; they 're political songs .
They 're already dead .
Obviously , death is not very universally accepted .
I mean , you 'd think that the traditional - music people could gather from their songs that mystery - just plain simple mystery - is a fact , a traditional fact .
I listen to the old ballads ; but I would n't go to a party and listen to the old ballads .
I could give you descriptive detail of what they do to me , but some people would probably think my imagination had gone mad .
It strikes me funny that people actually have the gall to think that I have some kind of fantastic imagination .
It gets very lonesome .
But anyway , traditional music is too unreal to die .
It does n't need to be protected .
Nobody 's going to hurt it .
In that music is the only true , valid death you can feel today off a record player .
But like anything else in great demand , people try to own it .
It has to do with a purity thing .
I think its meaninglessness is holy .
Everybody knows that I 'm not a folk singer .
PLAYBOY : Some of your old fans would agree with you - and not in a complimentary vein - since your debut with the rock -'n '- roll combo at last year 's Newport Folk Festival , where many of them booed you loudly for " selling out " to commercial pop tastes .
The early Bob Dylan , they felt , was the " pure " Bob Dylan .
How do you feel about it ?
DYLAN : I was kind of stunned .
But I can't put anybody down for coming and booing : after all , they paid to get in .
They could have been maybe a little guieter and not so persistent , though .
There were a lot of old people there , too ; lots of whole families had driven down from Vermont , lots of nurses and their parents , and well , like they just came to hear some relaxing hoedowns , you know , maybe an Indian polka or two .
And just when everything 's going all right , here I come on , and the whole place turns into a beer factory .
There were a lot of people there who were very pleased that I got booed .
I saw them afterward .
I do resent somewhat , though , that everybody that booed said they did it because they were old fans .
PLAYBOY : What about their charge that you vulgarized your natural gifts ?
DYLAN : What can I say ?
I 'd like to see one of these so - called fans .
I 'd like to have him blindfolded and brought to me .
It 's like going out to the desert and screaming and then having little kids throw their sandbox at you .
I 'm only 24 .
These people that said this - were they Americans ?
PLAYBOY : Americans or not , there were a lot of people who did n't like your new sound .
In view of tbis widespread negative reaction , do you think you may have made a mistake in changing your style ?
DYLAN : A mistake is to commit a misunderstanding .
There could be no such thing , anyway , as this action .
Either people understand or they pretend to understand - or else they really do n't understand .
What you 're speaking of here is doing wrong things for selfish reasons .
I do n't know the word for that , unless it 's suicide .
In any case , it has nothing to do with my music .
PLAYBOY : Mistake or not , what made you decide to go the rock -'n ' - roll route ?
DYLAN : Carelessness .
I lost my one true love .
I started drinking .
The first thing I know , I 'm in a card game .
Then I 'm in a crap game .
I wake up in a pool hall .
Then this big Mexican lady drags me off the table , takes me to Philadelphia .
She leaves me alone in her house , and it burns down .
I wind up in Phoenix .
I get a job as a Chinaman .
I start working in a dime store , and move in with a 13 - year - old girl .
Then this big Mexican lady from Philadelphia comes in and burns the house down .
I go down to Dallas .
I get a job as a " before " in a Charles Atlas " before and after " ad .
I move in with a delivery boy who can cook fantastic chili and hot dogs .
Then this 13 - year - old girl from Phoenix comes and burns the house down .
The delivery boy - he ain't so mild :
He gives her the knife , and the next thing I know I 'm in Omaha .
It 's so cold there , by this time I 'm robbing my own bicycles and frying my own fish .
I stumble onto some luck and get a job as a carburetor out at the hot - rod races every Thursday night .
I move in with a high school teacher who also does a little plumbing on the side , who ain't much to look at , but who 's built a special kind of refrigerator that can turn newspaper into lettuce .
Everything 's going good until that delivery boy shows up and tries to knife me .
Needless to say , he burned the house down , and I hit the road .
The first guy that picked me up asked me if I wanted to be a star .
What could I say ?
PLAYBOY : And that 's how you became a rock -'n ' - roll singer ?
DYLAN : No , that 's how I got tuberculosis .
PLAYBOY : Let 's turn the question around :
Why have you stopped composing and singing protest songs ?
DYLAN : I 've stopped composing and singing anything that has either a reason to be written or a motive to be sung .
Do n't get me wrong , now .
" Protest " is not my word .
I 've never thought of myself as such .
The word " protest , " I think , was made up for people undergoing surgery .
It 's an amusement - park word .
A normal person in his righteous mind would have to have the hiccups to pronounce it honestly .
The word " message " strikes me as having a hernia - like sound
It 's just like the word " delicious . "
Also the word " marvelous . "
You know , the English can say " marvelous " pretty good .
They can't say " raunchy " so good , though .
Well , we each have our thing .
Anyway , message songs , as everybody knows , are a drag .
It 's only college newspaper editors and single girls under 14 that could possibly have time for them .
PLAYBOY : You 've said you think message songs are vulgar .
Why ?
DYLAN : Well , first of all , anybody that 's got a message is going to learn from experience that they can't put it into a song .
I mean it 's just not going to come out the same message .
After one or two of these unsuccessful attempts , one realizes that his resultant message , which is not even the same message he thought up and began with , he 's now got to stick by it ; because , after all , a song leaves your mouth just as soon as it leaves your hands .
Are you following me ?
PLAYBOY : Oh , perfectly .
DYLAN : Well , anyway , second of all , you 've got to respect other people 's right to also have a message themselves .
Myself , what I 'm going to do is rent Town Hall and put about 30 Western Union boys on the bill .
I mean , then there 'll really be some messages .
People will be able to come and hear more messages than they 've ever heard before in their life .
PLAYBOY : But your early ballads have been called " songs of passionate protest . "
Would n't that make them " message " music ?
DYLAN : This is unimportant .
Do n't you understand ?
I 've been writing since I was eight years old .
I 've been playing the guitar since I was ten .
I was raised playing and writing whatever it was I had to play and write .
PLAYBOY : Would it be unfair to say , then , as some have , that you were motivated commercially rather than creatively in writing the kind of songs that made you popular ?
DYLAN : All right , now , look .
It 's not all that deep .
It 's not a complicated thing .
My motives , or whatever they are , were never commercial in the money sense of the word .
It was more in the do n't die - by - the - hacksaw sense of the word .
I never did it for money .
It happened , and I let it happen to me .
There was no reason not to let it happen to me .
I could n't have written before what I write now , anyway .
The songs used to be about what I felt and saw .
Nothing of my own rhythmic vomit ever entered into it .
Vomit is not romantic .
I used to think songs are supposed to be romantic .
And I did n't want to sing anything that was unspecific .
Unspecific things have no sense of time .
All of us people have no sense of time ; it 's a dimensional hangup .
Anybody can be specific and obvious .
That 's always been the easy way .
The leaders of the world take the easy way .
It 's not that it 's so difficult to be unspecific and less obvious ; it 's just that there 's nothing , absolutely nothing , to be specific and obvious about .
My older songs , to say the least , were about nothing .
The newer ones are about the same nothing - only as seen inside a bigger thing , perhaps called the nowhere .
But this is all very constipated .
I do know what my songs are about .
PLAYBOY : And what 's that ?
DYLAN : Oh , some are about four minutes ; some are about five , and some , believe it or not , are about eleven or twelve .
PLAYBOY : Ca n't you be a bit more informative ?
DYLAN : Nope .
PLAYBOY : All right .
Let 's change the subject .
As you know , it 's the age group from about 16 to 25 that listens to your songs .
Why , in your opinion ?
DYLAN : I do n't see what 's so strange about an age group like that listening to my songs .
I 'm hip enough to know that it ain't going to be the 85 - to - 90 - yearolds .
If the 85 - to - 90 - year - olds were listening to me , they 'd know that I can't tell them anything .
The 16 - to - 25 - year - olds , they probably know that I can't tell them anything either - and they know that I know it .
It 's a funny business .
Obviously , I 'm not an IBM computer any more than I 'm an ashtray .
I mean it 's obvious to anyone who 's ever slept in the back seat of a car that I 'm just not a schoolteacher .
PLAYBOY : Even though you 're not a schoolteacher , would n't you like to help the young people who dig you from turning into what some of their parents have become ?
DYLAN : Well , I must say that I really do n't know their parents .
I really do n't know if anybody 's parents are so bad .
Now , I hate to come on like a weakling or a coward , and I realize it might seem kind of irreligious , but I 'm really not the right person to tramp around the country saving souls .
I would n't run over anybody that was laying in the street , and I certainly would n't become a hangman .
I would n't think twice about giving a starving man a cigarette .
But I 'm not a shepherd .
And I 'm not about to save anybody from fate , which I know nothing about .
" Parents " is not the key word here .
The key word is " destiny . "
I can't save them from that .
PLAYBOY : Still , thousands of young people look up to you as a kind of folk hero .
Do you feel some sense of responsibility toward them ?
DYLAN : I do n't feel I have any responsibility , no .
Whoever it is that listens to my songs owes me nothing .
How could I possibly have any responsibility to any kind of thousands ?
What could possibly make me think that I owe anybody anything who just happens to be there ?
I 've never written any song that begins with the words " I 've gathered you here tonight . . . "
I 'm not about to tell anybody to be a good boy or a good girl and they 'll go to heaven .
I really do n't know what the people who are on the receiving end of these songs think of me , anyway .
It 's horrible .
I 'll bet Tony Bennett does n't have to go through this kind of thing .
I wonder what Billy the Kid would have answered to such a question .
PLAYBOY : In their admiration for you , many young people have begun to imitate the way you dress - which one adult commentator has called " selfconsciously oddball and defiantly sloppy . "
What 's your reaction to that kind of put - down ?
DYLAN : Bullshit .
Oh , such bullshit .
I know the fellow that said that .
He used to come around here and get beat up all the time .
He better watch it ; some people are after him .
They 're going to strip him naked and stick him in Times Square .
They 're going to tie him up , and also put a thermometer in his mouth .
Those kind of morbid ideas and remarks are so petty - I mean there 's a war going on .
People got rickets ; everybody wants to start a riot ; 40 - year - old women are eating spinach by the carload ; the doctors have n't got a cure for cancer - and here 's some hillbilly talking about how he does n't like somebody 's clothes .
Worse than hat , it gets printed and innocent people have to read it .
This is a terrible thing .
And he 's a terrible man .
Obviously , he 's just living off the fat of himself , and he 's expecting his kids to take care of him .
His kids probably listen to my records .
Just because my clothes are too long , does that mean I 'm unqualified for what I do ?
PLAYBOY : No , but there are those who think it does - and many of them seem to feel the same way about your long hair .
But compared with the shoulder - length coiffures worn by some of the male singing groups these days , your tonsorial tastes are on the conservative side .
How do you feel about these far - out hair styles ?
DYLAN : The thing that most people do n't realize is that it 's warmer to have long hair .
Everybody wants to be warm .
People with short hair freeze easily .
Then they try to hide their coldness , and they get jealous of everybody that 's warm .
Then they become either barbers or Congressmen .
A lot of prison wardens have short hair .
Have you ever noticed that Abraham Lincoln 's hair was much longer than John Wilkes Booth's ?
PLAYBOY : Do you think Lincoln wore his hair long to keep his head warm ?
DYLAN : Actually , I think it was for medical reasons , which are none of my business .
But I guess if you figure it out , you realize that all of one 's hair surrounds and lays on the brain inside your head .
Mathematically speaking , the more of it you can get out of your head , the better .
People who want free minds sometimes overlook the fact that you have to have an uncluttered brain .
Obviously , if you get your hair on the outside of your head , your brain will be a little more freer .
But all this talk about long hair is just a trick .
It 's been thought up by men and women who look like cigars - the anti-happiness committee .
They 're all freeloaders and cops .
You can tell who they are :
They 're always carrying calendars , guns or scissors .
They 're all trying to get into your quicksand .
They think you 've got something .
I do n't know why Abe Lincoln had long hair .
PLAYBOY : Until your abandonment of " message " songs , you were considered not only a major voice in the student protest movement but a militant champion of the civil rights struggle .
According to friends , you seemed to feel a special bond of kinship with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , which you actively supported both as a performer and as a worker .
Why have you withdrawn from participation in all these causes ?
Have you lost interest in protest as well as in protest songs ?
DYLAN : As far as SNCC is concerned , I knew some of the people in it , but I only knew them as people , not as of any part of something that was bigger or better than themselves .
I did n't even know what civil rights was before I met some of them .
I mean , I knew there were Negroes , and I knew there were a lot of people who do n't like Negroes .
But I got to admit that if I did n't know some of the SNCC people , I would have gone on thinking that Martin Luther King was really nothing more than some underprivileged war hero .
I have n't lost any interest in protest since then .
I just did n't have any interest in protest to begin with - any more than I did in war heroes .
You can't lose what you 've never had .
Anyway , when you do n't like your situation , you either leave it or else you overthrow it .
You can't just stand around and whine about it .
People just get aware of your noise ; they really do n't get aware of you .
Even if they give you what you want , it 's only because you 're making too much noise .
First thing you know , you want something else , and then you want something else , and then you want something else , until finally it is n't a joke anymore , and whoever you 're protesting against finally gets all fed up and stomps on everybody .
Sure , you can go around trying to bring up people who are lesser than you , but then do n't forget , you 're messing around with gravity .
I do n't fight gravity .
I do believe in equality , but I also believe in distance .
PLAYBOY : Do you mean people keeping their racial distance ?
DYLAN : I believe in people keeping everything they 've got .
PLAYBOY : Some people might feel that you 're trying to cop out of fighting for the things you believe in .
DYLAN : Those would be people who think I have some sort of responsibility toward them .
They probably want me to help them make friends .
I do n't know .
They probably either want to set me in their house and have me come out every hour and tell them what time it is , or else they just want to stick me in between the mattress .
How could they possibly understand what I believe in ?
PLAYBOY : Well , what do you believe in ?
DYLAN : I already told you .
PLAYBOY : All right .
Many of your folksinging colleagues remain actively involved in the fight for civil rights , free speech and withdrawal from Vietnam .
Do you think they 're wrong ?
DYLAN : I do n't think they 're wrong , if that 's what they see themselves doing .
But do n't think that what you 've got out there is a bunch of little Buddhas all parading up and down .
People that use God as a weapon should be amputated upon .
You see it around here all the time : " Be good or God wo n't like you , and you 'll go to hell . "
Things like that .
People that march with slogans and things tend to take themselves a little too holy .
It would be a drag if they , too , started using God as a weapon .
PLAYBOY : Do you think it 's pointless to dedicate yourself to the cause of peace and racial equality ?
DYLAN : Not pointless to dedicate yourself to peace and racial equality , but rather , it 's pointless to dedicate yourself to the cause ; that 's really pointless .
That 's very unknowing .
To say " cause of peace " is just like saying " hunk of butter . "
I mean , how can you listen to anybody who wants you to believe he 's dedicated to the hunk and not to the butter ?
People who can't conceive of how others hurt , they 're trying to change the world .
They 're all afraid to admit that they do n't really know each other .
They 'll all probably be here long after we 've gone , and we 'll give birth to new ones .
But they themselves - I do n't think they 'll give birth to anything .
PLAYBOY : You sound a bit fatalistic .
DYLAN : I 'm not fatalistic .
Bank tellers are fatalistic ; clerks are fatalistic .
I 'm a farmer .
Who ever heard of a fatalistic farmer ?
I 'm not fatalistic .
I smoke a lot of cigarettes , but that does n't make me fatalistic .
PLAYBOY : You were quoted recently as saying that " songs ca n't save the world .
I 've gone through all that . "
We take it you do n't share Pete Seeger 's belief that songs can change people , that they can help build international understanding .
DYLAN : On the international understanding part , that 's OK .
But you have a translation problem there .
Anybody with this kind of a level of thinking has to also think about this translation thing .
But I do n't believe songs can change people anyway .
I 'm not Pinocchio .
I consider that an insult .
I 'm not part of that .
I do n't blame anybody for thinking that way .
But I just do n't donate any money to them .
I do n't consider them anything like unhip ; they 're more in the rubber - band category .
PLAYBOY : How do you feel about those who have risked imprisonment by burning their draft cards to signify their opposition to U. S. involvement in Vietnam , and by refusing - as your friend Joan Baez has done - to pay their income taxes as a protest against the Covernment 's expenditures on war and weaponry ?
Do you think they 're wasting their time ?
DYLAN : Burning draft cards is n't going to end any war .
It 's not even going to save any lives .
If someone can &el more honest with himself by burning his draft card , then that 's great ; but if he 's just going to feel more important because he does it , then that 's a drag .
I really do n't know too much about Joan Baez and her income - tax problems .
The only thing I can tell you about Joan Baez is that she 's not Belle Starr .
PLAYBOY : Writing about " beard - wearing draft - card burners and pacifist income - tax evaders , " one columnist called such protesters " no less outside society than the junkie , the homosexual or the mass murderer . "
What 's your reaction ?
DYLAN : I do n't believe in those terms .
They 're too hysterical .
They do n't describe anything .
Most people think that homosexual , gay , queer , queen , faggot are all the same words .
Everybody thinks that a junkie is a dope freak .
As far as I 'm concerned , I do n't consider myself outside of anything .
I just consider myself not around .
PLAYBOY : Joan Baez recently opened a school in northern California for training civil rights workers in the philosophy and techniques of nonviolence .
Are you in sympathy with that concept ?
DYLAN : If you mean do I agree with it or not , I really do n't see anything to be in agreement with .
If you mean has it got my approval , I guess it does , but my approval really is n't going to do it any good .
I do n't know about other people 's sympathy , but my sympathy runs to the lame and crippled and beautiful things .
I have a feeling of loss of power - something like a reincarnation feeling ; I do n't feel that for mechanical things like cars or schools .
I 'm sure it 's a nice school , but if you 're asking me would I go to it , I would have to say no .
PLAYBOY : As a college dropout in your freshman year , you seem to take a dim view of schooling in general , whatever the subject .
DYLAN : I really do n't think about it .
PLAYBOY : Well , have you ever had any regrets about not completing college ?
DYLAN : That would be ridiculous .
Colleges are like old - age homes ; except for the fact that more people die in colleges than in old - age homes , there 's really no difference .
People have one great blessing - obscurity - and not really too many people are thankful for it .
Everybody is always taught to be thankful for their food and clothes and things like that , but not to be thankful for their obscurity .
Schools do n't teach that ; they teach people to be rebels and lawyers .
I 'm not going to put down the teaching system ; that would be too silly .
It 's just that it really does n't have too much to teach .
Colleges are part of the American institution ; everybody respects them .
They 're very rich and influential , but they have nothing to do with survival .
Everybody knows that .
PLAYBOY : Would you advise young people to skip college , then ?
DYLAN : I would n't advise anybody to do anything .
I certainly would n't advise somebody not to go to college ; I just would n't pay his way through college .
PLAYBOY : Do n't you think the things one learns in college can help enrich one 's life ?
DYLAN : I do n't think anything like that is going to enrich my life , no - not my life , anyway .
Things are going to happen whether I know why they happen or not .
It just gets more complicated when you stick yourself into it .
You do n't find out why things move .
You let them move ; you watch them move ; you stop them from moving : you start them moving .
But you do n't sit around and try to figure out why there 's movement - unless , of course , you 're just an innocent moron , or some wise old Japanese man .
Out of all the people who just lay around and ask " Why ? " , how many do you figure really want to know ?
PLAYBOY : Can you suggest a better use for the four years that would otherwise be spent in college ?
DYLAN : Well , you could hang around in Italy ; you could go to Mexico ; you could become a dishwasher ; you could even go to Arkansas .
I do n't know ; there are thousands of things to do and places to go .
Everybody thinks that you have to bang your head against the wall , but it 's silly when you really think about it .
I mean , here you have fantastic scientists working on ways to prolong human living , and then you have other people who take it for granted that you have to beat your head against the wall in order to be happy .
You can't take everything you do n't like as a personal insult .
I guess you should go where your wants are bare , where you 're invisible and not needed .
PLAYBOY : Would you classify sex among your wants , wherever you go ?
DYLAN : Sex is a temporary thing ; sex is n't love .
You can get sex anywhere .
If you 're looking for someone to love you , now that 's different .
I guess you have to stay in college for that .
PLAYBOY : Since you did n't stay in college , does that mean you have n't found someone to love you ?
DYLAN : Let 's go on to the next question .
PLAYBOY : Do you have any difficulty relating to people - or vice versa ?
DYLAN : Well , sometimes I have the feeling that other people want my soul .
If I say to them , " I do n't have a soul , " they say , " I know that .
You do n't have to tell me that .
Not me .
How dumb do you think I am ?
I 'm your friend . "
What can I say except that I 'm sorry and I feel bad ?
I guess maybe feeling bad and paranoia are the same thing .
PLAYBOY : Paranoia is said to be one of the mental states sometimes induced by such hallucinogenic drugs as peyote and LSD .
Considering the risks involved , do you think that experimentation with such drugs should be part of the growing up experience for a young person ?
DYLAN : I would n't advise anybody to use drugs - certainly not the hard drugs ; drugs are medicine .
But opium and hash and pot - now , those things are n't drugs ; they just bend your mind a little .
I think everybody 's mind should be bent once in a while .
Not by LSD , though .
LSD is medicine - a different kind of medicine .
It makes you aware of the universe , so to speak ; you realize how foolish objects are .
But LSD is not for groovy people ; it 's for mad , hateful people who want revenge .
It 's for people who usually have heart attacks .
They ought to use it at the Geneva Convention .
PLAYBOY : Are you concerned , as you approach 30 , that you may begin to " go square , " lose some of your openness to experience , become leery of change and new experiment ?
DYLAN : No .
But if it happens , then it happens .
What can I say ?
There does n't seem to be any tomorrow .
Every time I wake up , no matter in what position , it 's always been today .
To look ahead and start worrying about trivial little things I can't really say has any more importance than looking back and remembering trivial little things .
I 'm not going to become any poetry instructor at any girls ' school ; I know that for sure .
But that 's about all I know for sure .
I 'll just keep doing these different things , I guess .
PLAYBOY : Such as ?
DYLAN : Waking up in different positions .
PLAYBOY : What else ?
DYLAN : I 'm just like anybody else ; I 'll try anything once .
PLAYBOY : Including theft and murder ?
DYLAN : I can't really say I would n't commit theft or murder and expect anybody to really believe me .
I would n't believe anybody if they told me that .
PLAYBOY : By their mid-20s , most people have begun to settle into their niche , to find a place in society .
But you 've managed to remain inner-directed and uncommitted .
What was it that spurred you to run away from home six times between the ages of ten and eighteen and finally to leave for good ?
DYLAN : It was nothing ; it was just an accident of geography .
Like if I was born and raised in New York or Kansas City , I 'm sure everything would have turned out different .
But Hibbing , Minnesota , was just not the right place for me to stay and live .
There really was nothing there .
The only thing you could do there was be a miner , and even that kind of thing was getting less and less .
The people that lived there - they 're nice people ; I 've been all over the world since I left there , and they still stand out as being the least hung - up .
The mines were just dying , that 's all ; but that 's not their fault .
Everybody about my age left there .
It was no great romantic thing .
It did n't take any great amount of thinking or individual genius , and there certainly was n't any pride in it .
I did n't run away from it ; I just turned my back on it .
It could n't give me anything .
It was very void - like .
So leaving was n't hard at all ; it would have been much harder to stay .
I did n't want to die there .
As I think about it now , though , it would n't be such a bad place to go back to and die in .
There 's no place I feel closer to now , or get the feeling that I 'm part of , except maybe New York ; but I 'm not a New Yorker .
I'm North Dakota - Minnesota - Midwestern .
I 'm that color .
I speak that way .
I 'm from someplace called Iron Range .
My brains and feeling have come from there .
I would n't amputate on a drowning man ; nobody from out there would .
PLAYBOY : Today , you 're on your way to becoming a millionaire .
Do you feel in any danger of being trapped by all this affluence - by the things it can buy ?
DYLAN : No , my world is very small .
Money can't really improve it any ; money can just keep it from being smothered .
PLAYBOY : Most big stars find it difficult to avoid getting involved , and sometimes entangled , in managing the business end of their careers .
As a man with three thriving careers - as a concert performer , recording star and songwriter - do you ever feel boxed in by such noncreative responsibilities ?
DYLAN : No , I 've got other people to do that for me .
They watch my money ; they guard it .
They keep their eyes on it at all times ; they 're supposed to be very smart when it comes to money .
They know just what to do with my money .
I pay them a lot of it .
I do n't really speak to them much , and they do n't really speak to me at all , so I guess everything is all right .
PLAYBOY : If fortune has n't trapped you , how about fame ?
Do you find that your celebrity makes it difficult to keep your private life intact ?
DYLAN : My private life has been dangerous from the beginning .
All this does is add a little atmosphere .
PLAYBOY : You used to enjoy wandering across the country - taking off on openend trips , roughing it from town to town , with no particular destination in mind .
But you seem to be doing much less of that these days .
Why ?
Is it because you 're too well known ?
DYLAN : It 's mainly because I have to be in Cincinnati Friday night , and the next night I got to be in Atlanta , and then the next night after that , I have to be in Buffalo .
Then I have to write some more songs for a record album .
PLAYBOY : Do you get the chance to ride your motorcycle much anymore ?
DYLAN : I 'm still very patriotic to the highway , but I do n't ride my motorcycle too much anymore , no .
PLAYBOY : How do you get your kicks these days , then ?
DYLAN : I hire people to look into my eyes , and then I have them kick me .
PLAYBOY : And that 's the way you get your kicks ?
DYLAN : No .
Then I forgive them ; that 's where my kicks come in .
PLAYBOY : You told an interviewer last year , " I 've done everything I ever wanted to . "
If that 's true , what do you have to look forward to ?
DYLAN : Salvation .
Just plain salvation .
PLAYBOY : Anything else ?
DYLAN : Praying .
I 'd also like to start a cookbook magazine .
And I 've always wanted to be a boxing referee .
I want to referee a heavyweight championship fight .
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine any fighter in his right mind recognizing me ?
PLAYBOY : If your popularity were to wane , would you welcome being anonymous again ?
DYLAN : You mean welcome it , like I 'd welcome some poor pilgrim coming in from the rain ?
No , I would n't welcome it ; I 'd accept it , though .
Someday , obviously , I 'm going to have to accept it .
PLAYBOY : Do you ever think about marrying , settling down , having a home , maybe living abroad ?
Are there any luxuries you 'd like to have , say , a yacht or a Rolls - Royce ?
DYLAN : No , I do n't think about those things .
If I felt like buying anything , I 'd buy it .
What you 're asking me about is the future , my future .
I 'm the last person in the world to ask about my future .
PLAYBOY : Are you saying you 're going to be passive and just let things happen to you ?
DYLAN : Well , that 's being very philosophical about it , but I guess it 's true .
PLAYBOY : You once planned to write a novel .
Do you still ?
DYLAN : I do n't think so .
All my writing goes into the songs now .
Other forms do n't interest me anymore .
PLAYBOY : Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions ?
DYLAN : Well , I guess I 've always wanted to be Anthony Quinn in " La Strada " .
Not always - only for about six years now ; it 's not one of those childhood - dream things .
Oh , and come to think of it , I guess I 've always wanted to be Brigitte Bardot , too ; but I do n't really want to think about that too much .
PLAYBOY : Did you ever have the standard boyhood dream of growing up to be President ?
DYLAN : No .
When I was a boy , Harry Truman was President ; who 'd want to be Harry Truman ?
PLAYBOY : Well , let 's suppose that you were the President .
What would you accomplish during your first thousand days ?
DYLAN : Well , just for laughs , so long as you insist , the first thing I 'd do is probably move the White House .
Instead of being in Texas , it'd be on the East Side in New York .
McGeorge Bundy would definitely have to change his name , and General McNamara would be forced to wear a coonskin cap and shades .
I would immediately rewrite " The Star - Spangled Banner , " and little school children , instead of memorizing " America the Beautiful , " would have to memorize " Desolation Row " [ one of Dylan 's latest songs ] .
And I would immediately call for a showdown with Mao Tse - tung ; I would fight him personally - and I 'd get somebody to film it .
PLAYBOY : One final question :
Even though you 've more or less retired from political and social protest , can you conceive of any circumstance that might persuade you to reinvolve yourself ?
DYLAN : No , not unless all the people in the world disappeared .
The Federal Government has been accused of ignoring international human rights conventions by deciding to deport a Sydney Muslim Shia cleric .
Iranian - born Sheikh Mansour Leghaei , who has lived in Australia for the past 16 years , will be deported within six weeks because ASIO made an adverse security finding against him in 1997 .
The United Nations advised the Government not to deport the sheikh because of claims he had been denied a fair hearing over the adverse security finding .
Dr Leghaei had asked Immigration Minister Chris Evans to use his ministerial power to allow him to stay in Australia .
Senator Evans said he carefully considered whether to stop the cleric being deported from Australia but declined to intervene in his case .
" The Department has spoken to him this morning and advised him that his wife and son have been granted visas on the basis of their long - term residence and their connection and integration in Australia , " Senator Evans said .
" But because of the adverse security assessment on Dr Leghaei he will not be granted a visa and I will not intervene on his behalf . "
Dr Leghaei 's supporters say he is a leader of inter - faith relations between Muslims and Christians .
He has been fighting to get permanent residency for 13 years .
But standing in his way is the ASIO security assessment , which says he is a threat to national security and is suspected of " acts of foreign interference " .
Under Australian law , ASIO is under no obligation to tell Dr Leghaei why it suspects him , so he has taken his case to the Immigration Review Tribunal , the Federal and High Courts .
The sheikh says he has never been told of the allegations contained in his ASIO file or been given the chance to respond to them .
" That is the mystery in this case , that you are thought to be a risk to national security , despite all the positive work that you have done here and despite all numerous letters of support , " he said .
" It 's not only local community , the wider community also knows me and respects all what I 've done . "
The sheikh 's barristers have written to the United Nations claiming the Government 's treatment of his case violates his human rights under international covenants that Australia has signed .
The co-director of Sydney University 's Centre for international law , Ben Saul , is one of the barristers representing the sheikh .
Associate Professor
Saul says the sheikh should be given a chance to answer the allegations against him .
" If there 's evidence , all the sheikh asks is that evidence be provided to him so that he can challenge it , " he said .
" How can a person get a fair trial ?
How can a person get a fair hearing unless they see at least some of the evidence against them ?
The sheikh 's seen nothing .
" He 's been denied an opportunity for a fair hearing in his national security deportation assessment .
" International human rights law requires that a person be given sufficient information or access to the evidence against them before they 're deported on national security grounds .
" And at no time has the sheikh been able to see any of the evidence against him . "
Today Associate Professor Saul produced copies of a letter the UN wrote to the Australian Government on April 21 asking it not to deport Dr Leghaei for at least a year , while it considered his case .
" If Australia proceeds to deport the sheikh it will be in direct contravention of its obligations under its international human rights treaties and in direct contravention of a specific order issued by the UN committee , " he said .
Carmakers agree to make electric cars noisier
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Automakers and advocates for the blind have agreed on a plan to address an unintended problem caused by electric and hybrid cars :
They endanger sight - impaired and distracted pedestrians because they make no noise when running on electric power .
The groups joined together to present Congress with a proposal for minimum noise levels that future electric cars would have to make .
Sometimes even sighted pedestrians can be unaware of the cars ' approach .
" As a person who walks my dog in Virginia , where there are no sidewalks , I 've been startled by hybrid cars , too , " said Gloria Bergquist , vice president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
A study done last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that hybrid cars tend to hit pedestrians more often than other cars in situations where the approaching car cannot be seen .
The AAM , along with the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , the American Council for the Blind and the National Federation for the Blind , presented Congress with suggested language that could become part of the Motor Safety Act of 2010 , a bill now moving through Congress that would create a host of new auto safety rules .
The proposed language would have NHTSA create a new safety standard for electrically powered cars involving some sort of minimum sound required when operating at low speeds .
At higher speeds , wind and tire noise are typically enough to make the car detectable .
The sound could n't be just anything .
For instance , vehicle owners would not be able to " customize " the sound of their car the same way they can download ringtones for cell phones .
That 's specifically prohibited in the proposed rule .
Instead , car manufacturers would provide an approved sound or set of sounds for a given make and model of car .
It would be up to NHTSA to set the minimum noise level a vehicle would have to make at givens speeds and to determine what sort of sounds would be allowed .
The sounds would need to communicate something about the car 's speed and acceleration , just as the sound of a rumbling gasoline engine does .
In the past , I have criticised science journalists for not providing enough background in their reports .
Both news stories and scientific papers obviously focus on new events and achievements , but they do so in the knowledge that new discoveries stand on giant shoulders .
For this reason , when I cover new papers for this blog , I try to describe some of the research that led up to it , a tactic that fits with the growing cries for more context in modern journalism .
And yet , it ’s perhaps churlish to expect this to be a routine part of science journalism when many scientists themselves do n’t take up the practice .
I bring this up in the light of a new paper , published today in Nature Neuroscience , about the controversial topic of acupuncture .
I was going to do this as a straight write - up but actually the omissions in the paper are probably just as interesting than the science within it .
The gist is this : Nanna Goldman from the University of Rochester Medical Center claims to have found a biological explanation for the pain - relieving effects of acupuncture .
She worked with mice that had inflamed paws , and managed to alleviate their pain by using a needle to pierce a traditional acupuncture point near the knee .
This painkilling effect only happened when she rotated the needles after insertion .
This effect depended on a chemical called adenosine , which typically surges in concentration after any stress or injury .
Adenosine works by docking at a protein called the adenosine A1 receptor , which has well established roles in suppressing pain and is found on neurons that transmit pain signals .
Indeed , other chemicals that stimulated this protein had the same pain - relieving effects as acupuncture .
Drugs that prevent the body from breaking down adenosine led to even more potent pain relief .
And mice that lacked the A1 receptor altogether experienced no pain relief from the needles .
Taken on its own merits , this is a nice piece of biochemistry .
But what does it really tell us about acupuncture ?
Does it actually validate this ancient method as a way of relieving pain ?
After reading the paper , you might walk away with that idea that we ’re one step closer to understanding how a treatment with real medical benefits really works .
It 's littered with statements like “ A1 receptor activation is both necessary and sufficient for the clinical benefits of acupuncture ” and “ medications that interfere with A1 recep­tors or adenosine metabolism may improve the clinical benefit of acupuncture ” .
In the study 's press release , lead scientist Maiken Nedergaard even says , " The new findings add to the scientific heft underlying acupuncture . "
But these results have to be considered in the light of those that came before it .
As mentioned above , new scientific discoveries stand on the shoulders of giants and in the case of acupuncture – one of the most well - researched of all “ alternative therapies ” – those shoulders are particularly large .
Many trials have demonstrated that acupuncture does have some pain - relieving effects - that is not in doubt .
And as Steven Novella notes , unlike things like homeopathy or reiki , with acupuncture “ something physical is actually happening ... so it is therefore not impossible that a physiological response is happening ” .
But the big questions are whether this effect is genuine of nothing more than a placebo .
To answer that , clinical trials have used sophisticated methods , including “ sham needles ” , where the needle ’s point retracts back into the shaft like the blade of a movie knife .
It never breaks the skin , but patients can’t tell the difference from a real , penetrating needle .
Last year , one such trial ( which was widely misreported ) found that acupuncture does help to relieve chronic back pain and outperformed “ usual care ” .
However , it did n’t matter whether the needles actually pierce the skin , because sham needles were just as effective .
Nor did it matter where the needles were placed , contrary to what acupuncturists would have us believe .
Other trials have foundsimilar results .
Going beyond individual studies and looking at all of the available evidence does n’t much change the verdict .
Last year , scientists from the Nordic Cochrane review centre did an analysis of the available evidence and after considering the 13 trials that met their stringent quality criteria , they concluded :
“ A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found , ^ which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly ^ distinguished from bias ...
Our findings question both the traditional foundation of acupuncture , ^ which is based on the existence of meridians and Qi sensations , ^ and the prevailing hypothesis that acupuncture has an important ^ effect on pain in general .
If this hypothesis is wrong , and ^ our results point to that , then acupuncture would seem to be ^ unlikely to have an effect on pain related only to certain conditions , ^ but further studies may examine this question . ”
Goldman does n’t really address any of these points .
The introduction to her paper focuses on acupuncture ’s popularity , mentioning endorsements by the WHO , the NIH and , strangely , the US Internal Revenue Service .
As to the bigger question about whether it is effective , there is no sign of the recent trials or reviews that I mentioned .
Instead , she briefly says that the pain - killing effects of acupuncture are “ well - documented ” and that “ Western medicine has treated acupuncture with considerable skepticism ” , citing only an editorial published in 1972 .
As I ’ve said , this is not an area that ’s lacking in earlier research to refer to or consider .
The discussion is a bit better in that it at least references one trial which showed that acupuncture has no advantage over placebo sham - needle treatments .
And if anything , the results seem entirely consistent with the idea of acupuncture as an elaborate placebo .
The tissue damage inflicted by the rotating needle triggers a local flood of adenosine .
If the needle is stuck in the right general area , the extra adenosine reaches the receptors on the pain - transmitting neurons and shuts down their activity .
There is no need to invoke ‘ qi ’ flowing through ‘ meridians ’ .
Indeed , all sorts of injuries and stresses will lead to a burst of adenosine .
And Goldman even says that sham needles , by stimulating but not breaking the skin , could still trigger a burst of adenosine , leading to the same pain - killing effects .
There has been so much previous work in this area that the question “ How does acupuncture work ? ” is better replaced by “ Why are acupuncture ’s effects largely indistinguishable from those of sham treatments ? ”
The new study suggests some answers but it seems unfortunate to me that Goldman did n’t include any sham - needle controls in her experiments .
Brian Berman , who has been involved in previous Cochrane reviews of acupuncture , agrees .
He described the study a “ very interesting ” but said that “ some sort of a placebo control is needed ” .
Edzard Ernst , former professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter , has written extensively about acupuncture also concurs .
He told me , “ It ’s an interesting study but it proves nothing .
We need independent replication , better controls and studies in humans . ”
This is the most frustrating part of what could have been a really fascinating study .
Without building on the massive amount of work that ’s already been done on acupuncture , it is hard to know what to make the new and admittedly interesting results .
I also wonder whether your average health journalist will know how this study fits into the bigger picture - whether it vindicates the use of acupuncture or whether it actually fits with a skeptical stance .
But I suspect we wo n’t have to wait long to find out .
PS : The paper notes that the authors have no competing financial interests that might have affected their work .
However , it is worth noting that one of the co-authors , Jurgen Schnermann , is married to one Josephine Briggs .
Briggs is the director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , an institute that has had its fair share of controversy in the past .
Update : Yeah , the mainstream media are n't really covering themselves in glory here .
See Stuff and Nonsense for a summary .
The Times probably has the best piece , in that it actually mentions previous trial data and has some great commentary from Edzard Ernst .

Wall Street as usual enjoys denying facts until they become so obvious to the common person on the street .
By then , it is too late to react .
For example , subprime was n’t a problem until it lit the fuse that set the global economy into a downward tailspin .
Analysts at Barclays Capital are now coming out giving full attention to shadow inventory in the markets .
Even though their report states that the pipeline for shadow inventory may be topping out , we have such a large number of distress properties in the pipeline that we wo n’t see any draw down of distress sales until 2012 .
And ultimately the sales end is what keeps prices lower because distress properties sell for less .
As we know from various reports over 7 million homes are currently 30 + days late or in a state of foreclosure .
The new data from Barclays looks at severe distress :
Source : Barclays Capital
2.4 million mortgages are 90 + days late .
Another 2.1 million are in the actual foreclosure process .
Yet banks only have 478,000 homes listed as REOs today .
In other words , we have a giant pipeline of distress properties that will be hitting the market , trickle or no trickle , for the next few years .
What this also tells us is that pressure on housing prices will be the status quo for years to come with an already pre-built supply of cheap properties .
Barclays Capital also put out their projections of actual distress sales for the next few years :
If you assume that we sell 4.5 to 5 million existing homes per year , this amounts to over 30 percent of all existing home sales for the next few years will be distress properties .
This is already in the bag .
So even though you might hear that the pipeline is getting smaller I would n’t exactly take this as a vote of confidence for the housing market .
I mean how much worse can it get ?
There are such a large number of homes in distress that it is simply clogging the inventory pipelines for years to come .
And part of this also jumps in directly with home building and housing starts :
Even today , after a supposed recovery housing starts are down by a record breaking 70 percent from their recent peak .
The last time we saw anything resembling this was back during the Great Depression when home building came to a screeching halt .
But if you look above at the multi- unit starts this has n’t even moved .
Why ?
Commercial real estate is the next major problem area for the markets .
With a saturated market , vacancies are still sky high so the need for more housing units is going to be muted for years to come .
The problem with the shadow inventory pipeline is that it also guarantees that construction will not lead us out of this recession as it has in the past .
Then again , never have we been so dependent on real estate and the financing from Wall Street to create a bubble of legendary proportions .
This massive build up with inventory guarantees pressure for years to come and home prices will stagnant or drop short of middle class incomes going up .
Even Barclays understand that the only way we get out of this is if shadow inventory is liquidated in an “ orderly fashion ” and job growth comes into the picture .
And we have n’t really seen much in that regard .
Home sales for the moment are highly dependent on low mortgage rates and demand that was pulled forward by tax credits .
Yet those programs are now coming to an end and the market will have to stand on its own two feet .
Banks have been buying time hoping that miraculously prices would once again recover and they would be able to offload inflated homes onto the market with minor losses .
Yet home prices have hit the wall even after obscene amounts of money to prop them up :
What can we gather from the above data and information with shadow inventory ?
Prices are likely to fall unless :
- Wages increase - Job growth comes back strongly ( with good paying jobs ) - We bring back easy money no - doc mortgages
Short of that , prices will continue to drop to reflect the actual amount Americans can pay .

AMD Phenom II X6 1090T review roundup
So AMD ’s new hexacore CPU range is official , it ’s cheap ( comparatively speaking ) , but is it any good ?
For that we turn to the bevy of launch - day reviews , and if you ’re the sort of person who sneaks a look at the last page of a book because they simply have to know the outcome , here it is : for the money , the Phenom II X6 1090T processor is threatening to give Intel ’s similarly priced chips something of a spanking .
More after the cut .
Understandably , the people who ’ll see the best return on the X6 will be those running apps that take advantage of the multiple cores : video editing pros , multimedia tinkerers and anything with threaded - processing support .
Still , not everyone should immediately plump for the X6 ; at least one reviewer suggests that gamers would generally get a better return if they spent the money on a Phenom II X4 chip instead and put the leftovers toward an SSD or new video cards .
Compared to the Intel Core i7-980X , it ’s understandably slower , but AMD ’s chip is also straightforward to overclock and – while less intelligent than Intel Turbo Boost – the new Turbo CORE auto - overclock system squeezes out a welcome 400 - 500MHz extra .
For more details than you can probably stomach , there are plenty of reviews linked below .
AMD are heavily pushing the value message with the new hexacores , promising that a full system based on the new CPU will come out cheaper than Intel ’s own hexacore Core i7 -980X on its own .
Some people believe that with Social Plug-ins and the “ Open Graph , ” Facebook is overreaching .
One of those people is now NY Senator Charles Schumer .
For quite some time I ’ve been saying and speculating that if “ the industry ” is n’t careful the regulators will spring into action .
Today Senator Schumer called on the FTC to create guidelines and regulate social networking privacy , motivated apparently by Facebook ’s Open Graph announcements last week .
Here ’s an excerpt from Schumer ’s letter :
Today , U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to provide guidelines for social networking sites , like Facebook , Myspace , and Twitter on how private information submitted by online users can be used and disseminated .
Schumer ’s call to the FTC comes on the heels of recent reports that Facebook has decided to provide user data to select third party websites and has begun sharing personal profile information that users previously had the ability to restrict access to .
These recent changes by Facebook fundamentally change the relationship between the user and the social networking site .
Previously , users had the ability to determine what information they chose to share and what information they wanted to keep private .
Recent policy changes are fundamentally changing that relationship and there is little guidance on what social networking sites can and cannot do and what disclosures are necessary to consumers .
Under new policies , users must go through a complicated and confusing opt - out process to keep private information from being shared with third party websites .
Additionally , Facebook has also created a new system whereby ‘ interests ’ listed by users on their personal profiles are automatically aggregated and shared as massive web pages .
Users used to have the ability to keep this information private if they chose .
These new common interest pages are a gold mine of marketing data that could use by used for spam and potentially scammers , intent on peddling their wares .
Schumer and his staff may or may not fully understand what Facebook is trying to do or the benefits the company asserts it ’s providing to users and publishers .
But this should be taken seriously and could be the beginning of a long - anticipated move into online privacy regulation by the feds .
The IAB ( and Facebook itself ) should head this off at the pass with voluntary moves and clearer disclosures .

Women are the female of the human species , with the biological role of bearing offspring ( pregnancy and childbirth ) .
In preparation for this role , women 's breasts begin to grow at puberty , forming the most obvious physical difference between women and men other than the reproductive organs .
Other differences include a layer of subcutaneous fat under the skin which hides the underlying musculature , and a wider pelvis to facilitate carrying the baby and allowing it to be born .
Women also have a greater proportion of fine vellus hair over certain areas of their skin ( such as their face and legs ) than the coarse terminal hair which appears on men .

Men have typically two times more upper body strength than women , and around 50 % more leg strength .
[ 1 ]
Women have slightly longer average lifespans than men , which results in women overtaking men in population by middle age despite a 1.05:1 boy to girl ratio at birth in the United States .
This rate varies among countries .

Women in history
Compared to men , fewer women have had impact on history as leaders in diverse fields , but large numbers of women have still had enormous impact .
Eleanor Roosevelt
Sarah Palin
Such examples include
Christianity and women 's rights
See also : Christianity and women 's rights and Atheism and women 's rights
Dr. Jeff Myers in his book Understanding the Culture : A Survey of Social Engagement wrote about Christianity and women 's rights :
“ Christianity has done more for women ’s rights than any other movement in history .
Christianity sprouted in the seedbed of the Roman Empire , whose soil was nourished with the blood of the innocent .
To say that Rome was distinctly anti-woman is an understatement .
Families typically kept all their healthy boys and their oldest healthy girl .
Other daughters were left to die as infants .
Surgical abortion was available , and women often died from it or were left maimed .
Surviving girls were typically married off at age twelve and were pressured into remarriage when widowed .
Christians opposed these practices .
They took in abandoned infants , condemned surgical abortion , allowed girls to remain unmarried until they were ready , and provided support for widows .
Welcomed by the church rather than shunned , women converted to Christianity at a far higher rate than men and rose to positions of leadership .
Unsurprisingly , this led to a surplus of Christian women who , in marrying pagan men , provided the early church “ with a steady flow of secondary converts , ” as Rodney Stark drily phrased it .
Also , because they accepted rather than rejected all children , Christians gained a distinct population advantage in producing the next generation .
Furthermore , Christianity ’s acceptance of women ’s dignity led to cultural innovations all over the world .
In India , for example , it was only when Parliament forced the British East India Company to allow Christian missionaries into India that the practice of suttee was questioned .
It took decades , but these missionaries , together with indigenous Christians like Krishna Mohan Bannerjee , eventually succeeded in having this gruesome practice banned .
In China , traditional culture held that tiny feet were a mark of status and beauty for women .
In many parts of China , the feet of little girls were bound tightly to prevent them from growing .
This broke the toes and bones in the arches of their feet , leaving many girls nearly crippled .
In the 1600s , the Manchu emperors ( who were not ethnically Chinese ) tried and failed to stop the practice .
In the late 1800s , however , Chinese Christian women , such as medical doctor Shi Meiyu , began agitating against this abuse of young girls and women and were eventually successful in making the practice illegal .
Meiyu also exerted a transformational influence on China through her work in medicine and public health and the help she provided to opium addicts .
Historically in most cultures , women were often denied educational opportunities .
Christian missionaries and indigenous Christian leaders changed that in country after country .
In Japan , Nitobe Inazō , a scholar with five doctoral degrees and an innovator in Japan ’s agricultural advancement , founded Tokyo Christian Women ’s University and became its first president .
Tsuda Umeko , a Japanese woman educated in the United States , became the private tutor of prime minister Ito Hirobumi ’s children .
She had such an influence on securing the right of women to education that Tsuda College , the most prestigious private women ’s college in Japan , is named in her honor . [ 3 ] ”
Women in the Bible
Contrary to what many Liberals , Atheists , and Feminists like to say , the Bible does not devalue women .
Genesis
The Bible says that women , like men , were created by God on the 6th day of Creation , as told in The Book of Genesis :
So God created man in his [ own ] image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
Genesis 1:27 ( KJV )
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
Mark 10:6 ( KJV )
Genesis further elaborates that God took a rib from Adam , the first man , and from it created Eve , the first woman , as a helper for Adam when the animals , which had been created for that purpose , proved unsuitable :
And the LORD God said , [ It is ] not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought [ them ] unto Adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that [ was ] the name thereof .
And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
And the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
Genesis 2:18 - 22 ( KJV )
According to some biblical literalists ,
Eve caused sin and suffering to come into the world when she convinced Adam to eat from The Tree of Knowledge , an act directly forbidden by God Himself .
As punishment for this , God declared that women shall experience great pain in childbirth . [ 4 ]
New Testament statements on the role of women
Saint Paul also has much to say on the status of women in society , most memorably that women should submit to their husbands just as the church submits to Christ . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Most of these things are not believed by even the strictest Christians , and such views are considered extreme by even the most conservative Christians .
The New Testament contains several instructions regarding the role of women :
Women are to dress modestly and not wear " broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array . " [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Women may learn in silence , but may not be permitted to teach men . [ 11 ]
Some interpretations limit this rule to the teaching of doctrine .
Women are not permitted to speak in church . [ 12 ]
Women are to be subservient to and follow the instructions of their husbands .
[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
Women " shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety . " [ 17 ]
These viewpoints are not widely accepted in secular , first - world nations , although some believers still adhere to them .
However , Christians do not always agree on how literal or universal these directives are intended to be .
For example , dressing modestly is interpreted by some Anabaptists to mean that women should only wear black or dull colors and that dresses should cover the entire arms and legs , whereas most non-Anabaptist Christians consider the directive to modesty as simply meaning that garments should not be wrongly provocative .
The directive that women should not speak in church is regarded by some as being literal for all situations , but due to other New Testament passages which indicate that women were allowed to publicly testify in the early church , [ 18 ] the most common Christian interpretation [ Citation Needed ] of 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 is that women in the Corinthian church were in the habit of conversing casually and gossiping during the church service , and that the apostle Paul was telling them not to do that .
However , that interpretation is at odds with the following Scripture passage :
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
1 Timothy 2:11 - 15 ( KJV )
Another interpretation sees the silence of women being limited to the immediate context of the passage , namely the authoritative judgment of prophecy .
Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
1 Corinthians 14:29 ( KJV )
Some Protestants
[ Who says ? ] believe these verses can be taken out of context and applied too legalistically .
They believe that the church can conform legitimately to modern egalitarian ideals without sacrificing the literal meaning of these passages .
Strong and important women in the Bible
Among the Bible 's several strong and empowered women are Deborah , the only female judge and ruler of Israel ; Judith ; and Queen Esther , heroine of the Book of Esther .
In the New Testemant , Mary Magdalene and other women are disciples of Christ with whom He seems to have close friendships .
The Virgin Mary is heavily revered in the Catholic and Orthodox churches .
Old Testament statements on women
The Old Testament law states that if a man sells his daughter into slavery there are specific conditions protecting her status . [ 19 ]
Atheism and women
[ 20 ]
Studies indicate that women in the Western World tend to be more religious than men .
See also : Atheism and women and Atheism and women 's rights
Surveys throughout the world and other data indicate that women are less inclined to be atheists . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
In 2016 , Atheist Alliance International ( AAI ) conducted an annually reoccurring atheist census project and found :
“ At the time of writing , the Atheist Census Project recorded that on average worldwide 73.2 % of respondents were male .
The result is consistent with other research ...
As such , the focus of many scholarly papers has been on seeking to explain this persistent observation . " [ 23 ] ”
In November 2010 , Discover Magazine published survey results published by the World Values Survey which showed significant differences between the percentage of men and women who are atheists for various countries with men outnumbering women in terms of adopting an atheist worldview . [ 24 ]

„ Grundsätzlich ist aber festzustellen , dass bei massiven ehrabschneidenden und rufschädigenden Falschbehauptungen immer in angemessener Weise reagiert werden muss . “
Jakob Schötz , stellvertretender Pressesprecher Bistum Regensburg
Dies ist eine Geschichte über das Schweigen .
Über das Schweigen der minderjährigen
Opfer eines katholischen Pfarrers , das die Kirche mit Geld erkauft haben soll ( was sie bestreitet ) .
Über das Schweigen ihrer Kritiker , das die Kirche gerichtlich erzwingen will .
Und , am Ende , über das Schweigen der Kirche , wenn man sie um eine Erklärung ihres Vorgehens bittet .
Es geht um einen pädophilen Pfarrer , der sich 1999 in der niederbayerischen Stadt Viechtach während des Osterfestes an zwei Kindern vergriffen hat .
Der Mann wurde später angezeigt und zu einer Bewährungsstrafe verurteilt .
Obwohl zu den Auflagen gehörte , sich von Jugendarbeit fernzuhalten , arbeitete er schon schon nach kurzer Zeit wieder mit Ministranten .
2004 wurde er in Riekenhofen zum Gemeindepfarrer ernannt — ohne dass das Bistum Regensburg den Verantwortlichen vor Ort von seiner Vorgeschichte erzählt hätte .
Der Pfarrer verging sich erneut an Kindern .
Vor zwei Jahren wurde er vom Landgericht Regensburg wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs eines minderjährigen Ministranten in 22 Fällen zu drei Jahren Haft und Unterbringung in einer Psychiatrie verurteilt .
Dem Bistum warf der Richter vor , den Täter „ in eine Versuchungssituation “ geführt zu haben .
Wie groß die Schuld des Bistums ist , ist umstritten .
So gibt es widersprüchliche Angaben , wie genau die Verantwortlichen über den Inhalt eines Gutachtens aus dem Jahr 2000 informiert waren , das dem Pfarrer „ eine homoerotische Kernpädophilie “ attestierte — und nicht nur ein „ einmalig regressives Verhalten “ , wie der Therapeut des Pfarrers behauptete .
Dem Regensburger Bischof Gerhard Ludwig Müller war es aber ein Anliegen , sich nicht persönlich bei den Opfern zu entschuldigen .
„ Für die Tat kann nur der Täter verantwortlich gemacht werden “ , sagte sein Sprecher Jakob Schötz .
Im „ Spiegel “ klagte 2007 die Mutter der Opfer von Viechtach die Kirchenoberen an : Es habe ein „ Verschweigen und Vertuschen von Anfang an “ gegeben ( das war , bevor Müller Bischof wurde ) .
Als sich die Eltern 1999 beim Generalvikar darüber beschwerten , dass sich der Pfarrer an ihren Söhnen vergriffen hatte , habe sie das Ordinariat in Regensburg überredet , keine Anzeige bei der Polizei zu erstatten .
Der „ Spiegel “ weiter :
Am 25 .
November 1999 dann wurde ein rechtlich höchst dubioses Abkommen zwischen Familie , Täter und Bischöflichem Ordinariat geschlossen .
In dem bislang der Öffentlichkeit unbekannten Vertrag heißt es : „ Im wohlverstandenen Interesse der Kinder und auf ausdrücklichen Wunsch der Eltern soll Stillschweigen gewahrt werden . “
Benedikt erhielt damals 4000 Mark , seine Schwester 1000 Mark , der Bruder 1500 Mark als „ Schmerzensgeld “ vom Pfarrer .
Die Mutter verlangte vom Bistum aber auch noch die schriftliche Zusicherung , dass der Fummel - Priester nicht wieder in der Jugendarbeit eingesetzt werde .
(…)
Doch der Justitiar des Bistums verweigerte die Zusicherung , dergleichen könne „ vom Bischöflichen Ordinariat nicht gutgeheißen werden “ , schrieb er an die Familie zurück .
Die Kirche könne nur versprechen , „ dass der künftige Einsatz des Herrn K. erst aufgrund einer sorgfältigen Entscheidung erfolgen wird “ .
Die von der Fummelei geschockte Familie wollte sich zumindest vorbehalten , den Priester später noch anzeigen zu dürfen .
Aber auch das bügelte das Ordinariat ab : „ Da der künftige seelsorgliche Einsatz von Herrn K. allein im Kompetenzbereich des Bischöflichen Ordinariates verbleiben soll , wobei bei Art und Zeitpunkt des Einsatzes die Vorfälle berücksichtigt werden , können wir es nicht akzeptieren , dass … eine Anzeige vorbehalten bleibt . “
Die Familie unterschrieb schließlich die Schweigevereinbarung .
( Monate später wurde der Priester dann doch angezeigt , von einer Bekannten des Vaters . )
Im Februar dieses Jahres griff der „ Spiegel “ den Fall noch einmal auf — als Teil seiner Titelgeschichte „ Die Scheinheiligen — Die katholische Kirche und der Sex “ .
Darin hieß es :
„ Es geht Ihnen nicht um die Opfer , sondern vor allem darum , dass nichts an die Öffentlichkeit kommt “ , warf zum Beispiel ein missbrauchter Jugendlicher dem Regensburger Bischof Gerhard Müller vor .
Ein Kaplan hatte ihm 1999 in den Schritt gegriffen .
Statt aber den Fall aufzuklären , vermittelte das bischöfliche Ordinariat der Familie eine Art Schmerzens - und Schweigegeld vom Täter .
Das Bistum Regensburg ging gegen den Artikel vor .
Vor dem Landgericht
Hamburg erwirkte es eine einstweilige Verfügung , die es dem „ Spiegel “ verbietet , mit dieser Berichterstattung den Eindruck zu erwecken , das Bistum „ habe durch die Vermittlung einer Geldzahlung bewirken wollen , dass der in Rede stehende Vorfall nicht an die Öffentlichkeit komme “ .
Der „ Spiegel “ hat den Artikel aus seinem Online - Archiv entfernt .
Man prüfe zur Zeit , ob man gegen die Verfügung Widerspruch einlege , sagte ein „ Spiegel “ - Sprecher .
Zuvor schon hatte Bischof Müller die Berichterstattung von „ Spiegel “ und anderen Medien als „ antikatholische Kampagnen “ abgetan und dem Magazin vorgeworfen , sich der „ Verletzung der Menschenwürde aller katholischen Priester und Ordensleute schuldig “ zu machen .
Diese und weitere Reaktionen der katholischen Kirche in Regensburg auf verschiedene Missbrauchsfälle im Bistum kritisierte das örtliche Online - Magazin regensburg - digital .de am 7 .
März 2010 in einem Eintrag .
Der Autor Stefan Aigner schrieb darin u.a.:
Und beim Vertuschen von Missbrauch zeigt man sich äußerst kreativ . (…)
Opfer eines pädophilen Pfarrers in Riekhofen erhielten Schweigegeld .
Das Bistum Regensburg hat das stets bestritten .
Es habe keinen kausalen Zusammenhang zwischen der Zahlung und dem vereinbarten Schweigen gegeben , behauptet das Bistum .
Das Bistum mahnte diese Formulierung ab .
Aigner gab daraufhin durch seinen Rechtsanwalt eine Unterlassungserklärung ab , wonach er vorerst die Formulierung „ Opfer eines pädophilen Pfarrers in Riekofen erhielten Schweigegeld “ nicht mehr verwenden werde .
Seinen
Text auf regensburg - digital .de änderte er wie folgt :
Ein Opfer des pädophilen Pfarrers von Riekofen erhielt eine Geldzahlung , welche nicht nur in den Augen unserer Redaktion den Beigeschmack einer Schweigegeldzahlung hat .
Das Bistum Regensburg hat das stets bestritten .
Es habe keinen kausalen Zusammenhang zwischen der Zahlung und dem vereinbarten Schweigen gegeben , behauptet das Bistum .
Das Bistum Regensburg fand auch diese Form inakzeptabel — obwohl sie die Meinungsäußerung klar als solche deklariert und auch wieder das Dementi des Bistums in der Sache referiert .
Anstatt auf den Brief von Aigners Anwalt zu antworten , gingen die Regensburger Kirchenleute erneut zum Hamburger Gericht und erwirkten dort auch gegen regensburg - digital .de eine einstweilige Verfügung , die sogar beide Formulierungen umfasst , die ursprüngliche und die geänderte .
Ich habe dem Bistum Regensburg einige Fragen zu dem Fall und dem Vorgehen gegen die Berichterstattung gestellt .
Ich habe die Kirchenleute gefragt :
ob die Darstellung der Vorgänge in Viechtach korrekt ist , wie sie der „ Spiegel “ 2007 in seinem Artikel „ Schweigen mit Geld erkauft “ schilderte — das Bistum hat diesen Artikel , in dem von einer „ Schweigevereinbarung “ die Rede ist , laut „ Spiegel “ bis heute nicht beanstandet .
ob es einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Stillschweigen und der Zahlung des Schmerzensgeldes gab .
ob sie gegen einen der anderen Artikel vorgegangen sind , die ähnlich wie der „ Spiegel “ über den Fall berichtet und einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Schmerzensgeld und dem Schweigen der Eltern der Opfer hergestellt haben , z.B. „ Bild “ ( 14.3.2008 ) , „ Welt “ ( 1.10.2007 ) , „ taz “ ( 24.9.2007 ) , „ Süddeutsche Zeitung “ ( 17.9.2007 ) .
ob das Bistum zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt versucht hat , mit den Verantwortlichen von regensburg - digital .de ins Gespräch zu kommen .
warum das Bistum nicht auf den Vorschlag reagiert hat , den Vorwurf der Zahlung von „ Schweigegeld “ deutlich als Meinungsäußerung zu kennzeichnen .
warum das Bistum versucht , diese Meinungsäußerung auf juristischem
Weg zu unterbinden .
Die Antwort von Bistums - Sprecher Jakob Schötz lautet :
Zu dem von Ihnen angefragten Vorgang nehmen wir keine Stellung .
Grundsätzlich ist aber festzustellen , dass bei massiven ehrabschneidenden und rufschädigenden Falschbehauptungen immer in angemessener Weise reagiert werden muss .
Der Rest ist Schweigen .
Stefan Aigner von regensburg - digital .de will sich nicht von der katholischen Kirche in Regensburg seine Meinungsäußerung verbieten lassen .
Damit er sich den teuren Widerspruch gegen die einstweilige Verfügung von dem für seine meinungsfreiheitsfeindlichen Urteile bekannten Hamburger Landgericht leisten kann , bittet er um Spenden .
Ich schließe mich dem gerne an .
The leader of Jaish - e - Muhammad , one of Pakistan ’s most feared militant groups , recently drew hundreds of worshipers to the Batha Mosque , where the theme of speeches and sermons often covers the same topic : holy war against the West .
Young men streamed into the beige building in north Karachi chanting “ God is great ! ” on the day Maulana Masood Azhar spoke .
Though Jaish - e - Muhammad has been banned in Pakistan since 2002 , local police officers joined mosque guards in cordoning off the garbage - strewn dirt lanes surrounding the mosque and providing security for the rally .
“ They had metal detectors checking people going in , ” said Ali Khan , 27 , who works at a barber shop about 50 yards from the mosque ’s white iron gate .
“ The people in this mosque , their main focus is jihad . ”
Jaish - e- Muhammad is being scrutinized by U.S. and Pakistani investigators for a possible connection to Faisal Shahzad , the 30 - year - old Pakistani - American accused of attempting to detonate a car bomb last week in New York City ’s Times Square .
Pakistani authorities arrested at least four suspected Jaish - e - Muhammad members in Karachi this week , including Mohammed Rehan , who in July allegedly drove Shahzad to the northwestern city of Peshawar , the gateway to the country ’s Taliban - filled tribal areas .
In light of the Shahzad case , the U.S. probably will push Pakistan to clamp down on groups such as Jaish - e - Muhammad that harbor bitter hatred for the United States and have begun to establish links with Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban .
Pakistan ’s record in enforcing its ban on militant groups has been poor , Pakistani analysts said .
In Karachi , banned militant groups routinely dispatch workers to mosques where they have strong followings to pass out jihad pamphlets and compact discs , said Raza Hassan , a Karachi - based crime reporter for Dawn , a Pakistani English - language newspaper .
“ Authorities have not come down hard on Jaish - e - Muhammad or any of these banned outfits , ” Hassan said .
“ They seem to lack a policy . ”
If there has been a policy , it has been one that publicly condemns certain militant groups while discreetly allowing them to function under the radar .
To facilitate their operations , some extremist organizations have created humanitarian front groups with different names that raise funds for building schools and healthcare clinics .
What ’s not known is how much of that money gets channeled to militant activities .
“ Usually when the government bans these militant groups , they suddenly start welfare work , ” said Yusuf Khan , a Karachi - based analyst .
“ During the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005 , Jaish - e - Muhammad began helping people and rebuilding .
That ’s their technique : to become philanthropic and get sympathy . ”
One reason groups such as Jaish - e - Muhammad are allowed to operate is because historically they have set their primary target as India , Pakistan ’s nuclear - armed rival , experts said .
Lashkar - e - Taiba , the militant group alleged to have engineered the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people , is banned in Pakistan but continues to operate under the banner of Jamaat - ud - Dawa , which runs hospitals and schools throughout the country .
Though the West regards Lashkar - e - Taiba as a terrorist organization , the group ’s founder , Hafiz Saeed , moves freely through Pakistan and periodically delivers sermons at a mosque in Lahore .
U.S. officials and others in the West worry that Jaish - e - Muhammad and Lashkar - e - Taiba may be operating training compounds in Pakistan ’s volatile tribal belt along the Afghan border .
Experts doubt that the Shahzad case will prod Pakistani authorities to crack down on those groups .
“ I ’m afraid it will be life as normal , ” said Yusuf Khan .
“ There is a lot of sympathy among many in law enforcement for these people .
You can not wipe this out . ”
It is widely believed that Pakistan ’s intelligence community helped form Jaish - e - Muhammad in the mid-1990s to battle Indian forces in the Indian - administered section of Kashmir .
Later , however , the group widened its mission , training thousands of recruits to fight U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Jaish - e- Muhammad is also linked to the 2002 kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl .
Jaish - e - Muhammad ’s leader , Azhar , lives in Bahawalpur , a southern Punjab city and the militant group ’s home base .
When he comes to Karachi , he usually heads to the North Nazimabad neighborhood , where he makes periodic appearances at the Batha Mosque , Ali Khan and other residents said .
Shopkeepers and neighbors near the mosque ’s 10 - foot perimeter wall said they tolerate a nervous co-existence with the mosque .
“ We ’re always fearful that something ’s going to happen there , ” says Shahzad Ali , a 35 - year - old grocery shop owner , “ and that in the process , we ’ll become victims . ”

Here 's a surprise : recording industry revenues actually grew in 13 major world markets in 2009 .
Australia , Mexico , South Korea , Sweden , the UK , and Brazil were all among the countries that saw revenue increases , and the global music business says this proves the need for tougher anti-piracy laws .
" South Korea and Sweden in particular saw striking returns to growth , " said global recording industry trade group IFPI , " showing how an improved legal environment can help impact on legitimate music sales . "
And it might be true !
The data , though , is ambiguous .
Sweden did get a new law in 2009 that gave rightsholders a court - mediated method for getting the names of accused infringers , and The Pirate Bay admins went on trial .
But both of those tactics have been usable in the US for years ( remember the Grokster case , and all those P2P lawsuits against individuals ? ) .
So why did the US account for the majority of the worldwide recording industry losses in 2009 even as Sweden 's record industry grew ?
It ca n't just be the " improved legal environment " in Sweden .
And how do you explain the case of Australia ?
This is the country where a federal judge recently issued a 200 + page opinion in which he ruled that ISPs have no responsibility even to act on warning letters from rightsholders , much less have any responsibility to disconnect users from the Internet .
Yet revenue is up .
Mexico is n't cracking down hard on P2P users , yet revenue is up .
The industry 's preferred legal solution continues to be graduated response ending in an Internet disconnection , but a quick look at IFPI 's data shows no compelling reason to adopt such a draconian punishment as the final step in the process .
In South Korea , the first country in the world to implement a " three strikes " law that disconnects repeat file - sharers , 30,000 infringement warnings were sent in the last year , but not a single South Korean has been disconnected .
Yet revenue is up .
Several ISPs in the UK were forwarding infringement letters to subscribers in 2009 , but none were disconnecting users .
Even the recently passed Digital Economy bill does n't allow for such disconnections for at least another year .
Yet revenue is up .
And IFPI does n't list France as a country where revenue is up ... despite the fact that France passed Europe 's toughest Internet disconnection law last year .
In fact , a recent French study found that total Internet piracy had actually increased in France since the law passed , though it migrated from P2P to HTTP streaming and one - click download sites .
So what 's been driving the growth ?
The legal environment may have some effect , but new business models are also making an impact .
Sweden , for instance , is the home of Spotify , a hugely popular European ad - supported music service .
Even IFPI attributes the growth to a combination of legal changes and " the launch of popular legitimate services . "
Seeing this sort of industry data appear year after year , we 're left with two thoughts .
First , innovation is crucial — make it easier to use Hulu and Spotify than it is to download P2P versions of TV shows and music , and many pirates will go legit .
Second , the industry has overreached on " three strikes , " and it 's not even necessary —
Internet disconnections have stirred up powerful waves of discontent , and there 's no clear correlation between such laws and industry revenue growth .
Settling for a solution that would garner widespread support , such as the forwarding of warning letters and possible connection throttling or an appropriate , small fine as a final step ( with judicial oversight ) , would have gone a long way toward removing the mask of anonymity from file - sharing .
Plenty of reasonable people would have supported such limited , targeted steps ; reaching for less would have achieved more .
Instead , the industry pushes Internet disconnections and ACTA .
And if it can't pass laws , it starts suing individual ISPs instead ( as the recording industry has done in Ireland and the film industry has done in Australia ) .
When more than 30 countries saw double - digit growth rates in digital music sales in 2009 ( and 17 of these were over 40 percent ! ) and 13 major markets saw overall revenue growth , it 's clear that the recording industry is n't about to shrivel up and disappear .
Still , worldwide , the market did contract by 7 percent , most of that due to the US and Japanese markets .
IFPI boss John Kennedy sees a return to growth for his business , but this depends on " how quickly governments can act to deal with piracy . "
Nana Attakora remains a work in progress .
It was a year ago this weekend when the Toronto FC defender made his first start of 2009 — and just the fourth of his career — logging 76 minutes in a wild 3 - 3 tie against DC United in Washington .
It was TFC ’s eighth game of the season .
That evening , joining Attakora on the back line were Marvell Wynne , Adrian Serioux and Marco Velez .
Regular defender Jim Brennan took a turn in the midfield .
Since that game , all of those other guys have moved on from the TFC lineup .
Meanwhile , Attakora has started all but four of the team ’s last 29 games , including each of the first six so far this season .
Aside from goalkeeper Stefan Frei , he ’s the only member of the Reds to play every minute in 2010 .
The guy who struggled to get playing time at the start of last season is now the team ’s workhorse .
“ It ’s a lot different than last year , ” the 21 - year - old Orangeville native said Tuesday with characteristic understatement as TFC ( 2 - 4 - 0 ) began preparations for Saturday ’s visit to BMO Field by the Chicago Fire ( 2 - 2 - 2 ) .
For Attakora , a member of TFC since its inaugural season of 2007 , it ’s been a pretty simple formula .
Increased playing time has meant increased confidence .
“ I feel a lot more confident and comfortable out there , ” said Attakora , who , despite appearing in only two - thirds of the games last season , was named TFC ’s player of the month twice and also was awarded the club ’s most improved player award for the year .
Attakora finished with two goals and four assists in 2009 , his first points in a TFC uniform .
So far this season , which began in tumult as a host of personnel changes carried over from the pre-season into the games that matter , Attakora has been the one constant , playing on a backline that has featured seven different players in the other three positions .
“ He ’s athletic .
He ’s good in the air , ” said head coach Preki Radosavljevic , who has employed the 6 - foot - 1 , 185 - pound Attakora as centre back most of the time .
But Preki , who has watched his side surrender 11 goals in four road games , all losses , knows that even though Attakora has been his best defender , he needs more from him .
“ I still expect him to be more confident on the ball , to find little holes and gaps when he has the ball on his feet and not to panic , ” Preki said .
“ These are the things that I try to encourage him every day to do . ”
Attakora said he ’s encouraged by the challenge from Preki to improve .
“ If he wants more of me , that means I have a lot more to offer , ” he said .
“ It ’s great to hear something like that . ”
Frei said it ’s clear Attakora wants to make himself better because he “ works extremely hard , day in , day out . ”
The goalkeeper wants to see his centre back be more vocal , though , taking charge in the middle .
“ If he realizes how good he is , he ’s going to become our leader in back , ” Frei said .
“ He ’s a big asset of this team . ”
Attakora , who was named Canada ’s under - 20 player of the year in both 2008 and 2009 , agrees that getting better on the ball is key .
He said it ’s a combination of calmness and thinking quicker , especially at the international level where the game moves at a much faster pace than Major League Soccer .
“ I do think I need to speed up my game , ” said Attakora , a veteran of more than two dozen international matches with Canadian youth sides who debuted with the senior national team in Jamaica in January .
Attakora says after all the changes at TFC , he ’s getting comfortable with his teammates , though he admits that it ’s been a particular challenge with Russian Maksim Usanov , who has limited use of English .
“ We ’re getting better at it as the days go on , ” said Attakora , noting that all the lineup changes in the midfield also present a challenge because it ’s important to learn where they like to receive the ball .
“ That ’s a key because that ’s where the play starts , ” he said .
“ If we do n’t get it to them , they ca n’t get it to the strikers . ”
Defender Nick Garcia returned to the training field Tuesday for the first time since he was dropped by a punch to the face by Montreal Impact striker Roberto Brown during last Wednesday ’s Canadian championship opener .
The TFC veteran , who had a few days off , said he is n’t sure if he was knocked out but he still does n’t have 100 per cent hearing in his left ear .
Brown , meanwhile , has been suspended indefinitely by the Impact for the incident , which happened in the 35th minute of a game TFC went on to win 2 - 0 at BMO Field .
. . .
Fellow defender Ty Harden , who in the same game sustained a nasty cut to his leg that required 22 stitches , is likely out three to six weeks , according to Preki .
Harden took a boot on the shin from Impact goalkeeper Matt Jordan on a scramble in front of the goal as Toronto scored to make it 1 - 0 .
The 12th - minute goal , which was originally given to Dwayne De Rosario , was awarded to Harden on Monday following a Canadian Soccer Association review .
The jar of Marmite appears in the left hand corner of the screen
The maker of Marmite is threatening legal action against the British National Party to stop it from using a jar of the spread in a party broadcast .
Unilever said it had not given the BNP permission to use its product and was looking into taking out an injunction .
The BNP 's online broadcast was removed from its website , but it can still be seen on video hosting website YouTube .
The party initially said the clip was a spoof , but then claimed it had not been responsible for adding the Marmite jar .
Mock election
In the broadcast , a jar of Marmite appears in the top left hand corner of the screen as BNP leader Nick Griffin addresses the camera .
In a statement , BNP leader Nick Griffin said the jar had " apparently " been inserted by " one of the people to whom we had given the broadcast to review " .
He added that it was not included in the official version of the broadcast .
Neither Marmite nor any other Unilever brand are aligned to any political party
Unilever However , Mr Griffin went on to say that the Marmite jar had been added in reaction to a recent advertising campaign for Marmite which he said mocked the BNP .
In the Marmite campaign two spoof political parties , the Love Party and the Hate Party , compete in a mock election .
The BNP claims the Hate Party was " clearly based " on itself .
" Quite simply , if you start a spoof , you should expect to get spoofed , " added Mr Griffin .
" Although we are not responsible for whoever it was who inserted the Marmite jars into the internet version of the broadcast , we do see the amusing side . "
Unilever said in a statement : " Neither Marmite nor any other Unilever brand are aligned to any political party .
" We are currently initiating injunction proceedings against the BNP to remove the Marmite jar from the online broadcast and prevent them from using it in future . "

Everything and More On David Lipsky ’s book - length David Foster Wallace interview , Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself .
Sam Anderson
" It 's like the Nixon tapes for DFW - heads . "
05/10/10 at 12:25
David Foster Wallace ’s interviews were always show - stoppers : erudite , casual , funny , passionate , and deeply self - aware like he was n't just answering the questions at hand but also interviewing himself , and his interviewer , and the entire genre of interviews .
Last month , David Lipsky published essentially the Platonic ideal of the form : the book - length Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself a sort of DFW version of a DFW interview .
The book is a little time capsule .
In 1996 , at the very end of his Infinite Jest book tour , Wallace agreed to give Lipsky total journalistic access for a Rolling Stone profile .
He was n’t thrilled about it ( this stuff is real bad for me ... I said yes to this , so that I could in good conscience say no to a couple of things that are just way more toxic ) , but as an interview subject he was as usual pretty much ideal : honest , patient , and fully engaged .
Lipsky shadowed him for five days .
He slept at his house , played with his dogs , observed his writing class , drove him through a blizzard , sat next to him on airplanes , joined him for Denny ’s meals , and participated in endless hotel - room junk - TV binges .
Meanwhile he recorded hours and hours of conversationtrivial , goofy , intense , occasionally slightly testy covering everything from the malaise of fin-de - siècle America to the seductive power of Alanis Morissette ( I just find her absolutely riveting  ) .
Lipsky never wrote the profile ( he got sent off instead , he says , to do a story about heroin addicts in Seattle ) , but he held on to the tapes .
After Wallace ’s suicide in 2008 , he unearthed and converted them , basically unmolested , into this book : a 300 - page channeling of DFW ’s famous voice at precisely the moment it was becoming that famous voice .
I found it totally fascinating .
We get to watch DFW ’s signature self - consciousness churning at a length and ferocity unprecedented outside of his actual published writing .
(  I do n’t mind appearing in Rolling Stone ,  he tells Lipsky at one point ,  but I do n’t want to appear in Rolling Stone as somebody who wants to be in Rolling Stone .  )
It ’s like the Nixon tapes for DFW - heads full of telling moments that would have been stripped from any reasonable magazine article .
One of the effects of Wallace ’s prose is to make you irrationally want to be his best friend , and Lipsky creates a reasonable simulacrum of that experience .
This also marks the official beginning of the book industry ’s processing of DFW as a departed figure .
( Other Wallace - related books are scheduled to come out in the next year or so , most notably D.T. Max ’s biography and Wallace ’s own posthumous final novel , The Pale King . )
As such , it raises all kinds of issues : Wallace 's literary legacy ; art versus self - help ; the culture of 1996 versus 2010 ; DFW the talker versus DFW the writer ; and on and on and on .
We 're going to spend the next week or so hashing all of this out , sharing our own DFW experiences , and pondering the writer 's obsession with Top 40 mid-nineties alternative music .
The Reading Room members are :
DT Max , author of the New Yorker piece  The Unfinished  and of an in - progress Wallace biography .
Jason Kottke , pioneering culture blogger and longtime DFW - head .
Laura Miller , Salon book critic .
Garth Risk Hallberg , author of the novella A Field Guide to the North American Family , frequent contributor to the litblog the Millions .
Sam Anderson , New York Magazine book critic .
Let 's start with D.T. Max .
Given that you ’re writing a more traditional biography , I 'm curious to hear what you thought of Lipsky ’s approach .
Do you think this genre the infinite transcript can get into the little crevices of DFW ’s life and personality in a way that more straightforward biography maybe can ’t ?
Were there any , for you , surprises here ?
And please , if you can , unravel for us the metaphysics of Wallace 's Alanis Morissette obsession .
Toby Elles from Lancaster displays a frying pan with an image of Jesus Christ on it , which he claims appeared after he fell asleep with a pan of bacon on the stove in March 2010 .
He said : " My housemates and I had a few beers earlier in the evening I thought I would snack before going to bed and as it was cooking I decided to take a rest on the couch .
When I woke up about an hour later the room was full of smoke .
It 's some kind of miracle .
If it was n't for the smoke of the bacon burning this onto the pan it could have been a very bad situation , perhaps someone 's looking over me . "

Everywhere else , countries recognise the need to exempt food from GST
by Gordon Campbell
Dead certainties are a rarity in politics , but it ’s a safe bet that GST will be raised to 15 % in the May Budget , to help fund the income tax cuts the government has in mind .
Rather than tax what people earn , more weight will be given to taxing what they spend – a shift that will leave more money in the pockets of the relatively well off , and place a heavier burden on workers on low incomes , and on beneficiaries .
That ’s because those on benefits and the working poor have less discretionary income , and spend a higher proportion of their income on basics , such as food .
For that reason , other developed countries exempt food from GST , VAT , or whatever name they give to their consumption tax .
Australia , for instance , has operated a food exemption for GST for nearly ten years .
Other countries though , have not adopted the NZ model – despite the esteem in which it is allegedly held .
Like our enthusiastic embrace of free trade and asset sales , the ‘ simplicity ’ of our GST system has many admirers but few , if any , imitators .
New Zealand does pride itself – correction , the bean counters at IRD and within corporate boardrooms pride themselves – on our refusal to exempt food , given the dreadful ‘ anomalies ” this would entail .
It should be pointed out that we also lack the sort of capital gains tax that other countries feel is essential , and our economy has suffered as a result .
When it comes to New Zealand not having a GST food exemption though , most of the people who suffer from the lack are tidily tucked away , in places like south Auckland .
A food exemption for GST has been mooted before .
Currently , Maori Party MP Rahui Katene has drafted a private member ’s bill to exempt “ healthy ” food from GST .
In February , this media report from Whangarei suggested that a wide level of public support exists for the proposal .
Revenue Minister Peter Dunne though , has said there will be no GST exceptions for special items in this year ’s Budget .
Why raise the issue again now ?
There are four good reasons for doing so .
One , because the GST hike is imminent .
Two , because there is a lot of talk about the desirability of pursuing a single Australasian market , and Australia operates their allegedly complex food exemption so smoothly and cost effectively that compliance is no longer a contentious issue over there .
Three , because in December , the Australian Tax Office unveiled a computerized model that makes GST food and beverage compliance extremely easy to manage , and four , because a major New Zealand research study released in March has proven that if supermarket customers were given a 12.5 % price discount , an almost dollar for dollar higher investment in healthy food will result , and will be still observable six months later .
Cutting GST on food in other words , would will result in lasting health benefits .
The question then is not why do it – but why not do something so easy , so readily manageable by business , so justifiable on grounds of social justice , and so likely to deliver practical health benefits to the community ?
1 . The political fallout from a food exemption are trifling , and transient .
In Australia , GST is levied at 10 % .
This means that if GST is raised to 15 % here in May , our GST rate will be 50 % higher than across the Tasman .
Keep that in mind when your hear politicians saying that we must , must , must lower our corporate tax rate to match the corporate tax rate that prevails in Australia .
Basic food for human consumption – as this Australian Tax Office table explains is adjudged in Australia to be GST free .
This includes food and beverages such as fruit and vegetables , meat , eggs , bread , cheese , soup , milk , tea , coffee , fruit and vegetable juices ( with 90 % minimum by volume of juice ) breakfast cereals , flour , infant formula , sugar - and some beverages and beverage ingredients , including the fats and oils marketed for culinary or for cooking purposes .
Conversely the food that is GST liable includes restaurant and takeaway food and the prepared foods that such outlets customarily offer : such as quiches , pizzas , sandwiches , food platters , hamburgers , hot dogs , confectionary , biscuits , popcorn , ice cream and luxury items such as caviar and fish roe .
The intent of the distinction , and its logic is clear : it aims to exempt the food and ingredients that people use to feed their families , and protect them what is essentially a socially regressive tax .
At the same time , the aim is also to tax the kind of food available from restaurants and takeaway outlets , and luxury items .
In Australia , the exemption enjoys consensus support , right across the political spectrum .
It came about because at the 1998 election a political impasse existed between the John Howard government advocating GST and a Labour opposition hostile to it , - so , the Democrats stepped in and negotiated a raft of exemptions , including food .
The fallout from doing this deal subsequently divided and destroyed the Democrats as a political third force in Australia .
The deal was done by then .
During the 2001 election , the Labour Party vainly tried to revive public opposition to GST .
During its election campaign that year , Labour tried to highlight the exemption given to uncooked chickens ( bound for preparation at home ) in contrast to the GST being levied on the cooked chickens being sold in the same supermarkets .
Big deal .
The public were highly unimpressed .
Labour lost the election , and this episode really marked the death knell in Australia of public opposition to GST
Today , the food exemption is not a factor on the political landscape across the Tasman at all .
For this article , I contacted the leading Australian tax expert Professor Michael Walpole of the University of New South Wales , a long time opponent of the GST food exemption – and asked him whether the exemption is still a feature of the political debate about tax in Australia .
Or are the equity arguments and compliance procedures now widely accepted ?
“ It does not seem to be a hot topic , ” Walpole replied .
” I think there is resignation on this .
Computers and systems are better – there is a simplified system [ within the relevant division of the legislation ] for really small businesses selling food , and non -food items …
The equity argument has probably become accepted by the wider community – although it is probably flawed , as research suggests the rich eat more food and more raw food than the poor . ”
Walpole ’s colleague .
Professor Cynthia Coleman at Sydney University concurs : We [ Michael Walpole and I ] both think that the food exemption is not really part of the political landscape any more . “
Professor John Quiggin ( pictured left ) , a leading Australian economist and commentator based at the University of Queensland , told me that compliance problems with the GST exemption are now considered negligible .
“ It could n’t be described as a major [ cost ] let alone a prohibitive burden .
As you say , with the general shift to computerisation , the [ compliance ] costs now would be small , particularly on the assumption that all grocery foods were exempted .
[ Conversely ] since they are mainly service items , restaurant meals and takeaway food should be included in the tax base . ”
Quiggin continues : “ There ’s a bit of irony here – the advocates of a ‘ broad - based ’ GST were so keen to limit exemptions that they pushed the ‘ fresh food ’ compromise which produced substantially greater compliance costs than an across - the - board exemption .
As an issue of political debate , the food exemption for GST is pretty well invisible .
The GST is settled , and no - one really wants to touch it , except at the edges .
It was excluded from the [ upcoming ] Henry Review of the tax system .
Even among tax economists , there ’s very little interest in re-opening this issue . ”
2. Health benefits will follow , from a food exemption Using tax to manipulate the market for certain products is a widely accepted practice .
The whole rationale for taxing tobacco at higher and higher levels is based on the premise that demand for socially harmful products can be managed by raising the price .
A GST food exemption is based on the same principles of price elasticity – that demand for healthy products can be fostered by lowering the tax , and thereby reducing the price .
Is the reason for doing so however , based on fairness and social justice – or is the motive to promote health , by using a price signal to steer the public away from takeaways , and towards healthier , home - cooked food ?
In the political debate about GST there is often an overlap between justice and health issues – and this makes a recent shopping study carried out by the Wellington School of Medicine highly relevant to the debate .
The research has been gaining international attention , but it has been little reported here , as yet .
The Medical School study of 1,100 shoppers split them into four groups for purposes of comparison : people who got a price discount of 12.5 % , people who got the same price discount plus nutritional education , people who received just the educational information , and finally , those who got neither .
Their shopping habits were then compared , over an extended period of time : not from what they said they bought , but from their actual dockets at Foodstuffs and Pak ’n ’ Save .
The purchases that were studied were limited to the 3,000 top selling items on the industry ’s Shop ’n
’
Go computerized product catalogue , and these were matched , for nutritional evaluation , against 1,000 items from the Heart Foundation ’s “ Pick the Tick ” roster of healthy foods , which are essentially defined by their tolerable levels of salt , sugar and fats .
“ Edam cheese gets in , ” survey head Professor Tony Blakely of the Medical School explained , “ but not mild or tasty , because of higher fat .
We were n’t looking for total avoidance , but looking for the healthier options .
Green milk got in , blue milk was out . ”
The main findings from the survey ?
People , Blakely explained , kept on buying almost the same amount of saturated fats , regardless of the price and regardless of the educational material they were given .
However , they used their 12.5 % price discount to buy a significantly higher amount of healthier foods , and were still doing so at the end of the survey .
Education alone made little or no impact .
“ We did n’t see an improvement for nutrition interventions .
And they were highly targeted .
We spent a huge amount of effort on them .
People would get pamphlets in the mail [ saying ]
‘ Look we notice you ’re drinking blue milk , have you ever though of drinking green milk , and the cost is the same …
It was very well done education , which had no effect . “
Did the survey offer any support for a food exemption for GST – given that it ca n’t be accidental that the researchers chose 12.5 % as their level of price discount ?
Blakely laughed .
“ We deliberately picked GST as the amount to take off , to get peoples attention and to directly test it .
We make no apologies about that … but we also felt it was what we thought would be the right amount , if we were looking at a price - driven change . ”
Therefore , Blakely continued , one of the policy implications of the study certainly does concern the removal of GST from food items .
“ But that comes with distinct advantages and disadvantages .
The advantages might include that heaps of other countries do it .
Just about every European country takes GST or value added tax off food .
Not – normally – healthy food , but food .
Because its about an economic imperative in protecting families from the cost of their essentials being too high . “
The disadvantage , in his view , was that “ every other bean counter in the world who is working with tax ” held up New Zealand as the great example of simplicity in its GST system , and people “ may not want to let go of that simplicity .
But that ’s a debate that should happen , and it should be based on the evidence . ”
With that in mind , what had his research found out about the health advantages of exempting food by an amount equivalent to GST ?
“ That you will see some health gains from it , ” Blakely replied .
“ Given that nutrition education did n’t work , and that it does n’t seem as if [ promoting ] individual responsibility is a high - return avenue to take , either .
It is the structure of how we provide the food – and in this case , price is an element of that structure – that is effective .
So , as a society we just ca n’t keep on saying that its all about nutritional education , and all about personal responsibility .
We live in a context , and one of them is price .
And if we are going to take the obesity epidemic seriously , we are going to have to intervene in those areas . ”
His study suggests that price is one intervention that works .
In policy terms , Blakely added , the evidence is that education may not significantly change the behaviour of individuals in their actual purchasing decisions .
Even so , he believes education can play a useful role within the wider public debate .
“ From the public health point of view [ the study ] shows that price matters , and changing the price contours will have a health gain .
And far as exacting change among individuals , price is more important than education I agree … but if we are going to intervene where there is market failure ( and this is one of them ) and you are going to introduce regulation , you need a population that agrees with that , and are happy to support the politics of it .
So you still need education .
But health education of individuals to change their patterns of consumption does n’t really go very far , if you do nothing else .
“ It all came down , he agrees , to the price elasticity demonstrated by the study .
Because the 12.5 % price reduction produced an average gain of 11 % in the purchase of healthy food ?
“ That ’s right .
So if you divide one by another , you ’re getting towards a , 85 price elasticity .
It was almost dollar for dollar . ”
Computerisation makes compliance easy .
Any introduction of a GST food exemption would create two potential sources of cost to business : namely , the one - off costs of the equipment to manage the exemption efficiently , and the ongoing costs of identifying and managing the distinctions between items that qualify , and those that do n’t .
As Professor Michael Walpole noted above , the Australian tax legislation has been streamlined to assist compliance by small firms .
In December , the Australian Taxation Office also released a computerised package called GS1 - Net , that simplifies for business the process of managing the food exemption – essentially , by ensuring that the food and beverage items qualifying for the deduction have been correctly assessed , well before they reach the retail level .
As the ATO website states : : “ The Tax Office assures manufacturers and other suppliers who rely on GS1 Net GST classifications for food and grocery products , that there will be no risk of penalties or of retrospective adjustments to their GST liability . ”
In the New Zealand environment , it would mean that the same onus of responsibility for clarity and certainty would rest with the IRD .
The GS1 Net package could be readily adapted for use here .
The model belongs jointly to GS1 Australia and GS1 New Zealand , the non-profit trade organizations that administer the global GS1 system of numbering , bar coding and electronic messaging for supermarket products within Australasia .
As Peter Stephens , CEO of GS1 New Zealand says , his organization actually owns a 15 % stake in the existing GS1 Net package in use in Australia .
Already , there is considerable convergence between Australian and New Zealand supermarket operators in placing their product information on the GS1 system , for ready access in both markets .
As Stephens stresses , the retail price is not part of the information disseminated by the GS1 system and accessed by scanning the barcode .
The retail price , which is the last link in the chain , is added by the retailer or the supermarket head office – but crucially , the data stream routed to and from the Australian Taxation Office ( or IRD here ) can re-assure all concerned what the correct exemptions for particular items should be .
In essence , it takes the initial decisions on exemptions upstream , lends them certainty , and makes them readily accessible .
Depending on how complex the exemption system here might be , simple additional apps could spit out the correct final price at point of sale .
Point being , Australia has shown just how simple the process of managing the food exemption can be – and the computerized system that would deliver certainty to business on how to manage it is already in existence , and the IRD could readily be plugged into the GS1 system that already governs product information flows within the New Zealand food and beverage marketplace .
( GS1 incidentally , may also contain the solution to New Zealand ’s vexed issue of country - of - origin and ingredient labeling .
Shortly , a simple phone app will enable consumers to use GS1 to scan – with their cellphones – the barcode , which will then be able to print out onto their screens far more product information about allergens and country - of - origin sources of mixed ingredients than could ever be fitted onto a label . )
Inevitably , some anomalies will arise however a food exemption is defined .
As Professor John Quiggin has pointed out , an exemption could be defined as ‘ grocery items ’– or all food could be zero rated , and tax levied only on the service component at restaurants , bars and takeaways .
The Australian experience however , demonstrates that an exemption ( anomalies and all ) can enjoy wide public support – and need not impose a prohibitive burden on business or the economy .
Nor need it have lasting political consequences for any government enacting it .
Dunne and Finance Minister Bill English should , in other words , be willing to reconsider their current hostility to exemptions .
There are pressing reasons for them to rethink the issue .
Otherwise , people on middle incomes and the poor are facing a double whammy in the May Budget .
GST is a socially regressive tax – as mentioned , it hits those on low incomes who have less discretionary income , far harder .
Given that the income tax cuts planned for the May Budget are themselves also highly regressive – on the evidence , a very small number of high earners will get most of the money up fort grabs – the case for a food exemption is doubly compelling .
As things stand , a few will win heavily – and with luck , some middle income New Zealanders may be only be no worse off , and others will be significantly worse off .
Income inequality will increase .
While we await the final details about what Bill English has in mind , the outlook is not encouraging .
A few weeks ago , the mainstream media published verbatim somer recent NZIER calculations about the combined impact of a GST hike to 15 % and income tax cuts – most of us , the NZIER considred , would be slightly better off .
However , even if fo the sake of argument one accepted their figures as gospel , the combined income tax changes / GST hike would leave those households with a median income of $ 65,000 a year only $ 10 ahead of where they were .
Those earning under $ 19,600 would see no gain at all .
Every household earning up to the average wage would get $ 5 or less from the exercise – which , in other words , would be less than the famous block of cheese once derided by the National party .
Those earning over $ 146,000 were estimated to be $ 90 a week better off .
However , these NZIER research figures were highly suspect – in that they calculated the impact of the GST hike at a flat rate , by assuming it would affect 80 % of income in each and every income band .
In all likelihood , this would under - represent the impact of a GST on the poor , and would over - estimate its impact on the wealthy .
The politics of how all this wiol play out have yet to be seen .
How can the Maori Party for instance , possibly rationalize the havoc that the regressive income tax cuts , and the regressive hike in GST will wreak on their constituents ?
The government to which they belong is ignoring one obvious safeguard , a food exemption on GST ?
As a consequence , the effects of the GST hike and its willful lack of a food exemption safeguard will fall most heavily on the families of the poor – and will thus promote further hardship among Maori and Pacific Island families who are disproportionately on low incomes .
In the media coverage of the May Budget , the focus will inevitably be on the detail that it contains – but right now , perhaps we should be talking about the road that is not being taken .

The machines are .
There are not so many things that connect people all around the world and one of such things is coffee .
What can be better than cup of hot coffee in …
What a season it has been for Inter Milan 's Argentine striker Diego Milito and what a pleasure it is to be proved hopelessly wrong about him .
Three years ago in the Copa America , Milito replaced the injured Hernan Crespo and was so ineffective that coach Alfio Basile decided he would rather play without a target - man centre - forward .
Milito returned to make a few appearances in World Cup qualification , but again made little impression .
Argentina manager Diego Maradona seemed to have given up on him when , chasing the game against Brazil last September , Milito was brought off the bench only to fluff a couple of chances in a 3 - 1 defeat .
He looked so ordinary for Argentina .
How , then , had he scored so many goals for Genoa ?
A year ago I had the chance to ask this very question to one of his former team - mates , Brazilian goalkeeper Rubinho .
Milito celebrates after scoring against Chievo during Inter Milan 's Serie A football match in Milan
Milito , he told me , was perhaps not quite in the class of Argentina 's other forwards and although he was good , he was greedy .
He was not good at combining with other strikers and to operate effectively he needed to have the play set up for him .
In the light of this analysis , we agreed that he would probably struggle at Inter Milan , but 30 goals later - big , decisive goals - it is clear that we were very wrong .
Or rather , I was .
To my mind , Rubinho 's point of view still holds .
Inter coach Jose Mourinho has set up his team in such a way that Milito , like Drogba at Chelsea , is king of the front line , with Samuel Eto'o withdrawn to a deeper role on the right .
As Rubinho saw it , given a tactical formation built around his strengths , Milito has thrived .
My mistake , based on what I had seen for Argentina , was that I thought he was too ordinary to deliver at the highest level , even given such favourable circumstances .
It is always nice to be proved wrong when someone exceeds your expectations - certainly much more so than when the opposite happens .
The value of Milito 's short running stride was perfectly illustrated by the second of his goals against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final .
He generated the pace to beat Daniel Van Buyten to the left , but was quickly able to get in position for a right - footed cross - shot .
Both that and the first goal , when he waited for his moment with impressive calm , bore the hallmark of a striker full of confidence .
And no wonder .
Not only has he won the Champions League , he is also going to the World Cup .
A few months ago it looked unlikely but , with all those goals for Inter , the striker has taken a giant leap on to the plane to South Africa .
He may also have given the Argentina squad something of a problem .
They now seem to have an excess of number nines .
Gonzalo Higuain is first choice , although he will be feeling the pressure from Milito and will be hoping to do well in Monday 's friendly at home to Canada .
And Maradona has persisted with his Martin Palermo fixation , including the lumbering 36 - year - old striker as a substitute to be brought on when his side are desperate for a goal .
Three centre forwards , plus Lionel Messi , Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero make a total of six strikers in his 23 and inevitably leaves the squad short of cover in other areas , like central midfield .
There are doubts that 35 - year - old Veron wil last the pace
Especially , there is a lack of cover for Juan Sebastian Veron , the man Maradona refers to as " my Xavi " .
Veron no longer has quite the dynamism of the Barcelona man , but his passing over distance is better - in midweek he set up a goal for Estudiantes in a Copa Libertadores quarter - final with as fine a diagonal ball as you could wish to see .
The old warhorse is in good form but he is 35 , and may struggle to last the pace .
Javier Pastore is inked in as Veron 's deputy and the elegant youngster is an outstanding prospect .
He has adapted surprisingly quickly to Italian football , and makes the point that after a year at Palermo the defensive side of his game and his tactical awareness are greatly improved .
He is at his best , though , higher up the pitch than the role filled by Veron .
Maradona has surely left himself short of options in terms of genuine all - round midfielders .
Many would argue that Esteban Cambiasso should be in the squad - on the basis of his club form rather than his displays for Argentina , because he was not missed by anyone when Maradona dropped him .
I would prefer Ever Banega of Valencia or Fernando Gago of Real Madrid but certainly one of three should be in .
Having three number nines , though , means that some other area is bound to be light .
It is worth it ?
Palermo is a gamble .
At his age can he really score goals at the highest level ?
And despite his club form , so is Milito .
Argentina 's system and personnel are different .
So far Milito has been unable to combine with Messi .
Can he suddenly learn to do so now ?
I have my doubts but , then again , I have been wrong before - and when it comes to Diego Milito , very wrong indeed .

Other questions on South American football to vickerycolumn@hotmail.com , and I will pick out a couple for next week .
A quick note of apology - I have got so much on at the moment that I do not have time to get back individually to all the questions , so I am very sorry if you have not had a reply .
But please keep sending them in - they all get read and considered , and they all help in formulating themes for future columns .
From last week 's postbag ;
Q ) I was leafing through my Panini - sticker book just now and Uruguay sort of popped out at me .
I 'd like to know what you make of their chances in South Africa .
They have a good , although sometimes slightly erratic , keeper in Muslera , quality full - backs in the Perreiras and the pure undiluted class of Suarez and Forlan in attack .
Not to mention Godin , Lugano , Fucile and other Caceres .
I am not saying they are my red - hot favourites right away but I was considering sticking a tenner on them , as an amusing outsider bet .
They seem like a strong team or is that only on paper ?
Thomas Liekens
A ) Hard to see them going all the way but they can certainly travel with a bit of confidence .
Forlan and Suarez , plus big Abreu off the bench - there is plenty of firepower .
In qualification , though , they did not find goals easy against the strong .
That is why the emergence of Nicolas Lodeiro is so important - the young , left - footed playmaker adds so much more subtlety to their game and allows Forlan to get further forward .
He joined Ajax at the start of the year and has not had much playing time - will inactivity have taken the edge of his game ?
It is a key question for Uruguay 's campaign .
Q ) I was interested in your opinion on Lucas Barrios , Argentine by birth but now holding a Paraguayan passport .
He has a very good scoring record in German football for this season and was the surprise inclusion in the provisional Paraguay World Cup squad .
Can you see him muscling out the front line who helped Paraguay to the top of the South American qualification or will he have to settle for a supporting role ?
If he does , I can see him propelling his adopted nation deep into the tournament .
Brent Horner
A ) He has a Paraguayan mother , so there is nothing fishy about his inclusion .
An interesting case .
He has always scored goals but it was only when he did it for a big club ( Colo Colo in Chile ) that people started to take notice .
I think that is because he looks ungainly , as if he was running in Wellington boots that are too big for him .
He will have a chance with Paraguay - remember that Salvador Cabanas , top scorer in qualification , is recovering after being shot in the head and will miss the World Cup .
With Santa Cruz , Haedo Valdez and Cardozo , Paraguay have strength in depth with their strikers , and Barrios will have to make a quick impression in the warm up friendlies , against the Republic of Ireland this Tuesday and then Ivory Coast and Greece .
As an outsider , he 'll have to do better than the others to get into the first team in South Africa , so his World Cup starts in Dublin .

A lion cub is born at Space Farms Zoo in Sussex
WANTAGE --
At the Sussex County zoo that was once home to the world 's largest bear , the latest attraction is a 25 - pound ball of feline fur named Siren .
The 10 - week - old African lion cub was recently born at Space Farms Zoo & Museum in Wantage , which opened today for the season .
Currently the size of a large housecat , the cub looks like a plush toy come - to - life , but her constant pacing , piercing glare and menacing growls reveal her true nature .
The family - owned zoo has had lions for nearly 40 years .
But because cub births only occur occasionally , the arrival of a new lion gives Space Farms something to crow about .
Siren is the zoo ’s fifth - generation of Atlas lions , also known as Barbary lions , which are extinct in the wild .
" We have n’t had a lion cub since 2002 , so that ’s why it ’s a special occasion , " said zoologist Lori Space Day .
" We do n’t breed them .
They do what they want to do .
Nature takes it course . "
The last cub born here was Siren ’s father , 8 - year - old Attila , who is the current king of the zoo — aside from zoo patriarch Fred Space , Lori ’s 81 - year - old father who still helps run the place .
Long lineage here is nothing new .
Lori is a third - generation family member at the zoo founded in 1927 as a general store and wild - animal shelter by her grandparents Ralph and Elizabeth Space .
The zoo became home to Goliath , the Guinness World Record largest bear in the world at 2,000 pounds and 12 feet tall , who lived there from 1967 to 1991 .
The zoo also holds life longevity records for bobcat ( 33 years ) , jaguar ( 21 years ) and puma ( 22 years ) .
The zoo had only North American animals until 1971 , when Fred Space took in an old circus lion as a temporary boarder .
But after the owner never bothered to come back for that cat , named Leo , it was permanently adopted and became the zoo ’s first exotic animal .
In 1974 , Leo sired a cub named Moses , who years later begat a cub dubbed Moses II .
In 1998 , Moses II fathered Solomon , and in 2002 Solomon ’s offspring , Attila , was born .
And now comes Siren .
Three pounds at birth , Siren was the size of a sneaker but now is more than 2 - feet long , with 3 - inch - wide paws and inch - long canine teeth .
A male cub sibling also was born but has been adopted out to another zoo , while their mother died from complications during the births .
Siren is fattening up on a bottle - fed formula of 42 percent protein and 25 - percent fat , and also noshes on venison .
Like the other big cats at the zoo , " She eats Sussex County ’s best ( deer ) roadkill , " Space Day said .
During a recent bottle - feeding , the cub occasionally nipped at Space Day ’s hand .
" They are cute , but you can see they are dangerous . "
Siren will be kept separate from father and grandmother until the fall , when she has grown to the size of a large dog and will join her forebearers in their pen .
Attila has a massive head , a lush black mane and paws the size of dinner plates .
His mother , a 20 - year - old lioness ( about 80 in human years ) named " 3 o’clock " for a marking on her face , share quarters next to a pair of equally magnificent tigers .
The cubs were a welcome surprise , noted the zoo ’s veterinarian , Ted Spinks of Animal Hospital of Sussex County .
" We did n’t expect it , " Spinks said .
" The lion is the top of the food chain , so when you get a lion born there , it ’s pretty cool . "

( CNN ) --
Tragedy struck at a Pennsylvania circus Friday after a startled elephant stomped its trainer to death , police said .
People at the Irem Shrine in Wilkes - Barre , which has been hosting the James Hamid Circus all week , rushed to help but not before the trainer sustained life - threatening injuries , said police Lt. Steven Oshefski .
It was unclear what spooked the elephant , but the pachyderm was calmed by those on the scene .
The victim is not being identified until next - of - kin have been notified , Oshefski said .
The incident was classified as a workplace accident and the investigation has been turned over to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
A balloon vendor at the circus told CNN affiliate WBRE that the death was shocking .
" In the 30 years I 've been doing my vending , I 've never heard an animal killing their trainer and all , " said Ed Conrad .
" So something must have happened . "
Oshefski said the elephant came into contact with electrical wires , but it was unclear what exactly startled the animal .
Animal rights activists decried the use of animals in circuses .
" It should come as no surprise that elephants and other animals sometimes snap and attack circus employees and members of the public , " said Robbyn Brooks of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) .
" PETA has obtained shocking photos and video of circus trainers as they beat elephants and subject them to violent training methods using barbaric devices such as bullhooks , " Brooks said .
Circus members observed a moment of silence for the elephant handler who died , WBRE reported .
The circus , however , made a decision almost immediately after the death that the performance would go on .

The demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of the larger task of determining which beliefs are epistemically warranted .
This entry clarifies the specific nature of pseudoscience in relation to other categories of non-scientific doctrines and practices , including science denial ( ism ) and resistance to the facts .
The major proposed demarcation criteria for pseudo - science are discussed and some of their weaknesses are pointed out .
In conclusion , it is emphasized that there is much more agreement on particular cases of demarcation than on the general criteria that such judgments should be based upon .
This is an indication that there is still much important philosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience .
Demarcations of science from pseudoscience can be made for both theoretical and practical reasons ( Mahner 2007 , 516 ) .
From a theoretical point of view , the demarcation issue is an illuminating perspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in the same way that the study of fallacies contributes to the study of informal logic and rational argumentation .
From a practical point of view , the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life .
Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas , we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look - alikes .
Due to the high status of science in present - day society , attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims , teachings , and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue pressing in many areas .
The demarcation issue is therefore important in practical applications such as the following :
Healthcare : Medical science develops and evaluates treatments according to evidence of their effectiveness .
Pseudoscientific activities in this area give rise to ineffective and sometimes dangerous interventions .
Healthcare providers , insurers , government authorities and – most importantly – patients need guidance on how to distinguish between medical science and medical pseudoscience .
Expert testimony :
It is essential for the rule of law that courts get the facts right .
The reliability of different types of evidence must be correctly determined , and expert testimony must be based on the best available knowledge .
Sometimes it is in the interest of litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science .
Therefore courts must be able to distinguish between science and pseudoscience .
Philosophers have often had prominent roles in the defence of science against pseudoscience in such contexts .
( Hansson 2011 )
Environmental policies :
In order to be on the safe side against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take preventive measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence of an environmental hazard .
This must be distinguished from taking measures against an alleged hazard for which there is no valid evidence at all .
Therefore , decision - makers in environmental policy must be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific claims .
Science education :
The promoters of some pseudosciences ( notably creationism ) try to introduce their teachings in school curricula .
Teachers and school authorities need to have clear criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable and disproved teachings .
Journalism :
When there is scientific uncertainty , or relevant disagreement in the scientific community , this should be covered and explained in media reports on the issues in question .
Equally importantly , differences of opinion between on the one hand legitimate scientific experts and on the other hand proponents of scientifically unsubstantiated claims should be described as what they are .
Public understanding of topics such as climate change and vaccination has been considerably hampered by organised campaigns that succeeded in making media portray standpoints that have been thoroughly disproved in science as legitimate scientific standpoints ( Boykoff and Boykoff 2004 ; Boykoff 2008 ) .
The media need tools and practices to distinguish between legitimate scientific controversies and attempts to peddle pseudoscientific claims as science .
Work on the demarcation problem seems to have waned after Laudan ’s ( 1983 ) much noted death certificate according to which there is no hope of finding a necessary and sufficient criterion of something as heterogeneous as scientific methodology .
In more recent years , the problem has been revitalized .
Philosophers attesting to its vitality maintain that the concept can be clarified by other means than necessary and sufficient criteria ( Pigliucci 2013 ; Mahner 2013 ) or that such a definition is indeed possible although it has to be supplemented with discipline - specific criteria in order to become fully operative .
( Hansson 2013 )
The oldest known use of the word “ pseudoscience ” dates from 1796 when the historian James Pettit Andrew referred to alchemy as a “ fantastical pseudo - science ” ( Oxford English Dictionary ) .
The word has been in frequent use since the 1880s ( Thurs and Numbers 2013 ) .
Throughout its history the word has had a clearly defamatory meaning ( Laudan 1983 , 119 ; Dolby 1987 , 204 ) .
It would be as strange for someone to proudly describe her own activities as pseudoscience as to boast that they are bad science .
Since the derogatory connotation is an essential characteristic of the word “ pseudoscience ” , an attempt to extricate a value - free definition of the term would not be meaningful .
An essentially value - laden term has to be defined in value - laden terms .
This is often difficult since the specification of the value component tends to be controversial .
This problem is not specific to pseudoscience but follows directly from a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous problem with the concept of science .
The common usage of the term “ science ” can be described as partly descriptive , partly normative .
When an activity is recognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it has a positive role in our strivings for knowledge .
On the other hand , the concept of science has been formed through a historical process , and many contingencies influence what we call and do not call science .
Against this background , in order not to be unduly complex a definition of science has to go in either of two directions .
It can focus on the descriptive contents , and specify how the term is actually used .
Alternatively , it can focus on the normative element , and clarify the more fundamental meaning of the term .
The latter approach has been the choice of most philosophers writing on the subject , and will be at focus here .
It involves , of necessity , some degree of idealization in relation to common usage of the term “ science ” .
The English word “ science ” is primarily used about the natural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to be similar to them .
Hence , political economy and sociology are counted as sciences , whereas studies of literature and history are usually not .
The corresponding German word , “ Wissenschaft ” , has a much broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties , including the humanities .
The German term has the advantage of more adequately delimiting of the type of systematic knowledge that is at stake in the conflict between science and pseudoscience .
The misrepresentations of history presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo - historians are very similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science promoted by creationists and homeopaths .
More importantly , the natural and social sciences and the humanities are all parts of the same human endeavour , namely systematic and critical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible understanding of the workings of nature , people , and human society .
The disciplines that form this community of knowledge disciplines are increasingly interdependent ( Hansson 2007 ) .
Since the second half of the 20th century , integrative disciplines such as astrophysics , evolutionary biology , biochemistry , ecology , quantum chemistry , the neurosciences , and game theory have developed at dramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously unconnected disciplines .
These increased interconnections have also linked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other , as can be seen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on advanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings .
The conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood with this extended sense of science .
On one side of the conflict we find the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural and social sciences and the humanities .
On the other side we find a wide variety of movements and doctrines , such as creationism , astrology , homeopathy , and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict with results and methods that are generally accepted in the community of knowledge disciplines .
Another way to express this is that the demarcation problem has a deeper concern than that of demarcating the selection of human activities that we have for various reasons chosen to call “ sciences ” .
The ultimate issue is “ how to determine which beliefs are epistemically warranted ” ( Fuller 1985 , 331 ) .
The phrases “ demarcation of science ” and “ demarcation of science from pseudoscience ” are often used interchangeably , and many authors seem to have regarded them as equal in meaning .
In their view the task of drawing the outer boundaries of science is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary between science and pseudoscience .
This picture is oversimplified .
All non-science is not pseudoscience , and science has non-trivial borders to other non-scientific phenomena , such as metaphysics , religion , and various types of non-scientific systematized knowledge .
( Mahner ( 2007 , 548 ) proposed the term “ parascience ” to cover non-scientific practices that are not pseudoscientific . )
Science also has the internal demarcation problem of distinguishing between good and bad science .
A comparison of the negated terms related to science can contribute to clarify the conceptual distinctions .
“ Unscientific ” is a narrower concept than “ non-scientific ” ( not scientific ) , since the former but not the latter term implies some form of contradiction or conflict with science .
“ Pseudoscientific ” is in its turn a narrower concept than “ unscientific ” .
The latter term differs from the former in covering inadvertent mismeasurements and miscalculations and other forms of bad science performed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing to produce good science .
Etymology provides us with an obvious starting - point for clarifying what characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely non- or un-scientific .
“ Pseudo - ” ( ψευδο - ) means false .
In accordance with this , the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) defines pseudoscience as follows :
“ A pretended or spurious science ; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have . ”
Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science .
The foremost modern classic on the subject ( Gardner 1957 ) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science .
According to Brian Baigrie ( 1988 , 438 ) , “ [ w ] hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones . ”
These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific , an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria ( Hansson 1996 ) :
(1 ) it is not scientific , and ( 2 ) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific .
The former of these two criteria is central to the concerns of the philosophy of science .
Its precise meaning has been the subject of important controversies among philosophers , to be discussed below in Section 4 .
The second criterion is philosophically less important , but it needs careful treatment not least since many discussions of pseudoscience ( in and out of philosophy ) have been confused due to insufficient attention to it .
An immediate problem with the definition based on ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is that it is too wide .
There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but are not commonly called pseudoscientific .
One of the clearest examples of this is fraud in science .
This is a practice that has a high degree of scientific pretence and yet does not comply with science , thus satisfying both criteria .
Nevertheless , fraud in otherwise legitimate branches of science is seldom if ever called “ pseudoscience ” .
The reason for this can be clarified with the following hypothetical examples ( Hansson 1996 ) .
Case 1 : A biochemist performs an experiment that she interprets as showing that a particular protein has an essential rôle in muscle contraction .
There is a consensus among her colleagues that the result is a mere artefact , due to experimental error .
Case 2 : A biochemist goes on performing one sloppy experiment after the other .
She consistently interprets them as showing that a particular protein has a rôle in muscle contraction not accepted by other scientists .
Case 3 : A biochemist performs various sloppy experiments in different areas .
One is the experiment referred to in case 1 .
Much of her work is of the same quality .
She does not propagate any particular unorthodox theory .
According to common usage , 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad science , and only 2 as a case of pseudoscience .
What is present in case 2 , but absent in the other two , is a deviant doctrine .
Isolated breaches of the requirements of science are not commonly regarded as pseudoscientific .
Pseudoscience , as it is commonly conceived , involves a sustained effort to promote standpoints different from those that have scientific legitimacy at the time .
This explains why fraud in science is not usually regarded as pseudoscientific .
Such practices are not in general associated with a deviant or unorthodox doctrine .
To the contrary , the fraudulent scientist is usually anxious that her results be in conformity with the predictions of established scientific theories .
Deviations from these would lead to a much higher risk of disclosure .
The term “ science ” has both an individuated and an unindividuated sense .
In the individuated sense , biochemistry and astronomy are different sciences , one of which includes studies of muscle contraction and the other studies of supernovae .
The Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) defines this sense of science as “ a particular branch of knowledge or study ; a recognized department of learning ” .
In the unindividuated sense , the study of muscle proteins and that of supernovae are parts of “ one and the same ” science .
In the words of the OED , unindividuated science is “ the kind of knowledge or intellectual activity of which the various ‘ sciences ‘ are examples ” .
Pseudoscience is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather than the unindividuated sense .
There is no unified corpus of pseudoscience corresponding to the corpus of science .
For a phenomenon to be pseudoscientific , it must belong to one or the other of the particular pseudosciences .
In order to accommodate this feature , the above definition can be modified by replacing ( 2 ) by the following ( Hansson 1996 ) :
( 2′ ) it is part of a non-scientific doctrine whose major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific .
Most philosophers of science , and most scientists , prefer to regard science as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular doctrines .
There is an obvious tension between ( 2′ ) and this conventional view of science .
This , however , may be as it should since pseudoscience often involves a representation of science as a closed and finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open - ended inquiry .
Sometimes the term “ pseudoscience ” is used in a wider sense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ′ ) .
Contrary to ( 2′ ) , doctrines that conflict with science are sometimes called “ pseudoscientific ” in spite of not being advanced as scientific .
Hence , Grove ( 1985 , 219 ) included among the pseudoscientific doctrines those that “ purport to offer alternative accounts to those of science or claim to explain what science cannot explain . ”
Similarly , Lugg ( 1987 , 227–228 ) maintained that “ the clairvoyant ’s predictions are pseudoscientific whether or not they are correct ” , despite the fact that most clairvoyants do not profess to be practitioners of science .
In this sense , pseudoscience is assumed to include not only doctrines contrary to science proclaimed to be scientific but doctrines contrary to science tout court , whether or not they are put forward in the name of science .
To cover this wider sense of pseudoscience , ( 2′ ) can be modified as follows ( Hansson 1996 , 2013 ) :
( 2 ″ ) it is part of a doctrine whose major proponents try to create the impression that it represents the most reliable knowledge on its subject matter .
Common usage seems to vacillate between the definitions ( 1 ) + ( 2′ ) and ( 1 ) + ( 2 ″ ) ; and this in an interesting way :
In their comments on the meaning of the term , critics of pseudoscience tend to endorse a definition close to ( 1 ) + ( 2′ ) , but their actual usage is often closer to ( 1 ) + ( 2 ″ ) .
The following examples serve to illustrate the difference between the two definitions and also to clarify why clause ( 1 ) is needed :
A creationist book gives a correct account of the structure of DNA .
An otherwise reliable chemistry book gives an incorrect account of the structure of DNA .
A creationist book denies that the human species shares common ancestors with other primates .
A preacher who denies that science can be trusted also denies that the human species shares common ancestors with other primates .
( a ) does not satisfy ( 1 ) , and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either account .
( b ) satisfies ( 1 ) but neither ( 2′ ) nor ( 2 ″ ) and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either account .
( c ) satisfies all three criteria , ( 1 ) , ( 2′ ) , and ( 2 ″ ) , and is therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts .
Finally , ( d ) satisfies ( 1 ) and ( 2 ″ ) and is therefore pseudoscientific according to ( 1 ) + ( 2 ″ ) but not according to ( 1 ) + ( 2′ ) .
As the last two examples illustrate , pseudoscience and anti-science are sometimes difficult to distinguish .
Promoters of some pseudosciences ( notably homeopathy ) tend to be ambiguous between opposition to science and claims that they themselves represent the best science .
Various proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in science or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to .
Proposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research program ( Lakatos 1974a , 248–249 ) , an epistemic field or cognitive discipline , i.e. a group of people with common knowledge aims , and their practices ( Bunge 1982 , 2001 ; Mahner 2007 ) , a theory ( Popper 1962 , 1974 ) , a practice ( Lugg 1992 ; Morris 1987 ) , a scientific problem or question ( Siitonen 1984 ) , and a particular inquiry ( Kuhn 1974 ; Mayo 1996 ) .
It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria can be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description .
A much more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the fundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are reducible .
Derksen ( 1993 ) differs from most other writers on the subject in placing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist , i.e. the individual person conducting pseudoscience .
His major argument for this is that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions , and such pretensions are associated with a person , not a theory , practice or entire field .
However , as was noted by Settle ( 1971 ) , it is the rationality and critical attitude built into institutions , rather than the personal intellectual traits of individuals , that distinguishes science from non-scientific practices such as magic .
The individual practitioner of magic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily less rational than the individual scientist in modern Western society .
What she lacks is an intellectual environment of collective rationality and mutual criticism .
“ It is almost a fallacy of division to insist on each individual scientist being critically - minded ” ( Settle 1971 , 174 ) .
Some authors have maintained that the demarcation between science and pseudoscience must be timeless .
If this were true , then it would be contradictory to label something as pseudoscience at one but not another point in time .
Hence , after showing that creationism is in some respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th century , one author maintained that “ if such an activity was describable as science then , there is a cause for describing it as science now ” ( Dolby 1987 , 207 ) .
This argument is based on a fundamental misconception of science .
It is an essential feature of science that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical testing , intellectual criticism , and the exploration of new terrain .
A standpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately to this process of improvement , which means as a minimum that well - founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are accepted .
The demarcation of science cannot be timeless , for the simple reason that science itself is not timeless .
Nevertheless , the mutability of science is one of the factors that renders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult .
Derkson ( 1993 , 19 ) rightly pointed out three major reasons why demarcation is sometimes difficult : science changes over time , science is heterogenous , and established science itself is not free of the defects characteristic of pseudoscience .
Attempts to define what we today call science have a long history , and the roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been traced back to Aristotle ’s Posterior Analytics ( Laudan 1983 ) .
However it was not until the 20th century that influential definitions of science have contrasted it against pseudoscience .
Around 1930 , the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed various verificationist approaches to science .
The basic idea was that a scientific statement could be distinguished from a metaphysical statement by being at least in principle possible to verify .
This standpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a proposition is its method of verification ( see the section on Verificationism in the entry on the Vienna Circle ) .
This proposal has often been included in accounts of the demarcation between science and pseudoscience .
However , this is not historically quite accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem , namely that between science and metaphysics .
Karl Popper described the demarcation problem as the “ key to most of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science ” ( Popper 1962 , 42 ) .
He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a scientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific , rather than pseudoscientific or metaphysical .
Instead he proposed as a criterion that the theory be falsifiable , or more precisely that “ statements or systems of statements , in order to be ranked as scientific , must be capable of conflicting with possible , or conceivable observations ” ( Popper 1962 , 39 ) .
Popper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between statements belonging to the empirical sciences and “ all other statements – whether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical character , or simply pseudoscientific ” ( Popper 1962 , 39 ; cf. Popper 1974 , 981 ) .
This was both an alternative to the logical positivists ’ verification criteria and a criterion for distinguishing between science and pseudoscience .
Although Popper did not emphasize the distinction , these are of course two different issues ( Bartley 1968 ) .
Popper conceded that metaphysical statements may be “ far from meaningless ” ( 1974 , 978–979 ) but showed no such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements .
Popper ’s demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science ( Hansson 2006 ) and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific ( Agassi 1991 ; Mahner 2007 , 518–519 ) .
Strictly speaking , his criterion excludes the possibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is refutable .
According to Larry Laudan ( 1983 , 121 ) , it “ has the untoward consequence of countenancing as ‘ scientific ’ every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions ” .
Astrology , rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience , has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted ( Culver and Ianna 1988 ; Carlson 1985 ) .
Similarly , the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis , another of his major targets , do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests .
Defenders of Popper have claimed that this criticism relies on an uncharitable interpretation of his ideas .
They claim that he should not be interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient condition for demarcating science .
Some passages seem to suggest that he takes it as only a necessary condition ( Feleppa 1990 , 142 ) .
Other passages suggest that for a theory to be scientific , Popper requires ( in addition to falsifiability ) that energetic attempts are made to put the theory to test and that negative outcomes of the tests are accepted ( Cioffi 1985 , 14 – 16 ) .
A falsification - based demarcation criterion that includes these elements will avoid the most obvious counter - arguments to a criterion based on falsifiability alone .
However , in what seems to be his last statement of his position , Popper declared that falsifiability is a both necessary and a sufficient criterion .
“ A sentence ( or a theory ) is empirical - scientific if and only if it is falsifiable . ”
Furthermore , he emphasized that the falsifiability referred to here “ only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences ” ( Popper [ 1989 ] 1994 , 82 ) .
A ( theoretical ) sentence , he says , is falsifiable if and only if it logically contradicts some ( empirical ) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe ( Popper [ 1989 ] 1994 , 83 ) .
A statement can be falsifiable in this sense although it is not in practice possible to falsify it .
It would seem to follow from this interpretation that a statement ’s status as scientific or non-scientific does not shift with time .
On previous occasions he seems to have interpreted falsifiability differently , and maintained that “ what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can become a testable scientific theory tomorrow ; and this happens frequently ” ( Popper 1974 , 981 , cf. 984 ) .
Logical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical falsifiability .
However , even logical falsifiability can create problems in practical demarcations .
Popper once adopted the view that natural selection is not a proper scientific theory , arguing that it comes close to only saying that “ survivors survive ” , which is tautological .
“ Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research program ” ( Popper 1976 , 168 ) .
This statement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed out that it misrepresents evolution .
The theory of natural selection has given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in field studies and in laboratory settings ( Ruse 1977 ; 2000 ) .
In a lecture in Darwin College in 1977 , Popper retracted his previous view that the theory of natural selection is tautological .
He now admitted that it is a testable theory although “ difficult to test ” ( Popper 1978 , 344 ) .
However , in spite of his well - argued recantation his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in defiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural selection .
Thomas Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper ’s view on the demarcation problem was a starting - point for developing their own ideas .
Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing “ the entire scientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional revolutionary parts ” ( Kuhn 1974 , 802 ) .
Popper ’s focus on falsifications of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare instances when a whole theory is at stake .
According to Kuhn , the way in which science works on such occasions cannot be used to characterize the entire scientific enterprise .
Instead it is in “ normal science ” , the science that takes place between the unusual moments of scientific revolutions , that we find the characteristics by which science can be distinguished from other activities ( Kuhn 1974 , 801 ) .
In normal science , the scientist ’s activity consists in solving puzzles rather than testing fundamental theories .
In puzzle - solving , current theory is accepted , and the puzzle is indeed defined in its terms .
In Kuhn ’s view , “ it is normal science , in which Sir Karl ’s sort of testing does not occur , rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises ” , and therefore a demarcation criterion must refer to the workings of normal science ( Kuhn 1974 , 802 ) .
Kuhn ’s own demarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle - solving that he sees as an essential characteristic of normal science .
Kuhn ’s view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology .
Since antiquity , astronomy has been a puzzle - solving activity and therefore a science .
If an astronomer ’s prediction failed , then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory .
In contrast , the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline “ particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles , for no man , however skilled , could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition ” ( Kuhn 1974 , 804 ) .
Therefore , according to Kuhn , astrology has never been a science .
Popper disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn ’s demarcation criterion .
According to Popper , astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving , and consequently Kuhn ’s criterion commits him to recognize astrology as a science .
( Contrary to Kuhn , Popper defined puzzles as “ minor problems which do not affect the routine ” . )
In his view Kuhn ’s proposal leads to “ the major disaster ” of a “ replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one ” ( Popper 1974 , 1146 –1147 ) .
Popper ’s demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure of theories .
Imre Lakatos described this criterion as “ a rather stunning one .
A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred of evidence in its favour , and it may be pseudoscientific even if all the available evidence is in its favour .
That is , the scientific or non-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently of the facts ” ( Lakatos 1981 , 117 ) .
Instead , Lakatos ( 1970 ; 1974a ; 1974b ; 1981 ) proposed a modification of Popper ’s criterion that he called “ sophisticated ( methodological ) falsificationism ” .
On this view , the demarcation criterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis or theory but rather to a whole research program that is characterized by a series of theories successively replacing each other .
In his view , a research program is progressive if the new theories make surprising predictions that are confirmed .
In contrast , a degenerating research programme is characterized by theories being fabricated only in order to accommodate known facts .
Progress in science is only possible if a research program satisfies the minimum requirement that each new theory that is developed in the program has a larger empirical content than its predecessor .
If a research program does not satisfy this requirement , then it is pseudoscientific .
According to Paul Thagard , a theory or discipline is pseudoscientific if it satisfies two criteria .
One of these is that the theory fails to progress , and the other that “ the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems , shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others , and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations ” ( Thagard 1978 , 228 ) .
A major difference between his approach and that of Lakatos is that Lakatos would classify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific even if its practitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a progressive discipline .
In a somewhat similar vein , Daniel Rothbart ( 1990 ) emphasized the distinction between the standards to be used when testing a theory and those to be used when determining whether a theory should at all be tested .
The latter , the eligibility criteria , include that the theory should encapsulate the explanatory success of its rival , and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent with those of the rival .
According to Rothbart , a theory is unscientific if it is not testworthy in this sense .
George Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based on the requirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into the other sciences .
The various scientific disciplines have strong interconnections that are based on methodology , theory , similarity of models etc .
Creationism , for instance , is not scientific because its basic principles and beliefs are incompatible with those that connect and unify the sciences .
More generally speaking , says Reisch , an epistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into the existing network of established sciences ( Reisch 1998 ; cf. Bunge 1982 , 379 ) .
A different approach , namely to base demarcation criteria on the value base of science , was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton ( [ 1942 ] 1973 ) .
According to Merton , science is characterized by an “ ethos ” , i.e. spirit , that can be summarized as four sets of institutional imperatives .
The first of these , universalism , asserts that whatever their origins , truth claims should be subjected to preestablished , impersonal criteria .
This implies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not depend on the personal or social qualities of their protagonists .
The second imperative , communism , says that the substantive findings of science are the products of social collaboration and therefore belong to the community , rather than being owned by individuals or groups .
This is , as Merton pointed out , incompatible with patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and discoverers .
The term “ communism ” is somewhat infelicitous ; “ communality ” probably captures better what Merton aimed at .
His third imperative , disinterestedness , imposes a pattern of institutional control that is intended to curb the effects of personal or ideological motives that individual scientists may have .
The fourth imperative , organized scepticism , implies that science allows detached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by other institutions .
This is what sometimes brings science into conflicts with religions and other ideologies .
Merton described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of science , and thus as empirical statements about norms in actual science rather than normative statements about how science should be conducted ( Merton [ 1942 ] 1973 , 268 ) .
His criteria have often been dismissed by sociologists as oversimplified , and they have only had limited influence in philosophical discussions on the demarcation issue ( Dolby 1987 ; Ruse 2000 ) .
Their potential in the latter context does not seem to have been sufficiently explored .
Popper ’s method of demarcation consists essentially of the single criterion of falsifiability ( although some authors have wanted to combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually performed and their outcomes respected , see Section 4.2 ) .
Most of the other criteria discussed above are similarly mono- criterial , of course with Merton ’s proposal as a major exception .
Most authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put forward a list of such criteria .
A large number of lists have been published that consist of ( usually 5 – 10 ) criteria that can be used in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific practice .
This includes lists by Langmuir ( [ 1953 ] 1989 ) , Gruenberger ( 1964 ) , Dutch ( 1982 ) , Bunge ( 1982 ) , Radner and Radner ( 1982 ) , Kitcher ( 1982 , 30 – 54 ) , Hansson ( 1983 ) , Grove ( 1985 ) , Thagard ( 1988 ) , Glymour and Stalker ( 1990 ) , Derkson ( 1993 , 2001 ) , Vollmer ( 1993 ) , Ruse ( 1996 , 300–306 ) and Mahner ( 2007 ) .
Many of the criteria that appear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 .
One such list reads as follows :
Belief in authority :
It is contended that some person or persons have a special ability to determine what is true or false .
Others have to accept their judgments .
Unrepeatable experiments : Reliance is put on experiments that cannot be repeated by others with the same outcome .
Handpicked examples : Handpicked examples are used although they are not representative of the general category that the investigation refers to .
Unwillingness to test : A theory is not tested although it is possible to test it .
Disregard of refuting information : Observations or experiments that conflict with a theory are neglected .
Built - in subterfuge :
The testing of a theory is so arranged that the theory can only be confirmed , never disconfirmed , by the outcome .
Explanations are abandoned without replacement .
Tenable explanations are given up without being replaced , so that the new theory leaves much more unexplained than the previous one .
( Hansson 1983 )
Some of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations have defended this approach as being superior to any mono-criterial demarcation .
Hence , Bunge ( 1982 , 372 ) asserted that many philosophers have failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they have presupposed that a single attribute will do ; in his view the combination of several criteria is needed .
Dupré ( 1993 , 242 ) proposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family resemblance concept .
This would mean that there is a set of features that are characteristic of science , but although every part of science will have some of these features , we should not expect any part of science to have all of them .
However , a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to justify a multicriterial account of how pseudoscience deviates from science .
Even if science can be characterized by a single defining characteristic , different pseudoscientific practices may deviate from science in widely divergent ways .
Hence , the above - mentioned seven - itemed characterization of pseudoscience was proposed as representing seven common ways to deviate from a minimal ( necessary but not sufficient ) criterion of science , namely : Science is a systematic search for knowledge whose validity does not depend on the particular individual but is open for anyone to check or rediscover .
Pseudo - sciences have been called many names , with connotations ranging from contemptuous to laudatory .
Three the terms currently in frequent use are science denial ( ism ) , scepticism , and fact resistance .
Some forms of pseudo - science have as their main objective the promotion of a particular theory of their own , whereas others are driven by a desire to fight down some scientific theory or branch of science .
The former can be called pseudo - theory promotion and the latter science denial ( ism ) .
Pseudo - theory promotion is exemplified by homeopathy , astrology , and ancient astronaut theories .
The term “ denial ” was first used about the pseudo - scientific claim that the Nazi holocaust never took place .
The phrase “ holocaust denial ” was in use already in the early 1980s ( Gleberzon 1983 ) .
The term “ climate change denial ” became common around 2005 ( e.g. Williams 2005 ) .
Other forms of science denial are relativity theory denial , tobacco disease denial , hiv denialism , and vaccination denialism .
Many forms of pseudo - science combine pseudo - theory promotion with science denialism .
For instance , creationism and its skeletal version “ intelligent design ” are constructed to support a fundamentalist interpretation of Genesis .
However , as practiced today , creationism has a strong focus on the repudiation of evolution , and it is therefore predominantly a form of science denialism .
Science denialism usually proceeds by producing false controversies , i.e. claims that there is a scientific controversy when there is in fact none .
This is an old strategy , applied already in the 1930s by relativity theory deniers ( Wazeck 2009 , 268–269 ) .
It has been much used by tobacco disease deniers sponsored by the tobacco industry ( Oreskes and Conway 2010 ; Dunlap and Jacques 2013 ) , and it is currently employed with considerable success by climate science denialists ( Boykoff and Boykoff 2004 ; Boykoff 2008 ) .
However , whereas the fabrication of fake controversies is a standard tool in science denial , it is seldom if ever used in pseudo - theory promotion .
To the contrary , advocates of pseudo - sciences such as astrology and homeopathy tend to describe their theories as conformable to mainstream science .
The term scepticism ( skepticism ) has at least three distinct usages that are relevant for the discussion on pseudo - science .
First , scepticism is a philosophical method that proceeds by casting doubt on claims usually taken to be trivially true , such as the existence of the external world .
This has been , and still is , a highly useful method for investigating the justification of supposedly certain beliefs .
Secondly , criticism of pseudo - science is often called scepticism .
This is the term most commonly used by organisations devoted to the disclosure of pseudo - science .
Thirdly , opposition to the scientific consensus in specific areas is sometimes called scepticism .
For instance , climate science deniers often call themselves “ climate sceptics ” .
To avoid confusion , the first of these notions can be specified as “ philosophical scepticism ” , the second as “ defence of science ” , and the third as “ science denial ( ism ) ” .
Adherents of the first two forms of scepticism can be called “ philosophical sceptics ” , respectively “ science defenders ” .
Adherents of the third form can be called “ science deniers ” or “ science denialists ” .
Torcello ( 2016 ) proposed the term “ pseudoscepticism ” for so - called climate scepticism .
Unwillingness to accept strongly supported factual statements is a traditional criterion of pseudo - science .
( See for instance item 5 on the list of seven criteria cited in Section 4.6 . )
The term “ fact resistance ” or “ resistance to facts ” was used already in the 1990s , for instance by Arthur Krystal ( 1999 , p. 8 ) , who complained about a “ growing resistance to facts ” , consisting in people being “ simply unrepentant about not knowing things that do not reflect their interests ” .
The term “ fact resistance ” can refer to unwillingness to accept well - supported factual claims whether or not that support originates in science .
Kuhn observed that although his own and Popper ’s criteria of demarcation are profoundly different , they lead to essentially the same conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively pseudoscience ( Kuhn 1974 , 803 ) .
This convergence of theoretically divergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon .
Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their views on what science is .
Nevertheless , there is virtual unanimity in the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of demarcation .
There is widespread agreement for instance that creationism , astrology , homeopathy , Kirlian photography , dowsing , ufology , ancient astronaut theory , Holocaust denialism , Velikovskian catastrophism , and climate change denialism are pseudosciences .
There are a few points of controversy , for instance concerning the status of Freudian psychoanalysis , but the general picture is one of consensus rather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation .
It is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached in particular issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the general criteria that these judgments should presumably be based upon .
This puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important philosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience .
Philosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other interesting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between science and pseudoscience .
Examples include related demarcations such as that between science and religion , the relationship between science and reliable non-scientific knowledge ( for instance everyday knowledge ) , the scope for justifiable simplifications in science education and popular science , the nature and justification of methodological naturalism in science ( Boudry et al 2010 ) , and the meaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural phenomenon .
Several of these problem areas have as yet not received much philosophical attention .
What a day this has been at the Google I/O !
I have run around and talked to numerous extremely interesting people , including Googlers who have hinted ( nothing is official until it 's announced tomorrow and , of course , they could be trying to trick us ) and pretty much unofficially confirmed some very interesting details about Android 2.2 , also known as Froyo .
Performance
First up , I have confirmed that JIT will definitely be included .
As we already broke earlier , simple benchmarks show a 450 % improvement in speed over Android 2.1 Eclair , due to JIT .
But this is just the beginning .
JIT can't help performance everywhere and in some situations has no effect at all , such as I / O operations or while running native code .
JIT wo n't help much during boot either .
This is why the Android team has spent a significant amount of time analyzing and optimizing every little bit of reported slowdowns and inefficiencies they could find .
With Froyo , there was finally enough time to take a breather and organize proper analysis , set up profiling , and enable reporting of every little unexpected lag that the phones experience .
In order to accomplish this , a whole swarm of Google developers have been running around sporting dev or even nightly builds of Froyo on their Nexus Ones in the last month or maybe even few months .
Frankly , I am shocked that so little information leaked out when so many people had Froyo installed - not even a glimpse .
Google , you are either the new Apple security - wise or your employees really respect you ( I think both are true ) .
I found out that a lot of problems and slowdowns were identified using the system described above and fixed .
For example , one such bug was Android writing the same large XML file during bootup , 30 times rather than 1 .
I/O operations are expensive , so this significantly slowed down the boot time .
Once the bug was identified , fixing it was a matter of a few minutes ( set a flag if a file has already been written and check it ) .
You can think of Froyo as a release focused on slimming Android down and making it fit and more robust .
Froyo is supposed to be healthier than ice - cream , is n't it ?
Maybe there 's a hidden meaning there .
We 've seen the leaked from 4 chan " Auto - update " screenshots before but nobody has been able to confirm their validity .
From what I 've been hearing while running around today , this is indeed true - we will finally have auto - updating apps .
But that is not all we will have .
Auto - updating apps without having an ability to mass update all apps needing updating would n't make much sense - if Google were to work on one feature , it would have worked on the other too .
So I can unofficially confirm , based on what I managed to scope out today , that the mass update feature is indeed going to be present as well .
I believe this is going to make a lot of people who have been requesting a single button to update all apps happy .
Surprises
Another thing that was relayed pretty clearly and with an air of mystery , is that there will be surprises that nobody has even said anything about .
I could n't find out anything further here , but this is going to make tomorrow 's keynote that much more special and the wait that much more unbearable .
Other Stuff
I am not going to mention WiFi tethering as we already confirmed it and backed it up with some exclusive screenshots , after TechCrunch broke the story .
I am also not going to talk about Flash 10.1 support here - clearly , we already know we will be getting Flash , and it will be awesome ( though this last part remains to be seen after testing in the wild ) .
Conclusion
We 're bringing you as much information as we were able to gather but take everything with a grain of salt , people - as always , until everything is confirmed , nothing is confirmed .
7 hours until the keynote !

Image caption Cadbury owner Kraft is shaking up its UK operations
Kraft Foods , the new owner of chocolate maker Cadbury , has announced plans to close its UK headquarters .
The US company said it would move staff from its Cheltenham office to Cadbury 's current headquarters in Uxbridge , and Cadbury offices in Bournville .
Kraft said it planned to make Bournville , in Birmingham , the historical home of Cadbury , a centre for research and development .
But the food giant did not say if job losses would result from the changes .
Kraft 's Cheltenham office will close in 2011 .
Cadbury 's Science Centre in Reading is to become a global science and technology centre .
Business rationale
Kraft bought Cadbury in a controversial takeover at the beginning of the year .
It was feared that losing the iconic Cadbury to Kraft would lead to job cuts and factory closures .
So far 150 jobs have already been lost at the Cadbury HQ in Uxbridge and the closure of one factory been announced .
While the business case is clear , we need to support our people Nick Bunker , President Kraft Foods
Kraft 's proposals will , it believes , help strengthen collaboration between staff and boost performance .
Nick Bunker , President of Kraft Foods UK , said : " We would be very sad to leave Cheltenham and we would provide significant resources to support sites during the move .
However , the business rationale is compelling . "
' Chocolate excellence '
Kraft has come under fire for the way it has so far handled the takeover of Cadbury .
It reneged on a commitment to keep its plant at Sommerville in Keynsham open which angered workers and politicians alike .
Putting Bournville at the heart of Kraft 's chocolate research and development work will go some way to reassure workers and the British people that Kraft is committed to the long term future of Cadbury in the UK .
The Bournville so called ' Centre of Excellence ' will work on new product development for brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk , Toblerone , Green and Black 's and Suchard .
Kraft 's UK boss Nick Bunker called the move " a vote of confidence " in the UK .
A 15 - month - old baby escaped with just cuts and bruises after being hit by a train when his pushchair rolled off a station platform .
CCTV footage shows the buggy , at the top of the picture , rolling onto the track as the train arrives at Melbourne 's Tooronga station .
Paramedics said the double - pushchair started moving after the baby 's three - year - old brother climbed out when their grandmother 's back was turned .
Ambulance crew member Kate Jessop said it was amazing the child was not seriously hurt , while the grandmother , who was not named , told of her fear for the baby .
A similar incident happened in October , also in Melbourne , when a baby escaped with just a bump on the head .

COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) —
Food companies that remove high - fructose corn syrup from their products threaten the jobs of farmers in Ohio , the nation 's No. 7 grower of corn , state agriculture leaders say .
Some nutritionists cite the syrup as part of the country 's obesity problem , though industry scientists and many dietitians say it is no more fattening than sugar .
Nonetheless , PepsiCo Inc. has removed all high - fructose corn syrup from sports drink Gatorade and replaced it with cane sugar .
And ConAgra Foods Inc. said last week it has removed high - fructose corn syrup from its
Hunt 's brand ketchup .
" Farmers are extremely concerned , " said Fred Yoder , whose family farm near Plain City sends 80 percent of its corn directly to a corn-sweetener refinery .
" Not only do farmers lose , but the consumer is the biggest loser because food costs could go up 20 to 30 percent if they continue to switch from high - fructose corn syrup . "
Ohio produces $ 2.1 billion worth of corn , according to the state Farm Bureau .
Yoder argues that 1,700 corn-refining employees and 2,500 corn farmers in Ohio stand to lose their jobs if food producers turn their backs on high - fructose corn syrup .
High - fructose corn syrup has been used as a sweetener in a variety of foods ranging from baked goods and soft drinks to cereals since the 1970s .
The product not only is less expensive than sugar , but also extends the shelf life of processed foods .
About 58 percent of consumers say they are concerned that high - fructose corn syrup poses a health threat in the foods they eat , according to a study last year by NPD Group Inc. , a market research company in Port Washington , N.Y .
Forty - one new soft drinks and energy drinks were introduced last year proclaiming they contained no high - fructose corn syrup , said Mintel International Group , a Chicago - based research group .
So far this year , at least 14 new soft drinks and energy drinks have been put on the market advertising their lack of high - fructose corn syrup , Mintel spokeswoman Christine Coombes said .
John Davis , president of the board of directors for the Ohio Corn Growers Association , said he thinks consumers ' fears are based on misconceptions .
" These companies are not basing their decision on scientific facts but on what certain activist groups are telling them about the issue , " Davis said .
" Five years from now , when you still have the same obesity issue , what are they going to blame it on then ? "

Washington ( CNN ) -- U.S. officials are revising the way they screen air passengers coming to the United States , dropping measures hastily implemented after the Christmas Day bombing attempt and replacing them with a plan to give airlines and other nations " real - time , threat - based intelligence " about potential terrorists .
Under the plan , the Transportation Security Administration would give airlines and other nations information gleaned from intelligence sources about potential terrorists -- information such as partial names , partial passport numbers and travel patterns of suspects .
The plan retains existing No Fly and selectee lists , as well as the random selection of some passengers for additional screening .
But the plan scuttles a much - criticized program , implemented in the wake of the December 25 bombing attempt , that subjected virtually all travelers from 14 predominantly Muslim countries to additional screening .
" What we have done is changed the way we screen passengers who are coming internationally into the United States , " said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
" It is a more intel - or information - based way to screen .
It 's a stronger way to determine whether passengers should go through secondary examination and not just primary examination . "
The new security measures are the result of a review President Obama ordered after a Nigerian man allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day .
The measures begin Friday but will take a short time to implement fully , a senior administration official said .
The U.S. intelligence community will determine , based on threat information , which characteristics should be used to select passengers for secondary screening .
Race could be one distinguishing feature passed along , but " only when we have reliable intelligence that suggests that someone with that characteristic is a potential terrorist , " said the administration official .
The official said the program did not involve racial profiling .
The air carriers and international countries -- when they are the ones administering screening -- will have responsibility for pulling and screening passengers who meet the criteria .
The official said there is no concern about providing too much intelligence to too many people .
Security partners will be given what they need to identify people for additional screening and no more .
The new security regime requires cooperation from the airlines and other governments , but the official does not anticipate compliance problems .
" It is in their interest to ensure the safety of their flights , " the official said .
The United States will do inspections , and there will be penalties for not complying .
The recent case of David Headley showed how " fragmentary intelligence " can be used to help stop a potential terrorist , two administration officials said .
In March , Headley pleaded guilty to helping plan the November 2008 Mumbai , India , terror attacks , and another attack that was never carried out on a Danish newspaper that published controversial cartoons about the prophet Mohammed .
Based on intelligence , including a partial name and travel information , Customs and Border Protection did additional screening of travelers entering the United States and was able to identify Headley .
Since the failed Christmas Day attack , Napolitano has participated in aviation summits in Spain , Mexico , Japan and other places to forge agreements and to strengthen ways information can be shared around the aviation community , a senior administration official said .
Napolitano has suggested the International Civil Aviation Organization , a U.N. agency , set standards that would apply to all international airports , strengthening weak links in the security chain .
European privacy laws have stymied previous U.S. efforts to gain access to passenger information .
Full - body scanners improve security , TSA says
" I believe that this is a more effective security strategy , " said Sen. Susan Collins , R- Maine , ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee .
" Applying a kind of blanket , ' one - size - fits - all ' scrutiny to individuals based solely on their country of origin provides only limited additional security and helps terrorists avoid detection by using operatives from other countries to carry out their plots . "
Rep. Peter King , R - New York , ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee , called the change a " significant step forward " but criticized the White House for not briefing Congress before announcing the change .
" This is yet another instance of homeland security adviser John Brennan and other White House staff withholding important security information from Congress , " he said .
The Sikh Coalition , a religious rights organization , also said it welcomed the change , highlighting the decision to end the " 14 country " directive .
" Because the policy focused solely on national origin and not individual behavior , it effectively made profiling the law of the United States , " the group said .
" Its rescission is a step in the right direction towards ending profiling by the federal government . "
CNN 's Ed Henry and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report .
I ’m sure all of you bought the Humble Indie Bundle last week ( if not , shame : ) , and it ’s still on sale ! ) , which raised over $ 1 million for charity , indie developers and the EFF .
It was a very successful experiment in both selling indie developed games , the key factors being that there was no DRM and you could pay what you wanted for the collection of games .
However , in a very illuminating blog post , Wolfire estimates that up to 25 % of the downloads of the game are pirated , as they define it : “ users download from shared links from forums and other places without actually contributing anything ” , not including torrents .
Now remember that this is a bundle of games which are all DRM - free , that you can pay as little as $ 0.01 for and where you personally decide who gets the money : charity , the EFF , the developers or a combination of any .
Despite this , people are still finding ways to get it for free .
Now there are two ways to look at this .
Either :
1 . This proves that there is an absolute need for DRM to prevent unauthorised downloads , since even giving the option to pay just one cent does not prevent piracy .
OR
2 . This proves that DRM and price are irrelevant factors when it comes to piracy .
My disagreement with point of view 1 . is that I have yet to hear of any game that uses DRM that has not been cracked and ended up on bittorrent .
Yes it may take some time for newer / harder methods to be broken , but they always get there in the end – witness the Ubisoft ‘ always online ’ DRM which has now been cracked in two different ways .
Therefore the argument that DRM prevents piracy is false .
At the very best it delays it by a month .
But if point of view 2 . is correct , does n’t this mean that that 25 % of people who downloaded a copy of the bundle for free ( approx . 25,000 people ) are pirates ?
Well ‘ pirates ’ is an extremely nebulous term which can be defined to mean what people would like it to mean at any one time .
Avoiding using that term means you have to look in detail at the kind of people who are actually downloading titles for free .
Here is a non-exhaustive breakdown formed from my own thoughts , those of Wolfire and from some commenters on their blog :
Crackers whose only goal is to break DRM on titles to be the first to get the game online = a very small minority of people who do it for the prestige for themselves or their group
Those who refuse to pay = a group of people who wo n’t pay for anything digital be it games , movies or music , mostly for a personal belief that by doing so they are giving a finger to the ‘ system ’
Those who are unable to pay = they do n’t have any money to pay
Those who ca n’t pay = people who do n’t have credit cards / PayPal accounts or access to one , in the West most likely to be kids , elsewhere in the world , likely to be a heck of a lot of people ( see comments in the Wolfire blog by people from South Africa and Russia for instance )
Those who are lazy = ca n’t be bothered filling in card details or going through PayPal login , especially for cheap impulse purchases
Those who expect anything they download to be free
Out of these , in the case of the Humble Indie Bundle we can discount : crackers since there was no DRM , and those ‘ unable to pay ’ since you could pay 1 cent if you wished .
What ’s left is the 25,000 who downloaded the games for free .
Now those guys who refused to pay , not even a cent ( which they could choose to give to charity btw ) , well they are just selfish wankers in this case as there is no ‘ man ’ they are ‘ sticking ’ anything ‘ to ’ .
Not saying they are always selfish wankers despite the fact I do n’t agree with their beliefs , but in this case they definitely are .
This then leaves three main groups : those who ca n’t pay even though they want to ( kids , no credit card for personal or poor credit reasons or those in countries with no / poor credit card systems or cards that cannot be linked to PayPal ) , those who ca n’t deal with complicated payment systems and those that believe that anything downloadable is free ( all ages , all races , all over the world ) .
If we go back to point 2 . above , we find this agrees with it .
DRM is irrelevant as these people are not crackers proving a point and because they would not have bought a DRM copy anyway since they would always have got their copy through filesharing or a free link where it ’s already been cracked .
Price is irrelevant in two ways .
The ‘ free downloaders ’ to whom digital == free do not care if the game originally cost $ 100 or $ 1 , it does n’t even register with them .
This is a generation where a digital video of their friends on holiday is equivalent to a video of the film Iron Man for instance .
The reasons for this I wo n’t go into here to keep this post small , but I will discuss at some point .
Secondly those who could n’t pay or were too lazy to pay wanted to pay , but were prevented by technical / financial admin/national / tedious payment system reasons .
The payment issues can be solved by giving people as many ways to pay as you possibly can , thus preventing them from having to seek out a free version .
The remainder , to whom everything digital is intrinsically free are not your customers anyway as I ’ve mentioned in a previous post , so do n’t worry about them .
So , this being the case , Wolfire ’s decision that they are not going to do much about the free downloading ( other than request those people torrent it instead to save their server bandwidth ) makes perfect sense .
In their own words :

It took an hour and a half to navigate the roughly 100 - feet between the science lab and the cafeteria , including 15 minutes spent walking in circles until Tony and Wank simultaneously realized that they were both following the other ; 30 minutes of backtracking to find the bathrooms before simply urinating through the slots of Jenny Speceâs locker ( it was unanimously decided on as retribution for her terrible handjob techniques ; itâs like stroking a beloved pet , Jenny , not starting a fucking lawnmower ) ; and a full 45 minutes of rapt discussion as to who was the best Transformer , and why .
When they finally remembered why they 'd come , they quickly located the double - doors to the cafeteria .
Wank flipped on the lights and looked for the fryer while Tony found the freezer .
â Wank , â 
Tony said , his jaw gone slack , his eyes losing focus , â there are no words for this .
I must compose a symphony .â 
It was the day after delivery .
The freezer was stocked with ten 30 - pound bags of crinkle - cut french fries .
Three hundred pounds of pre-sliced potato mana ; the starchy ambrosia ; yellow gold .
â Iâm going to make all of them , â 
Wank whispered in awe .
He rushed over and began alternately praying to , swearing at and punching the fryer .
After what seemed like a frankly unnecessary flying elbow , he finally managed to hit the " ON " button .
The machine kicked to life .
â Dude , just use the manual , â 
Tony offered the booklet helpfully .
Wank promptly seized it and dropped it into the deep fryer , â Records are for the weak of mind and demented !
We are young and clever ; we will not suffer instructions !
â â I cannot conceive of a situation in which losing the instructions for an intensely complicated and dangerous piece of machinery has ever ended well .â â Well clearly it 's working :
They have become deep fried and delicious .
Now you may dine on your precious instructions .â 
Tony could not shake an ominous feeling of foreshadowing , but he ate the manual anyway because he was extremely high and that is just what extremely high people do .
MOUNT EVANS — Bighorn sheep once just about posed for Barb Day when she crept across their high - country habitat with her camera .
Now , in the latest twist of an ecological saga , non-native mountain goats are displacing the sheep along the road from Echo Lake Lodge to Mount Evans ’ 14,264 - foot summit .
“ You miss them , ” said Day , who has run the lodge for 31 years .
She and others who sense trouble are correct .
The long - term survival of bighorn sheep — Colorado ’s curly - horned state animal — is far from assured , with the sheep facing heavy threats here and across the West .
Colorado Division of Wildlife data show bighorn numbers statewide decreased by 10.2 percent between 2001 and 2009 — from 7,690 to 6,903 .
Construction carving into their habitat and disease attacking their lungs — combined with vehicular traffic and livestock — are identified as stress factors .
Hunters kill an average of 157 bighorns a year .
Federal biologists contend that competition from mountain goats — introduced in 1948 by Colorado wildlife managers — could push bighorns over the brink .
The most heralded herd of 335 bighorns above Georgetown — the one along Interstate 70 that people snap pictures of — is producing only 10 to 12 lambs per 100 ewes , said Rick Kahn , terrestrial - wildlife - management supervisor for the state .
That is less than one - third of what a healthy herd should produce .
“ It ’s fair to say that , of all the big game in this state , the bighorn species is the one we are most concerned about , ” Kahn said .
In the 1990s , Colorado emerged as a haven for bighorns , as herds in Wyoming , Montana , South Dakota and Idaho dwindled .
Colorado officials envisioned sustaining 20,000 .
Today , state biologists are scrambling to stop the nine - year decline .
They ’re stepping up research into how bighorns fall prey to pneumonia , parasitic lungworm and other diseases .
They ’re trying to revive dying herds .
They euthanized the last ailing bighorns in Poudre Canyon last year and transplanted 15 healthy sheep from crags above Georgetown – hoping these will colonize the canyon .
They ’re posting more tourist - management signs , such as the one at Echo Lake Lodge that warns : “ Your food kills me because my young learn to beg rather than forage . ”
On Sunday I appeared on The Big Questions on BBC1 to discuss whether the pope should " resign " .
It quickly descended into a heckling circus where calmly reasoned argument fell victim to unfocused outrage .
Afterwards , two representatives of the Protest the Pope Coalition told me menacingly I had " no right " to defend Benedict XVI 's record on abuse .
But shouting down the truth does n't make it go away .
I do n't defend the pope because I think it is the duty of a good Catholic ; I defend him because he is completely innocent of the charges made against him , and because the media has merged with the mob and misreported the facts .
The three recent stories from the US cited by Richard Dawkins and his mob as " proving " that the pope should be arrested under international law – the horrible cases of Murphy in Wisconsin , Teta and Trupia in Arizona , and now Kiesle in California – have this in common : the abuse took place in the 1970s ; the police were informed and acted ; the priest was suspended by his bishop ; requests for dismissal from the clerical state ( " defrocking " ) were sent to Cardinal Ratzinger 's department in the Vatican , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ; and some time later the priests were defrocked – except in the case of Murphy , who died during his trial .
Suspension and defrocking are two separate actions .
The first can be done by a bishop , with immediate effect ; the second is a lengthy process that involves Rome .
Suspension – meaning a priest is no longer able to function as a priest – say mass , hear confession , act as chaplain etc – is the key action that a bishop has to take against an abusive priest to prevent him having contact with minors .
If , in any of these " smoking gun " cases , the bishop failed to suspend an abusive priest immediately , he did wrong .
But such failure would have had nothing to do with Cardinal Ratzinger , whose only involvement was when a request for defrocking landed on his desk .
The time Rome took over each defrocking says nothing whatsoever about cover - up or collusion .
It says only that defrocking was then a complex and elaborate procedure that took too long .
However , what prevented the abuse was not the defrocking but the suspension by the bishop .
There is no link between the length of the defrocking process and the priest 's opportunity to abuse .
In fact , in the case of Kiesle , most of the abuse for which he was convicted took place after he was defrocked , when his bishop had no more control over him .
But was n't Ratzinger in charge while all this was going on ?
Did n't it happen on his watch ?
No .
From 1981 to 2001 he was in charge of a department that dealt with defrocking , but not with suspensions and penalties for paedophile priests , which were the responsibility of local bishops .
A number of bishops failed to suspend the abusive priests , some of whom continued to abuse .
That is the scandal .
It has been exposed and dealt with , and a number of bishops have , as a result , resigned .
More important , guidelines are now in place to prevent it ever happening again .
Not only was Cardinal Ratzinger not complicit in these failures , he was the Vatican official who most clearly saw what was needed to tackle the problem .
Then , in 2001 , Pope John Paul asked him to review the local churches ' handling of clerical abuse cases .
Cardinal Ratzinger asked bishops around the world to forward to him all cases where credible allegations had been made against priests .
He did this not to " cover up " the crimes – which had been reported to the local police – but to ensure that the priests were more speedily dealt with .
He accomplished this by amending the procedure for defrocking to allow for a fast - track procedure that did not involve trials .
Some try to make out that Cardinal Ratzinger 's 2001 letter orders a cover - up by insisting that parties observe secrecy under pain of excommunication .
What it actually says is that confidentiality should be observed during church trials , to allow the victims to give evidence freely and to protect the accused until found guilty .
There is nothing in that letter preventing victims reporting the case to the police , and the assumption is that they should .
Pope Benedict is not responsible for cover - up , collusion , turning a blind eye , institutional idolatry or any of the other accusations that , with greater or lesser vehemence , have been hurled at the Catholic church during recent weeks .
On the contrary , he is the one in the Vatican who has done most to rid the church of this scourge .
He is the one who has acted most consistently and energetically to improve the church 's handling of these cases .
The new Sprint HTC EVO sports some of the nicest hardware you can find on any mobile device on the market and boasts some of the burliest specs we 've ever seen in a phone ( 4G finally ! ) .
What 's more , it 's just drop - dead gorgeous ; the kind of thing that compels others to ask about it when you take it out of your pocket .
So the EVO 's greatest draw is its 4G WiMax compatibility .
How did it work ?
Uh ... we do n't know .
We tested the phone in San Francisco , which is not currently wired for 4G .
If you 're considering the EVO for its data - processing chops , take a look at where 4G is currently deployed .
However , it did do far better with 3G than our iPhone .
We took the phone to three different locations in San Francisco where AT&T has coverage holes , and in every case , had a 3G data connection ( sometimes slow ) while our iPhone would n't even make calls .
While this may be less of an issue in areas where AT&T delivers the coverage it advertises , those who suffer its inadequate network will be happy to know there 's a robust alternative .
On the hardware front , the giant 4.3 - inch display makes the iPhone and Nexus One feel dinky in comparison , yet it remains small and light enough to slip easily into a pocket .
It flaunts an 8 - megapixel camera ( with flash ) on the back , along with a 1.3 - megapixel sensor adorning the front .
This dual - screen action allows you to preview pics in order to take well - framed self portraits of yourself and your pals .
The camera also shoots 720 p video — it wo n't replace your HD camcorder , but it 's a fantastic shooter to have in your pocket .
A kickstand in the back lets you stand it up like a television , while an HDMI port lets you connect it to a TV .
The 1 - GHZ Snapdragon processor feels faster than the Indy 500 while the phone seemingly has more antennas than your average police car , with 3G , 4G ( WiMax ) , Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , FM and GPS connectivity .
All those antennas are put to good use .
The navigation system is on par with or better than most standalone GPS units .
Moreover , the phone feels designed for the internet from the get - go .
On launch , it walks you through setting up your Google , Facebook , Twitter and other social media accounts .
It imported our Facebook and Google contacts into the phone in seconds , and thanks to Google Voice integration , we were able to use an existing number .
We also loved the ability to tether the phone .
In just three clicks , you can set up a Wi -Fi connection to send internet to your computer .
Our only real hardware complaint is that the OLED display could bit brighter and crisper — it looks slightly fuzzy next to an iPhone — and we noticed some odd cyclical dimming effects when reading long blocks of text on web pages .
The overall interface is excellent , easily one of the most user - friendly of all the Android phones we 've laid hands on .
When we handed the phone off to a user who had never before tried Android , she was immersed in seconds and able to do e-mail , surf the internet and tweet without instruction .
It 's worth noting that the phone does not ship with the newly announced Froyo ( 2.2 ) version of Android , however HTC has announced that it intends to update phones released in 2010 with that version of the OS .
Our major quibble is that the battery on the EVO is shorter - lived than a plotline in a Seth MacFarlane show .
A typical use situation gave us about 6 hours of battery life .
After driving around town to test the GPS and 3G signals we ran out of juice in just over 4 hours .
The situation was even worse when we flipped on the 4G antenna .
In short , it wo n't make it through the day without a recharge .
While the battery on the EVO is replaceable , so you can carry a spare , we look forward to a day when smartphone battery life is reasonably matched to power consumption .
Overall , we loved this phone .
The hardware is smart and well - appointed , the interface is pleasant and straightforward , and it just plain worked .
In short , it felt like a call from the future ; one not dropped by AT&T .

Last call for designs
It is now time to finalize the designs .
We will allow additional submissions on the wiki up to the end of May and then we will vote on the designs .
So if you have n't yet submitted your idea or would like to tweak your existing submission , now is the time .
We are requesting design variations that cover both a vertical or square badge - like arrangement ( like most of those currently submitted ) and a horizontal web banner style design .
So if you only submitted one so far please add another one so we can see how well your idea could translate to a different format .
Picking the best
At the start of June , we will determine by a vote the strongest design to be developed into the finished labels .
The judging panel will include members of the KDE promotion team and ( similar to the Plasma Jam Session ) will include an additional member : you .
There will be a poll on the KDE Community Forum , the opening of which will be announced on the Dot , so that everyone who is KDE can have their say .
Keep watching the Dot for news on the poll and results .

In East Germany during the reign of the Stasi , neighbors informing on neighbors played an important role in making sure totalitarian rule operated efficiently .
All authoritarian states require helpful citizen - informants to make sure all are equally oppressed .
Is it possible the Department of Homeland Security in New York was mindful of this experience when it sent out the letter below to business owners and operators in the state ?
Imagine the false positives as eager informers rat out people engaged in behavior that a few short years ago was considered not only normal but none of the business of the state and its citizen - informers .
The letter was sent to Infowars.com this afternoon :

Formula
One racing might not be the same scintillating sensation in the United States that it is in Europe , but that 's not going to stop Codemasters from bring F1 2010 to America this September .
This title might not initially appeal to U.S. racing game fans , but F1 2010 might be the first F1 game that American gamers will want to pick up .
The developers behind F1 2010 have had approachability in mind during the entire development cycle , though there 's certainly plenty of room for the deeply technical racing that hardcore F1 fans will be frothing at the mouth for .
Oh +god , + don't + panic !+ Don't +panic !
The +weather+effects+are+looking+very+nice .
Last week , I had the pleasure of playing an early build of F1 2010 and seeing how a non -F1 fan like me can handle the game .
Surprisingly , I was able to avoid totally destroying my car , which I consider a serious victory .
But there 's a lot more going on in F1 2010 besides this needed accessibility .
With some incredible tech , a full career mode and online multiplayer , F1 2010 might be the game that opens up the Formula One world to nervous and intimidated gamers in the United States ( see : Ryan Clements ) .
First , a brief history lesson : Codemasters acquired the Formula One license in May of 2008 , which means that the team has been working on F1 2010 for about two and a half years .
This long development time really shows , as F1 2010 looks and runs beautifully , even in its early stages .
I quickly noticed the fluidity of the driver turning the highly detailed wheel , and the look of the tires as they scream across rain - spattered tracks .
I was told that the development team went to great lengths to create an authentic F1 experience .
This includes 19 official circuits , 12 teams , pit stops , real cars and drivers -- the team even motion captured actual pit crews to make the whole thing come alive .
The other thing that the developers want to stress is that F1 2010 is more than just racing -- it 's about living the life of the driver .
Although you can play as real F1 drivers in Grand Prix and other modes , it seems like the meat of the game will be in career mode , where players play as themselves in the world of Formula One .
This means that you 'll join a team , participate in interviews ( your answers influence the game ) , race against your teammate and live the surprisingly glamorous life that is F1 racing .
This interface is already looking spectacular , as the main menu is set up next to your trailer where press might be waiting and models are posing for cameras .
Your agent sits in your trailer and acts as a portal to various sections of the game , and from this headquarters menu players can jump into a ton of different races .
One of the first things that players will notice when booting up F1 2010 is an important question the game poses : what sort of experience do you want ?
There are five different levels that players can select which dictate just how much hand - holding will be implemented to give Formula
One newcomers a chance to get oriented .
This is a really fantastic idea , as it gives players like me an easy entryway into the experience without worrying about the extremely technical stuff in tweaking your vehicle of choice .
But of course , menus are n't nearly as exciting as actual races ( Right ? ) .
As nervous as I was to race in front of the representatives from Codemasters , I was amazed at how quickly I was able to get into the actual gameplay mechanics .
Sure , playing F1 2010 is difficult and requires a fair amount of skill , but it was n't unintelligible .
Everything felt natural .
This is probably thanks to the advising that former F1 driver Anthony Davidson has provided .
Apparently Davidson is in the developers ' offices every other week commenting on game controls .
F1 2010 is a precise , tight game where carefully handling , acceleration and speed is absolutely critical ( lest you want to explode ) .
The AI in F1 2010 will also be realistic , as the developers are doing their best to make the opposing racers behave like actual F1 drivers .
After all , each F1 driver drives differently , so having the AI vary from car to car makes total sense .
This realism and attention to detail even extends into the weather , with wet roads having a drastically different feeling than dry roads .
The developers have even considered loose pebbles that might be strewn on the track in certain courses .
The amount of real - world information contained in F1 2010 is mind - blowing , which leads me to believe that this will be very well - received among Formula One fans .
F1 2010 will be landing on the PS3 , 360 and PC this September .
Players can look forward to a legitimate F1 experience with a robust career mode , time trails and even the ability to download fellow players ' ghost runs .
Be on the lookout for our continued coverage of F1 2010 in the future .
In the week that Australia appointed its first population minister , a survey from a leading Sydney think - tank has shown that Australians are wary of the fast - paced growth of their country .
Right now the population stands at 22 million , but a government study released late last year forecast that it would grow to 36 million by 2050 , an increase of 61 % .
To put that in perspective , the global population is expected to grow over the same period by 38 % , and Australia 's projected expansion would likely make it the fastest growing industrialised nation , outpacing even India .
According to the Lowy Institute poll , 72 % of respondents support the general principle of a population rise , but 69 % want it kept below a 30 million ceiling .
Last year , Kevin Rudd was quick to embrace a Big Australia policy .
Now he 's having a rethink , ostensibly it seems because he misread the public mood on what has always been a sensitive issue here .
It not only raises the always thorny question of immigration levels , but whether Australia 's cities can sustain such rapid growth .
The government has refused to set a population target .
It says it will report back sometime after the election , which seems like an attempt to neutralise what could be a major issue during the upcoming campaign .
The politics of the Big Australia policy are by no means clear cut .
This week the Liberals seem eager to adopt a populist stance .
On Tuesday , the party 's immigration spokesman , Scott Morrison , said that migration levels were " out of control " , and had to be brought " back into perspective " .
Yet following complaints from business groups , who fear immigration cuts would be followed by skills shortages , he was forced to backtrack .
Tony Abbott , meanwhile , says he supports a " strong Australia " , which also sounds like a hedge .
We 've spoken before about the creep of the cul - de - sacs into the countryside , which looks set to become a headlong rush if the population forecasts .
Sydney , for instance , is growing at a rate of over 1,500 people a week , and is suffering badly from an infrastructure lag .
Road and rail construction simply cannot keep pace , and nor can new housing .
Demand outstrips supply , fuelling Australia 's housing affordability problem - a problem exacerbated this week by another hike in interest rates ( although , historically speaking , the cost of borrowing remains on the modest side ) .
The flip - side is that low population growth can lead to stagnation and problems of economic sustainability - in particular , of how to pay for the health and pension costs of an ageing population .
Many in the business community equate a Big Australia with a booming Australia .
Many in the burgeoning suburbs are increasingly thinking that big is far from beautiful .
UPDATE :
This is also the week , as it turns out , that the Australian government has decided to clampdown on asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka , two of the main source countries .
More than 100 boats carrying asylum seekers have been intercepted by the Australian navy since the Rudd government came to power in 2007 and Kevin Rudd has clearly been under mounting political pressure over the spike in the number of boat people .
The government 's response is the immediate suspension of visa applications from new Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers .
The move is clearly intended as a deterrent to people smugglers who operate mainly out of Indonesia - an attempt to stop the boats .
People smugglers will no longer be able to give their Afghan and Sri Lankan clients the assurance that their asylum applications will be processed by the Australian authorities .
Instead , there 's the much less enticing prospect of being held in limbo at an Australian offshore detention centre at Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean .
The government has said it made the decision in the light of changing circumstances in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan .
But the move is widely being interpreted here , of course , as principally a political move designed to neutralise an always sensitive issue ahead of this year 's Australian election .
The opposition has repeatedly claimed that the softening of the Rudd government 's immigration policies has led asylum seekers to target Australia .
It is always interesting and instructive to put Australia 's share of asylum seekers in a global context .
According to the latest figures from the United Nations refugee body , the UNHCR , Australia received 6170 applications for asylum in 2009 , compared with 1400 the previous year .
The United States received 49,020 , France 41,980 , Canada 33,250 , United Kingdom 29,840 , Germany 27,650 and Sweden 24,190 .
On a list of 44 industrialised nations , Australia was ranked 16th overall or , if you prefer , 21st on a per capita basis .
Kate Gauthier of the Refugee Council of Australia bemoans " ' the hysterical obsession with each boat arrival " and notes : " It 's unfortunate that the most vulnerable people in the world are being treated as public footballs . "
Under the new procedures , boats will not be turned away by the Australian navy and boat people will still be taken to a detention centre at Christmas Island , which is already overcrowded .
What the Refugee Council of Australia fears is the indefinite detention of new arrivals from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka , who will not be able to apply for asylum for at least the next six months , if they are Afghan , and the next three months if they come from Sri Lanka .
So is this is a paranoiac overreaction or a proportionate response to protect Australia 's borders ?
BlazeHtml : Initial results
Published on April 28 , 2010 under the tag BlazeHtml was accepted as GSoC project , I present the project herePublished on April 28 , 2010 under the tag haskell
What is this
This is a blogpost version of a talk I recently gave at the DutchHUG , about BlazeHtml , a “ blazingly fast HTML combinator library ” .
This project was accepted for Google Summer of Code , so I thought I ’d blog it , too .
What is BlazeHtml
About one month ago , a discussion took place on the Haskell web - devel mailing list .
In the mail I link too , Chris Eidhof describes what he wants to see in the Haskell web - devel neighbourhood .
Not much later , a ticket is created for Google Summer of Code by Johan Tibbel .
I was quite interested in this idea from the start , so because I was attending ZuriHac , I started a project on GitHub to do some work in this direction .
This project turned out to be more popular on ZuriHac than I had initially expected – I got the help from 7 awesome Haskellers : Chris Done , Fred Ross , Jim Whitehead , Harald Holtmann , Oliver Mueller , Simon Meier and Tom Harper .
Us hacking on ZuriHac
Together , we produced an initial , prototype version of BlazeHtml .
We focused on abstraction as well as performance … and I ’m afraid we wanted to do too much at once .
With pain in my heart , I had to throw a lot of code away and make a fresh start after ZuriHac .
But this does not mean the code we wrote was not useful : I will reintegrate big parts of it later , and it was a very useful learning experience .
The actual problem
Let ’s define the actual problem more precisely .
We want to write abstract descriptions of Html documents built from content and atttributes represented both as String as well as Data .
Text values , since both types are common representations of sequences of Unicode characters in Haskell programs .
We want to render these documents to a sequence of bytes represented as a lazy ByteString .
The chunks of such a lazy ByteString should be “ big enough ” in order to be efficient in later progressing , like sending the render over a socket or writing it to a file .
For now , we fix the output encoding to UTF - 8 , for two reasons :
We first want to get a performance baseline .
This way we can precisely determine what later abstractions cost .
UTF - 8 supports Unicode and is widely used and recommended for web pages .
Current state
So , what is the current state of our library ?
After having tried different design paths , we now have an implementation that is fast .
With this baseline performance , I hope to continue .
The question , of course , is how fast it exactly is .
The “ Big Table ” benchmark is a very simple microbenchmark , implemented in many different templating engines .
It times the rendering of a big < table > .
This table has 1000 rows and 10 columns , and every row has the simple content 1 , 2 , 3 , … 10 .
The different templating engines tested are :
Spitfire
ClearSilver
ERB
Erubis
Our own BlazeHtml .
BigTable benchmarks
For the record , all benchmarks are run on a Intel CPU T2080 @ 1.73GHz .
As you can see , BlazeHtml is quite fast .
I also tried some other Haskell libraries .
I will perform a more extensive benchmarking of the Haskell libraries available from Hackage in the near feature .
For now , you can see some initial results here :
BigTable benchmarks
Although I have to say that this comparison is not quite fair .
BlazeHtml produces encoded strings , where the other packages produce just strings ( which still need to be encoded before sending them over the network ) .
The code used for these benchmarks can be found in our repo .
Some benchmarks were implemented by the spitfire team , they can be found in their repo .
I edited some of these benchmark so that all of them escape the table content , in order to make a more fair comparison .
Why is BlazeHtml fast
There are two design decisions underlying the speed that BlazeHtml features :
We avoid explicit intermediate data structures by using a continuation - passing style ; i.e. our only intermediate data structures are closures , which are probably the best optimized data structures in a functional programming language like Haskell .
We copy each output byte at most once by using a mutable buffer encapsulated in a Builder monoid .
These two design decisions together with some well - chosen inlining resulted already in a quite nice speed .
What was missing then was fast writing of individual bytes into a Builder :
We were introducing too much overhead .
Every character was taken through an entire pipeline of functions that looked more or less like
. encode .
escape appendencodeescape
What I wanted is to have these operations executed on some sort of stream rather than on every character .
Originally , we were using the following function ( defined in Data .
Binary .
Builder ) to create our Builder monoid :
singleton :: Word8 ->
Builder
This function was called for every byte , introducing a severe overhead .
I was able to get significant speedups by defining the ( manually fused ) functions :
fromText :: Text ->
Builder fromUnescapedText :: Text ->
Builder fromString :: String ->
Builder
These functions were defined in Text .
Blaze .Internal.Utf8Builder .
They all rely on a small patch to Data .
Binary .
Builder , exposing the following function :
-- | /O( n ) ./ A Builder from a raw write to a pointer .
-- fromUnsafeWrite :: Int -- ^
Number of bytes to be written .
-> ( Ptr Word8 -> IO ( ) ) -- ^ Function that does the write . ( ) ) ->
Builder -- ^ Resulting ' Builder ' .
As you can see from this signature , we have some code here that some people would consider “ not elegant ” .
Those people include me .
However , we must not forget that efficiency is our main goal .
Besides , these functions are not exported to the end user .
The Future
So , that ’s it for now .
You can expect more updates from me in the feature , since I ’ll be working on this project with great enthusiasm now that it has been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2010 .
Thanks to all the people who made this possible !
This blogpost was partly based on the notes I make while developing .
These can be found here .
I ’d also like to thank Simon Meier for his continuous stream of feedback .
The supermarket says the advert is simply a parody
An Israeli supermarket chain is using a spoof of surveillance footage showing the alleged assassins of a Hamas commander in a television advert .
The advert 's fake grainy surveillance footage shows actors wearing elaborate disguises .
Dubai police released footage they said showed the assassins of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , some dressed for tennis , as they followed him through his hotel .
Israel 's secret service is widely suspected of being behind the killing .
But the government says there is not enough proof that its agents were involved .
In the advert for Mahsanei Kimat Hinam shops , disguised customers prowl the supermarket 's aisles and an actress wearing a wide - brimmed hat says she : " cannot admit to anything " .
The final line is : " We offer killer prices . "
Advertising executive Sefi Shaked said the campaign was inspired by the original footage .
" We were fascinated by the technique of using surveillance cameras instead of high - production cameras , and the latest events in Dubai have given us a great opportunity , " he said .
" It 's a parody , a take - off of what happened in Dubai .
All the Israeli television comedy shows have done it , so why should n't we ? " he added .
The International Weightlifting Federation ( IWF ) banned two Bulgarian weightlifters athletes , Georgi Markov and Alan Tsagaev ( above ) , for life while the other nine members of the team received four - year bans .
Bulgaria ’s Sports Ministry has stripped the country ’s weightlifting federation of its licence for financial mismanagement and a major doping scandal that saw the country 's top athletes banned .
The ministry said late Wednesday that it had refused to renew the federation 's licence because it had " breached the anti-doping regulations and sports ethics ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games and marred Bulgaria 's sports prestige . "
After the Games , the International Weightlifting Federation ( IWF ) banned two Bulgarian weightlifters athletes , Georgi Markov and Alan Tsagaev , for life while the other nine members of the team received four - year bans .
The federation was also fined USD 465 000 .
Ahead of the 2008 Olympics , all eight men and three women on Bulgaria 's preliminary weightlifting squad had tested positive for the anabolic steroid metandienon .
23 weightlifting clubs from around the country on Tuesday formed an alternative Bulgarian national weightlifting federation , adding they would apply for a licence from the sports ministry and the IWF .
The latest extracts from “ Property is Theft ! ” are now available .
As well as the remaining parts of the introduction , extracts of two texts from the start and end of Proudhon ’s political life are included .
These are 1841 ’s Letter to M. Blanqui ( the Second Memoir on Property ) and the final chapter of the posthumously published Theory of Property ( ‘ Théorie de la propriété ’ ) .
While much is made of the latter by Proudhon ’s enemies ( due to its supposed embrace of property ) , there are much in common between the two texts .
The final material from the introduction is in two parts .
The first includes “ Further Reading ” ( on Proudhon and includes links to the full versions of “ What is Property ? ” , etc. ) , “ Acknowledgements ” ( a big “ thank you ” to everyone who helped with translations and advice ) , “ A note on the texts ” and “ A note on the translations . ”
The second is more substantial , an appendix which is a discussion on Proudhon ’s changing terminology .
This is extremely relevant given Proudhon ’s alleged embrace of property in Theory of Property .
As discussed in this appendix , such claims wilfully ignore what he actually argued .
To quote George Woodcock ( as the appendix does ) :
“ Much has been made of this essay in an attempt to show that it represents a retreat from Proudhon ’s original radicalism .
Fundamentally , it does not . . .
What Proudhon does is to change his definition of property . . . he is thinking , not of the usurial property he condemned in his earlier works , but of the property that guarantees the independence of the peasant and artisan . . .
Because of his changes in definition , Proudhon appears more conservative , but the alterations are not radical , since he continues to uphold the basic right of the producer to control his land or his workshop . ”
The suggestion that Proudhon became a support of “ property ” flows from comments like these :
“ There is only one thing new for us in our thesis : it is that that same property , the contradictory and abusive principle of which has raised our disapproval , we today accept entirely . ”
However , immediately before this he argued :
“ Thus , on this great question , our critique remains at base the same , and our conclusions are always the same : we want equality , more and more fully approximated , of conditions and fortunes , as we want , more and more , the equalisation of responsibilities .
We reject , along with governmentalism , communism in all its forms ; we want the definition of official functions and individual functions ; of public services and of free services . ”
Which is a significant qualification , particularly as much of his comments are similar to those raised in ( say ) 1841 ’s Second Memoir .
In “ Theory of Property ” he argues for the “ approximation of the equality of property ” and suggests that “ the equality of property is not at all an initial fact ; it is in the ends of the institution , not in its origins . ”
Moreover , he still argues for workers associations as one of the “ guarantees of property against itself ” is “ Industrial and agricultural association ” and points to “ the industrial associations , small worker republics ” ( I should note that by “ small ” Proudhon was not meaning small - scale industry but rather suggesting they would be self - governing associations within a bigger self - governing society and economy ) .
Two decades previously he was proclaiming “ I preach emancipation to the proletaires ; association to the labourers ; equality to the wealthy . ”
The themes of equality and association are consistent :
“ Now , it would be a violation of justice to dispossess some and endow others , and then stop there .
We must gradually lower the rate of interest , organise industry , associate labourers and their functions , and take a census of the large fortunes , not for the purpose of granting privileges , but that we may effect their redemption by settling a life - annuity upon their proprietors .
We must apply on a large scale the principle of collective production , give the State eminent domain over all capital !
make each producer responsible , abolish the custom - house , and transform every profession and trade into a public function .
Thereby large fortunes will vanish without confiscation or violence ; individual possession will establish itself , without communism , under the inspection of the republic ; and equality of conditions will no longer depend simply on the will of citizens . ”
Obviously his position on using the State as a means of transition changed somewhat after 1841 .
By 1846 , he had taken the position that the state could not be reformed and looked to working class self - organisation to transform society ( and pressurise the state from outside as required ) .
However , in terms of his analysis of property and his goals there are substantial overlap between his uncompleted arguments of the 1860s and his position in 1841 .
Back then he was well aware that property reduced to just what you personally used was not property in the sense of “ theft ” or “ despotism ” :
“ Property , at its first term , is almost null .
Reduced to personal exploitation , it is property only potentially .
At its second term , it exists in its perfection ; then it is truly property . . .
When property is concentrated , society , abusing itself , polluted , so to speak , grows corrupt , wears itself out . ”
In 1841 it was a case of “ the third term , the synthesis . . .
I have shown that this third term is association , which is the annihilation of property . ”
In the 1860s , he was willing to call this synthesis property ( as Woodcock suggested ) .
Why ?
As noted in the appendix , from 1850 onwards Proudhon started to use the term “ property ” to describe possession and seems to be driven by a desire to reduce peasant hostility to social reform ( a conclusion produced by the events of the 1848 revolution undoubtedly ) .
Such a change in terminology ( if not that much of content ) could , and does , lead to confusions – particularly when those seeking to dismiss Proudhon ignore the details of his 1860s work in favour of selective quoting of a few sentences .
Sadly , this fate has befallen many of Proudhon ’s work ( starting with Marx ’s hatchet job on “ System of Economic Contradictions ” and some of the commentary on “ War and Peace ” ) .
Ironically , Proudhon had pointed out in 1841 the confusion which would result in such a use of the term “ property ” ( against the Christian Socialist Leroux , whom he would debate with in 1849 ) :
“ Thus , according to M.Leroux , there is property and property , — the one good , the other bad .
Now , as it is proper to call different things by different names , if we keep the name ‘ property ’ for the former , we must call the latter robbery , rapine , brigandage .
If , on the contrary , we reserve the name ‘ property ’ for the latter , we must designate the former by the term possession , or some other equivalent ; otherwise we should be troubled with an unpleasant synonymy . ”
Quite !
Suffice to say , attempts to proclaim Proudhon as rejecting his previous analysis are somewhat at odds with what he actually argued in the 1860s .
It is doubtful that supporters of “ absolute ” or Lockean property would concur with Proudhon ’s clearly stated desire to equalise property and wealth ( nor with workers associations to replace wage - labour and the ago - industrial federation within mutualism ) .
The question obviously now arises as to where “ Theory of Property ” stands in relation to Proudhon ’s ideas and legacy .
As I note at the start of the extracts from it in the anthology :
“ Proudhon ’s ‘ Théorie de la propriété ’ was posthumously published from an unfinished manuscript in the year of his death by his friends .
It was started in 1860 / 1 but , significantly , Proudhon never completed it , preferring to write and publish other works ( such as ‘ The Federative Principle ’ ) .
Given that he completed ‘ On the Political Capacity of the Working Classes ’ on his death - bed , the question remains as how important this work is in terms of the overall evolution of his ideas .
This is why this extract is in an appendix .
“ What becomes clear from this work is that there is no significant change in Proudhon ’s perspective on property and possession .
The usual themes of his work are there , such as the land as common property , workers associations and the absolutist nature of property .
His apparent new found support for ‘ property ’ is not for capitalist private property .
Rather , it is for small - scale property , property which combines ownership and use .
As such , rather than a conversion away from his previous ideas this work represented more a slight shift in his position .
The vision expounded is the familiar Proudhonian one of an artisan , peasant and workers co-operative based economy . ”
Suffice to say , I would argue that “ The Political Capacity of the Working Classes ” is Proudhon ’s legacy rather than the incomplete “ Theory of Property . ”
This is indicated , I think , by the fact that in Chapter XIII ( “ On Association , within Mutuality ” ) of “ Political Capacity ” he states “ I had very much wanted here to give the mutualist and federative theory of Property , the critique of which I published twenty - five years ago ” and in a footnote adds : “ See What is Property ; Letter to M. Blanqui ; Warning to proprietors , Paris , 1840 , 41 and 42 , and Economic Contradictions , volume II [ presumably Chapter XI ] . ”
Clearly in his final moments he was not distancing himself from his seminal critique of property .
This is not to say that “ Theory of Property ” should be ignored , far from it .
Rather it is to point out that he never finished it , preferring to work on other texts , and , as such , cannot be considered to be his final word on property .
Talking of which , here is Proudhon ’s final words of that text ( the full version of the chapter can be found here ) .
I think them very sweet ( I know , not very revolutionary sounding , but that is the feeling they provoke in my grizzled libertarian - communist heart ) :
“ When I see all these fences around Paris , which block the view of the country and the enjoyment of the soil by the poor pedestrian , I feel a violent irritation .
I ask myself whether the property which surrounds in this way each house is not instead expropriation , expulsion from the land .
Private Property !
I sometimes meet that phrase written in large letters at the entrance of an open passage , like a sentinel forbidding me to pass .
I swear that my dignity as a man bristles with disgust .
Oh !
In this I remain of the religion of Christ , which recommends detachment , preaches modesty , simplicity of spirit and poverty of heart .
Away with the old patrician , merciless and greedy ; away with the insolent baron , the avaricious bourgeois , and the hardened peasant , durus arator .
That world is odious to me .
I can not love it nor look at it .
If I ever find myself a proprietor , may God and men , the poor especially , forgive me for it ! ”
I should also note that that chapter on association from “ Political Capacity ” is full of interesting material , discussing how mutualist associations differ from capitalist and communist ones – he considers the later two as having much in common ( “ that nothing in them indicates a single thought of reform , any superior view of civilisation , nor the least concern for the progress and destiny of humanity ” ) .
Of the major works that have not been translated , I would say that “ Confessions of a Revolutionary ” and “ The Political Capacity of the Working Classes ” are the two most crying out for publication in English .
Both contain important material and are important to understanding the evolution of anarchism and Proudhon ’s ideas .
Confessions is his account and analysis of the 1848 revolution and the chapters translated for the anthology suggest a rich source of information about Proudhon ’s practical ideas and a primary document for that revolution .
Material on which is few and far between , particularly from an anarchist perspective ( and even from a Marxist one ) which is strange given that both Proudhon and Marx lived through it ( perhaps Marx ’s commentaries on the events in France means that Marxists do n’t have to bother with it ? ) .
Bakunin mentioned 1848 a few times and the whole event seems to have been important in the development of Marxism and Anarchism .
The only libertarian account I can think of is volume two of Murray Bookchin 's The Third Revolution .
It covers the ground well ( and includes the Paris Commune ) but that book was written when he was breaking from anarchism and it shows it ( his account of Proudhon 's ideas is just terrible , for example ) .
There is still a good libertarian account of the 1848 revolution waiting to be written .
Suffice to say , a complete translation of Confessions would enrich our understanding of Proudhon ’s ideas ( particularly in regards to transition towards mutualism as that was what he was trying to influence the revolution towards ) as well as being a libertarian account of a key revolution of the 19th century .
It is a disgrace , in many ways , that we ( the anarchist movement ) have never done so .
We could combine both , I suppose , by producing a good introduction to the book which analyses both the revolution and Proudhon 's ideas and activities during it .
However , that would be a substantial project .
As regards “ Political Capacity ” , this really is Proudhon legacy – he worked on it to his dying day and he was addressing himself to both the needs of the day and to a blossoming working class movement .
It is clearly an attempt to present his ideas in a clear way in order to influence a movement which looked to him for many of its ideas ( as can be seen from the activities of the Mutualists in the First International ) .
The anthology has five chapters and a letter , a fraction of the complete work .
What is there is of great interest and clarifies many of Proudhon ’s ideas .
It really should be made available .
A few comments on the history of the Second Memoir .
This was written as a letter to liberal economist Jérôme - Adolphe Blanqui ( not to be confused with his younger brother , the revolutionary communist Auguste Blanqui – any family gatherings when Blanqui was out of jail must have interesting to say the least ) .
Blanqui had defended Proudhon when “ What is Property ? ” provoked a hostile response .
As Proudhon ’s friend J. A. Langlois recounts in his “ P. J. Proudhon : His Life and His Works ” :
“ The first memoir on property appeared in 1840 , under the title , ‘ What is Property ? or an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government . ’
Proudhon dedicated it , in a letter which served as the preface , to the Academy of Besançon .
The latter , finding itself brought to trial by its pensioner , took the affair to heart , and evoked it , says Sainte Beuve , with all possible haste .
The pension narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold defender of the principle of equality of conditions .
M. Vivien , then Minister of Justice , who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the author , wished first to obtain the opinion of the economist , Blanqui , a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences .
Proudhon having presented to this academy a copy of his book , M. Blanqui was appointed to review it .
This review , though it opposed Proudhon 's views , shielded him .
Treated as a savant by M. Blanqui , the author was not prosecuted .
He was always grateful to MM .
Blanqui and Vivien for their handsome conduct in the matter .
“ M. Blanqui 's review , which was partially reproduced by ‘ Le Moniteur , ’ on the 7th of September , 1840 , naturally led Proudhon to address to him , in the form of a letter , his second memoir on property , which appeared in April , 1841 .
Proudhon had endeavored , in his first memoir , to demonstrate that the pursuit of equality of conditions is the true principle of right and of government .
In the ‘ Letter to M. Blanqui , ’ he passes in review the numerous and varied methods by which this principle gradually becomes realised in all societies , especially in modern society . ”
I should also note that there is a Third Memoir on property which has not been translated .
It appeared in 1842 and was entitled “ A Notice to Proprietors , or a Letter to M. Victor Considérant , Editor of ‘ La Phalange , ’ in Reply to a Defence of Property . ”
It contained this call for working class self - emancipation :
“ Workers , labourers , men of the people , whoever you may be , the initiative of reform is yours .
It is you who will accomplish that synthesis of social composition which will be the masterpiece of creation , and you alone can accomplish it . ”
The book was seized by the magistrates of Besançon using the excuse it contained a ( somewhat vague ) threat to property owners .
Proudhon was summoned to appear before the court and read his written defence to the jurors who viewed him as a philosopher and was acquitted .
He was not so lucky when he was tried for insulting President Louis - Napoléon during the 1848 revolution and spent three years in prison ( ironically , Proudhon attacked the President for dictatorial ambitions and was subsequently proven right by the coup of December 1851 ) .
It is a sign of his influence during the revolution that the Conservative majority changed the law to strip Proudhon of his immunity as a elected representative of the people .
In effect , he was a political prisoner and his prosecution was a blow aimed at the left .
This famous exchange in the National Assembly in July 1848 ( after the crushing of the workers ' revolt on June 23 ) shows why the right were so keen to silence him :
Citizen Proudhon : Reservations go hand in glove with property .
The meaning is ..
Several members :
We got your meaning !
Citizen Proudhon :
The meaning is that , in the event of a refusal , we would ourselves proceed with the make - over without you .
( Angry rumblings )
Numerous voices :
Who , you ?
And who might you be ?
( Excitement )
Citizen Ernest de Girardin :
Are you talking about the guillotine ?
( Murmurs .
– Several challenges are made to the speaker from several quarters ) .
Citizen Speaker : I call upon all present to be silent .
The speaker has the floor so that he may explain his thinking .
Citizen Proudhon :
When I used those pronouns you and we , it was self - evident that at that point I was identifying myself with the proletariat and identifying you with the bourgeois class ( Further eruptions )
Citizen Saint - Priest :
But that is social warfare !
A Member : 23 June holds the floor !
In prison , though , he wrote two of his most important works ( “ Confessions of a Revolutionary ” and “ General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century ” ) .
In addition , he wrote the letters which became The Philosophy of Progress ( pamphlet pdf and non-pamphlet pdf ) .
The letters were written in 1851 and due to their length were published as a book in 1853 .
This was promptly banned by the censors of the Second Empire .
This been translated by Shawn Wilbur and was due to be included in the anthology .
However , as new material was translated for the book it became clear that we would not have space to include it in full .
I tried cutting it down but it soon became clear that doing so really did not do it justice and so , unfortunately , out it came .
There are some interesting parts of it relating to his works of the 1840s .
He refers to his critique of property as “ this socialist polemic ” and suggests that capitalism aims for “ Malthusian economics for the salariat ” ( wage - workers ) .
He talks of “ capital , a term of avarice , and in opposition to capital , a term of envy , the salariat .
The salariat is the revolutionary level , invented by capital .
These two passwords have entered into the language of the people . ”
He summarised his critique of property :
“ Is it conquest , first occupation , which creates property ? —
I observe that force does not make law , and that at the first occasion I would know , without further ado , to take my revenge .
“ Is it the institution of the State ? — I respond that what the state has made , the State can unmake ; and as I have the greatest interest in the thing , I am going to try to make myself master of the State .
“ Is it labour ? — I ask what must be the wages of labour ?
if each has laboured ?
if those who have laboured have received what ought to come back to them , cuique suum , neither more nor less ?... ”
He argued that capitalism and progress conflict :
“ I have said that the right of the capitalist , proprietor or master , — who stops the economic movement and hinders the circulation of products , who makes a civil war of competition , the machine an instrument of death , the division of labour a system of exhaustion for the worker , taxation a means of popular extenuation and possession of the soil a ferocious and unsociable domain , — was nothing other than the right of force , royal or divine right , such as the barbarians conceived and as it results from the definitions of politics and of the casuists , the highest expression of the absolute , the most complete negation of the ideas of equality , order and progress . ”
Needless to say , he links himself to the wider left and places himself in the democratic tradition , although a decentralised one which extends to economics as well as politics :
“ It is certain that the democracy , which is nothing else , after all , than the party of movement and liberty , cannot be erased from history for the aberrations and naivety of 1848 . . .
Up to now , democracy has followed the forms of monarchic government , monarchic politics , and monarchic economics .
This is why democracy has always been only a fiction , incapable of constituting itself .
It is time that it learns to think for itself ; that it posits the principle which is proper to it , and by affirming itself in a positive manner , that it carries to completion the system of social ideas . ”
In short , a new democracy which rejects centralised forms – a theme he returns to in subsequent works ( particularly in “ Political Capacity ” ) but which was raised in his polemic with Louis Blanc in 1849 .
Suffice to say , while “ The Philosophy of Progress ” may not be his best book , it is work reading .
Lastly , three things .
First , the cover of “ Property is Theft ! ” has been done ( for the AK Press catalogue ) .
I like it :
Second , in terms of “ Further Reading ” I should point out that Shawn Wilbur has translated around 13 pages of Proudhon ’s 1863 “ War and Peace ” ( a much misrepresented work ) .
And , yes , Tolstoy did name his novel after Proudhon work .
This translation was done for issue 1 his new magazine , “ The Mutualist ” .
It is worth a read , even if you are ( like me ) a communist - anarchist .
This issue includes translations of two pieces by Joseph Déjacque who was not only the first person to take Proudhon 's mutualism to communist - anarchist conclusions but also was was the first to employ the term libertarian as an alternative to anarchist .
I 'm hoping future issues will have translations from the debates in the First International in it Documents from Mutualist History section ( particularly material by César De Paepe and Eugene Varlin who were instrumental in developing mutualism towards the revolutionary collectivism usually associated with Bakunin ) .
We will see .
I should also , given the theme of this update , point readers to Shawn 's discussion on " What Is Property ? " vs " Theory of Property " ? , which was part of a wider Proudhon seminar he organised a while back .
His conclusion on the differences between the 1840s and 1860s ?
Similar to my own ( and Woodcock , Vincent , etc. ) , namely " It seems to me that very little . . . actually changes " and " I want to suggest that it is not " a " major change from the position " .
Suffice to say , the movement owes Shawn a great big thank you for all the hard work he has done in getting such material to new generations of anarchists .
Third , there is a blog by a communist - anarchist called “ Property is theft ” .
Nothing to do with the new Proudhon anthology or this site , but it looks interesting and I thought I would mention it ( particularly as it references An Anarchist FAQ ! ) .

REUTERS / Yannis Behrakis
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British scientists have found five common genetic factors linked to the risk of developing breast cancer , giving researchers a better understanding of its causes and clues for developing more treatments .
Douglas Easton from Britain ’s University of Cambridge led the largest genome - wide analysis of breast cancer patients to date , scanning the gene maps of 16,536 patients , and found five new common gene variations .
The findings add to 13 other common genetic variants for breast cancer and will help explain around 8 percent of the risk of getting the disease , Easton and colleagues wrote in a study published in the journal Nature Genetics on Sunday .
A few , high - risk gene variants that occur much more rarely account for another 20 percent of breast cancer risk .
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in rich nations .
It kills around half a million people worldwide each year .
Family history is a well - established risk factor .
Having a close relative with breast cancer approximately doubles a woman ’s risk for the disease .

( CNN ) --
A federal official monitoring the environmental impact of the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico said Tuesday his agency is closely watching what he called BP 's " unique idea " to break up the spill with dispersant chemicals underwater .
In addition to the traditional method of using dispersants on the surface , BP has attempted to inject chemicals near the source of the leak deep underwater .
Oil has been gushing out of the seabed since at least April 22 , when the Deepwater Horizon sank two days after an explosion and fire .
Charlie Henry , scientific support coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told reporters Tuesday that the agency is evaluating the pros and cons of the effort .
" We 're looking at response options , from the perspective of trying to make a determination of what makes the biggest mitigation to the pollution threat . "
" This is a unique idea , to insert dispersants near the seafloor , " said Henry .
" There are a lot of unknowns associated with this . "
So - called dispersants have components that bond to oil molecules , separating them from water molecules and helping break up the spill .
The Nalco Holding Co. , based in Naperville , Illinois , said that BP is using its Corexit 9500 product in the Gulf .
Nalco describes itself as the world 's leading water treatment and process improvement company .
" We 've made available to BP and the Coast Guard what we have in stock , and we are manufacturing more as it's needed , " spokesman John Shane said Tuesday .
Shane said he could not discuss the exact chemical makeup of Corexit 9500 , in part because the formula is a trade secret .
The material data safety sheet for Corexit 9500 said it includes petroleum distillates , propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt .
According to the safety sheet , it can cause eye or skin irritation with prolonged contact .
It also warns that " repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract . "
Henry said the dispersants being used in the Gulf show " fairly low toxicity . "
He added that any dispersant must be preapproved by the Environmental Protection Agency and listed on an approved product schedule before its use .
A 2005 report by the National Research Council found that Corexit is " significantly less toxic than oil or dispersed oil , " based on numerous studies .
Nalco describes the product as biodegradable .
" It 's made up of products that are used in everyday life , products used in food and products used in cosmetic applications as well , " Shane said .
Toxicologists and environmental scientists said Corexit and other dispersants are unlikely to cause immediate harm to people , but can have a big impact on marine organisms that are directly exposed .
A report by scientists at Exxon Biomedical Sciences said an earlier version of Corexit is harmful to some marine organisms at even lower doses than oil itself .
Fish eggs and larvae , shrimp , coral and oysters are potentially most at risk .
The National Research Council report noted elevated concentrations of dispersant chemicals in shellfish after a spill in Coos Bay , Oregon .
The chemicals can also contaminate the skin of ocean - farmed fish if their cages are near the site of the spill , according to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation , a nonprofit that offers technical guidance on cleaning up spills .
Jackie Savitz , senior scientist with Oceana , an environmental group that opposes offshore drilling , said the use of dispersants may be warranted , but that chemicals only shift the environmental impact , rather than eliminate it .
" [ Dispersants ] make the oil more soluble in water , so it wo n't just sit on the surface , " said Savitz .
" Whether that 's good or bad depends on whether you 're a fish or a seabird . "
Breaking up the oil may prevent it from forming clumps and coating birds ' feathers , but causes droplets to spread more widely at various depths .
" It 's like if your kids spread the food around on their plate .
It looks as though there 's less food , like they ate it , but really they just moved the food around . "

Last fall , a group of researchers at the Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) released a study showing an abrupt leveling off in the number of editors and edits to Wikipedia , starting in about 2007 .
There is a great summation of the findings in a set of posts by Dr. Ed H Chi , Lead Scientist at the PARC Augmented Social Cognition group here , here , here , and here .
I 've been thinking a lot over the past few months about what might be causing the slowing rate of contributions , as have many others .
I particularly liked Niel Robertson 's post last week on the Enterprise Irregulars site .
Niel 's thesis is that Wikipedia has failed to continue to develop innovative ways to motivate its community , falling behind as other communities and companies have implemented more creative new techniques .
Niel goes on to identify seven types of motivation for crowdsourcing ( yes , I still dislike that word ) efforts , of which he says Wikipedia is only using a couple .
I think he is on to something .
But Wikipedia is operating at a scale that dwarfs almost every other crowdsourcing effort in history .
It takes a massive bureaucracy of editors and administrators to keep the whole thing going .
And if traditional bureaucracies ( like those in governments and large companies ) tend to stifle innovation , what happens in a bureaucracy where the bureaucrats are n't getting paid and are n't getting any recognition for their efforts ?
From my point of view , this is Wikipedia 's next great challenge :
How does it convince the world to love and recognize its contributors ?
I think Niel 's post has some pretty good ideas for how Wikipedia could motivate its community of editors and administrators .
But for me , it goes beyond simple motivation .
The best contributors must truly feel loved and appreciated .
Right now , the only attention most editors and administrators get is in the form of hate , whether they deserve it or not .
The bureaucracy of Wikipedia has a brand problem , probably caused in large part by an underlying culture problem .
Search for " hate Wikipedia " in Google and you 'll return about 13,000,000 results , which mostly fall into one of two categories : people complaining about inaccurate or politizised entries or contributors complaining about malicious editors and draconian administrators .
Are these accusations true ?
I 'm sure many of them are .
In fact , Wikipedia itself has a brilliantly - edited page describing all of the criticisms of Wikipedia in great detail .
Can Wikipedia rehabilitate the reputation of its editors and contributors and eliminate some of the worst offenses of the bureaucracy ?
I think so .
But to do so will take significant cultural changes .
Some questions I 've been pondering :
How can Wikipedia reward and recognize editors who do exceptional work while rooting out those editors who stifle the exceptional work of others ?
How can Wikipedia reward true leadership and make heroes out of those who make the largest contribution ?
We love our superstars , whether in sports , politics , literature , or any other field , yet we do n't even know the names of our Wikipedia heroes yet .
Could ( and should ) Wikipedia make the shift from being a culture of near - anonymous contribution and service to one where contribution and service are rewarded in very public ways ?
I love Wikipedia , and I am not alone ( a Google search for " love Wikipedia " brings back 109,000,000 entries — almost 10 x the number for hate ) .
So if you love Wikipedia too ( or even if you do n't ) , please share some of your ideas below .
How can we help Wikipedia improve its culture of contribution to ensure it continues to grow and improve as a useful resource for years to come ?
Let me know what you think .
As we pointed out last week , nobody cares about either Greece or the PIIGs any more .
The focus among the smartest money out there , in the face of CDS traders , for the third week running , is on the core of Europe , and specifically on the UK .
Last week the net notional derisking in UK was a massive $ 1,063 million in 280 traded contracts , which according to our files is the single biggest one week derisking amount on record .
all the Greek " speculators " are now focusing their attention squarely on the UK ... and France , which came in second with $ 384 million in derisking .
Incidentally , these two represented the greatest amount of of derisking in all top 1000 CDS reference names ( third altogether was not surprisingly Goldman Sachs with $ 256 million ) .
The bet is now squarely on that the PIIGS contagion will move to the UK , and that France will also not be spared .
We wish Mr. Cameron all the best as he attempts to push the $ 50 billion austerity measure through .
We have a feeling his popularity rating in under a year will be even lower than that of president Obama .
And if it is n't it will be because the cable and the dollar will be at parity .
After all , we are all money devaluing comrades now .

Atheist Watermelon Miracle
Not to be outdone in the miracle department , atheists are having their own set of wondrous happenings .
Images of Jesus in a piece of toast , or in a taco are pretty small potatoes compared to the current spate of vegetable visitations being witnessed by people all over the world .
CSS Starbursts
I was recently experimenting with the new CSS3 rotation property and it occurred to me that I could use this to create image - free starbursts .
All I needed was a series of nested block - level elements each rotated by a slightly different amount and the rotation would distribute the box corners around the circumference of the star .
To start with I created a 16 pointed star by using three nested span elements inside a link .
Here is what the it looks like :
The above starburst will only work in browsers that support the CSS3 rotation property , currently , that 's Safari , Firefox , and Google Chrome .
All other browsers will gracefully degrade to a simple yellow box .
I 've added a Safari screenshot to the right so you can see what it looks like in a modern browser ( just in case you 're not using one right now ) .
Here is the HTML code .
Notice that there is only one link and three span tags :
< a href= " # " class= " starburst " > < span >< span >< span > < br />NEW < br />CSS3 < br />Starbursts ! </ span></span></span> </a>
The CSS is a little bit longer .
I 've highlighted the rotation rules in the CSS , one is for Firefox ( prefixed with - moz - ) , one is for webkit ( prefixed with - webkit - ) , and the other is the standard rotation rule as it will be used once this rotation property becomes standard :
. starburst { display : block ; width :6em ; height :6em ; background : # fe0 ; - webkit-transform:rotate ( - 45deg ) ; - moz-transform:rotate ( - 45deg ) ; rotation : - 45deg ; position : relative ; top:2em ; left : 2em ; text - align : center ; text - decoration : none ; color : #000 ; font - weight : bold ; font - family : Arial , sans - serif ; } . starburst span { display : block ; width : 6em ; height :6em ; background : # fe0 ; - webkit-transform:rotate ( 22.5deg ) ; - moz-transform:rotate ( 22.5deg ) ; rotation : 22.5deg ; }
Animated CSS3 starbursts
If you create your starbursts with CSS3 you can do so much more than with images .
Below are a few more demos where I 've experimented with different numbers of points , rounded borders , text - shadows , animations with transitions and transforms , and also translations .
To see the animations you will need to use Safari or Google Chrome .
Some cool features ...
No CSS Hacks
There are no CSS hacks required for these CSS3 starbursts .
CSS is designed to be backwards compatible so any browser that cannot understand CSS3 will simply ignore these new rules without any error .
i Phone , iPod Touch , & iPad Compatible
The Safari browser is one of the most advanced when it comes to CSS3 because it uses the powerful Webkit rendering engine .
This means all these animated starbursts will work fine on the iPhone , iPod Touch and the iPad .
SEO Friendly
Because the text in each starburst is actually real text it will be crawled and indexed by Google like everything else .
It also means that people who are vision impaired can more easily read and understand your web page if they are using a screen reader .
No Images Required
All of the shapes , colours and shadows in the starbursts above are created using CSS3 rules .
No images are used at all .
No JavaScript Required
The animations in these demos are made possible with the CSS3 transition rules .
No JavaScript is used to create any effects .
Resizable Text Compatible
All the dimensions of the starbursts are set in em measurements .
This means that you can increase the text size in your browser and the starburst will grow in size along with all other text .
This is great news for web accessibility .
Try out the CSS3 rotation property for yourself and see what you can come up with .
I 'm personally very excited by CSS3 because there are so many useful new properties , rotation is only one of them !

Twins manager Ron Gardenhire just announced that Jon Rauch will be the closer when the regular season begins on Monday in Anaheim .
He announced over the weekend that he would try a closer - by - committee approach , but it is not surprising that he opted for a more structured system .
Gardenhire pointed out that their bullpen has operated well when everyone knows their roles .
Rauch , 31 , has 26 career saves , including 17 with Washington in 2008 .
He 's not overpowering but should make up for that with mentality and demeanor .
`` You lose a closer and you have to ad lib a little bit , we all know that . ''
Gardenhire said .
`` The best thing is for us to get on our way here and this guy is our closer and we 'll go from there and see what happens . ''
Gardenhire said that Rauch is eager to prove he 's up for the challenge .
Matt Guerrier , Jose Mijares and Jesse Crain will serve as the main set up men , with Pat Neshek , Clay Condrey and Brian Duensing in the wings .
Gardy said his starters should get two or three at - bats before the reserves enter the game .
First baseman Brock Peterson is fired up .
``I want to be the first one to jack one ( homer ) in here , '' he said .

Call this a crash course in how federal agencies use the press to advance their own advocacy .
A memo leaked from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agency is has immigration reform activist groups up in arms , calling the government ’s plans to argue on behalf of its programs “ unbelievable ” and an “ an aggressive strategy for spin and deception . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The document details how the agency was to respond amid a host of planned protests against the so - called “ Secure Communities ” program .
It reveals that ICE targeted major media in eight cities where activists planned their rallies , securing space in publications like The Atlanta Journal Constitution , The Maimi Herald , The Washington Examiner and others .
“ On the day of the launch , ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton placed opinion - editorials in Atlanta , Georgia ; Miami , Florida ; and Morristown , New JerseyÃ¢â‚¬â€ all sites of the campaign , ” noted Uncover the Truth , a joint advocacy campaign set up by the Center for Constitutional Rights , the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and other non-governmental groups .
Additionally , it explains that the agency “ will arrange for [ Assistant Secretary ] Morton to be interviewed by Julia Preston from The New York Times , Suzanne Gamboa from the Associated Press , Antonieta CÃ ƒÂ¡diz from La Opinion and possibly Lori Montenegro from Telemundo . ”
“ ICEÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s unbelievable offensive against activists organizing for truth and accountability must be challenged , ” CCR attorney Sunita Patel said in a media advisory .
“ Rather than sticking to the promise of transparency , the Obama administration is hiding behind misinformation and attacking civil society .
The quest for answers is even more compelling and begs the question : what is ICE hiding ? ”

Hoping to obtain answers to just that question , the campaign has filed Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests for data related to the “ Security Communities ” program , which the agency says leverages technology to track down and capture what it calls “ criminal aliens . ”
In his editorial , Morton opened with a tale of a California man who ’d left Bible study , only to be run down by an illegal immigrant driving while intoxicated .
“ Since beginning the program in October 2008 , ICE has deployed the fingerprint technology to more than 165 jurisdictions across 20 states , ” he wrote .
“ We deploy to more places every week .
As a result , we have removed more than 33,000 aliens convicted of crimes Ã¢â‚¬â€ aliens who may have otherwise been released back onto our streets and into our neighborhoods .

“ As ICE expands this program nationwide , we meet regularly with local law enforcement agencies , national and local nongovernmental organizations , media and others to ensure the public understands that ICE is using this race - neutral program to identify and remove criminal aliens , thereby relieving the burden on state and local governments . ”
Morton was nominated to serve as ICE assistant secretary by President Obama on Feb. 23 , 2009 .
ADVERTISEMENT
A large part of the “ Secure Communities ” program is federal coordination of local law enforcement .
The leaked memo apparently reveals this coordination even applies to “ messaging , ” as it claims ICE would reach out to encourage press officers to speak with the media , going so far as to offer sound bytes and talking points .
“ It is deeply disturbing that ICE responded to our simple request for truth and accountability with an aggressive strategy for spin and deception , ” countered Sarahi Uribe , an organizer with Uncover the Truth .
“ At a time when its clear that the federal governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s irresponsibility gave rise to the crisis in Arizona , rights groups now feel under attack for demanding basic answers from our government . ”

It was revealed in Dec. 2009 that ICE maintains a network of unlisted immigrant detention centers across the United States , calling them “ subfield offices , ” where they hold an unknown number of people .
The Nation magazine placed the number of “ subfield offices ” at 186 , noting that the facilities have no beds or showers , are not subject to ICE Detention Standards and most are located “ in suburban office parks or commercial spaces revealing no information about their ICE tenants ” .
At least 100 immigrant prisoners have died while in ICE custody , according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union .
The following document is an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo detailing the agency ’s media strategy to counter activist citizen groups .

Fast alle Kinder lügen .
Wer sehr jung und überzeugend die Unwahrheit sagt , ist als Erwachsener im Beruf besonders erfolgreich .
Das sagen kanadische Forscher nach einer Studie mit 1200 Kindern .
" Du sollst nicht lügen " ist eine der Regeln , die Eltern ihren Kindern unbedingt vermitteln wollen .
In manchen Fällen amüsieren ( harmlose ) Schwindeleien die Familie , in manchen Fällen treibt das Beharren auf der Unwahrheit sie zur Weißglut .
Um wirklich überzeugend lügen zu können , benötigen Kinder die Fähigkeit , sich in eine andere Person hinein zu versetzen , deren Informationsstand abzuschätzen und zu ihrem eigenen Vorteil zu nutzen .
Lügen zu lernen ist ein zentraler Schritt in der Entwicklung eines Kindes .
Plausible Lügen , gute Auffassungsgabe
Normalerweise bilden Kinder diese Fähigkeit im Alter zwischen drei und fünf Jahren aus .
Nun haben Wissenschaftler herausgefunden , dass frühes Lügen Zeichen eines sich schnell entwickelnden Gehirns ist .
Wer mit zwei Jahren schon absichtlich die Unwahrheit sagt , hat als Erwachsener mehr Erfolg als andere .
Je plausibler die kindliche Lüge , desto besser ist auch die Auffassungsgabe in späteren Jahren , besagt die Studie der Toronto University .
" Eltern sollten nicht beunruhigt sein , wenn ihr Kinder schwindeln , " sagt der Studienleiter Dr. Kang Lee gegenüber der britischen Zeitung " Telegraph " .
" Fast alle Kinder lügen .
Die mit der besseren kognitiven Entwicklung lügen besser , weil sie ihre Spuren verwischen können .
Vielleicht werden sie im späteren Leben Banker . "
20 Prozent der Zweijährigen lügen
Dr. Lee und sein Team testete 1200 Kinder im Alter zwischen zwei und 16 Jahren .
Es stellte sich heraus , dass bei Kindern mit steigendem Alter auch die Bereitschaft zu lügen steigt .
Unter den Zweijährigen logen nur zwanzig Prozent .
Bei den Dreijährigen waren es bereits 50 und bei Vierjährigen 90 Prozent .
Mit dem Rücken zu einem Kuscheltier gesetzt , drehten sich etwa neun von zehn Kindern trotz ausdrücklichen Verbots nach diesem um , sobald sie allein im Raum waren .
Auch wenn das der Großteil im Anschluss leugnete , gelang es nur wenigen , die Lüge erfolgreich zu vertuschen .
Viele stolperten über die Frage , um welches Stofftier es sich wohl gehandelt habe .
Höhepunkt mit 12 Jahren
Am unehrlichsten sind Kinder der Studie zufolge im Alter von 12 Jahren .
Mit 16 Jahren hat die Bereitschaft zu lügen wieder stark abgenommen , nur noch 70 Prozent der Kandidaten logen .
Dafür lernen Jugendliche in diesem
Alter zu lügen , um ihrem Gegenüber Kummer zu ersparen .
Keinen Zusammenhang fanden die Forscher zwischen der kindlichen Bereitschaft zu Lügen und betrügerischem Verhalten .
Auch strenge oder religiöse Erziehung sollen keinen Einfluss haben .
Und wie sollen sich Eltern verhalten , wenn sie kleine Kinder beim Lügen erwischen ?
Jedenfalls nicht schreien und schimpfen , sagt Lee. Besser sei ein Gespräch über Ehrlichkeit und negative Folgen von Lügen .
Und : " Ab dem Alter von acht Jahren werden die Gelegenheiten dafür immer weniger . "

Irvine Renter at the Irvine Housing Blog writes : Bank of America to Increase Foreclosure Rate by 600 % in 2010
[ Irvine Renter ] attended a local Building Industry Association conference on Friday 26 March 2010 .
The west coast manager of real estate owned , Senior Vice President Ken Gaitan , stated that Bank of America , which currently forecloses on 7,500 homes a month nationally , will increase that number to 45,000 homes per month by December of 2010 .
After his surprising statement , two questioners from the audience asked questions to verify the numbers .
Bank of America is projecting a 600 % increase in its already large number of monthly foreclosures .
This is n't unsubstantiated rumor ; this comes straight from one of the most powerful men in Bank of America 's OREO department ( yes , that really is what they call it ) .
It appears they have too many properties already .
CR Note : I tried to verify these numbers with BofA without success .
Irvine Renter clarified this for me today .
Apparently Gaitan said that Bank of America anticipates the peak of foreclosure activity will occur in December 2010 and will top out at 45,000 units that month .
Apparently BofA believes foreclosure activity will trend down in 2011 .
According to Irvine Renter , Gaitan said BofA expects about 300,000 total foreclosures in 2010 .
That is a significant increase from the current 7,500 per month pace .
Once again , BofA 's media department told me they'd get back to me - but no word so far - so there numbers have not been verified .

The storm of news about the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has reached a relative lull today , as the oil company preps for its containment dome project that it will try to execute over the next several days .
With a moment to take a break from the constant news updates , reports are starting to ask :
What 's with all that chemical dispersant responders have been dumping on this spill ?
The stuff is called Corexit , made by the Nalco Company , and BP has now dumped about 160,000 gallons of it in the Gulf ( as well as pumping 6,000 gallons more all the way down to the leak location ) .
The dispersant particles bind to oil , sink , and are carried away by ocean currents .
But while that could help keep a spill from reaching the shores en masse , it means the oil is n't actually " cleaned up , " but rather diluted .
And the dispersant chemicals themselves can be dangerous , as Nalco 's own documents ( pdf ) show .
The 10 - page documents go into detail about compounds that must be handled with great care in their original form , that should not touch the skin and can damage lungs .
Although the documents state that the potential environmental hazard is “ moderate , ” they say that when used as directed at sea in the recommended amounts the potential environmental exposure is “ low ” [ The New York Times ] .
The company says Corexit contains no toxic metals or carcinogens .
But it has refused to divulge the full chemical composition , calling it proprietary information .
That 's annoyed environment groups that want to know exact what we 're putting into the sea in such mass quantity .
Still , with the number of options dwindling and oil continuing to gush into the Gulf , some of those groups have come to accept chemical dispersants as the lesser of two evils .
" It 's basically a giant experiment , " said Richard Charter , a senior policy adviser with Defenders of Wildlife .
" I 'm not saying we should n't do it ; we have no good options " [ AP ] .
Another eyebrow - raiser is the choice of chemical .
While the United States is familiar with Corexit from having used it previously , Wired.com reports that there are better alternatives on the market , like Dispersit .
Both Corexit and Dispersit were tested by the EPA , and according to those results , Corexit was 54.7 percent effective at breaking down crude oil from the Gulf , and Dispersit was 100 percent effective .
Not only did Corexit do a worse job of dispersing oil , but it was three times as lethal to silverfish – used as a benchmark organism in toxicity testing — and more than twice as lethal to shrimp , another benchmark organism and an important part of Gulf fisheries [ Wired.com ] .

Generators
The Scanning Problem
Here 's a very common programming problem :
Repeatedly collect items from an input stream into chunks , until the stream is empty .
For example , compilers for C and Pascal , and the Lisp reader , collect characters from the input stream to form tokens , where each token is either a name or number or punctuation element .
Another example is compress on page 37 of Graham 's ANSI Common Lisp .
This function collects items from a list into pairs of the form ( number element ) , indicating how often each item is repeated .
Ideally , we 'd like our code to break down into two pieces :
a function that collects some input elements and returns a chunk
a function that applies the chunking function to the input until the input is emptied
The key problem in defining these scanning functions is that the second function needs two values from the first function :
a token or chunk of some kind
the remainder of the input
Doing this cleanly , following the Cardinal Rule of Functions , takes some thought .
Approach 1 : Extra Parameters
Graham 's definition of compress defined a new function , compr , that took three arguments :
the element being scanned for
the current number of elements seen so far
the input list remaining
The second and third arguments hold the two values needed , and recursion was used to repeat the process until the list was emptied .
Unfortunately , the function compr is not very clear .
It has a terrible name , but it 's hard to give it a good name because it violates the Cardinal Rule of Functions and mixes several tasks together .
Approach 2 : Chunk then Trim
In this particular example , it turns out to not be too hard to use a scanning function that takes an object and a list and returns the length of the run of that element .
We 'll give a recursive definition of the scanning function here :
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( cond ( ( null l ) 0 ) ( ( not ( eql x ( first l ) ) ) 0 ) ( t ( 1+ ( get -run x ( rest l ) ) ) ) ) )
An iterative definition would be better here , because it would handle runs of any length without overflowing the function call stack .
Even better would be to take advantage of Common Lisp 's large library of sequence functions , e.g. ,
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( or ( position x l : test - not # 'eql ) ) ( length l ) ) )
Or , if you want to avoid the " deprecated " : test - not feature :
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( or ( position x l : test ( complement # 'eql ) ) ( length l ) ) )
compress can then be defined as a repeated call to get - run :
( defun compress ( l ) ( cond ( ( null l ) nil ) ( t ( let ( ( run ( 1+ ( get -run ( first l ) ( rest l ) ) ) ) ) ( cons ( list run ( first l ) ) ( compress ( nthcdr run l ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Unfortunately , this version of compress is still a little messy .
More importantly , it does n't generalize well .
After get - run scans the list , it returns how many items it found .
This number is then used to trim the list .
It works because it 's easy and relatively cheap to use the run-length to trim off the items used so far , but this is n't always the case , plus it leads to the messy nesting .
Approach 3 : Generators
Because chunking streams is a common problem , we could go for a general solution and define some functions that capture the procedural flow underlying the general solution to this kind of problem .
Note .
generators.lisp contains everything given below , except for the compression - specific functions , plus a few extras .
First , we define a new concept , a generator .
A generator is a function that you call to get elements from some source .
That source can be an input stream , a list of elements , an incrementing counter , whatever .
A generator takes one argument :
If the argument is : get , the current generator element is returned , if any .
, the current generator element is returned , if any .
If that argument is : test , then nil is returned if there is no current element .
, then is returned if there is no current element .
If that argument is : next , the current element is advanced to the next one , if any , and the previous current element is returned .
( Odd as the last rule may seem , it tends to be the most useful of the obvious options , just as i++ is more commonly used than ++i in C and C ++. )
We can define generators using closures .
We can do this on as needed basis , but a couple of generator - creating functions are particularly useful and easy to define .
For example , make - number - gen makes generators that generate numbers from M to N .
If no N is given , the generator never runs out , i.e , never returns nil to : test .
( defun make - number - gen ( m &optional n ) # '( lambda ( cmd ) ( ecase cmd ( : test ( and ( numberp n ) (> m n ) ) ) ( : get m ) ( : next ( prog1 m ( unless ( and ( numberp n ) (> m n ) ) ( incf m ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Note the use of prog1 to save and return the old value of m .
The function make - list - gen makes generators that generate elements from a list , from left to right .
( defun make - list - gen ( l ) # '( lambda ( cmd ) ( ecase cmd ( : test ( null l ) ) ( : get ( car l ) ) ( : next ( pop l ) ) ) ) )
We could define more generator - making functions , but now let 's define three simple functions that will make code using generators more readable , and less dependent on how they 're implemented .
( defun empty - gen -p ( gen ) ( funcall gen : test ) ) ( defun gen-elt ( gen ) ( funcall gen : get ) ) ( defun advance - gen ( gen ) ( funcall gen : next ) )
A good example of a generator - using function , and a handy one for testing generators , is extrude .
( extrude n gen ) returns a list of the first N elements generated by the generator gen .
( defun extrude ( n gen ) ( do ( (l nil ( cons ( advance - gen gen ) l ) ) ( i 0 ( 1+ i ) ) ) ( ( or ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( >= i n ) ) ( nreverse l ) ) ) )
Here are some examples :
? ( extrude 5 ( make- number-gen 3 ) ) ( 3 4 5 6 7 ) ? ( extrude 5 ( make- number-gen 3 6 ) ) ( 3 4 5 ) ?
( extrude 5 ( make - list - gen '( a b c d e f ) ) ) ( A B C D E ) ? ( extrude 5 ( make - list - gen '( a b c ) ) ) ( A B C )
Now , with all this background out of the way , here is how we would use generators for our compression problem .
First , we define get - run .
It keeps calling the generator until an element different than the given element is returned .
It returns the pair ( number elt ) indicating how many occurrences of the element it saw , counting the given one .
( defun get - run ( elt gen ) ( do ( (n 1 ( 1+ n ) ) ) ( ( or ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( not ( eql elt ( gen-elt gen ) ) ) ) ( list n elt ) ) ( advance - gen gen ) ) )
Finally , compress just calls get - run until the generator is exhausted .
( defun compress ( l ) ( let ( ( gen ( make - list - gen l ) ) ) ( do ( ( run -pairs nil ( cons ( get -run ( advance - gen gen ) gen ) run-pairs ) ) ) ( ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( nreverse run-pairs ) ) ) ) )
Background
Generators have a long history in Lisp and other functional programming languages .
The Common Lisp standard defines a particularly sophisticated set of series , generators and gatherers .
See Common Lisp The Language , 2nd edition , by Guy L. Steele Jr. , Appendices A and B ( Digital Press , 1990 ) .
In Scheme , they 're called streams .
See Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs , Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman , Section 3.4 ( MIT Press , 1985 )
C++ has the same thing , only they call them iterators .
Mitchell Model explains quite nicely why C++ iterators are really not iterators , and why real iterators would be hard to do in C ++.
See Data Structures , Data Abstraction : A Contemporary Introduction Using C++ , Mitchell L. Model , p. 57 and Appendix C ( Prentice - Hall , 1994 ) .
