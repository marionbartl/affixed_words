The rooting of the Tree of Life , and the relationships of the major lineages , are controversial .
The monophyly of Archaea is uncertain , and recent evidence for ancient lateral transfers of genes indicates that a highly complex model is needed to adequately represent the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of Life .
We hope to provide a comprehensive discussion of these issues on this page soon .
For the time being , please refer to the papers listed in the References section .
Two alternative views on the relationship of the major lineages ( omitting viruses ) are shown below

I recently started learning Scala because of its Actor Framework .
Over the last few weeks , I 've been working my way through the Programming in Scala book .
Having done that , I figured I 'd test myself out using some of Steve Yegge 's Phone Screen Questions .
I 've had the opportunity to be on both sides of the interview table / phone with Steve 's strategy , and both as interviewee and interviewer , I think the approach works much better than the others I have encountered / tried .
I 've adapted the strategy somewhat for my own purposes .
One , I hardly do any phone screens - almost all the interviews I 've done over the past couple of years have been face - to - face .
Two , I usually cover 3 areas instead of the 5 Steve advocates - our interviews last about 45 minutes , and 10 - 15 minutes per question leaves just enough time to answer questions that the candidate may have about us .
To get maximum coverage , a few colleagues ( who also follow this strategy ) and I usually split up the areas amongst ourselves prior to the interview .
In any case , I 've noticed that reading a programming language tutorial usually leaves me with just enough knowledge to read code in that language .
Writing some code is the only way I actually get to a point where I can program in that language .
So if you are like me , reading this post will probably not do you much good - except perhaps to notice the many similarities to Java .
However , if you are one of the lucky few who are able to absorb a language by reading code , then this post contains some simple Scala code to implement the coding questions in Steve 's page referenced above .
On the other hand , if you are an experienced Scala programmer , I am guessing that much of this code would look very primitive and / or Java - like to you .
In that case , I would appreciate your feedback and hints / pointers on better ways to do things in Scala .
Maven Project Setup
The lift Project ( a Scala web framework ) provides a Maven2 archetype for basic Scala projects , so that you get all the Maven2 goodness and its associated productivity boost for free in your Scala project .
To create a basic Scala project , run the command :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 sujit@sirocco :~$ mvn archetype:create \ - DarchetypeGroupId=org.scala-tools.archetypes \ - DarchetypeArtifactId=scala-archetype-simple \ - DarchetypeVersion=1.2 \ - DremoteRepositories=http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases
\ - DgroupId=com.mycompany.smi \ - DartifactId=scala- examples
Update the scala.version property in the generated POM to suit your setup ( I am using Scala 2.7.3 ) .
I started out using the Scala Eclipse plugin , so I did mvn eclipse : eclipse to generate my Eclipse IDE descriptors .
Then follow instructions on the plugin page to configure the plugin in your IDE .
However , ( at least in my case , I was using Eclipse 3.4.1 / MyEclipse 7 / Scala 2.7.3 with the plugin available from the update site ) , the Eclipse plugin was so bad as to be almost unusable .
There was no code - suggest , editors would freeze and would need to be closed and reopened , etc .
I ended up using Netbeans Scala plugin ( with Netbeans 6.5 ) , and it is sooo much better .
Netbeans also recognizes a Maven project natively , so no descriptors need to be generated .
My only gripe with Netbeans is its tendency to randomly freeze up for 30 - 40s at a time , something I 've never seen with Eclipse .
Anyway , here are Steve 's questions ( and some of my own ) and my Scala solutions below .
Reverse a String
This is actually one of my favorites .
But the nice thing about this one is that it is extendable in so many interesting ways .
Here are some of mine .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 // Source : src/main/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/StringReverser.scala package com .
mycompany .
smi . coding object StringReverser { // calling the method on String directly def reverse1 ( s : String ) : String = { s . reverse } // iterating backward through the string def reverse2 ( s : String ) : String = { val buf = new StringBuilder val len = s .
length for ( i <- 0 until len ) { buf .
append ( s . charAt ( len - i - 1 ) ) } buf .
toString } // recursively def reverse3 ( s : String ) : String = { val len = s . length if ( len == 1 ) { s } else { reverse3 ( s . substring ( 1 , len ) ) + s . charAt ( 0 ) } } // recursively , another one def reverse4 ( s : String ) : String = { val len = s .
length if ( len == 1 ) { s } else { s . substring ( len - 1 , len ) + reverse4 ( s . substring ( 0 , len - 1 ) ) } } }
The rather long and verbose class ( and object ) names in my post is in keeping with Steve 's post about Java being the Kingdom of Nouns , and because I guess I 've worked too long with Spring :-) .
The first answer is correct , but probably not quite what most interviewers are looking for .
The second one is usually what I get from a majority of people , with minor variations ( I like reading the string backwards when I do this in Java , for one ) .
The third and fourth versions are almost always the result of asking if there are other ways to do the same thing .
Here is the JUnit test harness to run this code .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // Source : src/test/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/StringReverserTest.scala package com .

smi . coding import org.junit._ import org.junit.Assert._
@ Test class StringReverserTest { @ Test def testReverse1 ( ) = { assertEquals ( " madA m ' I madaM " , StringReverser .
reverse1 ( " Madam I 'm Adam " ) ) } @ Test def testReverse2 ( ) = { assertEquals ( " madA m ' I madaM " , StringReverser .
reverse2 ( " Madam I 'm Adam " ) ) } @ Test def testReverse3 ( ) = { assertEquals ( " madA m ' I madaM " , StringReverser .
reverse3 ( " Madam I 'm Adam " ) ) } @ Test def testReverse4 ( ) = { assertEquals ( " madA m ' I madaM " , StringReverser .
reverse4 ( " Madam I 'm Adam " ) ) } }
Compute the n-th Fibonacci Number
The objective here is to compute the n-th Fibonacci number , where n is provided in the target method 's parameter list .
I provide two versions of a Fibonacci Number generator below .
The recursive version is more intuitive , although someone may ask you do this using iteration , so its probably good to know .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 // Source : src/main/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/FibonacciGenerator.scala package com .
mycompany .
smi .
coding object FibonacciGenerator { // iterative version def generate1 ( n : Int ) :
Int = { if ( n < 0 ) { throw new IllegalArgumentException ( " Invalid Argument , n must be >= 0 " ) } if ( n == 0 ) 0 else if ( n == 1 ) 1 else { var prev2 = 0 var prev1 = 1 var sum = 0 for ( i <- 2 to n ) { sum = prev1 + prev2 prev2 = prev1 prev1 = sum } sum } } // recursive version def generate2 ( n : Int ) :
Int = { if ( n == 0 ) 0 else if ( n == 1 ) 1 else { generate2 ( n - 2 ) + generate2 ( n - 1 ) } } }
Notice that you are calling the same function with the same argument twice multiple times in the recursive version , so caching the results of the calls may result in some improvement in the algorithm .
The JUnit test harness is shown below :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // Source : src/test/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/FibonacciGeneratorTest.scala package com .

smi . coding import org.junit._ import org.junit.
Assert._ class FibonacciGeneratorTest { val first8 Fibs = List [ Int ] ( 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ) @ Test def testGenerate1 ( ) = { var results =
List [ Int ] ( ) for ( i <- 0 until 8 ) { results += FibonacciGenerator .
generate1 ( i ) } assertEquals ( results , first8 Fibs ) } @ Test def testGenerate2 ( ) = { var results =
List [ Int ] ( ) for ( i <- 0 until 8 ) { results += FibonacciGenerator .
generate2 ( i ) } assertEquals ( results , first8 Fibs ) } }
Print Multiplication Table of 12
The objective here is to print multiplication tables uptil the number provided .
There are 4 implementations provided .
The first three do exactly what is asked , in slightly different ways , and that is a good thing .
The last one actually introduces complexity without any gain , and that was me pandering to the CS person in me , and hopefully I will not get my head cut off for it :-) .
Actually , I wanted to play with classes , and populating and printing a 2 dimensional array seemed to be a good idea to be able to do that .

Sum up Integers from Text File
The objective here is to read a text file of numbers , one number to a line , and print out the sum of these numbers .
There are two implementations of this solution , the first one does it the Java way ( with looping ) , and the second one does it the Scala way ( with a foreach over a List .
I also have a method to return an Iterator of lines given a file name ( which is reused in some related questions , see below ) .

" ) { s . substring ( 0 , s . length - 2 ) } else { s } } catch { case ex : StringIndexOutOfBoundsException => s } } ... }
One thing to note that you should not call any of your application packages java or scala .
Because of the way Scala namespaces work , IDEs ( and possibly the scala compiler ) will get confused about which namespace you are importing from .
I initially had com.mycompany .scala as part of my package name , but changed it to com.mycompany.smi in response to the problem described above .
Here are a couple of my own questions .
I try and ask different questions from whats on Steve 's list , just because , although I am guessing someone who reads
Steve 's post is probably capable of solving problems of similar complexity .
Compute Word Frequency from Text File
The objective here is to find the word frequency for a given file full of words .
The output is a Map of words and their frequencies .
As before , the first implementation is in the Java style , and the second one is in the Scala style .
The second implementation uses two nested generators with a predicate on the second generator .
These two functions are part of the same FileOperator object for the last question .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 // Source : src/main/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/FileOperator.scala // ( cont'd ) ... object FileOperator { ... def computeWordFrequencyMap1 ( file : String ) : Map [ String , Int ] = { var wordcounts =
Map .
empty [ String , Int ] for ( line <- lines ( file ) ) { val words = line .
split ( " [ , ;.!?-]+ " ) for ( word <- words ) { if ( word .
trim .
length >
0 ) { addWord ( chomp ( word ) , wordcounts ) } } } wordcounts } // multiple generators version def computeWordFrequencyMap2 ( file : String ) : Map [ String , Int ] = { var wordcounts =
Map .
empty [ String , Int ] for ( line <- lines ( file ) ; word <- line .
split ( " [ , ;.!? ] + " ) if ( word .
trim .
length > 0 ) ) { addWord ( chomp ( word ) , wordcounts ) } wordcounts } // refactored out to make the second version easier to write def addWord ( word : String , map : Map [ String , Int ] ) : Unit = { val origCount = if ( map .
contains ( word ) ) map ( word ) else 0 map + ( word -> ( origCount + 1 ) ) } ... }
Sort a Map [ String , Int ] by Value
Now that we have a Map of word frequencies , we want to know the highest occuring words , so that involves sorting the Map by its value .
The code below uses a Scala style comparator function in the keys . sort ( ) call .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // Source : src/main/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/FileOperator.scala // ( cont'd ) ... object FileOperator { ... def sortByValue ( unsorted : Map [ String , Int ] ) : Map [ String , Int ] = { val sorted Map = new LinkedHashMap [ String , Int ] ( ) val keys = unsorted .
keys .
toList // sort in descending order of value val sortedKeys = keys .
sort ( ( a , b ) => { unsorted ( a ) > unsorted ( b ) } ) sortedKeys .
foreach ( key => sorted Map + ( key -> ( unsorted ( key ) ) ) ) sorted Map } }
The JUnit test for the last 3 questions ( in FileOperator ) are shown below .
It uses two test data files , test1.txt , which contains integers , one per line , and test2.txt , which contains free form text spread across multiple lines .

sortByValue ( FileOperator .
computeWordFrequencyMap2 ( " src/test/resources/test2.txt " ) ) println ( sorted Map ) } }
Print out Odd Numbers from 1-99
The objective is pretty clear from the heading .
The next 3 questions have single implementations each , mostly focusing on ( what I believe are ) the Scala way of doing things .
They are all contained in a single file Misc.scala , relevant portions of which are split up among the next three sections .

Find largest int value in an int array
Given an int array ( our method actually populates it first using java.util .
Random ) , find the maximum value in the array .

nextInt ( n ) } println ( " >> input : " + arr .
toList ) // find max in list var max = 0 arr .
foreach ( elem => if ( max < elem ) max = elem else max = max ) max } ... }
Format RGB value as a 6 digit Hex String
The objective here is to return a hexadecimal RGB string given three bytes representing the R , G , and B portions of a color .
The approach here is not Scala specific , a Java version of this would probably look quite similar .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // Source : src/main/scala/com/mycompany/smi/coding/Misc.scala ... object Misc { ... def toHexString ( r : Byte , g : Byte , b : Byte ) : String = { val rgb = ( r << 16 ) + ( g << 8 ) + b " 0 x " + StringUtils .
leftPad ( Integer .
toHexString ( rgb ) , 6 , ' 0 ' ) } }
And here is the JUnit test for the 3 methods described above .

toHexString ( 0x11 , 0x00 , 0x11 ) ) } }
My take after going this far with Scala is that for an average Java programmer such as myself , learning to use Scala seems to be fairly simple .
The map , foreach , etc. methods seem intuitive , but hard to grasp and to apply correctly at first , but become easier with repeated usage .
There are also some aspects , such as discussions on currying , covariance , contravariance , etc , that I have n't fully gotten as yet , but hopefully they will also be understandable as I work more with Scala .
With Macworld just around the corner , people are still clamoring and fretting over the fact that Steve Jobs wo n't be delivering the keynote .
Lost in the shuffle , however , is the fact that Apple ( via Phil Schiller ) will most likely deliver some interesting announcements to its product line .
While there wo n't be a bombshell announcement that 'll catch everyone off - guard like the iPhone did in 2007 , it 's important to remember that a product like the iPhone does n't come around every year , or even every 5 years .
That said , here 's a look at some of the more popular rumors floating around regarding what Apple might have up its sleeve come Tuesday .
1. 32 GB iPhone
One of the older Macworld 2009 rumors has Apple announcing the availability of a 32 GB iPhone .
Currently , the largest capacity iPhone you can purchase is 16 GB , and as users become more accustomed to downloading media and applications to their devices , increased capacity is a must and a given .
Users , however , can already purchase a 32 GB iPod Touch , so why has Apple been slow to release the same for the iPhone ?
The answer , not surprisingly , is due to the fact that the iPhone has less room for flash chips due to the fact that it also contains some important parts necessary to , surprise surprise , make phone calls !
In other words , the iPhone currently has less physical space within the device itself .
So , while theiPod Touch currently has two 16 GB flash chips inside , the iPhone only has room for 1 .
Recent reports , however , suggest that single 32 GB flash chips might soon become available .
So while a 32 GB iPhone is inevitable , whether or not it will be announced atMacworld is something we 'll soon find out .
2. Snow Leopard
This is about as close to a sure thing as you 're gonna get when making predictions about Macworld .
It 's pretty much guaranteed that Phil Schiller will spend a considerable amount of time talking about , and potentially demo-ing , the features we can expect to see in Snow Leopard .
But do n't jump out of your seats just yet .
As opposed to Mac OS upgrades of the past such as Tiger and Leopard , this upgrade wo n't feature many " bells and whistles " , and will instead focus on ' under the hood ' enhancements such as improving system performance and efficiency .
Some of the features users can look forward to in Snow Leopard include :
A new Finder completely re-written in Cocoa
Microsoft Exchange Support right out of the box
64 bit support
Quicktime X , a platform that Apple promises will " advance modern media and Internet standards "
3. New MacMini's will be announced
This is another rumor you can probably bet on coming true .
Despite numerous reports suggesting that Apple was killing the MacMini , Apple is poised to announce significant enhancements to the oft - neglected device .
In addition to the standard spec upgrades , expect to see new MacMini 's featuring a new Mini DisplayPort , and the ability to hold more RAM .
Current MacMini's max out at 2GB , but new versions are expected to support up to 4GB of RAM .
There are also rumors floating around stating that the MacMini will have a new case design that more closely resembles the black and aluminum styled iMac .
4. iPhone Nano
While analysts have repeatedly said that Apple needs to come out with a varied lineup of iPhones in order to be successful , iPhone 3G sales have proven otherwise .
Nevertheless , rumors abound of an iPhone Nano with a smaller form factor , and case makers have already released pictures of cases for this yet - to - be - announced iPhone .
Is there something to this ?
I doubt it .
The whole appeal of the iPhone is it 's large screen that allows users to comfortably browse the web , watch movies , and use applications .
An iPhone with a smaller screen not only takes away those benefits , but introduces new challenges such as typing on an even smaller screen .
More importantly , Steve Jobs has touted the iPhone as being a more attractive platform for developers precisely because they only need to code for one device .
It therefore seems extremely unlikely that Apple will announce a smaller form factor iPhone .
There 's no telling what Apple might do in the future , but the app store is still relatively new , and we 've only seen the tip of the iceberg as to how its functionality can be extended via third party apps .
It makes more sense for Apple to continue to foster app store expansion and iPhone sales , as opposed to selling cheaper ( and thus lower margin ) iPhone Nanos .
5. New iMacs
An announcement of upgraded iMacs is more likely than not .
Aside from the standard speed bumps , expect to see new iMacs equipped with NVIDIA chips , and there have also been some rumors about new quad - core iMacs as well .
If true , this should be a welcome power boost for the entire iMac line .
6. Unibody and 17 inch MacBook Pro with irreplaceable battery
Seth Weintraub over at Computerworld recently reported that Apple is poised to make some interesting changes to its MacBook Pro line .
Specifically , he reports that the new MacBook Pro 17 inch models will sport much longer battery life , and ( gasp ! ) will not have a replaceable battery , much like the MacBook Air .
Obviously , anyone buying a 17 inch MacBook Pro is going to be burning up some considerable horsepower , and you'd think that they , more than any other type of user , would need the ability to swap out batteries when doing work out in the field .
If the new batteries , however , last significantly longer than what is currently available , it might all be a wash .
7. iWork and iMovie moving up to the cloud
While definitely possible , we 'll have to wait until Tuesday to see just how exciting the web - based options of iWork and iMovie might potentially be .
With respect to iMovie , however , I would n't expect anything too crazy .
Editing huge chunks of video up in the cloud seems extremely inefficient .
Expect iMovie to remain mostly cloud - less , with perhaps the potential for some rudimentary cloud editing capabilities .
As Macworld steadily approaches , the rumors about what Apple is going to announce will get increasingly absurd .
In other words , do n't hold your breath for a tablet , blu-ray , or a surprise appearance by either Steve Jobs or Mark Papermaster .

Naomi Wolf : Power Feminist or Victim Feminist ?
March 24 , 2004
by Robert L. Campbell
Part I : Power Feminist or Victim Feminist ?
Some feminists , in today 's world , believe that women have the same rights as men ; that this equality of rights is getting close to being consistently recognized in countries like the United States ; and that further feminist efforts , in this part of the world , should be narrowly targeted at those remaining areas where the legal and political systems privilege men over women .
They would also show concern about privileges granted to women over men , or cases in which the rights of both are violated .
Such views are characteristic of individualist feminism .
Others who call themselves feminists maintain that men are the oppressor class ; women are the victim class ; and women are consequently entitled to take over the oppressor role , at least for the next few thousand years .
Such views are characteristic of collectivist feminism .
Adequate sensitivity to feminist concerns would at the very least require attention to these differences .
Individualist feminists and collectivist feminists both seek a change in " power relations , " but from a libertarian standpoint , what kind of change they are aiming at makes all the difference in the world .
Which brings us back to Gus diZerega 's assertion that Naomi Wolf is a liberal feminist whose recent actions libertarians are either wrong to criticize , or to waste their time on ( I 'm still not sure which ) .
More specifically and less ambiguously , it brings us to Roderick Long 's multi-round defense of her article in New York magazine .
For a little over a decade , Wolf has presented herself to the public as a " power feminist . "
Her book Fire with Fire ( published in 1993 , all page references to the hardcover edition ) was intended to be a power - feminist manifesto .
While it makes concessions to individuality , Fire with Fire presents women as one great big interest group that should n't be shy about amassing political power and voting itself benefits from the public treasury .
" ' Feminism ' should mean , on an overarching level , nothing more than women 's willingness to act politically to get what they determine that they need " ( p. 59 ) .
Elsewhere she boils power feminism down to " More for women " ( p. 138 ) .
Wolf shows impatience with groupthink among movement feminists , but I take it to be largely directed against conformist attitudes that stand in the way of grabbing up those " power units . "
Underlyingly , she agrees with the establishment figures that women constitute a collective , in need of representation as such .
So there are reasons for libertarians to worry about the particular laws and policies that Wolf believes will flow from the " power " side of feminism .
But most of these can be held for another discussion .
More to the point here , Naomi Wolf expressly proclaimed that the days of " victim feminism " are past .
" Victim feminism is when a woman seeks power through an identity of powerlessness .
Victim feminism ... is what all of us do whenever we retreat into appealing for status on the basis of feminine specialness instead of human worth , and fight underhandedly rather than honorably " ( p. 135 ) .
In Fire with Fire , Wolf provides a checklist of power - feminist and victim - feminist attributes ( e.g. , power feminists are tolerant of other women 's choices regarding sexuality and appearance ; victim feminists are " judgmental , " even puritanical about them ) .
She cheers on women who buy guns , and excoriates feminists who gave their support to Jean Harris ( who murdered her cheating boyfriend ) or Hedda Nussbaum ( who stood by and let her husband beat their adopted daughter to death , when he was n't beating her ) .
She proclaims that women can be just as aggressive , nasty , or power - mad as men .
And as Wolf 's own account makes clear , victim feminism is n't a list of articles of belief .
It is a kit of tools , moves , and poses that can be used , instrumentally or opportunistically , by women who do not subscribe to any justificatory doctrines of female moral superiority and male moral inferiority , or female passivity and male aggression , or unabated patriarchal domination of American women in every walk of life , in 1993 or 2004 .
Wolf has told us she does n't believe the justifications .
Unfortunately , she has n't set down the tools .
Her New York magazine article leaves little doubt about her willingness to play the victim role , so she can seek power through powerlessness .
Let 's begin with the way that Wolf describes her life as an undergraduate at Yale : " I also knew that there was an atmosphere at Yale in which female students were expected to be sociable with male professors .
I had discussed with my friends the pressure to be charming but still seen as serious . "
In speeches that she gave for several years , referring to an unnamed male professor 's crude move on her : " I describe what the transgression did to me -- devastated my sense of being valuable to Yale as a student , rather than as a pawn of powerful men . "
Is n't she telling the reader that she saw herself as a pawn , well before Harold Bloom , drunk on Amontillado , supposedly pushed his face too close to hers , issued an oracularly loopy come-on , and put his hand on her thigh ?
Her description of the man deserves quoting at length : Harold Bloom was one of Yale 's most illustrious professors .
Most of my friends in the Literature department were his acolytes , clustering around him at office hours for his bon mots about Pater and Wilde .
He called students , male and female both , " my dear " and " my child . "
Beautiful , brilliant students surrounded him .
He was a vortex of power and intellectual charisma .
I , personally , was at once drawn to him intellectually and slightly scared of him .
I had audited a famous course he taught , and he had reached out to me then and invited me to talk with him .
Since he was so intellectually selective , I was " sick with excitement " at the prospect ...
His aura was compelling -- and intimidating .
Is this how a 19 - year - old student typically feels about a professor ?
And when an undergraduate harbors such feelings , does anyone believe the attraction is purely intellectual ?
Around that same age , I worked with people who were on the outer edge of the Ayn Rand cult ; I exhibited more than a few " Randroid " tendencies of my own .
Yet I could not have kept a straight face , had I heard someone describe Rand that way .
As a grad student , I had a crush on a female professor for a time .
Needless to say , I thought she was really smart , as well as truly hot , but ... " a vortex of power and intellectual charisma " ?
Reading
Wolf 's narrative , you 'd think that questioning authority was an idea that had never entered her mind .
Yes , I know it was 1983 , and Ronald Reagan was in the White House .
But did n't Naomi
Wolf entertain an occasional thought that the " powerful men " who taught her put their pants on one leg at a time ?
It may also be that in Lit Crit the big names are especially likely to attract groupies , though that is not sufficient to explain why Wolf would want to become one .
Whatever the basis for her attitude , she writes as though she worshipped Harold Bloom as a god and was intoxicated by his authority .
How far would she go , to get this superior being 's attention ?
Could " the pressure to be seen as charming " have been internally generated ?
Part II : Playing the Victim Role while Denying It It 's time for an inventory of what happened , assuming that Naomi Wolf 's story is semi-accurate .
A 19 - year - old female student has deified a male professor .
She has gone to great lengths to attract his attention .
Despite her intelligence and her self - proclaimed expertise at handling men ( an unwanted hand on the thigh is no big deal , she insists ) , she has let him invite himself to a candlelight dinner at her place .
She has gotten drunk with him .
She is so drunk , and so grossed out to discover that the deity is an ugly , out - of - shape , 53 - year - old man who finds her body of much more pressing interest than her poetry , that she vomits on the spot .
( In her first published account of the incident , in which Bloom was given another name , she declared that her poetry manuscript was " the most important gift I had ever given any man . " )
Witnessing her reaction , the ( former ? ) deity remarks that she is a " deeply troubled girl , " and hastily departs .
( Wolf has actually told her story twice in print now , and the versions do n't fully agree .
According to Rachel Donadio's New York Observer article , Wolf first published an account in her 1997 memoir , Promiscuities .
There she invited Bloom , who was given a made - up name and specialty , to her apartment to dine alone with her .
The 1997 version also credited the quantity of Amontillado that Wolf had knocked back as a partial explanation of her vomiting .
The 2004 version ascribes the vomiting entirely to the sheer horror of Bloom leaning close to her face and putting his hand on her thigh . )
From this encounter , Wolf might have learned that Bloom was not a god , that he was capable of acting like a fool , that his approval was not worth the cost to her self - respect , and that she could live a fulfilled life without being sponsored and validated by a " powerful man . "
Or she might have seen her failure to be validated as an irretrievable loss , irrefutable proof that she was unworthy of the deity 's beneficence .
She writes as though Bloom had delivered irrefutable proof .
Yet Roderick Long insists the incident did no real damage to her self - esteem : " Wolf says nothing of the kind . "
I believe this is something of the kind : " the encroachment , the transgression ... had effects that went deep . "
As is this : " What it set off was a moral crisis , shaking my confidence in the institution that I was in . "
And this : " I was spiraling downward : I had gotten a C- , a D , and an F , and was put on academic probation .
My confidence shaken , I failed in my effort to win the Rhodes Scholarship at the end of the term . "
( Incidentally , here is one part of Wolf 's story that fails to ring true .
Even at an Ivy League institution , Rhodes Scholarships go only to the hoitiest of the toitiest , among those who envision themselves as future world - shapers .
How could Wolf have won a Rhodes Scholarship , even on a second try , if her course grades had truly gone so far into the tank ? )
Continuing , from her former roommate : " You were really nervous ; you were anxious for the rest of the semester . "
And finally : " Once you have been sexually encroached upon by a professor , your faith in your work corrodes . "
Wolf insisted to Rachel Donadio that she never wrote another poem after the incident .
When Donadio asked her to explain why , she burst into tears ; she resumed the interview a few minutes later , without answering the question .
Picking up again with Donadio , she exclaimed , " Professor Bloom is not a bad guy !
He 's a good guy in many ways !
...
One stupid action should n't demonize someone or victimize someone .
... I 've talked to many people who have glowing things to say about him and whom he 'd mentored .
I wish I could have been mentored by him . "
It is also true that in the New York magazine article , Wolf denies presenting herself as a victim : " I was not traumatized personally , but my educational experience was corrupted . "
In light of the foregoing , her denial has no credibility .
As Zoe Williams wrote in The Guardian , " it really is debeateable whether or not some drunk bloke putting his face quite near yours and his hand on your thigh , when you thought he'd come round to read poetry , undermines your value to an entire institution .
In the barometer that runs from ' misunderstanding ' to ' act of violence ' , it leans irrefutably towards the former . "
On rereading her New York magazine article , I was struck by how often Wolf would say something , then explicitly deny the plain intent of her own words .
Readers need to be attentive to what Wolf is actually saying , and disinclined to credit what she says she is saying .
She talks of pestering Richard Brodhead , the Dean of Yale College , to take some kind of action against Harold Bloom .
Brodhead says there have been no complaints against Bloom during the 11 years that he 's been in office , and he is n't going to admonish a professor on the basis of unsubstantiated charges now 20 years old .
Wolf talks as though punishing Harold Bloom is not the point , then says , " His harmful impulse would not have entered his or my real life -- then or now -- if Yale made the consequences of such behavior both clear and real . "
I.e. , he should have been punished , or faced the threat of punishment .
She focuses on the dreadful thing that was done to her , and her heavy - hearted decision not to complain to anyone in authority about it .
Then she insists that she spent nine months phoning and emailing a bunch of Yale administrators , threatening to publish Bloom 's name , and finally delivering on her threat -- all for the sake of other women .
To get the other women 's cases into the article , she had to splice together alleged offenses that range from a male professor putting his hand on a female student 's leg when she sat next to him at a local bar and making a snarky remark when she got up and left her seat , to a professor drugging and raping a grad student .
In Fire with Fire , she not only rejected the idea of a simple continuum from unwanted propositions to rape , but went so far as to note that some women have called an awful sexual experience rape when they had obviously consented to it .
In those days , she would have emphatically rejected tossing the other women 's cases into the same basket :
It is absolutely true that all sexual harassment lies on a spectrum , but let us not take the opportunity granted by the new attention given these issues to collapse that spectrum .
Taking harassment and date rape seriously means demarcating the inappropriate from the criminal .
( 1993 , p. 193 ) .
This ought to make the reader wonder what the other women 's function might be , except to make it look as though she is getting back at Yale University for maintaining inadequate grievance procedures , not at Harold Bloom for putting a crude move on her .
To anyone who thinks I am being too harsh , I suggest a close reading of the last 7 paragraphs of Wolf 's article .
What is she recommending be done about " sexual transgression in school and work " ?
What could she mean when she says it should be handled as a " civil rights " issue ?
( Federal law already classifies sexual harassment as a form of discrimination against women . )
Does she really believe that Yale University has handled sexual transgressions against female students as badly as the Catholic Church has handled priests molesting boys ?
For that matter , does she really believe that " no one harasses upward in a hierarchy " ?
( Sexual - harassment experts like to say that a male student who makes sexual comments about a female professor is engaging in " contrapower harassment . " )
Anyone who can extract a consistent proposal for reform out of these paragraphs will relieve me of my muddle by explaining what it is .
In the meantime , I think I am on safe ground concluding that changing the way universities do their business was not the motivating force behind Wolf 's essay .
Part III : To Grieve or Not to Grieve ?
Harold Bloom does n't get off the hook , just because Naomi Wolf has the bad faith to bring out the old victimological ploys while denying that what she is up to .
Assuming that things went roughly as she recounted them , Harold Bloom did do something wrong .
He did n't just get drunk and put a crude move on a student whose work he was grading , he blew off his basic responsibilities as an instructor .
A professor who takes on a student for an independent study course is expected to give the student assignments , to track progress on them , and to meet with the student weekly .
It is n't clear from Wolf 's account whether he met with her in his office once or twice , or never bothered to at all .
But soon enough , if she is telling the truth , he was dodging meetings with her .
There was only the fateful dinner , and afterward , no further contact -- she says her poems went into his box in the department mailroom , and his final grade report was mailed to her .
Simply for failing to hold up his end of an independent study course , Bloom deserved to get chewed out by his department chair .
( Unless , of course , Bloom had been extended the privilege of enrolling students in independent study courses without having to meet with them .
In that case , his department and the upper administration needed to review the wisdom of keeping such a prima donna on the payroll . )
Wolf had multiple opportunities to seek justice , or at least some acknowledgment of wrongdoing .
She says she was too scared to try any of them .
She was convinced that her academic adviser would rate Bloom 's interests over hers .
She does n't mention either Bloom 's department chair or the dean of the college ( though at one point she insists that a trip to the dean 's office is " intimidating " to students per se ) .
She says she wanted to file a grievance ... and was talked out of it .
In fact , " some women friends " talked her out of speaking to " anyone official . "
" In the absence of transparent procedures , decoding the right rumors was how you survived . "
You would think Wolf and her friends were helpless inmates of some total institution , not students at an elite university .
Undergraduates are not known for their deep knowledge of the way a university works .
If any of Wolf 's friends had ever filed a grievance against a faculty member , she does n't mention it .
One supposedly told her about a woman whose complaint against a male graduate student was not upheld by the Grievance Board -- with the alleged result that the woman had a breakdown and dropped out of Yale .
( Other portions of Wolf 's account suggest that some of her friends were Bloomian acolytes themselves .
Could any of them have been more interested in protecting the guru than in supporting her ? )
I should note that Jennifer Weiner , an Ivy League contemporary of Wolf's , has little patience with this kind of story :
As someone who attended a similar institution in roughly the same era that Wolf did , I can assure you that Ivy League undergrads are practically marinated in entitlement .
If you had a beef with anything , be it person or policy , you felt perfectly entitled , justified , and encouraged to tell someone .
Even if you were on financial aid .
Even if you were female .
By the time I got to Princeton , in the heyday of P.C. , especially the women .
In any event , Naomi Wolf never talked to a faculty member or an administrator about her run-in with Bloom .
Her parents asked a professor they knew to intervene -- she says he declined to get involved -- and that was the end of it .
The New York Observer article indicates that she would never have had to be alone in a room with Harold Bloom during grievance hearings , undermining at least one of her stated reasons for avoiding the process .
I will add that faculty members often make the opposite complaint from Wolf 's : they think that grievance procedures of the kind that Yale was using are tilted against the professor , not the student , when sexual misconduct is being alleged .
That said , I have a little sympathy with Wolf concerning institutional grievance proceedings .
Flagrantly political decisions can happen in the best of them .
Where witnesses cannot be cross -examined ( a lot of grievance procedures do not allow it ) , some may lie with impunity to the grievance panel .
However we might evaluate it , the extreme confidentiality that Wolf complains about is commonplace .
( I have seen how grievance proceedings work , both in a three - initial corporation where I was once employed , and in academia where I am now , so I think I have some basis for generalizing ) .
A fair and reliable procedure will be able to find for an employee against a manager , or for a student against a professor , when the manager or the professor is in the wrong .
But the penalty assessed against the offender is frequently not revealed to the person who filed the successful grievance ( it never was in the three - initial corporation 's process , just as Wolf says it never is at Yale ) .
Naturally , if the offender is pushed into quitting , or is removed from a management position , the outcome will be visible -- but how and why it occurred will be known to very few .
Lesser sanctions will be kept officially quiet , and may not even become the subject of rumor .
Wolf , then , is at best naïve when she complains about lack of transparency as though it is unique to Yale University ( " as secretive as a Masonic lodge , " she laments ) .
Suppose an irate alumna of Clemson University called the president 's office , or a dean 's office , and demanded to know the outcome of a particular grievance not involving herself .
Or suppose she demanded to know what penalties had been imposed against administrators or professors who had been on the losing side in grievance procedures over the past so many years .
She would be told that these were personnel matters , grievance proceedings are highly confidential - - now please go away .
If a former employee were to call the offices of a high - level manager in a three - initial corporation , asking questions of this kind , the response would be identical in content , and probably brusquer in manner .
We can certainly debate the rationale for such policies .
I have heard it said that corporate managers would never consent to be subject to grievance proceedings , unless they could be spared public humiliation when the rulings went against them .
Maybe so , but that 's a strictly pragmatic appeal to existing " power relations . "
Wolf correctly recognizes that " the reputation of the university " and " damage control " are highly motivating to university administrators .
Naturally , fear of lawsuits stimulates wagon - circling , and some of those suits are filed under Federal sexual harassment law ( as Wolf is aware , both the Federal law and Yale policies and procedures mandated by a Federal judge were in place by the time of her run-in with Bloom ) .
But it is n't just sexual improprieties that prompt such fears .
She 'd have gotten no further , in her conversations with Yale administrators , had she demanded to know how administrators had been penalized when they were found to have misused university funds , or how professors were disciplined , when they were caught issuing fraudulent grades or driving drunk with students on board .
Wolf does n't let such details complicate the picture .
What 's clearly false is Wolf 's assertion that university grievance boards ( or administrative rulings made without a grievance procedure ) never go in favor of female students who have brought complaints against male professors .
On the contrary , sometimes they have found for female students whose charges against male professors were overblown , or fabricated outright .
Daphne Patai's book Heterophobia : Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism presents a number of documented cases .
For instance , Leroy Young was fired summarily from a tenured faculty position by the president of Plymouth State College -- without an investigation , immediately after Young had prevailed on appeal against a student who claimed that he had sexually harassed her .
But you 'd never know that from Wolf 's sample of unidentified size , drawn from an unknown number of unnamed universities : " Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence ...
No one was met by a coherent process that was not weighted against them . "
Really ?
Another female student sued Leroy Young - - who had passed a polygraph test denying her charges -- and ended up collecting $ 115,000 from his former university .
What 's more , any decently conducted grievance proceeding would not have permitted Wolf to make unsupported assertions , as she does in her article , that Harold Bloom was propositioning other female students , or subjecting them to unwanted touching , or having affairs with them .
Her entire evidence to those effects consists of rumors that she heard in 1983 plus rumors that a couple of her sources heard at other times .
If Bloom was laying his racket all over town , why could n't Wolf , with her extensive connections , turn up one other Yale alumna who wanted to describe her bad experience with him ?
Maybe
Wolf was just being lazy , as somewhat better quality sources have suggested that Bloom had affairs .
For instance , a published interview in GQ from 1990 described how the door to Bloom 's home was opened by a younger woman , obviously not his wife , who stuck around the entire time that the interviewer was on the premises .
But you 'd think Wolf would have regarded corroboration as vitally important ...
Indeed , a grievance proceeding might have led to challenges to her story .
Until the other two diners depart , and Wolf puts her poems in front of Bloom , we have no idea from her published accounts what sort of interaction was going on between them , for she retells not one word of their conversation .
Or is asking " What did you say to him ? " as off - limits as asking " What were you wearing " ?

UPDATE 1/28 : Full text of Dr. Theon ’s letter has been post on the Senate website and below .
This is something I thought I ’d never see .
This press release today is from the Senate EPW blog of Jame Inhofe .
The scientist making the claims in the headline , Dr. John S. Theon , formerly of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies , Arlington , Virginia , has a paper here in the AMS BAMS that you may also find interesting .
Other papers are available here in Google Scholar .
He also worked on the report of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident report and according to that document was a significant contributor to weather forecasting improvements :
The Space Shuttle Weather Forecasting Advisory Panel , chaired by Dr. John Theon , was established by NASA Headquarters to review existing weather support capabilities and plans and to recommend a course of action to the NSTS Program .
Included on the panel were representatives from NASA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the Air Force , and the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
For those just joining the climate discussion , Dr. James Hansen is the chief climate scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) and is the man who originally raised the alarm on global warming in 1988 in an appearance before congress .
He is also the keeper of the most often cited climate data .
EPW press release below – Anthony
Washington DC , Jan 27th 2009 : NASA warming scientist James Hansen , one of former Vice - President Al Gore ’s closest allies in the promotion of man-made global warming fears , is being publicly rebuked by his former supervisor at NASA .
Retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist , Dr. John S. Theon , the former supervisor of James Hansen , NASA ’s vocal man-made global warming fear soothsayer , has now publicly declared himself a skeptic and declared that Hansen “ embarrassed NASA ” with his alarming climate claims and said Hansen was “ was never muzzled . ”
Theon joins the rapidly growing ranks of international scientists abandoning the promotion of man-made global warming fears .
“ I appreciate the opportunity to add my name to those who disagree that global warming is man made , ” Theon wrote to the Minority Office at the Environment and Public Works Committee on January 15 , 2009 .
“ I was , in effect , Hansen ’s supervisor because I had to justify his funding , allocate his resources , and evaluate his results , ” Theon , the former Chief of the Climate Processes Research Program at NASA Headquarters and former Chief of the Atmospheric Dynamics & Radiation Branch explained .
“ Hansen was never muzzled even though he violated NASA ’s official agency position on climate forecasting ( i.e. , we did not know enough to forecast climate change or mankind ’s effect on it ) .
Hansen thus embarrassed NASA by coming out with his claims of global warming in 1988 in his testimony before Congress , ” Theon wrote .
[ Note : NASA scientist James Hansen has created worldwide media frenzy with his dire climate warning , his call for trials against those who dissent against man-made global warming fear , and his claims that he was allegedly muzzled by the Bush administration despite doing 1,400 on - the - job media interviews !
– See : Do n’t Panic Over Predictions of Climate Doom – Get the Facts on James Hansen – UK Register : Veteran climate scientist says ‘ lock up the oil men ’ – June 23 , 2008 & UK Guardian : NASA scientist calls for putting oil firm chiefs on trial for ‘ high crimes against humanity ’ for spreading doubt about man-made global warming – June 23 , 2008 ]
Theon declared “ climate models are useless . ”
“ My own belief concerning anthropogenic climate change is that the models do not realistically simulate the climate system because there are many very important sub - grid scale processes that the models either replicate poorly or completely omit , ” Theon explained .
“ Furthermore , some scientists have manipulated the observed data to justify their model results .
In doing so , they neither explain what they have modified in the observations , nor explain how they did it .
They have resisted making their work transparent so that it can be replicated independently by other scientists .
This is clearly contrary to how science should be done .
Thus there is no rational justification for using climate model forecasts to determine public policy , ” he added .
“ As Chief of several of NASA Headquarters ’ programs ( 1982 - 94 ) , an SES position , I was responsible for all weather and climate research in the entire agency , including the research work by James Hansen , Roy Spencer , Joanne Simpson , and several hundred other scientists at NASA field centers , in academia , and in the private sector who worked on climate research , ” Theon wrote of his career .
“ This required a thorough understanding of the state of the science .
I have kept up with climate science since retiring by reading books and journal articles , ” Theon added .

Theon also co-authored the book “ Advances in Remote Sensing Retrieval Methods . ”
[ Note : Theon joins many current and former NASA scientists in dissenting from man-made climate fears .
A small sampling includes : Aerospace engineer and physicist Dr. Michael Griffin , the former top administrator of NASA , Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson , the first woman in the world to receive a PhD in meteorology , and formerly of NASA , Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman , an astronautical engineer and former NASA astronaut , Award - Winning NASA Astronaut / Geologist and Moonwalker Jack Schmitt , Award - winning NASA Astronaut and Physicist Walter Cunningham of NASA ’s Apollo 7 , Chemist and Nuclear Engineer Robert DeFayette was formerly with NASA ’s Plum Brook Reactor , Hungarian Ferenc Miskolczi , an atmospheric physicist with 30 years of experience and a former researcher with NASA ’s Ames Research Center , Climatologist Dr. John Christy , Climatologist Dr. Roy W.

Gore faces a much different scientific climate in 2009 than the one he faced in 2006 when his film “ An Inconvenient Truth ” was released .
According to satellite data , the Earth has cooled since Gore ’s film was released , Antarctic sea ice extent has grown to record levels , sea level rise has slowed , ocean temperatures have failed to warm , and more and more scientists have publicly declared their dissent from man-made climate fears as peer - reviewed studies continue to man-made counter warming fears .
[ See : Peer - Reviewed Study challenges ‘ notion that human emissions are responsible for global warming ’ & New Peer - Reviewed Scientific Studies Chill Global Warming Fears ]
“ Vice President Gore and the other promoters of man-made climate fears endless claims that the “ debate is over ” appear to be ignoring scientific reality , ” Senator James Inhofe , Ranking Member of the Environment & Public Works Committee .
A U.S. Senate Minority Report released in December 2008 details over 650 international scientists who are dissenting from man-made global warming fears promoted by the UN and yourself .
Many of the scientists profiled are former UN IPCC scientists and former believers in man-made climate change that have reversed their views in recent years .
The report continues to grow almost daily .
We have just received a request from an Italian scientist , and a Czech scientist to join the 650 dissenting scientists report .
A chemist from the U.S. Naval Academy is about to be added , and more Japanese scientists are dissenting .
Finally , many more meteorologists will be added and another former UN IPCC scientist is about to be included .
These scientists are openly rebelling against the climate orthodoxy promoted by Gore and the UN IPCC .
The prestigious International Geological Congress , dubbed the geologists ’ equivalent of the Olympic Games , was held in Norway in August 2008 and prominently featured the voices of scientists skeptical of man-made global warming fears .
Reports from the conference found that Skeptical scientists overwhelmed the meeting , with ‘ 2/3 of presenters and question - askers hostile to , even dismissive of , the UN IPCC ’ ( See full reports here & here ]
In addition , a 2008 canvass of more than 51,000 Canadian scientists revealed 68 % disagree that global warming science is “ settled . ”
A November 25 , 2008 , article in Politico noted that a “ growing accumulation ” of science is challenging warming fears , and added that the “ science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant cap - and - trade legislation . ”
More evidence that the global warming fear machine is breaking down .
Russian scientists “ rejected the very idea that carbon dioxide may be responsible for global warming ” .
An American Physical Society editor conceded that a “ considerable presence ” of scientific skeptics exists .
An International team of scientists countered the UN IPCC , declaring : “ Nature , Not Human Activity , Rules the Climate ” .
India Issued a report challenging global warming fears .
International Scientists demanded the UN IPCC “ be called to account and cease its deceptive practices . ”
The scientists and peer - reviewed studies countering climate claims are the key reason that the U.S. public has grown ever more skeptical of man-made climate doom predictions .

The chorus of skeptical scientific voices grow louder in 2008 as a steady stream of peer - reviewed studies , analyses , real world data and inconvenient developments challenged the UN’s and former Vice President Al Gore ’s claims that the “ science is settled ” and there is a “ consensus . ”
On a range of issues , 2008 proved to be challenging for the promoters of man-made climate fears .
Promoters of anthropogenic warming fears endured the following : Global temperatures failing to warm ;
Peer - reviewed studies predicting a continued lack of warming ; a failed attempt to revive the discredited “ Hockey Stick “ ; inconvenient developments and studies regarding rising CO2 ; the Spotless Sun ; Clouds ; Antarctica ; the Arctic ; Greenland ’s ice ; Mount Kilimanjaro ; Global sea ice ; Causes of Hurricanes ; Extreme Storms ; Extinctions ; Floods ; Droughts ; Ocean Acidification ; Polar Bears ; Extreme weather deaths ; Frogs ; lack of atmospheric dust ; Malaria ; the failure of oceans to warm and rise as predicted .

Subject : Climate models are useless
Marc ,
First , I sent several e-mails to you with an error in the address and they have been returned to me .
So I ’m resending them in one combined e-mail .
Yes , one could say that I was , in effect , Hansen ’s supervisor because I had to justify his funding , allocate his resources , and evaluate his results .
I did not have the authority to give him his annual performance evaluation .
He was never muzzled even though he violated NASA ’s official agency position on climate forecasting ( i.e. , we did not know enough to forecast climate change or mankind ’s effect on it ) .
He thus embarrassed NASA by coming out with his claims of global warming in 1988 in his testimony before Congress .
My own belief concerning anthropogenic climate change is that the models do not realistically simulate the climate system because there are many very important sub - grid scale processes that the models either replicate poorly or completely omit .
Furthermore , some scientists have manipulated the observed data to justify their model results .

Above - inflation rail fare increases of more than 6 % are " completely out of kilter with the real economy " , passenger groups have said .
Anthony Smith of Passenger Focus said hikes were " difficult to explain " as wages were not rising by the same rate .
Train firms say more money will allow greater investment in services .
Michael Roberts , of the Association of Train Operating Companies , said Monday 's increases were partly because taxpayer funding was being reduced .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " Fare changes this year will help pay for 265,000 extra services , all against a background which is determined by government policy to reduce the call on us as taxpayers . "
Rail fares have got completely out of kilter with what is happening in the real economy
Anthony Smith
Passenger Focus
Train users to ' shiver ' at rises
Full list of rises
The fare changes " actually in our view strike the right balance between trying to ensure a reasonable level of increase to fund in return much improved services , " he added .
Mr Roberts said the average increases amounted to just £ 1 or £ 2 a day for many season ticket holders .
Commuting by rail was still " considerably less expensive than commuting by car - even allowing for falling petrol prices " , he went on .
' Particularly unpalatable ' Unregulated fares - off - peak and leisure fares - have gone up by an average of 7 % .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The problem is the ' improved services ' never arrive ( like some of the trains ) Emily , Manchester The 6 % increase for regulated fares , including standard , rush hour and season tickets , is based on the inflation rate for July .
Mr Smith , chief executive of Passenger Focus , said : " What makes these rises particularly unpalatable is the fact that inflation is currently about 3 % .
" Here we have rises that are on average 6 or 7 % and in some cases 10 % .
" Rail fares have got completely out of kilter with what is happening in the real economy and people are going to have dig very deep to find the extra money . "
CrossCountry , whose network of sevices covers 1,500 miles ( 2,414 km ) and stretches from Aberdeen to Penzance and from Stansted to Cardiff , has the highest increase for its unregulated fares - up 11 % .
East Midlands Trains , Chiltern Railways , National Express East Coast and South West Trains have put their unregulated fares up by more than 7 % .

NASA and the Department of Energy are working together to build the first space - based observatory designed to understand the nature of dark energy .
One of the most significant scientific findings in the last decade was that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .
The acceleration is caused by a previously unknown dark energy that makes up approximately 70 percent of the total mass energy content of the universe .
The discovery of dark energy showed that empty space is filled with a mysterious energy that increases as the universe expands .
While Einstein initially proposed a cosmological constant that could explain the dark energy , it is the amount of dark energy that is difficult to understand .
[ social_buttons ]
Now , a new collaborative research project between NASA and the DOE called the Joint Dark Energy Mission ( JDEM ) will hopefully clarify some of the properties of dark energy , advancing foundational elements of physics and astronomy .
“ Understanding the nature of dark energy is the biggest challenge in physics and astronomy today , ” said Jon Morse , director of astrophysics at NASA in a statement .
“ JDEM will be a unique and major contributor in our quest to understand dark energy and how it has shaped the universe in which we live . ”
Both DOE and NASA will develop scientific instrumentation for the observatory and will participate in the science operations and data analysis phase of the mission .
NASA will provide the telescope , spacecraft bus , and launch services .
Scientists hope that the JDEM , along with future measurements of supernovae , gravitational lensing and clusters of galaxies from a Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will reveal definitively whether dark energy behaves like Einstein ’s cosmological constant or like some new substance that changes with time as the universe evolves .
There are nearly 30 experiments proposed or under way .
With launch costs , NASA hopes the total budget for JDEM will fall under $ 1 billion .
In a sign that physicists and astronomers have longer planning horizons than most , launch is planned for the middle of next decade .
But if JDEM looks to be more expensive , the project may have to be postponed .

These days , everybody ’s an environmentalist .
But as the new year begins , we ask whether in this dismal market it ’s possible to safely invest in green companies and funds .
The call to “ go green ” seemed to be reaching a fever pitch just a few months ago .
Then - presidential candidate Barack Obama was pledging to promote industries that were environmentally minded and invest federal money in creating green technology .
Americans , tired of shelling out more than $ 100 at the gas pump to fill their oversize vehicles , were turning to hybrids in droves .
This would all seem to benefit the scores of green companies that went public -- perhaps even creating a bubble like the dot - com and housing booms .
Advertisement
But the green wave has been volatile , returning profits over prolonged rallies during boom times but falling particularly hard in recent months .
In the second half of 2008 , renewable - energy shares tanked .
The WilderHill Clean Energy Index , a collection of 51 green companies , ended the year down 70 % , compared with a 34 % drop in the Dow Jones industrial average .
The often undercapitalized start - ups became especially vulnerable after the stock market meltdown because there was no longer cash available to fund the hefty upfront costs for wind and solar projects .
Advertisement
On top of that , the price of fossil fuels plunged , restoring conventional energy ’s status as the low - cost alternative -- costing investors lots of money .
The Standard & Poor ’s energy index lost 35.9 % last year .
“ It got a little bit frenzied like the tech bubble in ’98 and ’ 99 , ” said Brent Kessel , co-founder of Abacus Wealth Management .
Venture capitalists backed projects that were n’t fully thought out , and investors rushed in too .
“ Fundamental principles of investment were n’t being followed by those putting money into green companies and mutual funds , ” Kessel said .
“ It was like they were interested in whatever was sexy .
The story is always the same .
The players just change . ”

The old rules apply
So how does an investor navigate a sector so fraught with risk in the new year ?
First , resurrect the old rules :
Do your homework .
Do n’t invest money you ca n’t afford to lose , and do n’t put all your money into any one sector .
Advertisement
For Kessel , careful green investing means buying shares in an array of companies that are turning a profit -- a seemingly basic requirement that was often ignored during the rush to acquire green shares .
Then , be patient .
These environmentally friendly companies may not make big money for a long time if at all -- a fact of life in the start - up world made more intense by the recession .
That ’s because green products and services are often more expensive than their conventional counterparts , and during hard times , discretionary spending is usually the first to go .
But to ignore their long - term potential is shortsighted , Kessel said .
Advertisement
Investments in alternative - energy companies , for example , probably wo n’t pay off immediately , but they might in five to eight years , he said .
Another key factor is the incoming Obama administration .
As environmental degradation continues , he and other world leaders will be under immense pressure to stem the damage .
The plans that his administration lays out are likely to dominate the direction of the green movement .
Conservation and renewables will get another push in the form of public - works projects built into Obama ’s stimulus package .
China , a prolific polluter as well as a center for green tech , is also unveiling a stimulus package .

Throughout the economy , companies large and small are champing at the bit to advertise themselves as green -- and cash in on what many believe will be a revolution in energy , household products and other areas .
“ The American consumer wants to be involved in it , and big companies are increasingly interested because they desperately need growth themselves , ” said Jack Robinson , founder and president of Winslow Green Growth .
The mutual fund was down 61.5 % last year after gaining 23.5 % in 2007 , its fifth straight year of positive gains .
Another environmentally minded fund , Portfolio 21 , declined 36 % in 2008 , also after enjoying five years of positive returns .

Think sub-sectors
The green sector is so new that it ’s hard to even figure out what companies belong in it .
Does Toyota Motor Corp. , which makes SUVs along with hybrid cars ?
Does Whole Foods Market Inc. , which sells organic foods but operates a huge supermarket chain ?
It may be easier to break the sector down by company type .
The first and perhaps most obvious is energy .
There are people developing sustainable fuels for cars and pushing to increase the amount of solar or wind energy that powers homes and businesses .
That also extends to companies developing power cables to deliver that energy to urban centers .
Advertisement
Alternative - energy companies could receive a boost if fuel prices go back up , as could makers of hybrid cars .
Californians are already experiencing a moderate increase in gasoline costs , and other states are expected to endure a similar bump come February , when refiners switch to a more expensive grade of gasoline used during the summer months .
But it is not clear when a massive price rise like the one experienced in 2008 might take place .
Another sub -sector of the so - called green economy involves water .
The Environmental Protection Agency says climate change and aging facilities promise to spread water shortages through most of the nation -- an issue that afflicts many parts of the globe .
But there are companies attempting to develop efficient ways to desalinate ocean water to increase the supply .
Other firms are working on recycling water for industrial use .
Another obvious area is transportation .
Air pollution standards and consumer demand are pushing automobile companies toward making more low - emission or zero-emission cars , including hybrids and electric vehicles .
If gasoline prices go up , demand for such vehicles can only rise .
There are bicycle manufacturers , scooter makers , bus companies and others that hope to profit from continued concern about pollution and the price of oil .
Advertisement
No one can map out where next - generation vehicles are going , and that ’s just the start of the riddles green investors face .
Plenty of provocative but unproven ideas are out there , which means that potential shareholders should be extremely careful .
Firms that had plenty of money a year ago may have little left now , and analysts expect a winnowing process .
“ Companies that are n’t fully capitalized will probably have to shut their doors in late 2009 , and a handful of players will come out much stronger , ” said analyst Sanjay Shrestha , who covers renewable energy for Lazard Capital Markets .
Advertisement
Shrestha advised investing in companies with a clear competitive edge , such as those whose products are most efficient .
Some advisors go so far as to recommend that investors stay away from individual stocks , investing instead in mutual funds with a proven track record in the sector .
If you want to take on the risks of investing in individual stocks , make sure the company is well capitalized , with enough financing to weather several slow years of operations .
Doing so keeps your risk in check .
Buying less - stable firms is so speculative that it can be akin to purchasing a lottery ticket .
Make sure the company is profitable , and check out the customer base .
Read the risk factors in the prospectus for a sobering picture of what could go wrong .
Advertisement
One way to find funds that invest in green companies is to contact socially responsible investing organizations .
The Social Investment Forum ( www.socialinvest.org), a financial industry association with an emphasis on ethical investments , puts out regular reports on the state of the industry .
As of 2007 , there were 260 mutual funds that marketed themselves as having been screened as socially or environmentally responsible investments .
But experts urge caution even when dealing with such professionals .
A 2007 Consumer Reports survey showed that most socially responsible mutual funds had lower returns and higher expenses than their mainstream counterparts .
Doug Sandler , chief equity officer for Riverfront Investment Group , is waiting for household - name companies to sort the market out .
He expects fledglings to give way to veterans with cash stockpiles , reliable manufacturing and global scale .
“ Some of these smaller companies will plow the field , ” he said , “ but when it comes time to harvest , the big companies will be the beneficiaries . ”

The inauguration of Barack Obama will not only bring about a wholesale turnover in the political leadership of the country but it will also unveil the newest in a long line of Presidential limos .
According to Presidential vehicle experts , the new limo is a beast - like General Motors truck - based Cadillac that is so tough it ’s like a ‘ rolling tank with windows . ’
Among the vehicle ’s main features are windows that are 5 inches thick , 19.5 - inch
Goodyear RHS tires ( same as super tough trucks ) , and possibly even a lock safety mechanism that seals off the car like a bank vault in case of an emergency .
Because the Secret Service keeps details of the limo understandably private , even the most knowledgeable security experts do n’t really know how much gadgety tech is being installed in the new ride .
But it ’s not stopping them making a few informed guesses .
In an interview with CNN , security expert Ken Lucci says rubber gaskets likely protect the car against chemical weapons and that the body will be made out of a tougher material than before .
The most recent limo used by President Bush used some combination of a dual hardness steel , aluminum , titanium and even ceramics to break up possible projectiles .
And there are usually steel overlaps that cover any gaps a door might leave .
Despite the immense secrecy , reports have leaked that the limo also comes with a 10 - CD changer , which will inevitably end up playing Obama favorites like Steve Wonder and Bob Dylan .
We ’re surprised there ’s no Blu-ray or Wii in there , but we ’re pretty sure of one thing :
The limo will be a Zune - free zone , especially considering the most recent reports .

Anthony Barnett ( London , OK ) : The Erminegate , kickbacks - to - cronies story brought back an old memory to me , from the days of " sleaze " when cash for questions tainted the Conservative government .
This too involved undercover journalists trailing round the most likely suspects until they got some of them drunk , greedy or off - guard enough to agree to a deal .
In the process many more were asked .
This time , according to the Sunday Times , ten Lords were approached and four agreed .
Some of the others refused robustly .
Others simply never get back to them with anything they could go on .
Here is the thought I had back in the old days when there were no blogs to record them .
" Why did no one report the attempts to corrupt the system ? " .
Is it merely honourable to refuse to be corrupted ?
The fact that none of the Tory MPs who were approached blew the whistle , called the Speaker 's office , or rang the police after a criminal proposition was made to them was one the things that convinced me of the inner rottenness of the state of the Tories at that time .
The same goes for the Lords today .
When they say that there are ' rumours ' of corruption it means that they all know that deals are taking place within their wheels .
That this is ' the way it is ' .
By not reporting a crude approach , those who remained silent also give their permission to it being made to others .
It is impossible not to think that perhaps they are beneficiaries of more ' deniable ' revenues and do n't want to ' rock the boat ' .
If the system was not corrupt it would be dangerous to try and bribe legislators .
Thousands of demonstrators are expected to converge on central London tomorrow to demand a ceasefire in Gaza amid growing international anger over Israel 's week - long bombardment .
The singer Annie Lennox , the former mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , comedian Alexei Sayle , Palestinian solidarity groups , Muslim organisations , the Stop the War Coalition and several MPs are among those backing the midday march from Embankment to Trafalgar Square .
Since Israeli air strikes started there have been daily protests outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington , west London , where large numbers have forced the closure of nearby streets .
A rally was held outside the Egyptian embassy in Mayfair / today to call for the opening of the Gaza - Egypt border , allowing the delivery of more humanitarian supplies .
Other supporters of / tommorrow 's mass protest include the former model Bianca Jagger , Tony Benn , the musician Brian Eno , Respect Party MP George Galloway , Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Teather , Labour MP Jermy Corbyn and the socialist activist Tariq Ali .
Speaking at a press conference ahead of the rally , Jagger appealed to the US president - elect , Barack Obama , to " ask for the immediate cessation of the bombardment of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip . "
Ken Livingstone condemned the " Israeli kill ratio of 100 to one " as " obscene " .
The UK government 's response so far had been completely inadequate , he said .
" The only time a British government was even - handed [ in the Middle East ] was Edward Heath in 1973 ... when he refused to let arms shipments through to Israel . "
Despite years of courting mainstream Muslim opinion , a rift appeared to be opening up between government departments and certain groups .
The Muslim Council of Britain called for a meeting with the Foreign Office but declined to attend the briefing unless it was given by the Foreign Secretary , David Milliband .
Dr Daud Abdullah , deputy secretary - general of the MCB , declared : " There is widespread consternation that our government , along with the United States , did not approve a vote in the Security Council , calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the siege of Gaza .
We find this incomprehensible given the dire humanitarian crisis . "
But the Foreign Office dismissed the allegation .
" We support the Arab League 's efforts towards a UN Security Council Resolution , " a spokesperson insisted .
" To be effective , any resolution must be one that will command broad support and that demands an end to Hamas rocket attacks against Israeli civilians as well as an end to Israeli military action in Gaza .
It is wrong to suggest that Britain would block action towards a permanent ceasefire .
We have not and are not doing so . "
The Stop the War coalition has called for protesters to bring old shoes to leave for Brown when the march passes Downing Street " in the spirit of Iraqi journalist Muntadar al - Zaidi " .
Local protests are also being organised in other UK cities / tomorrow .
A jihadist group , the Followers of Ahlulsunnah Al Jamal , today organised a protest march from the Central Mosque in Regent 's park to the US embassy .
Their placards declared : ' Shariah for Palestine ' , ' United Nations Go To Hell - Islam Is The Only Solution ' and ' Hands off Muslims ' .
Protests against the Israeli bombing erupted in many parts of the Muslim world .
In Kabul , around 1,000 protestors gathered outside the Nabawi mosque chanting ' Death to America , Israel and Britain and waved green Hamas flags .
In Cairo , Egyptian police used batons to beat back protests called by the Muslim Brotherhood .
Teargas was fired in Jordan to keep demonstrators away from the Jordanian embassy .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Members of Congress wo n't be allowed to slip earmarks into the economic recovery package Congress will soon take up , President - elect Barack Obama said Tuesday .
President - elect Barack Obama says details of the stimulus package will be posted online .
" We are going to ban all earmarks , the process by which individual members insert pet projects without review , " Obama told reporters after a meeting with his economic advisers .
Obama said that getting a handle on the country 's skyrocketing budget deficit must begin with the economic stimulus plan , and that the plan must include changes in the way Congress does business .
" We 're going to be investing an extraordinary amount of money to jump - start our economy , save or create 3 million new jobs , mostly in the private sector , and lay a solid foundation for future growth , " he said .
" But we 're not going to be able to expect the American people to support this critical effort unless we take extraordinary steps to ensure that the investments are made wisely and managed well . "
As Obama spoke on his plans to stimulate the sagging U.S. economy , the Federal Reserve predicted that the economy 's deterioration is likely to continue through this year , with unemployment rising into 2010 .
Banning earmarks -- usually pet projects of Congress members inserted in money bills unrelated to the projects -- is one of several steps the president - elect wants to take with the stimulus bill .
" We are going to bring a long - overdue sense of responsibility and accountability to Washington , " he said .
" We are going to stop talking about government reform , and we 're actually going to start executing . "
Obama said he will set up an oversight board " to identify problems early and make sure we 're doing all that we can to solve it . "
And , he said , Americans will be able to monitor online where the stimulus money is spent .
" But we 're not going to be able to stop there , " he said .
" We 're going to have to bring significant reform not just to our recovery and reinvestment plan , but to the overall budget process , to address both the deficit of dollars and the deficit of trust .
" We 'll have to make tough choices , and we 're going to have to break old habits .
We 're going to have to eliminate outmoded programs and make the ones that we do need work better . "
Obama met with key Democratic and Republican congressional members Monday , and leaders from both sides of the aisle were optimistic after the meeting .
Republicans , however , cautioned that they are interested in seeing significant tax cuts in the plan and expect to provide significant input into the process as well .
" This potentially $ 1 trillion bill would be one of the largest spending bills in U.S. history .
It would increase the deficit by half a trillion dollars overnight and deepen an already enormous national debt , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky , said .
" Before we all agree to it , the American people need to see the details .
" They need to be able to see for themselves whether this is money well spent .
And if lawmakers think that it is , then they need to make a convincing case to the people who are paying for it , " he said .
The president - elect is scheduled to deliver a major policy speech on the economy Thursday .

There 's bad ads running on Fark lately and we 're going to kill the people responsible .
We could use your help
We 've been getting a lot of reports lately about bad ads running on Fark .
Ads that play noise , ads that expand , ads that take over the entire screen , pop-ups , and worst of all at least a couple instances of ads depicting banana hammocks .
Recently we switched ad networks , and in the process we switched google adsense from the old partner to the new .
The old partner had a ton of filters installed over the years to keep these crap ads from running on Fark .
When we switched ad networks , the filter essentially got reset .
The new ad network had n't been running adsense so they do n't have any filters .
We 're having to rebuild it from the ground up .
For those who do n't know how adsense works , here 's a short paraphrased explanation :
It 's essentially a remnant ad network .
We do n't know who 's buying ads on Fark until they actually run .
Why the hell anyone thinks that annoying readers is the path to a successful ad campaign I 'll never know .
So if you see an ad that makes noise , expands , pops , or is in any other way annoying , see if you can get a copy of the url of the image and the url of the destination .
If you could email me either directly or via the submit form ( chosing ' bad banner ad ' as the subject ) and let me know what the urls are , we will kill it with fire .
If I can find who is responsible for these ads , they will be shoved up a dog's ass and shot .
PS - I should have the next installment of our previous ban discussion ready to go next week , things have been kinda busy lately with the election thingee .
PSS - I am travelling today and can't respond in the thread so if anyone has any comments or questions feel free to contact me We 've been getting a lot of reports lately about bad ads running on Fark .

Sheriff Joe Arpaio , TV star ?
It could happen when Smile ... You 're Under Arrest ! premieres in December on the Fox Reality channel .
" Sheriff Joe is an absolute natural , " producer Scott Satin says .
" He should have his own late - night talk show .
He 's wonderful on camera because he 's not acting .
He is a very sincere person . "
That sincerity will be spotlighted in the show , which was filmed last year in the Valley .
The premise involves elaborate sting operations used to nab people with outstanding warrants .
" It 's Punk 'd meets Cops , " says Satin , whose reality credits include Who Wants to Marry My Dad ? and the Sci-Fi Channel 's popular Who Wants to Be a Superhero ? , in which contestants are tested in such areas and bravery and courage .
The latter series helped inspire his latest offering .
" After that show was done , I was thinking , ' How can I do this for real ? ' " he says .
" That 's how it came to be . "
The producers scoped out different law - enforcement agencies around the country before settling on the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office .
The reason ?
" Sheriff Joe was fantastic , " Satin says .
" I knew he was our guy , and I hoped he would help us and agree to let us help him . "
Lisa Allen , spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office , says it was n't a snap decision to agree to participate .
" A lot of thought and a lot of meetings went into it , " she says .
" It was a unique marriage between law enforcement and entertainment , and we had to make sure it was right . "
So far , it looks like a successful marriage : About 400 warrants were cleared through the show .
The show targeted people who had warrants issued for their arrests after failing to show up for court dates .
" That 's what we hope people take from the show , " Satin says .
" If you have a court date , do n't blow it off .
That will get you in trouble . "
Of course , the real entertainment comes in watching the felons get busted .
In one sequence , a felon believes he is modeling Halloween costumes for a fashion show .
Of course , one of the outfits consists of a prisoner 's black - and - white stripes .
In another segment , lucky criminals think they are touring the set of a sequel to The Green Mile .
The film 's name : The Lime Green Mile .
Obviously , the show does n't make a case for Arizona having the brightest law - breakers .
" You may have smart crooks , but we have really smart producers , " Satin cracks .
Not only are our crooks gullible , they also love the spotlight .
Every person caught in a sting signed a waiver to appear on TV .
" It 's the Andy Warhol phenomenon , " Allen says .
" A lot of these guys thinking being on TV is a cool thing . "
At this point , three episodes have been filmed .
They will air at 5 p.m. Saturdays beginning Dec. 27 .
After that ?
Satin says the plan is to produce more shows if ratings warrant ( pun intended ) .
" Everybody learned a lot from the experience , " Allen says .
" We 're entertaining the thought ( of doing more ) , but we have n't committed to anything yet . "
Satin hopes that will change .
" I love Arizona and I love Sheriff Joe and I can't wait to come back and do more , " Satin says , though he knows of one other element needed to keep the show in the desert .
Namely , that our criminal element does n't wise up .
" Hopefully , a lot of people with warrants in Arizona do n't have cable . "

CSS Sprites : How Yahoo.com and AOL.com Improve Web Performance
Summary : Learn how AOL and Yahoo !
use CSS sprites to improve performance for their busy home pages .
CSS sprites save HTTP requests by using CSS positioning to selectively display composite background images .
To maximize accessibility and usability , CSS sprites are best used for icons or decorative effects .
CSS sprites group multiple images into one composite image and display them using CSS background positioning .
You can save a significant amount of HTTP requests by consolidating your images into one or more composite sprites and using CSS to selectively display parts of the sprite within your web page .
Now that the major browsers have evolved enough to support CSS backgrounds and positioning , more sites are adopting this performance technique .
In fact , some of the busiest sites on the Web use CSS sprites to save HTTP requests .
In this article we 'll expand on our mini-CSS sprite example ( mono- image CSS rollovers ) to show how Yahoo ! and AOL use sprites to improve performance .
A Brief CSS Sprite How - To
The idea behind CSS sprites is to consolidate multiple images into one sprite and then selectively display portions of this sprite with positioning .
The steps are as follows : Group multiple images together ( usually icons or decorative images ) into one sprite
Evenly space these images , aligned into one or more lines
Set this sprite to the background image of an element ( usually a list )
Position the sprite to display the appropriate image by shifting the X or Y position by a multiple of the spacing
Enjoy the increased speed and reduced HTTP requests Maximizing Web Performance at Yahoo ! and AOL With millions of users , Yahoo ! and AOL do everything they can to improve the user experience .
Both AOL.com and Yahoo.com use CSS sprites to save numerous HTTP requests for their intricate interfaces .
Both sites use CSS sprites to selectively display icons within their directories of services , and Yahoo !
uses sprites elsewhere as well .
Yahoo ! and AOL use similar techniques , but implement sprites in different ways .
First we 'll look at AOL .
com 's implementation , to show a more flexible , but slightly less efficient approach .
Next we 'll look at Yahoo !
to see how their inline style positioning works .
AOL.com CSS Sprites AOL.com uses CSS sprites on their home page to improve performance .
AOL uses a CSS sprite for the icons in their main directory navigation bar ( autos , finance , food , etc. ) on the left side of their home page ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : AOL.com Home Page uses CSS Sprites
Their main CSS file sets up the directory navigation bar list : < link rel= " stylesheet " type =" text / css " href = " http://www.aolcdn.com/_media/aolp_v23.1/main.css " /> # sm_col . dir ul li a , #sm_col .nav2 li a , #sm_col .nav3 li a { line - height : 1.2em ; padding :.28em 0 .28 em 2.3em ; border - bottom : 1 px solid # fff ; overflow : hidden ; } #sm_col . dir ul li a , #aiw , #sm_col .nav2 li a , #sm_col .nav3 li a { display : block ; width : 10.28em ; } #sm_col ul.serv li a :hover , #sm_col .nav2 li a:hover , #sm_col .nav3 li a :hover , . eight . dir ul li a :hover { background - color : # fff ; } This CSS sets the styles for the height of the directory menu , padding ( with plenty of room for the background icon , 2.3em , on the left ) , a white border on the bottom and any overflow to be hidden .
They display the anchor as a block to make it clickable and set the width to 10.28em , and set the rollover color to white .
Note that AOL could use background : instead of background - color : here to save six bytes .
Then AOL sets the background of each directory class ( as well as some other IDs ) to " dir_sprite.png " ( see Figure 2 ) .
.d1 , .d2 , .d3 , .d4 , .d5 , .d6 , .d7 , .d8 , .d9 , .d10 , .d11 , .d12 , .d13 , .d14 , .d15 , .d16 , .d17 , .d18 , .d19 , .d20 , .d21,.d22 , .d23 , .d24 , .d25 , .d26 , .d27 , .d28 , .d29 , .d30 , .d31 , #aim_sprTbEdt , #games_sprTbEdt , #sports_sprTbEdt , #weather_sprTbEdt , #radio_sprTbEdt , #horoscopes_sprTbEdt , #video_sprTbEdt { background : transparent url ( " dir_sprite.png " ) no -repeat 4px 0 ; } Figure 2 : AOL.com dir_sprite.png ( truncated ) CSS Sprite
For the subsequent directory menu items , it is just a matter of shifting the background image down 36 or 38 pixels to show each subsequent icon .
.d2 { background - position : 4px - 36 px ; } .d3 { background - position : 4px - 74 px ; } .d4 { background - position : 4px - 112 px ; } The HTML code looks like this for the directory .
< div id =" cols " > < div id =" sm_col " > < a name = " dir " >< h6 > Directory </h6 ></a>< div class = " dir " > < ul id =" om_dir_col1_ " class = " serv c " > < li >< a id =" d1 " class = " d1 " href = " http://autos.aol.com/?ncid=AOLCOMMautoNAVIdira0001 ">
Autos</a></li> < li ><a id =" d2 " class = " d2 " href = " http://money.aol.com " >
Finance </a></li> < li >< a id =" d3 " class = " d31 " href = " http://food.aol.com " >
Food </a></li> < li >< a id =" d4 " class = " d3 " href = " http://games.aol.com " >
Games</a></li> < li >< a id =" d5 " class = " d4 " href = " http://body.aol.com " >
Health & Diet</a></li> </ul > AOL uses classes and IDs to label their menu items , while Yahoo embeds the style directly into the list items .
AOL 's version uses slightly more code , but is more flexible .
Next let 's look at Yahoo !'s implementation of CSS sprites .
Caveats to CSS Sprites AOL engineers found that one downside with image sprites is that some devices seem to handle sprites in a memory - intensive manner .
On the iPhone for example , AOL.com freezes the device , due to sprites .
They found similar problems with the Sony Playstation .
Presumably browser sniffing to deliver a non-sprite version of the page to sprite - challenged devices would be the cure .
Yahoo.com ! and CSS Sprites Yahoo uses CSS sprites on its home page to improve performance .
The first set of icons is displayed in the " Check your mail status " section on the right of Yahoo.com ! ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 : Yahoo.com Home Page uses CSS Sprites Yahoo sets up the " patabs " section with contextual selectors specifying the width of the li items , as well as setting the ul to relative positioning .
# patabs ul . patabs li{ color :#8899a9 ; float : left ; min-width : 113 px ; width : 33.2 % ; } #patabs ul.patabs { position : relative ; z - index : 10 ; } The #patabs li .icon rule loads the composite background sprite pa-icons2.gif ( see Figure 4 ) .
# patabs li .icon{ display : block ; z - index :10 ; padding : 8px 0 9px 40 px ; background : url ( http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/ww/t7/pa-icons2.gif) 5 px 3px no-repeat ; } Figure 4 : Yahoo.com pa-icons.gif CSS Sprite ( truncated )
Next they change the background position to show only the icon that matches the tab ID ( in this case #messenger and # music ) .
# patabs # messenger .icon{ padding - left:31 px ; background - position : 2 px - 497 px ; } #patabs #music .icon{ background - position : 5 px - 197 px ; } The background - position : 5 px -XYZpx shifts the background loaded in the #patabs li .icon rule to display the appropriate icon .
Next , all Yahoo has to do to show these icons is class the div with an ID of patabs , the ul with a class of patabs , the li span with a class of icon , and set the id of each li to the name that matches .
Yahoo saves five HTTP requests by loading one composite CSS sprite for this section , rather than six separate images .
Note that Yahoo automatically expands the tab on rollover with JavaScript . < div id =" patabs " > < ul id =" tabs1 " class= " patabs first " > < li id =" mail " class = " first " > < div > < h4 > < a id =" pamail " accesskey= " m " href= " r / m2 " >< span class= " icon " >
Mail </ span></a></h4 > </div> </ li > < li id =" messenger " > < div > < h4 > < a id =" pamsgr " href= " r/ p1 " >< span class= " icon " >
Messenger </ span></a> </h4 > </div > </ li > < li id =" music " class = " last " > < div > < h4 > < a id =" pamusic " href= " r / uf " >< span class= " icon " >
Radio</ span></a> </h4 > </div > </li> Yahoo !
Directory CSS Sprite
For the main set of icons on the left side of Yahoo , they use a multiple column composite sprite ( see Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 : Yahoo.com trough.gif CSS Sprite ( truncated )
The first two rules set up the list and the background image for the anchor within each li .
# trough li{ padding : 3 px 0 3px 5 px ; p\adding : 3px 0 ; margin - left :- 15 px ; ma\rgin - left:0 ; } # trough li a{ display : block ; _display : inline ; min-height : 12 px ; padding : 3px 0 3 px 25 px ; margin : - 1px 0 - 2 px ; background : url ( http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/ww/sp/trough_1.4.gif) 0 0 no -repeat ; font : bold 84 % verdana ; voice - family : " \" }\ " " ; voice - family : inherit ; property : value ; _margin - left:0 ; } CSS Hacks Note that Yahoo !
uses a number of CSS hacks to allow for different browsers in their code .
They also create different style sheets optimized for different user agents , a non-trivial amount of work .
They include the backslash hack , underscore hack , voice family hack , and property : value ; hack which is part of another CSS hack .
Here are some URLs for more information on CSS hacks and filters .
Includes Yahoo's property : value hack , not recommended

http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=FrontPage
http://websitetips.com/css/solutions/
Tantek 's Box Model Hack Next , Yahoo marks up the " trough " bulleted list on the left side of their home page .
To access the second column , they shift the background 400 pixels to the left .
So for the first item in the list , i.e. , " answers , " they shift the background sprite 400 pixels to the left , then 120 pixels down to display the green starred icon. < div id =" colcx " > < div id =" left " > < div id =" trough " class= " md " > < div class= " bd " > < div id =" trough - cols " class= " fixfloat " > < ul id =" trough - 1 " class = " col1 " > < li > < a style= " " href= " r / 4 d " >
Answers</a></li> < li ><a style= " background -position :-400 px - 440 px " href= " r / 2h " >
Autos</a></li> < li ><a style= " background-position:0 - 761 px " href= " r/25 " >
Finance</a></li> </ul >
Same idea as before , but the positioning is embedded within the code .
They could accomplish the same effect by using : # trough .answers { background - position : - 400 px - 120 p x ; } within their style sheet , and using < li > < a style = " answers " href= " r / 4 d " >
Answers</a></li>
But adding these classes adds a bit more code since this is a one - off .
You can create simple one - dimensional CSS sprites or use two or more columns for more complex applications .
To maximize accessibility and usability , CSS sprites are best used for icons associated with links , or for decorative effects .
AOL found that using CSS sprites for every graphic caused accessibility and usability problems for browsers in " High Contrast Mode " on Windows machines .
Conclusion
This article shows how AOL and Yahoo !
use CSS sprites to improve performance for their busy home pages .
CSS sprites save HTTP requests by using CSS positioning to selectively display composite background images .
Another benefit of CSS sprites is that the combined image is often smaller in file size than the individual images , despite adding whitespace between images .
The smaller size of sprites is due to the reduced overhead of multiple color tables and formatting information required by separate images .
To maximize accessibility and usability , CSS sprites are best used for icons or decorative effects .

“ The natives are restless ” — I used to get indignant when I heard that paternalistic , sometimes cynical phrase .
Now I try to smile .
For one , I hear it a lot in my line of work , and it gets tiresome to always think ill of someone whose diction deceives her intentions .
But mostly I smile because I want the cliché to mean something else , a portent for positive change , the end of calamitous rule , a new era for the meek .
So when the meek turn restless , it should mean that justice is around the corner .
With last week 's passing of Guinea 's senile dictator , Lansana Conté , and the military coup that followed , the country is marking no deviation from a well - rehearsed choreography , enacted repeatedly since independence from the French in 1958 .
The dance moves are economical , simple for new generations of political elites to learn .
A leader emerges , accedes power bolstered by populist rhetoric , buys off the military , installs single - party rule .
Cronyism flourishes , rule of law evaporates , the military shores up the trappings of statehood .
Decades pass ; the population languishes .
Leader then dies , military resumes control until a new leader - puppet is found .
For nine million Guineans , the spectacle and squalor continue .
Conté down for the count
Conté belonged to a dwindling species of wizened and paranoid leaders - for - life , whose ranks include Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and Omar Bongo of Gabon .
Once hailed as liberators and visionaries , they became pathetic parables of ' absolute power corrupting absolutely ' .
The psychological path from flamboyant liberator to murderous despot is dramatic stuff , and was ably fictionalized in The Last King of Scotland .
An excellent non-fiction account of Mobutu Sese Seko ’s rise and fall is Mobutu , Roi du Zaire , by Thierry Michel .
Not so for Conté .
A diabetic chain - smoker who rarely appeared in public , Conté was a garden - variety despot whose life and career will be quickly forgotten , even by Guineans .
In the murky hours after Conté ’s death , a military junta declared power .
Western powers demanded an immediate return to civilian rule ; a rote bit of finger wagging that has surely never produced a single result .
Alluding to the high propensity for carnage in this West African neighborhood , Senegalese President Wade recently appealed for acceptance of Guinea ’s new military junta .
Although highly predatory and wholly opportunistic , the Guinean national military arguably prevented the country from sliding into the chaos of its neighbors , Liberia , Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast , for whom Guinea served for years as a place of refuge .
The intent of Wade ’s appeal is ambiguous .
Another leader - for - life in the making and no friend of opposition parties or the free press , Wade 's point may be that civilian rule and democracy are over - rated , and that in such places security is primordial .
He may also be a proponent of ' negative solidarity ' , as my Burundian friends call it , between African leaders who defend one another till the bitter end .
Witness the deafening silence from African leaders regarding Mugabe .
Amazonian propaganda and guided missiles
Still , it is all deeply disappointing and predictable .
Decades of syphilitic , jack - booted rule finally falls flat in the dust , and a unified populace stares blankly while an army faction takes control .
Is it that foreign occupiers are enough to mobilize popular resistance ( e.g. , anti-colonialism ) but when the oppressor is your brother you sit on your hands ?
Compared to the colonial era , today ’s absence of constructive , popular political agency in the world ’s poorest countries is mystifying and exasperating .
Back then , Sekou Toure led Guinea to independence and stood proud on the world stage , with adulation from Kennedy and visits from Castro .
[ ST ’s political compass is clear in these photos : star worship for Castro and distraction with Kennedy . ]
Like Mugabe and other liberators , it did n’t take long for Sekou Toure to relish the pleasures of despotism .
Conté took him down in 1984 and lived to repeat the tale .
Sekou
Toure did leave one legacy of note , a massive musical propaganda machine , similar to that created and cultivated by Mobutu in Zaire .
Of the dozens of propaganda bands still playing in Guinea , most notable are the Amazones de Guinée , an all female troupe pictured here .
A tidy description of all these different bands , with audio / video footage , can be found here .
Today , any damn idiot can fill a political vacuum in a place like Guinea , and there are dozens of Guineas in Africa .
Coups flourish , generally over control of resources , led by marginalized power bases organized along ethnic lines .
Mr. Bottom Billion , Paul Collier , wrote an op - ed earlier this year “ in praise of coups , ” suggesting that the West get back to its once successful business of engineering political putsches where it needed an ally .
Only this time , Collier argued , we should do it in favor of better governance by capable partners , and put an end to kleptocracies run by mandarins - cum - raving despots .
Responses to the article were predictable : a fantastical notion ; there are no such ‘ guided missiles ’ in politics .
As a dream , though , I understand the appeal of Collier ’s idea .
Social engineering does n’t sound so evil when the outcome is a guaranteed net gain .
And most people grasp that freedom without structure is a desert , so they might welcome the trade - off .
For the meek who get nothing and have nothing , I wonder what they might say to Collier , or anyone who just wants Africa to work .
Like me , Joe Plumbers in Africa want little to do with politics ; they just want politicians to do their jobs .
Their government ’s failings are not their own .
So when the ship starts sinking , no one ’s interested in going down with it .
Who would be ?
That ’s when the jack - boots and ammo cartridges are at their most frenzied .
A company run by the Conservative Party treasurer Michael Spencer gave advice to almost half the councils facing a funding crisis as a result of the collapse of Iceland 's banks , an investigation by The Independent reveals .
Those councils who used Butlers for strategic advice were almost twice as likely to have lost money in the three main Icelandic banks as those advised by other companies .
Of the 116 local authorities who lost money , 51 received advice from Butlers .
Their losses totalled £ 470 m , more than half the total amount of council funds frozen in the banks .
The Independent 's two - month investigation has been passed to the Communities Select Committee , which today begins an inquiry into local government finance , sparked by the disastrous decision of councils to invest £ 886 m in Iceland 's economy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Councils such as Kent ( £ 50 m ) , Norfolk ( £ 32.5 m ) , Dorset ( £ 28.1 m ) , Hertfordshire ( £ 28 m ) and Barnet ( £ 27.4 m ) ploughed millions into Iceland 's tottering banks to take advantage of market - beating interest rates .
Butlers also brokered their investments through its parent company , ICAP , among other brokers , all of whom received commission from the Icelandic banks .
ICAP insists the two divisions were " segregated " and regulated by the Financial Services Authority , adding that Butlers supplied councils with creditratings of institutions , rather than advising on individual transactions .
Several councils claim they were not warned early enough about the vulnerability of the banks , despite Butlers being contracted to evaluate and monitor their creditworthiness .
Credit agencies began downgrading the banks in February 2008 .
In April , Fitch put the three banks on negative rating watch .
Their ratings were downgraded in May , September and October .
An inquiry by the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers at Tory - controlled Kent County Council found that Butlers had only warned Kent about the banks on 30 September , the same day the Icelandic government took control of the country 's third largest bank , Glitnir .
PwC 's report quoted KCC saying Kent did not employ specialist treasury staff and relied on the expertise of Butlers : " We are surprised and disappointed that despite meeting with senior managers on September 29 , the advisers did not raise any concerns about the situation in Iceland . "
An email on 30 September notifying the council of the situation was sent to a junior staff member and was not read in time – Kent sank a further £ 3 m into Landsbanki's UK subsidiary , Heritable .
The investment is a fraction of the £ 1.2bn of public money trapped in Iceland .
Transport for London had £ 40 m invested and the Metropolitan Police Authority had £ 30 m , including £ 20 m invested on 23 September .
Overall , police authorities had £ 92 m invested and universities £ 77 m but the biggest losers were councils .

The Independent 's research shows that 35 per cent of councils advised by Butlers lost money in Iceland , compared with one in five that employed other advisers .
The investments of councils advised by Sector Treasury Services accounted for £ 313 m of frozen council funds .
About half of all UK councils use the services of the company , which is part of the Capita group .
The 40 local authority clients with Arlingclose lost no money because the company had been warning against investing in Iceland since May 2006 .
" There were plenty of signs that things were n't adding up , " the company director , Mark Horsfield , said .
ICAP said that Butlers had advised local authorities on the " structure and organisation " of their investments : " The decision as to with which institution to place funds was made by each local authority . "
The scale of Butlers ' involvement in the crisis will embarrass the Tories , who control many of the affected councils .
It is also a blow for Mr Spencer , the chief executive of ICAP who holds a 20 per cent stake in the listed company .

Canada 's Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) famously decided last year to allow Bell Canada to single out P2P traffic for bandwidth throttling between the hours of 4:30 pm to 2 am .
But even as it allowed a practice that the US Federal Communications Commission had just put the kibosh on , the CRTC also launched a much broader hearing on the entire issue of network neutrality .
With the ISP responses now in , it 's clear just how widespread deep packet inspection ( DPI ) has become at Canadian ISPs .
It 's enough to make staff Canuck Frank Caron weep into his Molson's .
Cold - filtered Internet
Christopher Parsons , a grad student at the University of Victoria ( the Fightin ' Vikes ! ) , has done yeoman 's work by combing through the numerous ( and lengthy ) ISP submissions to CRTC and compiling them into a set of tables ( PDF ) .
This makes it simple to compare responses across ISPs , and one of the obvious places to start is with filtering .
So who uses DPI to throttle Internet traffic ?
Bell Canada :
Yes , with a vengeance , but only P2P between 4:30 pm and 2am
Cogeco Cable : Yes
MTS Allstream : No
Rogers Cable : Confidential ( but probably yes )
Saskatchewan Telecom : No
Primus Telecom : No
Shaw : Yes
Barrett Xplore : Yes , and also prioritizes VoIP
TELUS : No
Bragg : Confidential
The list above might make it seem that only half of Canada 's responding ISPs use filtering , but a bare list takes no account of size .
Bell , Rogers , and Shaw are three enormous ISPs that together dwarf everyone else on the list , and all three appear to be throttling traffic .
What kind of traffic ?
Peer - to - peer , of course .
Cogeco says that heavy P2P use as far back as 2001 led it to adopt throttling schemes .
Bell notes that its DPI gear was at first just intended for billing , but the company then decided that it needed to use it for throttling as well .
Rogers wanted to avoid becoming " the world 's buffet , " whatever that means , and so clamped down on P2P because of its " unfair " use of many concurrent TCP connections .
Throttling in action at Bell Canada
The cable providers are generally concerned about their upstream bandwidth ( as was Comcast in the US ) , since it is far lower than downstream and is shared with an entire neighborhood of homes .
A few P2P users are capable of gumming up the upstream link for the entire node .
Many ISPs , even those not currently throttling traffic , still want to move to a usage - based pricing model .
Most companies , including Bell , are shifting to a usage - based pricing model , though several are willing to combine consumption caps with throttling .
( Bragg , which has already tried usage caps in the past , notes that customers responded poorly to them . )
When it comes to disclosing the existence of throttling , it 's clear that most ISPs would really prefer not to make a public production .
When Shaw introduced Arbor - Ellacoya DPI gear into its network , for instance , it did n't notify customers .
Rogers , likewise , does not " proactively " notify customers about its management practices .
Cogeco wo n't provide detailed information about what it does because that might allow the bad guys to bypass its systems .
Others put the information into legal documents .
Bell Canada goes so far as to offer a FAQ and a way to report problems with the throttling system , though this may be due more to Bell 's recent CRTC hearing than to the company 's love of transparency .
And speaking of transparency , most of the important information in the filings was provided on a " confidential " basis and is not currently available to anyone but CRTC staff .
This includes link utilization thresholds , detailed traffic growth numbers , and ( most ) vendors of the DPI gear involved in the throttling .
CRTC is moving rapidly with the proceeding , and all final reply comments are due by the end of April .
A public hearing is set for July 6 in Gatineau , Quebec , after which the CRTC will presumably rule on the question of just what sorts of bandwidth throttling measures Canadian ISPs will be allowed to take .
Ryanair plans to undercut its struggling competitors on prices
Budget airline Ryanair is to offer flights to the US for eight pounds , by buying planes from struggling rivals .
The plan will be revealed when chief executive Michael O'Leary announces the firm 's quarterly results on Monday .
" Economy class will be very cheap , around 10 euros , but our business class will be very expensive , " he said in a newspaper interview .
Ryanair 's second quarter profits are expected to fall , due to higher fuel prices and its decision to cut fares .
Mr O'Leary is expected to announce plans to buy more than 50 extra aircraft , as part of plans to beat the recession by undercutting more expensive rivals .
" We 'll just have to keep flying more aircraft , opening up more routes and offering people more cheap flights , " Mr O'Leary said .
Profits down
The flights - which could begin by the end of next year - would be available for those booking early .
Passengers would pay airport taxes on top of the fares .
The transatlantic flights are likely to go from Stansted and Dublin airports to New York , Florida , Los Angeles , San Francisco and Boston .
Meanwhile , it is expected that Ryanair 's quarterly profits will drop significantly .
Royal Bank of Scotland is forecasting net earnings of 145 m euros ( £ 115 m ; $ 184 m ) for Ryanair for the second quarter , down from 260 m euros last year .
While the oil price has come down lately , analysts say Ryanair is still suffering because it insured against changing fuel costs at too high a price .
Mr O'Leary has said he expected the airline to make a profit for the full year as long as oil stays below $ 70 a barrel .
Claire Evans wrote an interesting article on scientist John Underkoffler 's " spatial operating environment " g- speak for GOOD last week .
Unlike current operating systems ( Vista , Leopard , etc. ) which are designed entirely around the mouse , g - speak responds to the organic human movement of the user , without a mouse .
This could potentially have significant consequences for how we interface with computers , which is precisely why g - speak is so compelling .
Excerpt below :
After all , computers -- with their processors , memory , graphics , and networked view of the world -- are offering us increasingly complex possibilities for translating and interacting with 1s and 0s .
Yet , the way we use computers has n’t changed appreciably since the 1980s : we still click around a screen with a mouse or track pad .
The makers of g- speak know that this sort of control does n't take advantage of how the human brain works .
According to Underkoffler , the brain regions that controls muscles , muscle memory , and proprioception ( the sense of where your body is in space ) and the visual system evolved to work together to deal with spatial situations .
" That 's why we ’re all such experts at getting around and manipulating the real world , " he says .
" So it seems clear to us that computers should work the same way . "
Probably her most eye catching feature though is the hood .
I designed the image itself , and the design went through several incarnations before paint got anywhere near the hood , but the actual final " brush - to - car " painting you see here was literally done with brushes and acrylics , courtesy of a local tattoo artist who worked on it over a period of two days .
I ’m not much of an artist myself , and since my initial concept was really vague , we had a few disagreements about the design as it was coming together and ended up compromising on a few things ( like the hair and the tattoo on her arm )
The basic idea was to give it that “ pin- up girl ” feel , like something you might see on the side of an old World War II era fighter , and you can see elements of that in the “ kill marks ” spraypainted with stencil along the “ nose ” of the car .

WASHINGTON –
The United States has decided not to attack Iran 's nuclear facilities and turned down an Israeli request to help the Jewish state strike there itself , The New York Times reported Saturday .
According to the report , Israel has abandoned the idea for now , after estimating that it was incapable of damaging the Iranian nuclear program significantly .
Opinion
Is world being distracted ?
Ashley Perry Is Gaza war an Iranian ploy to divert attention away from nuke program ?
Is world being distracted ?
Bush was convinced by top administration officials , led by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ( who is to remain in office in the new Obama administration ) , that any overt attack on Iran would probably prove ineffective , lead to the expulsion of international inspectors and drive Iran ’s nuclear effort further out of view .
The report also suggested that while Bush was extensively briefed on options for an overt American attack on Iran ’s facilities , he never instructed the Pentagon to move beyond contingency planning , even during the final year of his presidency .
Gates ’ spokesman , Geoff Morrell , said last week that the defense secretary believed “ a potential strike on the Iranian facilities is not something that we or anyone else should be pursuing at this time . ”
According to the report , the tense exchanges prompted the White House to step up intelligence - sharing with Israel and brief Israeli officials on new American efforts to subtly sabotage Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure , a major covert program that Bush is about to hand off to President - elect Barack Obama .
Efforts to penetrate nuclear supply chain
According to the NY Times , Bush embraced more intensive covert operations actions aimed at Iran , having concluded that the financial sanctions imposed by the US and its allies were failing to slow Iran 's uranium enrichment efforts .
The covert American program , which started in early 2008 , includes renewed American efforts to penetrate Iran ’s nuclear supply chain abroad , along with new efforts , some of them experimental , to undermine electrical systems , computer systems and other networks on which Iran relies .
It is aimed at delaying the day that Iran can produce the weapons - grade fuel and designs it needs to produce a workable nuclear weapon .
There are conflicting estimates regarding to ability to halt or delay the nuclear plan this way , but some say the Israelis would not have been dissuaded from conducting an attack if they believed that the American effort was unlikely to prove effective .
The covert plan had two specific objectives :
To slow progress at Natanz and other known and suspected nuclear facilities , and keep the pressure on a little - known Iranian professor named Mohsen Fakrizadeh , a scientist described in classified portions of American intelligence reports as deeply involved in an effort to design a nuclear warhead for Iran .
Bush authorized a broad effort aimed at the entire industrial infrastructure that supports the Iranian nuclear program .
Some of the efforts focused on ways to destabilize the centrifuges .
Since his election on November 4 , Obama has been extensively briefed on the American actions in Iran , though his transition aides have refused to comment on the issue , the report said .
Early in his presidency , Obama must decide whether the covert actions begun by Bush are worth the risks of disrupting what he has pledged will be a more active diplomatic effort to engage with Iran .

* Will mull appropriateness of banks ’ forex debt ratings
* Unlikely to lower banks below S.Korea ’s A2 rating
* Has not changed outlook on S. Korea ’s rating
( Update with details , background )
By Rafael Nam
HONG KONG , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) - Moody ’s may downgrade 10 South Korean banks whose foreign currency debt ratings are above the country ’s sovereign rating , saying the higher ratings were inappropriate given they rely on the government to secure external funding .
Beleaguered South Korean lenders have struggled to raise dollars since the global financial crisis pummelled the domestic won currency KRW= as their high debt spreads make it costly for them to tap overseas markets .
Moody ’s is the only of the three major credit ratings agencies -- the others being Standard & Poor ’s and Fitch -- to currently assign a higher rating for some South Korean banks than the country ’s sovereign rating .
Moody ’s Investors Service also noted it was unlikely to lower the banks below South Korea ’s current A2 rating , the sixth - highest investment grade rating .
It said it had not changed its outlook on South Korea ’s own rating .
“ The review will consider the appropriateness of the banks ’ foreign currency debt ratings vis-a - vis the Korean government ’s given the banks ’ heavy dependence on government support to secure external funding during this crisis , ” Moody ’s said in a statement on Thursday .
Korea Development Bank ( KDB ) , which was included in Moody ’s list , was due to sell at least $ 1 billion in dollar bonds as early as next week .
Those plans are now “ up in the air ” , according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation .
State - owned KDB is rated Aa3 by Moody ’s , or two notches above South Korea ’s sovereign rating .
Among the lenders affected is another government - owned company , Export - Import Bank of Korea ( KEXIM ) , which sold $ 2 billion in five - year bonds on Monday .
South Korea last month said it would make available a 20 trillion won ( $ 14.63 billion ) fund to recapitalise banks .
The finance ministry has said it expects banks to be able to roll over all their external debt due in the first half of 2009 , helped by government and central bank plans to supply a combined $ 55 billion in foreign currency liquidity to money markets .
South Korea has $ 200 billion in foreign exchange reserves and also has a U.S. Federal Reserve credit line of $ 30 billion sealed in October , as well as swap lines with Japan and China .
Major South Korean banks have $ 8.9 billion in G3 currency denominated bonds and loans maturing in 2009 , according to BNP Paribas .
G3 refers to dollars , euros and yen .
Commercial lenders were already facing tough odds in raising money overseas after their bond spreads surged since the crisis .
The cost of insurance protection against a default in Kookmin Bank ’s senior debt , for example , is trading at 380 basis points as measured by its credit default swap ( CDS ) .
That is 50 bps higher than South Korea ’s sovereign CDS spread even if the country ’s biggest lender is rated two notches higher by Moody’s .
“ We believe it may be inappropriate to rate banks ’ foreign currency obligations higher than their government ’s ability to access the necessary foreign exchange , ” said Moody ’s in a statement earlier on Thursday explaining its reasoning .
“ That ability is , we believe , a function of their government ’s capacity to repay its own foreign currency debt and can therefore be measured by the government ’s foreign currency debt rating . ”
Other lenders included among Moody 's potential downgrades are Citibank Korea , the local unit of Citigroup C.N , along with Hana Bank , Industrial Bank of Korea 024110.KS , Kookmin , and National Agricultural Cooperative Federation .
Shinhan Bank , Woori Bank and Woori Finance Holdings 053000 .KS are also affected , Moody 's said .

When brought up , they often try to change the subject and for example attack you , asking what criminal acts you have on your conscience or if you are payed by the drug cartells or something .
According to Scientology all critics of Scientology are criminals , that 's why they are critics .
Nice logic .
This is only standard Scientology tech , it 's part of the training they have payed a fortune to learn .
Hubbard said so , period .
If you manage to see through their stupid personal attacks and desperate distractions , you may manage to force them to ward it off by telling you the Fair Game policy letter was cancelled in 1968 .
But keep in mind that Scientologists are trained to lie and never defend , always attack ( and generate money ) .
I got the actual cancellation letter they refere to right here :
HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS
OFFICE Saint Hill Manor , East Grinstead , Sussex HCO Policy Letter of 21 October 1968 CANCELLATION OF FAIR GAME
The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease .
FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order .
It causes bad public relations .
This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP .
LRH : ci:cden L. RON HUBBARD Copyright ( c ) 1968 Founder by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
Comments :
It is bad enough that such a policy ever was made in the first place , even if it truly had been cancelled later .
This HCO Policy Letter ( HCO P/L ) does not cancel the policy , it only cancels the use of the term ' Fair Game ' .
It states clearly that the practice described in the policy ( deprived of property , injured , tricked , sued , lied to or destroyed ) is not cancelled .
The " Church " of Scientology does not change anything because it 's wrong , no , they change it because it gives bad PR !
I personally got a copy of the course manual " PTS / SP COURSE - How to Confront and Shatter Suppression " as printed by the cult in 1989 .
This extract is from page 128 and shows that not even the wording was really changed after all :
If there is no agreement to be audited and the student who is found to be a suppressive person will not respond to A to E ( because student has blown and can't be found or because the student flatly refuses ) , the student is considered terminated .
A waiver or quit claim is given or sent the student stating Date _____________ Place_____________
I , __________________________ , having refused to abide by the Code of ( name and place of org ) do hereby waive any further rights I may have as a Scientologist , and in return for my course fee of _________________ , I do hereby quit any claim I may have on ( name of org ) or any Scientologist personell or any person or group or organization of Scientology .
Signed_________________________________________________
2 Witnesses_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
Only when this is signed the student may have his course fee returned , but no other fees as he accepted that service .
The ex-student should realize this makes him Fair Game and outside our Justice Codes .
He may not have recourse of any kind beyond refund .
And after signing can only return to Scientology as per policy on Fair Game .
Jon Atack writes in " The cancellation of Fair Game " :
77 . In Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California ( the " mother church " of the Churches of Scientology at the time the suit was filed ) , the California Appeal Court ruled , in a decision upheld by the US Supreme Court : " Wollersheim was compelled to abandon his wife and his family through the policy of disconnect .
When his mental illness reached such a level he actively planned his suicide , he was forbidden to seek professional help .
Finally , when Wollersheim was able to leave the Church , it subjected him to financial ruin through its policy of ' fair game ' . "
( JCA - 147 , pp.A -7 , 15 & 16 ) .
At appeal , Scientology asserted that " fair game " was a " core practice of Scientology " , and therefore protected as " religious expression " .
This position was also made on behalf of Scientology in the case against Gerald Armstrong , in 1984 , by religious expert Dr. Frank Flinn ( JCA - 45 ) .
JCA - 45 .

In my opinion this clearly shows organized criminal activity , exactly what we try to warn people about .
This cult uses the law and claims to be a " bona fide religion " only to defend its horrid organized activities !
It may be hard to imagine , but there are lots more where this comes from .
How far are these people really willing to go ?
I say it is about time we put down our foot and said : STOP !

A motorcyclist died in a freak accident when a pheasant crashed into his helmet , an inquest was told .
The bird hit 52 - year - old Ian Bottomley on the head and caused him to swerve into an embankment and fall off his bike .
Police found Bottomley , a father of two from Preston , Lancashire , lying motionless in the road and surrounded by feathers .
The accident happened on the A683 in Hornby , near Lancaster , on May 10 .
Bottomley was said to have been travelling at up to 77 mph on the road with a maximum speed of 60 mph , but assistant deputy coroner Derek Baker said speed was not a factor in the death .
The inquest heard the motorcycle was in roadworthy condition and there were no defects on the carriageway .
Recording a verdict of accidental death , Baker said : " This could not have been anticipated , nothing could have been done to prevent it . "
Poison Threat RICIN : Seattle Gay Bars Receive Threatening Letters
Originally posted on Tuesday , January 6 , at 3:40 PM .
Eleven gay bars in Seattle received letters today addressed to the " Owner / Manager " from someone claiming to be in the possession of ricin , a deadly poison .
" Your establishment has been targeted , " the letter begins .
" I have in my possession approximately 67 grams of ricin with which I will indiscriminately target at least five of your clients . "
" I felt sick when I read it , " said Carla , the owner / manager of Re-bar .
" It 's so vile .
It 's just hatred .
It made me worry for all the other bars , and for my bartenders , and our clientele . "
According to the CDC 's website , someone who has ingested " a significant amount " will develop vomiting and diarrhea within the first 6 - 12 hours ; other symptoms of ricin poisoning include hallucinations , seizures , and blood in the urine .
There is no antidote for ricin but ricin exposure is not invariably fatal .
" I just had the police come pick [ the letter ] up , " said Keith Christensen , the manager of the Eagle , when reached by phone .
Christensen had already heard about the letter from other bar owners and managers , and so he did n't open it .
" It 's probably nothing , " Christensen added , " but the economy is really screwing all the bars right now , and the last thing we need is something ramping up the not - go - out mode people seem to be in right now .
It 's really freaky that someone would do something like this at a time like this . "
Christensen says he 's posted signs at the Eagle advising patrons not to leave their drinks unattended .
" The police have already come and gone , " said Roland , the manager at Madison Pub .
" They collected the letter and that 's about it .
I do n't think it 's anything to worry about it . "
Roland admitted to being unnerved by the letter at first .
" But after the initial ' what ? ' , it 's like whatever . "
A letter also arrived in The Stranger 's offices , addressed to the attention of " Obituaries . "
The letter 's author said the paper should " be prepared to announce the deaths of approximately 55 individuals all of whom were patrons of the following establishments on a Saturday in January . "
The listed bars are : the Elite , Neighbours , Wild Rose , the Cuff , Purr , the Eagle , R Place , Re-bar , CC's , Madison Pub , and the Crescent .
" I could take this moment to launch into a diatribe about my indignation towards the gay community , " the letter concludes , " however , I think the deaths will speak for themselves . "
Alison , Luying , and Tippett , local promoters and DJs who do nights at various bars around town , came up with the idea of organizing a pub crawl for this Friday night to show support for the bars that were threatened .
Carla at Re-bar added that , as distressing as the letter was , she was pleased with the response from the community .
" Everyone is calling each other , everyone 's got each other 's backs . "

Fear of Failing ?
The Many Meanings of Difficulty in Video Games Jesper Juul
www.jesperjuul.net
From Mark J. P. Wolf & Bernard Perron ( eds. ) : The Video Game Theory Reader 2 . New York : Routledge 2009 .
pp. 237-252 .
Winning is n’t everything
It is quite simple :
When you play a game , you want to win .
Winning makes you happy , losing makes you unhappy .
If this seems self - evident , there is nonetheless a contradictory viewpoint , according to which games should be “ neither too easy nor too hard ” , implying that players also want not to win , at least part of the time .
This is a contradiction I will try resolve in what follows .
The question is : Question 1 : What is the role of failure in video games ?
The simplest theory of failure states that failing serves as a contrast to winning , that failure thereby makes winning all the more enjoyable .
There is , however , much more to failure .
The study of players discussed in this essay indicates that failure serves the deeper function of making players readjust their perception of a game .
In effect , failure adds content by making the player see new nuances in a game .
The study shows that players have quite elaborate theories of failure as a source of enjoyment in games .
Even so , given the negative connotations of failing , would a game be better received if players did not feel responsible for failing , but rather blamed failures on the game or on bad luck ?
This is the second question : Question 2 : Do players prefer games where they do not feel responsible for failing ?
This study strongly indicates that this is not the case .
Players clearly prefer feeling responsible for failing in a game ; not feeling responsible is tied to a negative perception of a game .
In effect , this sharpens the contradiction between players as wanting to win and players wanting games to be challenging : failing , and feeling responsible for failing , makes players enjoy a game more , not less .
Closer examination reveals that the apparent contradiction originates from two separate perspectives on games : a goal - oriented perspective wherein players want to win , and an aesthetic perspective wherein players prefer games with the right amount of challenge and variation .
Nevertheless , these two perspectives still present opposing considerations – the goal - oriented perspective suggests that games should be as easy as possible ; the aesthetic perspective suggests that games should not be too easy .
To examine this , I will look take a closer look at the role of failure and punishment .
I am writing here about single - player games .
1 Failure and Punishment Failure can be described as being unsuccessful at some task in a game , and punishment is what happens to the player as a result .
We can distinguish between different types of punishment for player failure : 2 Energy punishment :
Loss of energy , bringing the player closer to life punishment .
: Loss of energy , bringing the player closer to life punishment .
Life punishment :
Loss of a life ( or “ retry ” ) , bringing the player closer to game termination .
: Loss of a life ( or “ retry ” ) , bringing the player closer to game termination .
Game termination punishment : Game over .
: Game over .
Setback punishment : Having to replay part of the game ; losing abilities .
Losing energy brings the player closer to losing a life , and losing a life often leads to some type of setback .
In this perspective , all failures eventually translate into setbacks , and the player ’s use of time and energy is the most fundamental currency of games .
Whereas early video games in the arcade , on the home console , or for personal computers , tended to force the player to replay the entire game after failing , many home games from the mid-1980s and on became much more lenient by dispersing save points , allowing the player to save the game at will , or letting the player restart at the latest level played even after game over .
As a recent example of this design principle , after reaching game over in Super Mario Galaxy ( Nintendo EAD Tokyo , 2007 ) , the player loses of coins and collectables , but not overall progress in the game .
In the new area of downloadable casual games , 3 there is a movement from life punishment to energy punishment , with many games featuring energy bars , timers , or other types of soft evaluations of player performance as with the timer in Big City Adventure : San Francisco ( Jolly Bear Games 2007 ) ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Big City Adventure : San Francisco - a timer gradually runs out .
( Jolly Bear Games 2007 )
The psychological attribution theory provides a framework for examining different types of failure and punishment in games .
According to attribution theory , for any event , people tend to attribute that event to certain causes .
Harold K. Kelley distinguishes between three types of attributions that people can make in an event involving a person and an entity : Person :
The event was caused by personal traits , such as skill or disposition .
: The event was caused by personal traits , such as skill or disposition .
Entity :
The event was caused by characteristics of the entity .
: The event was caused by characteristics of the entity .
Circumstances :
The event was based on transient causes such as luck , chance , or an extraordinary effort from the person .
F. Försterling , Attribution : An Introduction to Theories , Research and Applications ( London : Psychology Press , 2001 ) , 46 - 47 , hereafter cited in the text as Försterling .
In the case of receiving a low grade for a school test , a person may decide that this was due to ( a ) person – personal disposition such as lack of skill , ( b ) entity – an unfair test , or ( c ) circumstance – having slept badly , having not studied enough .
This maps quite well to many common exclamations in video gaming : a player who loses a game can claim that “ I am terrible at video games ” , “ This is an unfair game ” , or “ I will win next time ” .
During the research for this essay , I developed the hypothesis that energy punishment is being more widely used because it makes the cause of failure less obvious :
If the game is over due to a single , identifiable mistake , it is straightforward for the player to attribute failure to his or her own performance or skill ( circumstance or person ) , but if the game is over due to an accumulation of small mistakes , the player is less likely to feel responsible for failing , and the player should be less likely to experience failing as an emotionally negative event .
This is the second question mentioned in the introduction : do players prefer feeling less responsible for failing ?
Video Game Theory Through Game Prototypes
To elaborate this discussion , a game prototype study was conducted .
This is not without precedent .
In a study made 25 years ago , Thomas W. Malone explored the question “ Why are computer games so captivating ? ” by creating a number of game prototypes with the same core game , but with different features ( music , scorekeeping , fantasy , types of feedback ) ( Malone 1982 ) .
In order to explore the attraction of the variations of the game , he let some children play these prototypes and examined how long each prototype was able to keep the attention of young players .
From this , he deducted a number of guidelines for developing games and interfaces .
Following Malone , the questions in this essay can be approached as empirical questions – What do players prefer ?
They can , however , also be approached as aesthetic questions – What is a good game ?
These are two historically separate approaches that I nevertheless believe can inform each other in the following .
In collaboration with the game company Gamelab , I developed a game prototype specifically designed to gather data on how players perceive failure .
The custom game could be described as a combination of Pac - Man ( Namco 1980 ) and Snake ( Originally Gremlin 1977 ) : using the mouse , the player controls a snake that grows as the player collects pills ; the player must avoid opponents ; and a special power pill allows the player to attack opponents for a short while ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : Game prototype for the test .
The game was designed with two game modes , an energy punishment mode where the player would lose a tail part when hit by opponents , and a life punishment mode where the player could make only a single mistake before losing a life .
In both games , the player has three lives , and the game consists of four levels .
We attempted to balance the two games so that they were equally hard ( as measured in the number of levels that players would complete ) .
Another reason for developing a new game was that this would give insight to the players ’ initial experience of learning a new game , and be less a reflection of their previous experience with that game .
First Test , Offline A preliminary test was conducted offline .
Five males and four females from Gamelab ’s tester base participated .
All participants had some experience with and interest in games , and came to the Gamelab offices ( see Appendix 1 at the end of this essay for a description of the test procedure ) .
Players were asked how they would rate the game , had they found it on the Internet .
The rating scale went from 1 to 10 , with 10 being the best rating .
Additionally , players were asked open questions about their views on failure in games .
Contrary to expectations , this small sample gave no indication that players preferred the energy punishment version of the game .
On the other hand , there were indications that the players ’ ratings were closely tied to their performance in the game , such that a player performing badly would dislike the game , a player performing fairly well would like the game , but a player performing very well would also dislike the game .
Given the interesting implications of this result , it was decided to focus on only one version of the game ( energy punishment ) , and run a new test online with a bigger sample .
Second Test , Online 85 players were recruited online4 and asked to play the game and answer a questionnaire ( see Appendix 2 for a description of the test procedure ) .
The players recruited were overwhelmingly male ( 73 out of 85 ) , and the majority had a game console in their home ( also 73 out of 85 ) .
Players were generally avid game players ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 : Game - playing frequency .
Game rating vs. performance Based on automated registration of player performances , player responses were placed into three categories , from a bad performance to a good performance :
Players that did not complete the game .
Players that completed the game , losing some lives .
Players that completed the game without losing any lives .
By comparing the average game ratings with the performance of the players ( Figure 4 ) , we can see an indication that winning is n’t everything : the most positive players were the ones that failed some , and then completed the game .
Completing the game without failing was followed by a lower rating of the game .
( The result for all three categories of player performance combined was close to statistical significance ( p=0.06 ) . )
Figure 4 : Player rating of game as function of performance .
This runs counter to the simple idea that players enjoy a game more the better they do , but it vindicates the game design imperative that a game must be neither too hard nor too easy as argued by , for example , Fullerton , Swain , and Hoffman ( 2004 , 249 ) .
This returns us to the second question , of whether feeling responsible for failing in a game will make players like the game less .
In the test , players were asked why they failed or succeeded .
Categories were based on attribution theory , but expanded into smaller subcategories : Person was split into “ I am bad at this kind of game ” and “ I am bad at games in general ” to capture difference between general player skills and player knowledge of specific genres .
was split into “ I am bad at this kind of game ” and “ I am bad at games in general ” to capture difference between general player skills and player knowledge of specific genres .
Entity was asked as “ The game was too hard ” .
was asked as “ The game was too hard ” .
Circumstance was split into “ I was unlucky ” and “ I made a mistake ” in order to distinguish between the experience of losing due to chance and losing due to a strategic mistake .
As can be seen in figure 5 and figure 6 , players were slightly more likely to report being responsible for success ( “ figured out how to play right ” ) than being responsible for failure ( “ made a mistake ” ) .
This is well - known phenomenon called attribution asymmetry , whereby individuals are more likely to attribute success to personal factors , and failure to external factors ( Försterling , 87-91 ) .
Figure 5 : Player attribution of failure
Figure 6 : Player attribution of success .
Do players prefer games where they do not feel responsible for failing ?
This seems not to be the case .
On the contrary , even though players presumably on some level dislike being personally responsible for failing , the feeling of being responsible for failing was nevertheless tied to a positive rating of the game ( see Figure 7 ) .
Figure 7 : Rating as function of failure attribution .
Since players who never lost a life are not relevant , and too few players answered “ I was unlucky ” or “ I am bad at this kind of game ” for the results to be meaningful , we can see how players who answered “ The game was too hard ” rated the game compared to those who answered “ I made a mistake ” .
The result was statistically significant ( p<0.016 ) .
In effect , this answers the second question of this paper – players prefer feeling responsible for their own failure .
Or at least the negative emotions from failing are more than cancelled out by other factors .
This result is parallel to a study of players playing the bowling mini- game in Super Monkey Ball 2 ( Amusement Vision , Ltd. 2002 ) , in which players exhibited positive reactions when falling off the edge of the playing field , but negative reactions of watching the replay of the same event ( Ravaja et al. 2005 ) .
Although players do not want to fail , they may nevertheless enjoy it when feeling responsible for it .
5 Players Reactions
When Not Failing
Do players have theories of the function of failure , and in that case , how do they frame them ?
To find out , players were asked if they had ever experienced a game that was too easy , and “ How do you know if a game is too easy ? ”
Answers were sorted into four categories based on their primary content , listed here with example answers and percentages : Answer type Examples
Too easy as lack of a challenge .
( 36 % ) “ not challenging enough ”
“ boring ... does n’t provide further challenges ”
“ If I do n’t feel challenged .
Of course that ’s a pretty predictable answer , but it ’s hard to put it any other way . ”
“ I get bored ” Too easy as not failing .
( 6 % ) “ When you never die .
And beat it in a day ” .
“ It does n’t seem to challenge me – I never lose ” Too easy as not being measured on performance .
( 5 % ) .
“ I can do things I know are “ wrong ” and do n’t get punished . ”
“ A game is too easy when you are progressing through the game automatically no matter how good you are playing . ”
Too easy as not having to rethink strategy .
( 27 % ) “ When I know exactly what to do and I can do it optimizing the result without ( big ) effort ”
“ No challenge , go through motions to complete it without any thought ”
“ If the challenge and thought require to complete it objectives become second nature quickly or there is no need for such contemplation ”
“ If the method for solving it is obvious and never fails . ”
The first response type , lack of challenge , is somewhat tautological .
Response 4 gives room for more interpretation : if a game being too easy is experienced as the game being shallow and uninteresting , it means that the role of failure is much more than a contrast to winning – failure pushes the player into reconsidering strategy , and failure thereby subjectively adds content to the game .
The game appears deeper when the player fails ; failure makes the game more strategic .
It would be nice to know if the results from this experiment map to players of published commercial games .
In a discussion of the initial disappointing reception of the game Shopmania ( Gamelab 2006 ) , Catherine Herdlick and Eric Zimmerman discuss how much of the criticism of the game came from the fact that it was perceived as too easy :
In the original version of Shopmania , we approached the first several levels of the game as a gradual tutorial that introduced the player to the basic game elements and the core gameplay .
This approach was based on the generally held casual game wisdom that downloadable games should be very easy to play , and that the frustration of losing a level should be minimized .
However , the problem with going too far in this direction is that the game ends up feeling like interactive muzak : you can play forever and not really lose , and the essential tension and challenge of a good game are lost .
From our analysis , players were telling us that the first seven or eight levels felt like a tutorial .
By the third or fourth level , we had playtesters exclaiming out loud , “ I get this game .
Can I skip the tutorial ” Catherine Herdlick and Eric Zimmerman , “ Redesigning Shopmania : A Design Process Case Study , ” IGDA Casual Games Quarterly 2 , no. 1 ( 2006 ) , http://www.igda.org/casual/quarterly/2_1/index.php?id=6
One of the negative comments on Shopmania was about having seen the whole game too early : “ After 20 minutes , felt like I saw the whole game ... ” ( Redesigning )
The “ see ” here probably does not refer directly to concrete graphics or level layouts , as much as it ties into some of the player comments in my experiment :
The players complain about the game not pressuring them , not threatening with failure .
Again , while players may dislike failure , not failing can be as bad as never succeeding .
Flow : The Standard Theory of Failure and Challenge
The standard psychological explanation for game failure and challenge is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ’s theory of Flow ( see Figure 8 ) , according to which the challenge of a given activity forms a narrow channel in which the player is in the attractive flow state ( Csikszentmihalyi 1990 ) .
Figure 8 : The flow channel .
( Csikszentmihalyi 1990 , 74 )
While flow theory does suggest that the player may oscillate between anxiety and boredom , it poses the banal problem that the standard illustration suggests a smooth increase in difficulty over time .
Noah Falstein ( Falstein 2005 ) has refined this to say that game difficulty should vary in waves – sometimes the game should be a little easy , sometimes a little hard , and that irregularity leads to enjoyment , as illustrated in Figure 9 .
An irregular increase in difficulty makes the player more likely to experience both failure and successes .

Conclusions :
The Contradictory Desires of Players I initially discussed a contradiction between the observation that players want to win and the observation that players prefer games where they lose some , then win some .
This leaves us with several opposing considerations indicating that games should be both easier and harder than they are :
The player does not want to fail ( makes player sad , feels inadequate ) .
Failing makes the player reconsider his / her strategy ( which makes the game more interesting ) .
Winning provides gratification .
Winning without failing leads to dissatisfaction .
Points 1 and 3 suggest that games should be very easy , whereas points 2 and 4 suggest that games should not be too easy .
The actual relationship of game design and game playing is probably not as antagonistic as this seems .
A more productive view is that games derive their interest from the interaction between these different considerations , and that the apparent contradiction comes from the fact that games can be viewed from two distinct frames of reference ( see Figure 10 ) .
Playing a game entails ( 1 ) a goal - orientation as part of the activity , but a player also has ( 2 ) an outside view of the game that entails an aesthetic evaluation of game challenge .
This is the source of the contradiction discussed in the introduction , between players wanting to win , and players wanting not just to win .
Figure 10 : Internal and external views of a game .
The second question was whether players would prefer not feeling responsible for failing , and whether the success of casual games consequently could be attributed to the fact that they tend to have energy punishment rather than life punishment , making failure seem less of a direct consequence of player actions .
This idea seems to be largely disproved – player appreciation of the game was tied positively to feeling responsible for failure .
This suggests that I had been focusing on the wrong part of the punishment system , and that the attraction of casual games is better explained as sparing use of setback punishment : failing in casual games is rarely tied to any substantial setback , and never to having to mechanically replay a game sequence .
6
Players still feel responsible for failing , but they are less likely to feel stuck in the game , being forced to replay a part of the game .
Finally , this research points to another layer of complexity in player psychology .
That failure and difficulty is important to the enjoyment of games correlates well with Michael J. Apter ’s reversal theory , according to which people seek low arousal in normal goal - directed activities such as work , but high arousal , and hence challenge and danger , in activities performed for their intrinsic enjoyment , such as games ( Kerr and Apter 1991 , 17 ) .
This yields an extra complication in relation to the game Shopmania discussed previously : if the role of failure is to force players to discover new strategies in a game , why is this even necessary ?
Given that players enjoy a challenge , why do players not simply challenge themselves by finding new ways to play the game ?
Game designer David Jaffe goes as far as asserting that players are basically lazy and “ WILL NOT use ANY mechanic they do not need to use .
They will take the path of least resistance to get from A TO B ” ( Jaffe 2007 ) ..
The conclusion must still be that players want to fail as well as win , but that players of the single - player games discussed here do not seek out additional challenge or depth if they do not have to .
Perhaps single player games are perceived as designed experiences that players expect to be correctly balanced without having to seek additional challenges themselves ?
By contrast , although the focus here has been on single player games , Jonas Heide Smith has documented how players of multiplayer games frequently handicap themselves to create an even playing field , effectively opening themselves to failure ( Smith 2006 , 217-227 ) .
Multiplayer games and more open sandbox games seem to encourage players to undertake more challenge - seeking behavior .
The study raises a number of additional questions , but I believe the following are the most obvious ones to explore further :
Is the relation between game rating and performance also consistent if the game is made easier or harder ?
How do players perceive difficulty in games without time pressure or failure states , such as “ endless ” mode in Bejeweled 2 ( PopCap Games 2004 ) or Sudoku ?
In game development experience , it is certain that small changes to game designs do matter to players .
To what extent can individual elements of a game design be isolated ?
To what extent can we extrapolate from one game to all games ?
Will the results of the test be different with a more “ casual ” audience ?
I have argued that failure is central to player enjoyment of games .
This is not that surprising , given conventional wisdom that a game should be balanced to match the skills of players .
However , it is notable that failure is more than a contrast to winning – rather failure is central to the experience of depth in a game , to the experience of improving skills .
The study supports the idea that growth , the experience of learning , of adjusting strategies , of trying something new , is a core attraction of video games .
7
Hence the desire for game balance , losing some , winning some , is also a desire for variation in the challenge and difficulty of the game .
Failure adds content .
If the classic tenet of storytelling is Aristotle ’s that a story should have a beginning , a middle , and an end , the core tenet of games must be this : a game should be neither too easy nor too hard .
This is more than the simple truism it sounds like .
It reveals much deeper and more complicated facts about games , and players .

Appendix 1 : Offline Test Procedure Participants were tested one at a time , and did not see or talk to other participants .
Participants were informed that “ We are working on a game , and we would like to hear your input .
This is not a test of your skill ; we would simply like to know what you think about the game . ”
Each player was asked to play the game until the game was over .
It was noted on what levels players lost lives .
Each player was asked “ Why did you fail ? ” and “ Why did you complete the level ? ”
The explanations were coded as being either due to ability ( personal factor ) , performance ( circumstance ) , or the game ( entity ) .
After one game had been played , the player was interviewed .
Each player was asked to rate the game as follows : “ If this was a game you found on the web , how would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10 , with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best ? ”
8
Each player was asked to explain if he or she had ever played a game that was too easy .
Each player was asked how he or she could tell if a game is too easy .
Participants were not paid , but as game testing is often described as a way of entering the game industry , testers may have strong motivation for pleasing the company .
This affects the confidence in the absolute judgments of the players , but since the testers ’ interest in pleasing the company will be statistically uniform , the data can be used relatively in correlation with other data from the test .
Appendix 2 : Online Test Procedure Players were recruited via the author ’s blog .
Players were told that “ This is not a test of your skills , but a test of how you feel about playing a little game experiment ” ; players were not aware that the test concerned failure .
Players were directed to a page with instructions , as can be seen at http://www.jesperjuul.net/test/rpt2/ .
Players were directed to the game .
The game consisted of four levels .
The player had three lives .
When a player reached game over , either by completing all four levels or by losing all three lives , the player was directed to an online questionnaire .
In the questionnaire , the player was asked to rate the game as follows : “ Say you found this game on the Internet .
On a scale from 1 to 10 , with 1 being the worst game ever , and 10 being the best game ever , how would you rate this game ? ”
Only players who completed the entire questionnaire were included .

At Cabot Cove near where I grew up in western New England , the Millers River meets the Connecticut .
The Iron Bridge Co. of Canton , Ohio , erected a one - lane bridge over the Millers in 1898 for $ 7,000 — or so an old plaque on the cross - beam over the western end used to proclaim .
Standing on the bridge , you can see the Connecticut rush by 100 yards downstream of the bridge .
In spring , the Connecticut sweeps the surging effluent of the Millers to the south and eventually inhales it , adding the silt of the Millers to its own .
The bridge connects East Mineral Road in Montague to River Road in Northfield .
It ’s no marvel — just a turn - of - the - century , strut - and - truss iron bridge with a paved roadway .
Montague had the bridge inspected in 1989 .
The engineers from the state said the abutments – then made of stone — were unsafe .
They had begun to shift and collapse , the engineers warned .
The town closed the bridge , saying it could not afford to pay $ 100,000 to repair it , given how little vehicle traffic crossed the bridge .
Years later , the bridge was modestly renovated as a pedestrian river crossing .
I think of 1988 as the year I left home .
That ’s the year I screwed up the nerve to leave the newspaper and go to graduate school at Evergreen , sight unseen .
Whenever I return home , I visit this bridge .
I love this bridge , but I ca n’t explain why .
I only know that I am irrevocably connected to the bridge , and it is irrevocably connected to me .
When I was 12 , I dove from the bridge into its dark waters below — instead of jumping feet first .
Real guys dove .
My first moment of courage — or stupidity .
As my life unfolded , there have been few of the former , many of the latter .
When I was 19 , I kissed Linda there for the first time .
She was leaning against one of the iron beams , complaining about how the rusted rivets were pressing against her back .
I walked over and kissed her .
My second moment of courage .
She kissed me back , and it was wonderful .
When you ’re young , all kisses are wonderful .
When I was 21 , I threw up over the downstream railing of the bridge .
I had been on a date that I had n’t really enjoyed .
I got drunk , took her home , and went to the bridge .
After I erupted the dinner we ’d had , I lay down on the bridge and slept .
I awoke there in the morning , hung over .
But not so hung over that I could n’t appreciate the sun , rising in the east over a bend in the Millers , penetrating the low fog cloaking the river .
A moment of magic .
When I was 23 , I took Tina for a walk on the bridge at night .
I had waited until full moon for this .
We each carried a glass of Chardonnay .
Hand in hand , we walked down the bank on the eastern side , past a tall elm that finally toppled into the river a few years later .
Erosion can kill .
I had been seeing T — I always called her T ; I do n’t know why — for nearly two years .
Suddenly , she set her glass on the railing and told me she ’d started seeing someone else .
My intended question remained unasked .
We both cried .
But her tears stopped much sooner than mine .
When I was 30 , I began bird watching .
During migration each spring and fall , I ’d meet my best friend , Bruce , at his house , about seven miles north alongside the Connecticut , and we ’d drive slowly down River Road , a rutted , dirt thoroughfare , to the bridge .
We ’d always linger at the bridge .
Drinking tea from a thermos .
Listening .
We did n’t know birdcalls very well , but we listened anyway .
One day , we saw a hawk circling over the confluence .
“ A redtail , ” I said .
“ A broadwing , ” he counter - claimed .
We looked at each other .
I asked him , “ Well , what do we need ? ” Bruce replied , “ We ’ve got a redtail already . ” I grinned .
“ Then it ’s a broadwing . ”
We laughed .
Even today , when we go birding , one of us will say , at some time , “ So what do we need ? ”
And we ’ll laugh .
These many years later , it ’s still part of the lexicon of our friendship .
For more than twenty years , Bruce and I birded from the bridge .
I ’ve kept track of what we ’ve seen there on a faded Audubon birding checklist .
One hundred and seventeen different species , twenty - six of them warblers .
Spring is glorious down there on the Millers .
I enjoy it .
I enjoy the time with Bruce .
I enjoy being on the bridge .
One day , during a Christmas Audubon bird count , we saw a blue grosbeak .
An accidental , as the birders say .
We still speak of it today .
When I was 32 , my uncle Pappy , a doctor , died a year after he retired .
He had a heart attack while doing genealogy studies at the University of Utah .
At the moment of his death , I was on a rock climb called the Cat Burglar in Tumwater Canyon in Washington state .
I knew the instant he died .
I just knew .
My climbing partner , Mark , and I drove five straight days back to Massachusetts , aided by little white pills .
After I carried his casket into the church , heard the eulogy , and buried him in Green River Cemetery , I went to the bridge .
And wept .
He had not taught me the rest of what he knew .
I still miss him terribly .
I still think of him when I visit the bridge .
In my thirties , I used to ride my bike from Greenfield to Northfield to visit Bruce and his wife , Laurie .
It ’s 11 miles .
I always stopped on the bridge , pulled out my pipe , and smoked a bowl of Captain Black .
The act was peaceful and calming .
I was running the copy desk at the newspaper then ; life was stressful .
The bridge became my Valium .
So much so that in time I would no longer need the Captain Black .
When I was 38 , I went to the bridge and wept for Neil .
He was my newsroom godfather .
He taught me the journalism I teach today in his memory .
Neil died at 54 .
He did n’t take care of himself .
He drank .
He smoked .
He never worked out .
But he inspired .
He gave life to phrases wooden to others , phrases such as “ freedom of speech ” and “ civic duty ” and “ the right to know . ”
He was the best journalist I ever knew , back then .
But Neil died .
Too soon .
I carved his name in the wooden side rails of the bridge .
When I hit the lottery , I ’ll establish a scholarship in Neil ’s name somewhere .
He did n’t go to college ; he began newspapering when he was 20 , fresh out of the Navy .
I miss Neil .
I ’m still angry with him for dying so young , before teaching me the rest of what he knew .
On the bridge , I deal with the anger .
I curse Neil , and I tell him I love him .
On the bridge , I resolve to take Neil into my classroom every day .
This year , my old editor , Bob , died .
So did professor Joe and climbing partner Dick .
I talk to them , too , on the bridge .
When I was 43 , on Nov. 4 , 1989 , I asked Carrie to marry me .
She said no , became angry , then wept with me before striding swiftly out of my apartment in Olympia .
She never spoke to me again .
I flew back East for Christmas five weeks later .
My dad picked me up at Bradley .
When we got home , I took his car and drove to the bridge .
It was dark , and it was cold .
I walked down onto the bridge and cried as hard as I have ever cried .
But on the bridge , I found solace .
Why ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe because the bridge and I had shared so much for so long .
But I miss Carrie .
Still .
I began trying to photograph the bridge when I was 30 .
I had an old 4×5 Speed Graphic .
I mounted it on a tripod , standing on the western bank , trying to find the zeitgeist of the bridge .
I must have moved that goddamned tripod two dozen times .
I could n’t find the best angle .
Then the light would n’t be right .
Then I could n’t frame all of the bridge .
The shutter never clicked .
I just could n’t find the soul of the bridge in the ground glass .
Over the past 40 years , using Hasselblads , Minoltas , Instamatics , digitals , even my damn cell phone , the result ’s been the same .
Frustration .
A feeling of ineptitude .
I am a good photographer , but the picture of the bridge eludes me .
Eight summers ago , I drove back to New England from my university to retrieve my truck .
I ’d had my dad ’s car since early July .
Easier to drive than my truck after an orthopedic surgeon once again rooted around in my right shoulder with nasty surgical instruments .
I took with me a Minolta SR - 1s , a camera I bought in 1964 , mail order from Japan .
It ’s one of my two most precious possessions .
I shot two rolls of the bridge in overcast morning light .
But I did n’t care whether I got “ decent ” pictures .
Photographing the bridge has become an act of adoration , I think .
It ’s part of how the bridge and I interact .
Perhaps I worship the bridge , and photographing it is part of the ritual of that worship .
Or maybe it ’s a habit , a way I greet the bridge when I ’ve been away for several months .
Maybe it ’s the way I speak of my feelings for it , the way I tell it I love it .
I do n’t know .
But I take a camera now each time I visit .
And binoculars .
Ritual .
A routine of affection .
A statement of loyalty .
A promise of passion .
Edward Abbey , in Desert Solitaire , wrote : “ Standing there , gaping at this monstrous and inhuman spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space , I feel a ridiculous greed and possessiveness come over me .
I want to know it all , possess it all , embrace the entire scene intimately , deeply , totally , as a man desires a beautiful woman . ”
I ’ve photographed in the West for more than 40 years .
I still have n’t taken a photograph west of the Mississippi that ’s anything more than a glorified postcard .
I ’ve seen very few photographs that capture the soul of the landscape .
That feeling of failure — of failing to trap the soul of the landscape in silver halide — has been at the heart of my frustration as an outwardly pragmatic man with a deeply buried drive and desire to create .
Maybe that ’s why I wrote a novel about love and landscapes in the West .
Was it a way to explore love ?
The unexplainable , the un-understandable of all emotions ?
Maybe it was a way to try to understand the end of the relationship that never really was between Mary and me .
When I told her , many years ago , I loved her and wanted to be with her , she only said , “ No , because I love you . ”
I left her behind in Kanab , Utah , in the bosom of the majestic Church of Rock , Desert and Big Sky .
Somehow , it ’s all connected to how I feel about the bridge .
About how I feel when I ’m on the bridge , when I ’m thinking about the bridge .
I ca n’t capture it ; I can only experience it , and try to cement the experience into my soul rather a photograph .
I ’ve happy on the bridge .
Sad. Angry .
Wistful .
Ecstatic .
And , far too often , melancholic .
I ’ve shared the bridge ; I ’ve been solo on the bridge .
I do n’t understand why the bridge affects me the way it does .
But I no longer try to explain it or understand it .
I accept it as part of my life .
It ’s part of who I am , part of how I feel , part of the reality that represents me .
It just is .
It is part of who I am .
Most Thin Film Photovoltaics Companies To Fail
A venture capitalist says most thin film photovoltaics ( PV ) advances fail in the transition from the lab to manufacturing due to yield problems and other manufacturing problems .
( thanks James Bowery )
The reality , according to Neal Dikeman , partner with VC firm Jane Capital Partners , is that only one or two thin - film projects have brought product to market in 30 years , and it 's a US $ 100 M - $ 200 M dollar up - front investment " just to play the game and see if your product really works . "
Silicon Valley investors have mistakenly bet on " really great teams " while the technology is still at a science experiment stage , he argues  investors are beginning to realize this , he thinks , and that the industry is sitting on the back end of about 5 - 10 years of US $ 100 M bets .
" We 're going to see a bunch of write - offs coming up , " he warns .
Dikeman argues that very few of the thin film PV start - ups have succeeded in getting a good thin film PV production process operating at large scale .
So First Solar is really an outlier .
Dikeman expects the entrance of semiconductor equipment manufacturing suppliers such as Applied Materials and Oerlikon will help matters .
If these companies can work out processes and equipment for doing thin films PV manufacturing then a lot more companies will be able to get into the business of thin film PV manufacturing .

Andrew Bird ’s Lull : An Elegant Symphony on The Capacity to Be Alone
Andrew Bird ’s Unusual , Gradual Climb to Success
Andrew Bird grew up in Chicago ’s northern suburbs .
His mother was an artist and had visions of all of her children playing classical music .
However , Andrew was the only one who took to it .
He began violin lessons at age 4 , using the Suzuki method , which stresses learning by ear .
In high school , while Bird ’s friends were listening to the Smiths and the Cure , he was listening to Mozart ’s Requiem .
At Northwestern University , though , he began to chafe against his classical training .
Bird resented the conservatory ’s self - gratifying ethos , the prevailing view that the headier the piece of music the better , even if it turned audiences away .
He wanted to improvise , rather than play written notes .
Bird ’s gradual climb to success has been an unusual one for a business in which careers tend to be made on the back of a big break .
But his increasing popularity also says something broader about the shifting dynamics of the industry .
The rock - music business has long been dominated by major labels following a simple formula :
They saw what bands were selling and looked for others that sounded just like them .
And since these same labels held what often seemed like exclusive access to the key retailers and influential radio stations , it was difficult for independent record companies and more inventive , esoteric artists to find traction in the general public .
But now with the precipitous drop in record sales , the major labels have lost much of their leverage , and with it , their ability to determine what records will become popular .
Bird ’s sound is not easy to categorize .
His songs are swelling and orchestral , the legacy of the years he spent studying classical violin at Northwestern University ’s prestigious conservatory and elsewhere .
He also has been compared with the Irish rock singer Damien Rice , but Bird ’s sound is also distinctly American , part of a new wave of folk , free folk , psych folk or freak folk , as it has variously been called , that has grown in popularity in recent years .
His songs have a pastoral , down - home feel , but they also have a darkness and emotional complexity not typically associated with folk rock .
It ’s been said that Will Oldham is the troubadour of alternative - country , Jeff Buckley was the intimate psychologist , Devendra Banhart is the gentle psychedelic minstrel and Rufus Wainwright is the sophisticated popular cult star .
Andrew Bird can be described as being all of them at the same time : the master of deeply - felt singing , the master of layered and complex arrangements , the master of lyrical imagery , the master of celestial melodies and the master of both the bizarre and of the sublimely subtle .
When Bird is on - stage , whether it be at a 75 - seat gloomy bar in Chicago , or performing before thousands at Chicago ’s Millennium Park or New York City ’s Carnegie Hall , he ’s always engaged in something of a musical high - wire act , whistling , singing and maniacally shifting from his violin to a guitar to a glockenspiel .
And all the while , his feet are busy working the pedals of an electronic looping station that records and then plays back his musical progressions in short intervals .
He ’s a true one - man - band , layering one musical passage on top of another , gradually nudging each song toward its orchestral crescendo .
Andrew Bird ’s Lull : The Elegant Sounds of Solitude
Lull is a musical animated short film , the tale of an old man and the sea .
The film is a very lonely one .
The old man is walking on a pier with his bucket of lobsters , and he encounters a large squid to which he is fatefully attracted .
He becomes an oceanic recluse , floating around and rejecting the world of men .
It ’s a fitting accompaniment for Chicago - based singer , violinist , whistler , and songwriter Andrew Bird , who has re-recorded Weather Systems ’ Lull backed by the Chicago indie-rockers Dianogah .
Bird sings of being alone , “ It can be quite romantic / Like Jacques Cousteau / Underneath the Atlantic / A fantastic voyage / To parts unknown . ”
That gorgeous sense of solitude reaches its apotheosis in Lull , where Bird explains ( with almost mathematic precision ) , “ Being alone can be quite romantic / Like Jacques Cousteau underneath the Atlantic / A fantastic voyage through parts unknown / Going to depths where the sun ’s never shone / I fascinate myself / When I ’m all alone . ”
The ingenious rhyme structure is enough to make you cry outright ( Bird is one of the most underrated talents in music , period ) .
But the striking interpenetration of his lyrical imagery and musical composition , the song bouncing happily along , as if riding Cousteau ’s mellow ocean homeward , combined with his poignant delivery is a truly exhilarating experience .
If you really pay attention , it ’s enough to make you crack a smile , especially when Bird self - consciously skewers the egotistical and self - centered ideas of loneliness , turning the criticisms of Carly Simon ’s “ You ’re So Vain ” back onto himself ( “ Rambling on rather self - consciously / While I ’m stirring these condiments into my tea /
And I think I ’m so lame / That I think this song is about me / Do n’t I do n’t I do n’t I ? “ ) .
The layers of Lull are way too many to count , but there ’s no doubting that it ’s a masterpiece of clever craftsmanship .
Andrew Bird will be giving a Special Performance in Washington D.C. to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama as U.S. President .
Bird will be joined by Chicago ’s Waco Brothers , Eleventh Dream Day , Jon Langford , Sally Timms , David Honeyboy Edwards , Ken Vandermark , Freakwater , Icy Demons , Judson Claiborne and more at the “ Big Shoulders Ball : Chicago Celebrates Change ” that will take place at the Black Cat venue in Washington , D. C .
The performance will take place on January 19th , the evening before Obama is sworn in as President .

McCain campaign holds clearance sale for campaign equipment John Byrne
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Blackberries marked down to just $ 30 !
No , it 's not a holiday clearance sale -- it 's a campaign blowout .
Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign is hawking off used campaign equipment at firesale prices for everything from Blackberries and Dell laptops to chairs and a power strip .
An email sent to campaign staff and acquired by The Sleuth 's Mary Ann Akers read like a weekend promotional flyer for a one - day - only sale .
" Starting Monday December 8 , 2008 the prices will be slashed to 36 % of the original price for furniture , office supplies , blackberries , and many campaign computers , " the email read .
" This is a great opportunity to own a piece of history , finish your Christmas shopping , or simply replace your old laptop . "
The campaign is even accepting credit cards for payment .
Among the deals listed in the email :
- A Dell Latitude D620 laptop for $ 417.00 .
- A Dell Latitude D820 laptop for $ 570.00 .
- Brother multifunction printer for $ 189.00 .
- RIM Blackberry 8700c for $ 30.00 .
- Folding chairs for $ 3.60 each .
- A 55 - cup steel coffee urn for $ 77.00 .
- A power strip for $ 1 .
- Ethernet cables for $ 1 a pound .
McCain campaign staffer Andrew Freeman told Akers the yard sale is not limited to campaign employees .
" Come on over and we 'll sell you a computer , " he said .
" Do n't have any cash on you ?
No worries , " Akers writes .
" An attached price sheet says , " We accept cash , checks , and credit cards . "
He told the judge : " What we have is a person who has post - traumatic stress but is quite capable of going out and having a good time at a fancy dress party . "
Millions of Canadian workers pay employment insurance premiums their entire working lives giving little thought to what would happen if they lost their jobs tomorrow .
But as the global economic crisis deepens , tens of thousands facing layoff are learning the cruel truth .
Cuts in the early 1990s mean barely half of the country 's unemployed today – and fewer than a quarter in Toronto – are eligible for benefits .
Those lucky enough to qualify often get far less than poverty - level incomes .
And for almost everyone scrambling to find work as the economy crumbles , benefits run out too soon .
As Stephen Harper 's Conservatives put the final touches on Tuesday 's budget , labour and business leaders alike are calling on Ottawa to mend Canada 's tattered employment insurance program – and put money in the hands of those who need it most and are most likely to spend it now .
The United States Congress has already passed two federal extensions to state employment benefits , and a new bill could see many American workers laid off in the beginning of 2008 collect benefits for up to two years .
Most Canadian observers believe Ottawa is also ready to act .
For about 2,400 auto - parts workers who lost their jobs when Vaughan 's Progressive Moulded Products plant went bankrupt last July , the fix can not come soon enough .
" I am trying .
Sometimes I cry .
It 's too hard , " Balvir Kaur Singh says quietly in halting English .
The 40 - year - old mother of three , who immigrated to Canada from India in 1990 as a new bride , worked the midnight shift so she could be home during the day with her children , who are now age 17 , 16 and 7 .
But a slip on the factory floor in September 2007 put Singh's " happy life " in Canada into a tailspin .
After five months off work , Singh was only able to return to work part - time .
Many days she was n't able to work at all .
When the company went bankrupt several months later , Singh did n't have the minimum 665 hours in the previous 52 weeks needed in Toronto to qualify for regular EI benefits .
She eventually received 17 weeks in EI sickness benefits .
But that ran out last fall .
Coupled with her husband 's reduced hours as a truck driver for another company , the Singhs , who live in a four - bedroom home in Maple , are now facing financial disaster .
" How do we pay our bills ? " she asks , her eyes brimming with tears .
Economists , academics and unions want Ottawa to scrap EI entrance requirements based on regional unemployment rates and allow workers everywhere to qualify if they have worked 360 hours in the previous year .
This would include new entrants and those on special benefits , such as maternity or sick leave .
Workers currently need between 420 and 700 hours depending on regional unemployment rates before they qualify .
New workers or those returning to the workforce after a two - year absence need between 840 and 910 hours and those seeking maternity or sick benefits need 600 hours .
Before 1996 , when Unemployment Insurance was renamed Employment Insurance , workers only needed the equivalent of between 180 to 300 hours to qualify .
For new entrants , it was just 300 hours .
" How do we care for our children ? " asks single mom Duc Phung Diep , who came to Canada from a refugee camp in Vietnam in 1996 with her 4 - year - old son .
Despite her poor English , Diep found work immediately in the garment industry and then in an electronics firm .
She started at Progressive in 2000 , earning as much as $ 800 a week with overtime .
Just over a year ago , as she was nearing the end of maternity leave for her second child , she bought her first home in the Jane - Finch community .
The company 's financial ruin has put enormous pressure on Diep , who extended her mortgage to 40 years last summer .
Still , Diep 's mortgage eats up most of her $ 325 weekly EI payments , forcing her to rely on her monthly child benefits of less than $ 400 for everything else .
Diep , 36 , whose EI runs out at the end of the month , says she is lucky to be accepted into a basic English and math course offered through the province 's Second Career program and hopes it will lead to further training as a hairdresser .
But the living expenses included in the program are even less than what she received on EI .
And now she has child - care expenses of $ 150 a week while she attends class every day .
" I 've used my savings .
No more savings .
I 'm very worried , " she says , her fear palpable .
Business and labour groups are calling on Ottawa to boost EI benefits – frozen for a decade after the cuts – to at least 60 per cent of earnings based on the best 12 weeks of pay in the previous 26 weeks .
Currently , weekly benefits are 55 per cent of earnings based on average weekly earnings for the previous six months .
The maximum weekly payment for 2009 is $ 447 .

During the early 1970s , unemployed workers received 75 per cent of their earnings .
But benefits have declined considerably since then .
By the end of the decade they had fallen to 60 per cent .
In 1993 , they dropped to 57 per cent and then to 55 per cent in 1994 .
The more generous benefits during the last recession combined with the ensuing 10 - year rate freeze , means an unemployed worker in 1991 received the equivalent of up to $ 600 a week – almost $ 150 more than today .
Lincoln Meikle , 53 , worked almost two years at the plant as a machine operator where he earned more than $ 15 an hour .
When the company went bust , he qualified for 38 weeks of EI benefits – the maximum duration for the unemployed in Toronto under the current system 's regional rules .
Those benefits ran out earlier this month .
Meikle has drained his meagre savings and RRSPs and last week his TV and home phone services were cut off because he can no longer make the payments .
The Scarborough father of four grown children who are either in school or out of work has turned to friends for help this month .
But he does n't know how he is going to pay February 's $ 830 rent and $ 140 auto insurance .
He is loath to turn to welfare , a program that has also been stripped to the bone and would likely require Meikle to sell his car – his only remaining asset and lifeline to a new job – in order to qualify .
" I 've looked for work and , trust me , there is n't any to be had .
I hope I can get into training .
But if a job comes , I 'm gone .
I can't live this way . "
Labour groups want Ottawa to increase the duration of benefits to at least 50 weeks in all regions and provide an additional year of special extension benefits if the national unemployment rate exceeds 6.5 per cent .
National unemployment for December was 6.6 per cent .
Currently , the maximum benefit period is 45 weeks .
But only the jobless in areas of high unemployment receive benefits for that long .
Where unemployment is less than 7 per cent , the maximum varies from 36 to 38 weeks or just eight or nine months .
Before the changes of 1996 , unemployed workers could receive benefits for up to 50 weeks .
Older workers and others in special programs could receive benefits equivalent to EI for longer periods .
Unemployed workers in many American states may soon receive benefits for up to two years under a proposal supported by President Barack Obama .
Canadian labour groups say Canada must follow suit .
" The focus should be on ( EI ) access and duration , " agrees TD Bank 's chief economist Don Drummond .
The respected banker and former senior federal finance official supports the call to standardize EI access across the country at 360 hours and to extend the benefit period beyond the current 45 weeks to support training .
" The purpose of EI is to provide a temporary cushion to someone when they become unemployed so they do n't become destitute ... and it 's just not doing its job , " he says .
" The culprit is the relationship between the number of hours that you work and the unemployment rate where you happen to live , " he says .
" That 's got to change . "
“ Caleb ” wrote in recently with a concern about building connections with people in the workplace :
One thing that comes in your blog from time to time is building and expanding professional and personal network .
What about people who are at it but still seem to be going nowhere ?
For example , I have worked in a lot of places and met a lot of people .
Once I leave the work , I try to keep in touch with people but it seems like every time it ’s me who initiates the conversation ( or the email for that matter ) .
If I send them an email , they will reply back – after that nothing happens unless and until I send them an email again .
Same goes for catching up for a coffee – I initiate the meeting but I never find other people inviting me for a coffee .
I also tried calling people ( not in weird time ) just to keep in touch but I think people get a bit annoyed .
So , it ’s always one - sided and I really do n’t want to be the one to initiate the conversation / email / phone call every single time with every single person as I feel like I ’m pushing people just to be in touch with me .
I believe Caleb ’s intuition is telling him the right thing here .
I do n’t believe the kind of contacts Caleb is making with his former coworkers are worth is time at all .
He ’s pushing for contact with people who simply are n’t reaching back – and that ’s a completely ineffective use of his time .
What ’s the problem , you ask ?
Value .
In the interactions that Caleb describes above , in which he seems to just be contacting people simply to touch base with them , the participant sees little or not value in the exchange .
From their perspective , Caleb ’s communication or attempt at arranging a meeting does n’t offer any notable value , so why should they bother ?
They might respond simply out of politeness , but they see no real value in it , so they do n’t bother to follow up .
This is the key lesson that many people miss out on when they try to build and maintain professional connections .
Keeping in touch alone does n’t add value , and without value , there is no real connection .
Real relationships , real friendships , real connections are based on exchanging value with each other .
Think about your closest friends .
They provide companionship .
They provide help when you need it .
They give you a shoulder to cry on .
They offer advice when you ask for it .
In short , they ’re valuable to you – and you keep coming back to them .
Then , think about the people you really value at work .
Who are the people that always come through in a pinch for you ?
Who are the ones that offer great suggestions when you need it and are seemingly always there to point you in the right direction ?
Those are the people that add value to your workplace – and they ’re the ones you ’ll be glad to help out if they need a hand .
Making irregular empty contact does n’t provide any value at all .
You ’re not building a regular pattern of companionship , nor are you providing anything of value aside from a quick friendly greeting .
You ’re no different than the guy down the block that you recognize and say hello to out of familiarity , but not out of closeness .
Putting effort into these contacts is like knocking on every door on your block just to say hi – people will say hello back to you , but you ’re largely wasting your time and theirs , and wo n’t build anything of value out of it .
Instead , you should still seek to make those contacts , but they should have some value embedded in them .
Here are some tactics to follow .
Ten Ways to Build Valuable , Lasting Professional Relationships
1 . Never make contact unless you can contribute something of value to their situation .
There ’s really no point in contacting someone that you ’ve never had a strong bond with unless you ’re giving something of value ( or requesting something of value ) .
So do n’t do it .
Do n’t ask someone you only lightly know to go out for coffee unless you have a genuine purpose in doing so – and saying “ hi ” is n’t that purpose .
Do n’t waste your time , and certainly do n’t waste theirs .
2 . Get a grip on who these people are and what they value .
Of course , that means you should contact someone if you can pass along something of value to them .
A big part of that is simply knowing who they are , what they ’re doing , and what they ’re passionate about .
In my previous career , I found it useful to collect business cards from people , then later on jot down a few notes about the person on the back – what were they working on , what were they passionate about , and so on .
Today , I largely do it electronically using an address book , where I use the “ note ” field to jot down notes about people so I can remember them later .
Then , later , if I know I know someone who ’s really into , say , golf , I can just search the “ notes ” field for “ golf ” and find that person .
3. Knowledge is often the best thing you can offer – so offer it .
If you have a useful piece of information that you ’re sure someone else could get value out of , share it ( unless , of course , sharing it would get you in trouble ) .
Just send it along , no questions asked .
This could be anything from how to solve a particular problem in your industry to knowing where an upcoming trade meeting is going to happen so you can schedule flights and hotel rooms early .
By sending along something actually useful , you add value to their lives – and their connection to you becomes stronger , because they now see you as more valuable .
4 . Pass along opportunities every chance you get .
Similarly , whenever you ’re offered something of value , do n’t turn it down just because you wo n’t use it .
Instead , accept it happily ( making the person offering it feel good ) , then pass it along to someone who could genuinely use it .
Be sure to let the person you got the item from know this , though – “ Hey … I know someone who could really use this !
Mind if I pass it along ?
Thanks ! ”
I had the opportunity once to pass along two NFL playoff tickets to someone who was ecstatic .
5 . Pass along genuinely useful items you discover online , with your own commentary .
On an irregular basis , it can be useful to pass along links that you find to be exceptionally useful .
For example , if you find a great technical reference for something important in your field , passing a link to that reference along to people who also work in your field is the definition of passing along value .
Not only could it have a profound positive impact on the recipient , it takes little effort from you .
Be careful with this , though , because overdoing it means you ’re not sending out truly quality items .
Keep it less than once a week and focus on the truly great stuff , and you ’ll be seen as someone providing actual value .
They ’ll pay attention to what you send if it ’s always good .
6 . When you pass along some value , let them know what you ’re up to – and also ask about what they ’re up to .
A quick paragraph saying “ What are you up to ? ” and perhaps referencing the last big matter that you ’re aware that the person was involved with is a great way to find out what they are currently up to .
While you ’re doing that , tack on a few sentences saying what ’s new with you .
This encourages the other person to let you know what they ’re up to – and keeps the relationship open and the communication flowing .
7 . Make mutually beneficial connections whenever you can .
If you observe that one person ’s need is met with another person ’s assets or skills , connect them together .
It only takes you a minute , but if that connection provides mutual value for both parties , you ’ll strengthen your relationship to both people , plus you will have helped solve a problem .
It ’s a win all around .
8 . Suggest that if they ’re in a bind , they should let you know .
And when they do , try to solve the problem .
Be sure to let people know if they ’re having a problem or are seeking some sort of help , they should let you know .
Even if you ca n’t help them , listening to their problem is useful .
Sometimes , though , you can help – or you know someone who can help .
In those situations , you can be very beneficial to them and really cement your relationship .
9 . When you ’re in a bind , tap all of the connections you can .
So when does all of this effort pay off ?
When you ’re in a bind and you ’ve put effort into helping others , they ’re much more likely to help you when you tap them back in your time of need .
Lost your job ?
Have a project that ’s beyond your skill level ?
Looking for a great deal on a major purchase ?
Getting ready to move ?
Those are great times to tap your network of connections .
10 .
Use social networking tools – Twitter is particularly useful for this .
Those nine things listed above are exactly the reason social networking tools were invented – and how some people use them successfully .
I find Twitter to be very useful in this regard , enabling me to quickly and easily share things with a wide group of people and also follow the ideas , thoughts , and activities of many others .
In short , pass along value and you ’ll get value in return .
Caleb ’s problem was that he was n’t passing along much value to begin with .

I think Richard Smalley would have appreciated my article “ Realizing Lithium Battery Potential ” which headlines MIT TechReview.com today .
The Rice University chemist – who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of soccer ball - shaped carbon cages called buckyballs – believed that nanotechnology could multiply the efficiency of the myriad energy devices upon which modern human society relies and , as such , had a central role to play in cleaning up our energy systems .
I relied on Smalley ’s vision to wrap up a 2004 feature story for Tech Review – “ Solar - Cell Rollout ” – on plastic solar cells , which represent a radical , nanotech - enabled departure from the high - performance silicon crystal materials that still dominate the photovoltaics industry .
Smalley ’s belief in the rather anemic , flimsy plastic cells ’ potential to someday be rooftop - ready lent crucial authority .
( Does n’t seem so crazy now .
Just yesterday a German R&D agency decided the technology ’s performance warranted a € 2.5 - million investment in improving its stability . )
In the same breath I passed along Smalley ’s plea for bold investments in physical sciences research :
Nanotech could help solve the energy problem , Smalley contends , by providing new tools and materials that make widespread use of solar cells economically viable .
But he believes it will take billions of dollars in funding and the focused efforts of the world ’s top chemists and physicists to make that happen .
So for the past two years , he has been crisscrossing the United States , evangelizing for nothing short of a modern - day Manhattan Project to use nanotech to deliver a sustainable energy system .
Smalley died from leukemia in 2005 , but the vision he championed continues to spread and the advances he foresaw are being realized .
My article on TechReview.com today presents nanotech - fueled advances that could multiply the energy storage capacity of lithium batteries .
The immense potential of lithium batteries is the inspiration for today ’s renaissance in electric vehicle development .
But auto industry analysts say their cost will constrain EV expansion through 2020 ; see for example these uninspiring growth curves from PriceWaterhouseCoopers ’ Calum MacRae .
More potent batteries should help by extending EVs ’ range and thus improving their value proposition .
Nanotech , by the way , is already improving the lithium battery .
Boston - area technology developer A123 , for example , coats its batteries ’ positive electrodes with nanoparticles of iron - phosphate to boost safety and reduce cost relative to conventional laptop - style batteries .
A123 is believed to have lost its bid to supply GM’s Chevy Volt plug - in hybrid vehicle , but as TechReview editor Kevin Bullis points out recently A123 has plenty of other EVs to bid on .

From HARPER ’S MAGAZINE , January 1990 , Readings
WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE
[ Reprinted from “ The Puritan and The Profligate , ” an interview with Allen Ginsberg in the December issue of Chronicles : A Magazine of American Culture , published in Rockford , Illinois .
The interview was conducted by John Lofton , a former columnist for The Washington Times . ]
JOHN LOFTON :
In the first section of your poem “ Howl ” you wrote : “ I saw the best young minds of my generation destroyed by madness . ”
Did this also apply to you ?
ALLEN GINSBERG :
That ’s not an accurate quotation .
I said the “ best minds , ” not “ the best young minds . ”
This is what is called hyperbole , an exaggerated statement , sort of a romantic statement .
I suppose it could apply to me too , or anybody .
People who survived and became prosperous in a basically aggressive , warlike society are in a sense destroyed by madness .
Those who freaked out and could n’t make it , or were traumatized , or artists who starved , or whatnot , they could n’t make it either .
It kinda cuts both ways .
There ’s an element of humor there .
LOFTON : When you say you suppose this could have applied to you , does this mean you do n’t know if you are mad ?
GINSBERG : Well , who does ?
I mean everybody is a little mad .
LOFTON : But I ’m asking you .
GINSBERG : You are perhaps taking this a little too literally .
There are several kinds of madness : divine madness —
LOFTON : But I ’m talking about this in the sense you spoke of in your 1949 poem “ Bop Lyrics , ” when you wrote : “ I ’m so lucky to be nutty . ”
GINSBERG : You ’re misinterpreting the way I ’m using the word .
LOFTON : No .
I ’m asking you a question .
I ’m not interpreting anything .
GINSBERG : I ’m afraid that your linguistic presupposition is that “ nutty ” as you define it means insanity rather than inspiration .
You are interpreting , though you say you are n’t , by choosing one definition and excluding another .
So I think you ’ll have to admit you are interpreting .
LOFTON : Actually , I do n’t admit that .
GINSBERG : You do n’t want to admit nuttin ’ !
But you want me to admit something .
Come on .
Come off it .
Do n’t be a prig .
LOFTON : I ’m just trying to understand what you meant by what you wrote .
But this question of madness .
GINSBERG : There ’s also another background .
In Zen Buddhism there is wild wisdom , or crazy wisdom , crazy in the sense of wild , unlimited , unbounded .
Or as in jazz , when someone plays a beautiful riff or extemporizes , they say , “ Crazy , man , ”
LOFTON : But I am interested in this question of your possible madness .
It ’s not a gratuitous question .
There is a history of madness in your family .
GINSBERG : Very much so .
LOFTON : Your mom died in 1956 in a mental institution .
Before that .
in 1949 , when you were twenty - three .
you spent eight months in the Columbia Psychiatric Institute .
What was this psychiatric disability and why did you spend just eight months in this institute ?
GINSBERG : Well , I had a sort of visionary experience in which I heard William Blake ’s voice .
It was probably an auditory hallucination , but it was a very rich experience .
LOFTON : This happened while you were masturbating , right ?
GINSBERG : Yes , but after .
LOFTON : I want to ask you about this psychiatric disability .
GINSBERG : No , no , no .
no , no , no , no , no .
Sir , first of all your tone is too aggressive .
You have to soften your tone , because there ’s an element of aggression here .
There ’s an element almost like a police interrogation here .
LOFTON : But that ’s not all bad .
The police , in some instances , do a good job , particularly in dealing with criminals .
GINSBERG : Sir , in this case it ’s a little impolite .
You ’re being a little harsh and unfriendly and making it very difficult for me to relate to you gently and talk unguardedly and candidly .
LOFTON : There ’s no doubt that from what I ’ve read about you , I do n’t like what you have stood for over the years .
I do n’t like your politics , the kind of sex you engage in .
So if you mean there ’s a hostility here toward what you are , absolutely there is .
GINSBERG : But you ’re talking to me as if I ’m an object of some kind and not a person in front of you , I ’m asking you , in a sense , to watch your manners .
LOFTON : That ’s interesting , because I ’m not asking you to respond in any particular way .
Why are you telling me how to ask questions ?
So , can we return to my question ?
What was this psychiatric disability that put you in an institute for eight months ?
GINSBERG : Well , I ’m not sure it really was a disability to begin with .
So I ca n’t answer the question the way you pose it .
LOFTON : But I ’m asking you if it ’s true , that you had this disability ?
GINSBERG : It ’s neither true nor not true .
LOFTON : But it is true that you were in an institute ?
GINSBERG : Yes , I was .
I had a kind of visionary experience relating to a text by William Blake , “ The Sick Rose . ”
It went : “ O rose , thou art sick ! /
The invisible worm /
That flies in the night /
In the howling storm , / Has found out thy bed /
Of crimson joy , / And his dark secret love / Does thy life destroy . ”
So , it ’s a very mysterious , interesting poem that keyed off a kind of religious experience , a visionary experience , a hallucinatory experience — whichever way you want to interpret it .
All three descriptions are applicable and possible .
Reality has many aspects .
LOFTON : Were you using drugs while you masturbated and had this experience ?
GINSBERG : Not at all .
I had been living very quietly , eating vegetarian diets , seeing very few people , and reading a great many religious texts : St. John of the Cross , the Bible , Plato ’s Phaedrus , St. Teresa of Avila , and Blake , So I was In a kind of solitary , contemplative mood .
LOFTON : Did you put yourself into this institute ?
GINSBERG : More or less .
Because I questioned my own sense of reality and I could n’t figure out the significance of the illuminative experience , whether it was a kind of traditional religious experience , where there is a sudden sense of vastness and ancientness and respect and devotional awareness or sacredness to the whole universe .
Or whether this was a byproduct of some lack - love longing and projection of my own feelings , or some nutty breakthrough .
LOFTON : Do you think you were better when you got out of there ?
GINSBERG : I think they said I was n’t ever really psychotic or crazy , just an average neurotic .
LOFTON : Did you go to anywhere else besides this institute ?
GINSBERG : Oh , later — I ’m going to a psychiatrist now .
LOFTON : I assume you ’re going to a secular humanist - type psychiatrist .
GINSBERG : I never inquired about her religious beliefs .
LOFTON : Really ?
So you ’re going to someone whose religious beliefs , whose presuppositions , you know nothing about ?
GINSBERG : I know some , through body language and the response to the immediate situation in front of me , which is what I am really interested in , rather than , say , this conversation .
I ’m dealing with you in terms of how you display yourself here , not the history of your thoughts .
I ’m trying to deal with the evidence or manifestation of how you present yourself here — your harshness , aggression , and insistency and —
LOFTON : Why not call it my perseverance ?
Is n’t that a nicer word ?
Or guts ?
Or tenacity ?
GINSBERG : I would say there is a little element of S&M in your approach .
Power .
LOFTON : No .
I would say this is more like the kind of sex you like .
GINSBERG : And I would say this is the kind of power relationship you like , judging from your behavior .
LOFTON : Well , that ’s certainly what S&M is all about — power .
GINSBERG : And you seem to like that do n’t you ?
Have your sexual fantasies ever involved that kind of power relationship ?
LOFTON : No , not to my knowledge , I ’m a Christian .
So I do n’t fantasize .
GINSBERG : Do you ever have sexual fantasies ?
LOFTON : No .
GINSBERG : None at all ?
LOFTON : No , I said I am a Christian .
GINSBERG : You ’ve never had any sexual fantasies !
LOFTON : Before I was a Christian , I had them , absolutely .
GINSBERG : And since you ’re a Christian you do n’t ?
LOFTON : No .
GINSBERG : And when you had them , did they involve any dominance / submission fantasies !
LOFTON : Mine were pretty orthodox heterosexual kinds of fantasies .
But there ’s no doubt they were bad .
And I am so glad that Jesus Christ delivered me from them .
GINSBERG : You have no erotic dreams now , at all , that you remember !
LOFTON : None that do n’t feature my wife , no .
GINSBERG : Yeah .
LOFTON : It ’s an amazing thing what Jesus can do for a person .
GINSBERG : Uh-huh .
LOFTON : Let ’s talk about some of your feelings over the years and see if they should be respected .
In 1978 , when you were on a Boston TV show , you shared your sexual preference for “ young boys , ” and this caused an instant irate reaction from mothers who had children home on vacation from school .
Is it true that you have a sexual preference for “ young boys ” ?
GINSBERG : No , no , no .
It ’s not accurate in the context of the broadcast .
LOFTON : Did you say you had a sexual preference for young boys ?
GINSBERG : We ’re not on trial here .
I ’m trying to explain .
LOFTON : But in a way , we ’re all on trial .
GINSBERG : Well , then you must excuse me if I do n’t adopt the submissive attitude you wish .
I got on the air and said that when I was young I was approached by an older man and I do n’t think it did me any harm .
And that I like younger boys and I think that probably almost everybody has an inclination that is erotic toward younger people , including younger boys .
LOFTON : How young were the boys ?
GINSBERG : In my case , I ’d say fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen .
LOFTON : That you had sex with ?
GINSBERG : No , unfortunately I have n’t had the chance .
[ laughs ]
No , I ’m talking about my desires .
I ’m being frank and candid .
And I ’m also saying that if anyone was frank and candid , you ’d probably find that in anybody ’s breast .
LOFTON : But why ?
Why do you persist in imputing your own rottenness to other people ?
GINSBERG : One moment .
Your question is :
Why do I persist in imputing my own rottenness to other people ?
LOFTON : That ’s right .
GINSBERG : You realize that you ’re using language that could he considered insulting .
LOFTON : I hope so .
I think it ’s a rotten preference to want to have sex with young boys .
And I do n’t think it ’s true that most people want to have sex with younger people .
GINSBERG : I did n’t say that .
You ’re putting words in my mouth .
What I said was that most people have erotic desires for young people .
LOFTON : You mean a fantasy they do n’t want to act on ?
GINSBERG : Most do n’t act on it .
Of course not .
But most people have in their breasts an erotic pleasure for younger people .
This is a part of the general spectrum of human charm and emotion rather than sin or rottenness .
LOFTON : Do you now have a desire to have sex with young boys ?
GINSBERG : I have a sexual desire for them , I must say , yes .
LOFTON : Still ?
GINSBERG : Oh , the older I get , the more .
LOFTON : And after years of therapy , too .
This therapy must really be doing a good job .
GINSBERG : You know what the therapy does ?
LOFTON : It probably tells you it ’s fine , just get comfortable with it right ?
GINSBERG : No , not quite .
Usually it ’s a discussion of where this comes from and trying to find the origin of it .
And find what conditioning affected me that I arrived at this particular orientation .
That ’s all .
LOFTON : How about sin ?
Is it a possibility that you are a sinner ?
GINSBERG : That does n’t come into play .
The attempt is to understand the situation , not categorize it with knee - jerk words like sin .
LOFTON : But this sexual preference for young boys does n’t seem to be something you want to be delivered from .
You smile when you talk about it .
You do n’t want to he cured of this , do you ?
GINSBERG : I should say my sexual preference is not just for boys , but also for middle - aged men , straight men , and women .
I ’ve occasionally had fantasies about making out with trucks as well as beasts .
And maybe I ’ll be making out with you , before it ’s all over .
[ laughs ]
LOFTON : Well .
maybe I could drive that truck while you make out with it , perhaps an eighteen wheeler , with the pedal to the metal .
GINSBERG : Now there ’s your fantasy .
[ laughs ]
LOFTON : Excuse me .
but you raised the idea of having sex with a truck .
GINSBERG : You extended it .
LOFTON : I ’m just trying to accommodate you .
I even offered to drive the truck .
And you attacked me .
But to hell with you .
I wo n’t drive the truck .
Get your own truck .
GINSBERG : Oh , you ca n’t get out of it that easily .
You ’ve already driven the truck in my mind .
Gosh , you ’re funny .
But you ’ve got this sort of contentious obsession —
God knows what ’s underneath all that .
LOFTON : Well , yes ,
He does know .
GINSBERG : You ’ve got to remember that I ’m talking on the basis of the experience of remembering my unconscious .
And maybe you ’re not as aware of what ’s going on in your mind as I am about what ’s going on in mine .
And therefore when you condemn impulses or fantasies that I ’m willing to be candid about you may not be so familiar with your own mind as to know that you do contain —
LOFTON : Mr. Ginsberg , the Book of Jeremiah says that the human heart is desperately wicked .
You do n’t have to tell me — a born - again Christian , Calvinist , Reformed , Puritan — about the variety of evil fantasies human beings have .
I read the Bible , sir .
GINSBERG : But you do n’t read your unconscious , the contents of your mind , very carefully .
You do n’t remember your dreams , your day - dreams , subliminal thinking .
LOFTON : You know why ?
GINSBERG : Why ?
LOFTON : Because I ’m not like you .
You ’re a heathen who imagines vain things .
You have an overactive imagination , a mental cancer .
GINSBERG : No , it ’s not quite like that .
Do you know anything about meditation practice ?
[ At this point Ginsberg offers to show Lofton how to meditate .
Lofton agrees but asks Ginsberg if he plans to take off his clothes .
Ginsberg says no .
They meditate .
They resume the interview .
]
LOFTON : The 1970 Current Biography says that you are n’t a proselytizer for homosexuality .
What does that mean ?
GINSBERG : I ’m observing my own mind and consciousness and reporting on that and trying to be candid .
Walt Whitman , who was a very great poet and , incidentally , gay , said he thought that for poets and orators of the future the great quality would be candor , frankness , truthfulness .
LOFTON : Well , Walt Whitman suffered from , if I may say so , what might be called terminal candor — not unlike yourself .
GINSBERG : You do n’t like Whitman ?
LOFTON : No .
GINSBERG : Have you read Whitman ?
LOFTON : Some .
GINSBERG .
Do you remember the name of the poem you read ?
LOFTON : Yes , one that says something like : “ So I make mistakes .
I contradict myself .
So what ?
I contain all things , ” This is absurd .
Talk about arrogance .
GINSBERG : Dig this .
LOFTON : I ’m diggin ’ it .
GINSBERG : He says : “ Do I contradict myself ?
Very well .
I contradict myself .
I am large , I contain multitudes , ” Do you know what he meant by that ?
LOFTON : Probably nothing good .
And I doubt if he knew what he meant .
GINSBERG : Yeah , he did .
I know what he meant .
LOFTON : How do you know what he meant ?
GINSBERG : [ laughs ]
Because I am large .
I contain multitudes .
LOFTON .
But you might contradict yourself .
GINSBERG : Yes .
And I certainly will contradict myself .
LOFTON : This will be one of your multitudes the ability to contradict yourself .
GINSBERG : That ’s what Whitman is saying .
LOFTON : It ’s gibberish .
GINSBERG : That our own minds are so vast that we can wind up contradicting ourselves without having to freak out about it .
It ’s very similar to what the poet John Keats said about negative capability .
He said the quality of a very great poet like Shakespeare was his ability to contain opposite ideas in the mind without an irritable reaching out after fact and reason .
Meaning that that part of the mind which judges , and irritably insists on either black or white , is only a small part of the mind .
The larger mind observes the contradiction , and contains those contradictions .
The mind that notices that it contradicts itself is bigger than the smaller mind that is taking one side or the other .
LOFTON : You speak very confidently about this .
Where do you get your ideas about what the mind is ?
GINSBERG : By direct observation through meditation practice .
LOFTON : But at most this would tell you only about your mind , would n’t it ?
You were making statements about the mind .
GINSBERG : I should say I noticed this about my mind and John Keats noticed it about his mind .
Sure , you might want to check our which side is right but when you get irritable about it and insist on one or the other , black or white , it ’s likely you ’ll eliminate some information from both sides .
LOFTON : Is nothing black - and - white ?
GINSBERG : Nothing is completely black - and - white .
Nothing .
In two days , we enter a new Bush and Cheney - less era , though we 'll be living with their nightmarish legacy forever and a day .
In response to change , all of us have to adapt -- TomDispatch included .
This site certainly wo n't lose its focus on the world out there , the ongoing militarization of our country , the way we continue to garrison the planet , or the new military and civilian team of custodians and bureaucrats of empire just now being put in place to manage our ongoing wars .
This coming week and next , for instance , the site will turn to the nightmare in Gaza , well covered indeed by the political blogosphere , while considering what , in the new Obama era , the future may hold in the Middle East ; but TomDispatch will also ( as today ) aim to expand its domestic focus , while keeping a steady eye upon the economic devastation now roiling our country and planet .
( By the way , on some Saturdays , including the next one , I 'll be having a surprise or two for TD readers , so keep your eyes peeled .
)
Just as the Bush administration is handing off a host of foreign policy debacles to Barack Obama ( including seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , a woefully mismanaged economic bailout , and possibly a second Great Depression , so the outgoing president is leaving the new administration with a public education mess .
There 's the much maligned and underfunded No Child Left Behind
Act which is up for reauthorization this year .
The cost of going to college is also rapidly spiraling out of control , as evidenced in a recent report in which every state except California received an " F " for college affordability .
And at the same time , student loans are drying up as lenders , fearing economic disaster , scale back their programs .
With this in mind , the stakes are high for the incoming Secretary of Education and Obama pal Arne Duncan , who was received with striking warmth during his Senate confirmation hearings this week .
As Sen . Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) put it , " Mr. Duncan , there is no question that schools across America can benefit from the same kind of fresh thinking that you brought to Chicago public schools .
As you know very well , perhaps our greatest educational challenge is to improve the performance of urban and rural public schools serving high - poverty communities . "
Today , Andy Kroll skips the " applause " and the " warm reception . "
Instead , he puts Duncan 's " fresh thinking " in Chicago under the microscope .
The results may surprise .
( To catch a TomDispatch audio interview with Kroll on the new Secretary of Education , click here . )
Tom
Though the announcement came amidst a deluge of other Obama nominations -- he had unveiled key members of his energy and environment teams the day before and would add his picks for the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior the next day -- Duncan 's selection was eagerly anticipated , and garnered mostly favorable reactions in education circles and in the media .
He was described as the compromise candidate between powerful teachers ' unions and the advocates of charter schools and merit pay .
He was also regularly hailed as a " reformer , " fearless when it came to challenging the educational status quo and more than willing to shake up hidebound , moribund public school systems .
On December 16th , a friendship forged nearly two decades ago on the hardwood of the basketball court culminated in a press conference at the Dodge Renaissance Academy , an elementary school located on the west side of Chicago .
In a glowing introduction to the media , President - elect Barack Obama named Arne Duncan , the chief executive officer of the Chicago Public Schools system ( CPS ) , as his nominee for U.S. Secretary of Education .
" When it comes to school reform , " the President - elect said , " Arne is the most hands - on of hands - on practitioners .
For Arne , school reform is n't just a theory in a book -- it 's the cause of his life .
And the results are n't just about test scores or statistics , but about whether our children are developing the skills they need to compete with any worker in the world for any job . "
Yet a closer investigation of Duncan 's record in Chicago casts doubt on that label .
As he packs up for Washington , Duncan leaves behind a Windy City legacy that 's hardly cause for optimism , emphasizing as it does a business - minded , market - driven model for education .
If he is a " reformer , " his style of management is distinctly top - down , corporate , and privatizing .
It views teachers as expendable , unions as unnecessary , and students as customers .
Disturbing as well is the prominence of Duncan 's belief in offering a key role in public education to the military .
Chicago 's school system is currently the most militarized in the country , boasting five military academies , nearly three dozen smaller Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs within existing high schools , and numerous middle school Junior ROTC programs .
More troubling yet , the military academies he 's started are nearly all located in low - income , minority neighborhoods .
This merging of military training and education naturally raises concerns about whether such academies will be not just education centers , but recruitment centers as well .
Rather than handing Duncan a free pass on his way into office , as lawmakers did during Duncan 's breezy confirmation hearings last week , a closer examination of the Chicago native 's record is in order .
Only then can we begin to imagine where public education might be heading under Arne Duncan , and whether his vision represents the kind of " change " that will bring our students meaningfully in line with the rest of the world .
The Militarization of Secondary Education
Today , the flagship projects in CPS 's militarization are its five military academies , affiliated with either the Army , Navy , or Marines .
All students -- or cadets , as they 're known -- attending one of these schools are required to enroll as well in the academy 's Junior ROTC program .
That means cadets must wear full military uniforms to school everyday , and undergo daily uniform inspections .
As part of the academy 's curriculum , they must also take a daily ROTC course focusing on military history , map reading and navigation , drug prevention , and the branches of the Department of Defense .
Cadets can practice marching on an academy 's drill team , learn the proper way to fire a weapon on the rifle team , and choose to attend extracurricular spring or summer military training sessions .
At the Phoenix Military Academy , cadets are even organized into an academy battalion , modeled on an Army infantry division battalion , in which upper - class cadets fill the leading roles of commander , executive officer , and sergeant major .
In addition , military personnel from the U.S. armed services teach alongside regular teachers in each academy , and also fill administrative roles such as academy " commandants . "
Three of these military academies were created in part with Department of Defense appropriations -- funds secured by Illinois lawmakers -- and when the proposed Air Force Academy High School opens this fall , CPS will be the only public school system in the country with Air Force , Army , Navy , and Marine Corps high school academies .
CPS also boasts almost three dozen smaller Junior ROTC programs within existing high schools that students can opt to join , and over 20 voluntary middle school Junior ROTC programs .
All told , between the academies and the voluntary Junior ROTC programs , more than 10,000 students are enrolled in a military education program of some sort in the CPS system .
Officials like Duncan and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley justify the need for the military academies by claiming they do a superlative job teaching students discipline and providing them with character - building opportunities .
" These are positive learning environments , " Duncan said in 2007 .
" I love the sense of leadership .
I love the sense of discipline . "
Without a doubt , teaching students about discipline and leadership is an important aspect of being an educator .
But is the full - scale uniformed culture of the military actually necessary to impart these values ?
A student who learns to play the cello , who studies how to read music , will learn discipline too , without a military - themed learning environment .
In addition , encouraging students to be critical thinkers , to question accepted beliefs and norms , remains key to a teacher 's role at any grade level .
The military 's culture of uniformity and discipline , important as it may be for an army , hardly aligns with these pedagogical values .
Of no less concern are the types of students Chicago 's military academies are trying to attract .
All of CPS 's military academies ( except the Rickover Naval Academy ) are located in low - income neighborhoods with primarily black and / or Hispanic residents .
As a result , student enrollment in the academies consists almost entirely of minorities .
Whites , who already represent a mere 9 % of the students in the Chicago system , make up only 4 % of the students enrolled in the military academies .
There is obviously a correlation between these low - income , minority communities , the military academies being established in them , and the long - term recruitment needs of the U.S. military .
The schools essentially function as recruiting tools , despite the expectable military disclaimers .
The Chicago Tribune typically reported in 1999 that the creation of the system 's first military school in the historically black community of Bronzeville grew , in part , out of " a desire for the military to increase the pool of minority candidates for its academies . "
And before the House Armed Services Committee in 2000 , the armed services chiefs of staff testified that 30 % - 50 % of all Junior ROTC cadets later enlist in the military .
Organizations opposing the military 's growing presence in public schools insist that it's no mistake the number of military academies in Chicago is on the rise at a time when the U.S. military has had difficulty meeting its recruitment targets while fighting two unpopular wars .
It seems clear enough that , when it comes to the militarization of the Chicago school system , whatever Duncan 's goals , the results are likely to be only partly " educational . "
Merging the Market and the Classroom
While discussing his nomination , President - elect Obama praised the fact that Duncan is n't " beholden to any one ideology . "
A closer examination of his career in education , however , suggests otherwise .
As Chicago 's chief executive officer ( not to be confused with CPS 's chief education officer ) , Duncan ran his district in a most businesslike manner .
As he put it in a 2003 profile in Catalyst Chicago , an independent magazine that covers education reform , " We 're in the business of education . "
And indeed , managing the country 's third - largest school system does require sharp business acumen .
But what 's evident from Duncan 's seven years in charge is his belief that the business of education should , first and foremost , embrace the logic of the free market and privatization .
Duncan 's belief in privatizing public education can be most clearly seen in Chicago 's Renaissance 2010 plan , the centerpiece of his time in that city .
Designed by corporate consulting firm A.T. Kearney and backed by the Commercial Club of Chicago , an organization representing some of the city 's largest businesses , Renaissance 2010 has pushed hard for the closing of underperforming schools -- to be replaced by multiple new , smaller , " entrepreneurial " schools .
Under the plan , many of the new institutions established have been privatized charter or " contract " schools run by independent nonprofit outfits .
They , then , turn out to have the option of contracting school management out to for - profit education management organizations .
In addition , Renaissance 2010 charter schools , not being subject to state laws and district initiatives , can -- as many have -- eliminate the teachers ' union altogether .
Under Duncan 's leadership , CPS and Renaissance 2010 schools have adopted a performance - driven style of governance in which well - run schools and their teachers and administrators are rewarded , and low - performing schools are penalized .
As Catalyst Chicago reported , " Star schools and principals have been granted more flexibility and autonomy , and often financial freedom and bonus pay . "
Low - performing schools put on probation , on the other hand , " have little say over how they can spend poverty funding , an area otherwise controlled by elected local school councils [ Local school councils ] at struggling schools have also lost the right to hire or fire principals -- restrictions that have outraged some parent activists . "
Students as well as teachers and principals are experiencing firsthand the impact of Duncan 's belief in competition and incentive - based learning .
This fall , the Chicago Public Schools rolled out a Green for Grade $ program in which the district will pay freshmen at 20 selected high schools for good grades -- $ 50 in cash for an A , $ 35 for a B , and even $ 20 for a C .
Though students not surprisingly say they support the program -- what student would n't want to get paid for grades ?
-- critics contend that cash - for - grades incentives , which stir interest in learning for all the wrong reasons , turn being educated into a job .
Duncan 's rhetoric offers a good sense of what his business - minded approach and support for bringing free - market ideologies into public education means .
At a May 2008 symposium hosted by the Renaissance Schools Fund , the nonprofit financial arm of Renaissance 2010 , entitled " Free to Choose , Free to Succeed : The New Market of Public Education , " Duncan typically compared his job running a school district to that of a stock portfolio manager .
As he explained , " I am not a manager of 600 schools .
I'm a portfolio manager of 600 schools and I 'm trying to improve the portfolio . "
He would later add , " We 're trying to blur the lines between the public and the private . "
A Top -Down Leadership Style
Barack Obama built his campaign on impressive grassroots support and the democratic nature of his candidacy .
Judging by his continued outreach to supporters , he seems intent on leading , at least in part , with the same bottom - up style .
Duncan 's style could n't be more different .
Under Duncan , the critical voices of parents , community leaders , students , and teachers regularly fell on deaf ears .
As described by University of Illinois at Chicago professor and education activist Pauline Lipman in the journal Educational Policy in 2007 , Renaissance 2010 provoked striking resistance within affected communities and neighborhoods .
There were heated community hearings and similarly angry testimony at Board of Education meetings , as well as door - to - door organizing , picketing , and even , at one point , a student walk - out .
" The opposition , " Lipman wrote , " brought together unions , teachers , students , school reformers , community leaders and organizations , parents in African American South and West Side communities , and some Latino community activists and teachers . "
Yet , as she pointed out recently , mounting neighborhood opposition had little effect .
" I 'm pretty in tune with the grassroots activism in education in Chicago , " she said , " and people are uniformly opposed to these policies , and uniformly feel that they have no voice . "
During Duncan 's tenure , decision - making responsibilities that once belonged to elected officials shifted into the hands of unelected individuals handpicked by the city 's corporate or political elite .
For instance , elected local school councils , made up mostly of parents and community leaders , are to be scaled back or eliminated altogether as part of Renaissance 2010 .
Now , many new schools can simply opt out of such councils .
Then there 's the Renaissance Schools Fund .
It oversees the selection and evaluation of new schools and subsequent investment in them .
Made up of unelected business leaders , the CEO of the system , and the Chicago Board of Education president , the Fund takes the money it raises and makes schools compete against each other for limited private funding .
It has typically been criticized by community leaders and activists for being an opaque , unaccountable body indifferent to the will of Chicago 's citizens .
Making the grade ?
Despite his controversial educational policies , Duncan 's supporters ultimately contend that , as the CEO of Chicago 's schools , he 's gotten results where it matters -- test scores .
An objective , easily quantifiable yet imperfect measure of student learning , test scores have indeed improved in several areas under Duncan ( though many attribute this to lowered statewide testing standards and more lenient testing guidelines ) .
Between 2001 and 2008 , for instance , the percentage of elementary school students meeting or exceeding standards on the Illinois Standards Achievement Test increased from 39.5 % to 65 % .
The number of CPS students meeting or exceeding the Illinois Learning Standards , another statewide secondary education achievement assessment , also increased from 38 % in 2002 to 60 % in 2008 .
When measured on a national scale , however , Duncan 's record looks a lot less impressive .
In comparison to other major urban school districts ( including Los Angeles , Boston , New York City , and Washington , D.C. ) in the National Assessment of Educational Progress , or " The Nation 's Report Card , " Chicago fourth and eighth graders ranked , with only one exception , in the bottom half of all districts in math , reading , and science in 2003 , 2005 and 2007 .
In addition , from 2004 to 2008 , the Chicago Public Schools district failed to make " adequate yearly progress " as mandated by the Bush administration 's No Child Left Behind Act .
Even if Duncan 's policies do continue to boost test scores in coming years , the question must be asked :
At whose expense ?
In a competition - driven educational system , some schools will , of course , succeed , receiving more funding and so hiring the most talented teachers .
At the same time , schools that are n't " performing " will be put on probation , stripped of their autonomy , and possibly closed , only to be reopened as privately - run outfits -- or even handed over to the military .
The highest achieving students ( that is , the best test - takers ) will have access to the most up - to - date facilities , advanced equipment , and academic support programs ; struggling students will likely be left behind , separate and unequal , stuck in decrepit classrooms and underfunded schools .
Public education is not meant to be a win-lose , us - versus - them system , nor is it meant to be a recruitment system for the military -- and yet this , it seems , is at the heart of Duncan 's legacy in Chicago , and so a reasonable indication of the kind of " reform " he 's likely to bring to the country as education secretary .

There 's a lot of talk of how densely populated Gaza is , but a new report from the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage & Commemoration Center shows how Hamas has used its control over Gaza to spread its terror infrastructure among the masses .
The 81 - page report details how population centers are used to house military personnel , bombs and other explosives and as bases from which to fire rockets at Israeli cities .
It cites the number of secondary explosions following an Israeli - bombing , which indicates the targets , in fact , stored Hamas munitions .
It 's impossible to assess how many civilian casualties are due to those secondary explosions .
But the report makes clear that Hamas deliberately urges women and children to serve as human shields :
" During Operation Cast Lead and in many instances in the past , the terrorist organizations have exploited IDF warnings to civilians to evacuate their residences before attacks to send children and adolescents to the relevant locations , knowing the IDF will not deliberately attack civilians .
Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya and many other Hamas leaders ( such as Nizar Rayyan , killed in Operation Cast Lead ) have openly boasted about their use of their human shield tactics . "
While Israeli critics throw the phrase " war crimes " around , the report cites specific violations by Hamas :
" We want to make sure that this situation is dealt with very vigorously , and that there is clear guidance given to the public and that we deal with this a quickly as possible so that in the coming days we can restore normality . "
A school destroyed by militants in Saidu Sharif in Swat Taleban militants have blown up another five schools in north - west Pakistan , officials say , despite a government pledge to safeguard education .
The schools were destroyed in the town of Mingora in troubled Swat district .
The Taleban issued an edict in December that private schools must close by 15 January as part of their campaign to ban education for girls .
Meanwhile the Khyber route for supplies into Afghanistan was temporarily closed on Monday after a militant attack .
' Scared '
The attacks in Mingora took place despite a curfew .
No -one was hurt as the winter holidays had begun .
A government official , Shaukat Yousafzai , told Reuters : " Attacks on troops are understandable but why are they destroying schools ? "
Diary of a Swat schoolgirl Swat diary : ' Taleban rule now '
The militants have destroyed more than 150 government schools over the past year , most of them for girls .
The Taleban want to impose their austere interpretation of Islamic law and oppose education for girls - which they say is un -Islamic .
Winter holidays began on 1 January but some private schools stayed open to catch up with lost classes .
But school owners in Mingora have now complied with the ban and say that the schools will not reopen until the Taleban revoke it or the conflict in Swat is resolved .
They say that even if they keep the schools open , parents are unlikely to send their children in view of the Taleban threat .
Mr Yousafzai said teachers were refusing to work .
" I try to convince them but they 're scared .
They doubt the government 's ability to protect them . "
In her diary for the BBC Urdu service , a seventh grade schoolgirl from Swat says there was little excitement about the winter school holidays - which for her began on 15 January .
She writes on 14 January : " Since today was the last day of our school , we decided to play in the playground a bit longer .
I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again . "
There are close to 2,000 schools in Swat district .
Some 1,600 of them are run by the government , including more than 500 girls ' schools , education officials say .
The rest are privately owned .
Route briefly closed
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says militants in Swat now control most areas except Mingora town and the road that connects it to the rest of the country .
Militants have frequently attacked convoys on the Khyber route
They have been targeting school buildings , sectarian opponents and local politicians .
Information Minister Sherry Rehman told reporters on Sunday the administration was working towards reopening schools on 1 March .
She earlier said the government would work with the provincial administration to protect education , particularly for girls , in North West Frontier Province .
Meanwhile , a militant attack on Monday forced the temporary closure of the Khyber Pass to convoys supplying foreign troops in Afghanistan .
The attack on a military camp left one soldier dead .
Government official Zar Bacha Khan told Reuters news agency the route had been reopened after 10 men were arrested .
The number of attacks on convoys by insurgents has increased and the pass has been closed several times before .
Last December , Pakistani security forces attempted to clear militants from the route , which provides up to 75 % of supplies for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan .

You may not know it , but today is National Pie Day ( at least according to the folks at the American Pie Council , which , by the way ... sweet gig ! ) .
It 's the 23rd anniversary of the venerated holiday , which was created -- appropriately , if rather disgustingly , enough -- to commemorate Crisco 's 75th anniversary .
Yes , we are a country that celebrates lard .
The American Pie Council suggests that you bake pies for all your friends and family today in hopes of " starting a tradition of pie-giving . "
You could go with the standards -- apple , pumpkin , or chocolate creme , which are Americans ' top three favorite pies according to Serious Eats .
Or you could make your pies all fancified and make a milk chocolate banana pie or a chilled grapefruit - caramel meringue pie , two of Food & Wine 's ten all - time favorite pies .
Or , if you 're like me , you could just grab a slice at one of the fine establishments listed below the jump .
House of Pies , 3112 Kirby Drive
This long - time Houston institution is more fondly known by the moniker " House of Guys , " owing to the sheer fabulousness that graces its divinely retro booths after late nights in nearby Montrose .
But that 's not the only fabulousness to be found here : the strawberry - rhubarb pie is heaven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the French blackbottom pie with its chocolate cream and vanilla rum custard is to die for .
Luby 's , multiple locations
When nostalgia sets in , there 's no place like Luby's to indulge youthful memories of lingering lunches after church on Sundays or weeknight meals with the grandparents .
The cafeteria - style setting is oddly comforting , with its bright cubes of Jell - O and Luann platters of liver and onions .
Equally comforting is their scrumptious chocolate icebox pie , which tastes exactly -- and happily -- like childhood .
Barbecue Inn , 116 West Crosstimbers
Despite its meaty name , patrons swear by the coconut pie at this old - school family - run restaurant in Garden Oaks .
While you 're there , make sure to try Barbecue Inn 's fried chicken and chicken fried steak -- easily some of the best in town .
My Dee Dee's Pie Shoppe , 301 West Gulf Bank
Although known for Soup Nazi-esque customer service , people still flock to My Dee Dee 's for their fantastic pies and cakes .
They also serve lunch , but it 's the pies and their pitch - perfect crusts that will keep you coming back .
Chocolate seems to be the key here : the chocolate meringue and chocolate pecan pies are among the best in town .
Flying Saucer Pie Company , 436 West Crosstimbers
I would be remiss not to mention Flying Saucer , which is not only the oldest pie shop in Houston ( 42 years and counting ) but is also visible from space on holidays due to the line that stretches out the door like a Great Wall of Pie Lovers .
While in serious demand in the holiday season , you can go by Flying Saucer on a weekday without too much fuss and pick up a whole pie to surprise your family with or just grab a slice of any pie for only $ 2.50 .
Favorites include the fresh strawberry cream pie and the blackberry pie ( which is only available from March through July ) .
Got a favorite pie establishment of your own ?
Feel free to sing its praises in the comments section below .
WASHINGTON - A federal judge yesterday accused the Bush administration of hiding evidence in the case of a Yemen man who has been held as a terror suspect at Guantanamo Bay for six years .
US District Judge Emmet Sullivan said he was forced to delay ruling on whether to free Aymen Saeed Batarfi because as many as 10 documents of classified information were withheld from the court until recently .
" I think it 's unfair , I think it 's disingenuous , " Sullivan said during an hour - long hearing .
He added : " This government , especially , hides the ball when it suits this government 's purpose . "
Sullivan also presided over last fall 's trial of former Senator Ted Stevens , when prosecutors broke rules requiring them to turn over evidence favorable to the Alaska Republican .
In yesterday 's case , Justice Department attorneys admitted that at least some of the recently - revealed documents dated back to September .
But Justice attorney John Henebery said the government did not believe the information had to be turned over immediately .
The information in the documents - compiled by the Defense Department and other government intelligence agencies - is unknown because it is classified .
Much of the evidence in the cases of hundreds of detainees who are seeking release in US District Court in Washington will never be made public .
Batarfi's attorneys say the 38 - year - old Yemen doctor was first held by US forces at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in late 2001 and transferred to the US naval station at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in April 2002 .

Pictured :
The incredibly rare baby lemur clutching its teddy ' mother '
With her bright hazel eyes , mop of fluffy grey hair , and tiny black face , this adorable baby lemur looks happy to have found something to cling on to .
Staff at Besancon Zoo in eastern
France have named the newly born Madagascar lemur as Tahina - one of only 17 Propithecus coronatus lemurs living in captivity worldwide .
She is being cared for by vets , who must feed her around the clock with a tiny syringe filled with a mixture of cat and baby milk .
Cuddly comfort :
Tahina the lemur holds on tight to her teddy bear
Tahina has also been given a cuddly teddy bear that she can clutch to like she would in the wild with her real mother .
Looking like a cross between a cat , dog and a squirrel , the lemur is the smallest of the
world 's primates .
Daunting start :
This baby lemur has been born into the world without its mother
With their clever foxy face , big amber eyes ( as adults ) , and trademark tail as long as itself , they are native primarily to Madagascar , the vast island that broke away from Africa 60 million years ago .
They were wiped out from other parts of Africa centuries ago by bigger and more aggressive primates .
In the wilds around Lake Aloatra in eastern Madagascar , the lemur is still under threat from the villagers who eat them as a local delicacy .
Round - the - clock care : A veterinarian feeds Tahina with a tiny syringe
Many species have become extinct over the past century , mainly due to habitat destruction and hunting .
But the good news for this endangered species is that captive - bred lemurs appear to survive successfully after being turned loose in their native Madagascar , where they are under threat from the destruction of their natural habitat .
Lemurs share some of the social and behavioral characteristics of monkeys and form social groups .
They are also noisy animals , making a bizarre range of sounds from the grunts and swears of brown lemurs to the eerie , wailing call of the indri , which has been likened to a cross between a police siren and the song of a humpback whale .
Angry monkeys turn on their cruel trainer and beat him senseless with his own stick after he handed out a vicious beating to one of the trio during a performance riding mini bicycles in a market in Sizhou , China

Twply , the Twitter site that promised to email your replies to your inbox while protecting your password , appears to have tweeted a promotional message for the service on your account even if you opted out of this option .
To add insult to injury , the site was sold today on Sitepoint for $ 1200 , just one day after launch .
The site , which required you to enter your Twitter password , has now sold that confidential data to the winning bidder - site user worldbuyer .
Here 's the Twply pitch from Sitepoint :
The site launched last night ,
The site provides a service to take @replies and send them to email .
The new owner will need to have a SMTP server with no limits to handle all the emails the server will be sending out .
Twply has been spread through twitter like nothing I have ever seen before , over 800 accounts added in one day .
What 's worldbuyer going to do with your private data ?
That remains to be seen , but the bigger question is when will Twitter users decide to stop handing over their passwords to unvetted third parties who may abuse those details ?
I personally think that my privacy is worth way more than $ 1200 , but where do you stand on this issue ?

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Peter W. Singer is not your typical “ military expert . ”
At 33 years old , he is the director of the Brookings Institution ’s 21st Century Defense Initiative and the youngest senior fellow in the think tank ’s 90 - year history .
In 2003 , his book Corporate Warriors chronicled the rise of the privatized military industry ; Children at War , released in 2005 , examined the tragic phenomenon of child soldiers .
He also served as the coordinator of President Barack Obama ’s defense policy task force during Obama ’s campaign — a role he took on after consulting for The West Wing .
In his new book , Wired for War , Singer takes an in - depth and at times frightening look at the growing use of robotics by the military — a development that he argues will be looked on as “ something revolutionary in war , maybe even in human history . ”
Recently , he spoke with Mother Jones about the unforeseen ripple effects of these new technologies , the folly of calls to use robots in Darfur , and whether we should ban these machines before it ’s too late .
Mother Jones :
Was there anything in particular that surprised you or scared you as you researched the book ?
Peter Singer : I think three parts were most surprising .
One was the openness with which people talk about how science fiction influenced what the scientists build and what the military asked to be built .
That ’s what drew me to research science fiction ’s influence on science reality .
I was really driven by just how many people would describe some weapon or robot and say , “ I was watching this Star Wars movie with my kids and I thought it would be cool if we could have something like that . ”
And it ’d be a Marine colonel saying that .
There is also a great scene in the book where the folks at a human rights organization I was visiting are referencing Star Trek more than the Geneva Conventions .
The second part of this is how quickly things moved .
In the first draft of the book there were systems on the commercial and military side that did n’t exist then that are out there now .
Related , this issue of arming and autonomy of robots is farther along than I thought .
Finding some of the studies about “ taking man out of the loop ” was a little bit surprising and scary .
Finally , the international “ blowback ” issue was much bigger than I suspected , which became very clear after interviews with folks in the Middle East .
I knew , of course , broadly that there were serious issues with our public diplomacy , but how dire it was when it came to our new military technology was a little bit surprising even to me .
MJ : What do you think are the most overlooked negative consequences of developing a more roboticized fighting force ?
PS : The part that I find overlooked from the political side is how our greater use of these technologies affects our own understanding of war , especially the public ’s links to war .
We can walk through a recent example .
There was an editorial in the Washington Post this month that talked about how we should do something in Darfur with unmanned machines .
Now , let ’s leave aside the irony of a humanitarian intervention done by an inhuman machine .
What we overlook too often is that military operations are not simply throwaway commitments , even with machines .
They involve you in something that is complex and long - term on the ground .
The public ’s relationship to their military in the US is a frayed thread right now .
We do n’t have a draft .
We do n’t have declarations of wars anymore .
We do n’t even have presidents asking the public to pay higher taxes .
Now add in a situation where Americans are mainly only risking their machines .
The bar to war was already lowering .
Now you take it all the way to the ground .
This was a huge concern of the soldiers I interviewed .
MJ : Also , so many of your interviews showed that the strategic impact of using more robotics on the battlefield is questionable , and that they could even backfire .
PS : It ’s tough because you ’re dealing with two arguments that make a great deal of sense .
The “ hearts and minds ” element is so important to countering insurgencies , but at the same time the technology has proven to be useful .
The limited discussions that we ’ve had on robots have always been on absolutist terms .
How this is all playing out in reality is way more complicated .
And it ’s already complicated now with our current Model T Ford versions of robotic technology .
Imagine how it will look with the next generation and the generation after that .
In my world of the people who study war and defense issues , we simply did not talk about robotics .
We do not talk about it because it ’s seen as mere science fiction .
Well , guess what ?
It ’s cold , hard , metallic reality .
These systems are being used right now whether you like it or not , and they are only the start .
MJ : How are robots going to affect our connection to modern war ?
PS : More than just removing humans from risk , these technologies record everything that they see .
So they reshape the public ’s relationship with war .
This has given rise to what soldiers call “ war porn . ”
You get some clip of the UAV [ unmanned aerial vehicle ] blowing someone up in an email , as if it ’s a joke .
There are 7,000 video clips of combat footage out there for anyone to download , put to music , etc .
There ’s no other way to put it .
It bastardizes the experience of war .
It should really scare us .
That ’s why I make the parallel with ESPN and the NBA .
It ’s one thing to be at the game or even play in the game ; it ’s another to watch it on TV .
It ’s even another to see it just via SportsCenter clips like these , which make the experience just a facade of all slam dunks and smart bombs .
Then , you have the ultimate nightmare scenario :
What if we all do n’t even care to watch the clips ?
What if our relation to war is n’t like the NBA , but the WNBA ?
MJ : Having taken on Corporate Warriors , what kind of similarities do you see between the private military industry and robotics ?
PS : I actually think that there is a bigger connection than maybe is obvious .
By that I do n’t mean that Robo - Blackwater is going to be knocking at your door anytime soon .
They both challenge our assumptions about war .
Corporate Warriors was about the fact that the public ’s monopoly of the military has broken down .
You have private actors in war that are fighting not as part of state militaries , but private military corporations .
Another assumption about warriors is that they are human .
Well , guess what ?
Machines are increasingly doing the fighting .
But even if they are human , the look of that human is being reshaped by technology .
Your image is likely of John Wayne storming the beachhead .
But it ’s also now the guy sitting behind his computer in a cubicle outside of Las Vegas .
It ’s also the SWORDS system [ an armed ground robot that has been deployed to Iraq ] .
Another theme that connects both books is that we started hiring these guys without thinking about the consequences or creating the proper legal structures to ensure accountability .
Well , substitute the word “ robot ” for “ contractor ” and the same thing can be said .
You are using them more and more but they are creating questions in the legal realm that you do n’t have the answers for yet .
So you ’re jumping into the water without looking first .
Finally , there is the bigger story about the disconnect between the public and their foreign and defense policies .
Private military firms are a way of avoiding the cost of going to war .
I do n’t mean the financial cost , but trying to dodge the public cost .
And that ’s the same thing with unmanned systems , just in a whole new digitized way , maybe a deeper way .
MJ : How do you see the coverage of this issue in the mainstream media , and why is there not more criticism ?
PS : This is the story of humans on every problem .
We wait until Pandora ’s box is opened before we say , “ Wow , maybe we should understand what ’s in that box . ”
What intrigues me is that there are some things where we are willing to have these discussions of big trends even before they ’re fully playing out .
For example , we ’re finally having a serious discussion about global warming , even though it wo n’t take full effect until 2030 or 2050 .
But for some reason you ca n’t do that when it comes to defense issues and war .
You ca n’t talk about anything beyond the tip of your nose .
The gatekeepers of the field do n’t want you to have that kind of discussion .
MJ : What do you make of the SWORDS , which has been praised in the press ?
PS : The goal of the book was to be critical in terms of asking the questions that need to be asked .
The SWORDS certainly deliver on a lot of things that they were asked to deliver on .
You ca n’t get mad at the company for building this thing .
But you need to ask the next question about the ripple effects .
What happens next ?
How is it used , and what are the implications ?
I just do n’t see us undertaking that kind of critical questioning right now .
It ’s pretty amazing because I really do believe that we ’re going to look back on this period as something revolutionary in war , maybe even in human history .
Certainly to the level of the atomic bomb , maybe even greater .
And is n’t it insane that we ’re not having that discussion right now ?
Unlike the period of the atomic bomb , it ’s happening right in front of us .
It ’s not happening in some secret lab somewhere .
MJ : Given your role in the Obama campaign , do you have any idea of how he or his national security team is thinking about moving forward with robotics ?
PS : In the current defense and economic environment , you are simply not going to be able to buy everything that you want .
So that means that you ’re going to have to focus on things that meet the needs of soldiers in the field .
Now where that relates to unmanned systems is the irony that these are the most high - demand systems right now .
For example , we ’re meeting only about 5 percent of the soldiers ’ demand for drone footage .
While I do n’t think you ’ll see any kind of international regime on these systems in the hopeful eight years of the Obama administration , I do think we will see an interest in the elements that underscore good policy and good arms control .
MJ : You examine the genre of sci- fi , which often seems to warn of the dangers of the path that we ’re currently headed down .
What predictions do you think are likely to come to pass ?
PS : Sci-fi is often a metaphor .
Were the creators of The Matrix saying that one day soon machines are going to run a world like this , or were they making the point that we are already wrapped within a matrix of technology that we depend on every day and we just do n’t realize it ?
I think it ’s more the themes and questions that science fiction raises rather than the exact predictions that should guide us .
MJ : You also go over historical examples of what has been done about weapons that we found beyond the pale , and various proposals for what could be done with robotics .
What would you like to see happen ?
PS : I think the first step is that you have to open the discussion .
We ca n’t just continue to be in denial about these technologies .
We know what ’s happened with every single previous technology that seemed like science fiction .
People said , “ Oh no , we ’ll never use that in war . ”
And yet we did .
That was true whether you were talking about airplanes and strategic bombing or nuclear weapons .
And if you wait until after the fact , it ’s a whole different story .
My fear is that that ’s what ’s going to happen — in fact , I think it ’s already in a way happening — with robotics and the military .
Importantly , this discussion has to involve not just the scientists , but also the political scientists .
It ’s got to be a multidisciplinary discussion .
You ca n’t have it be another repeat of what happened with the people working on the atomic bomb .
I think the example of what ’s happened with genetics research is a great potential guidepost for that .
They knew they were working on something that was n’t just important in the hard sciences but was going to be really important to humanity writ large .
And that meant that they better start involving a much wider set of people and wrestling with the issues that came out .
It does n’t mean we somehow solved all of the problems with genetics , but people are working on it .
MJ : What should be the role of international law ?
Should there be an international treaty to limit or ban their usage ?
PS : We may well conclude that there is a need for certain arms control , that there are certain elements of these weapons that we think should not be developed or should not be used in war .
Indeed , if history is any guide , there are a lot of weapons that we ’ve developed which we ’ve pulled back from — biological weapons , chemical weapons , etc .
This may be the case with armed autonomous robotics , where we ultimately pull back from them .
Or , there may be elements that you say need to be written or built into the system , such as a fail - safe device on any robot , or software to ensure that it follows ethical protocols .
But the biggest thing is that you ca n’t be in this current mode of denial .
History is not going to look kindly on us — if we ’re lucky enough to be around a hundred years from now — if we just keep our head in the sand on this issue because it sounds too science fiction .

In my last post I showed how to incrementally match long strings against regular expressions .
I now want to apply similar methods to matching languages that can't be described by regular expressions .
( Note that ' language ' is just jargon for a set of strings that meet some criterion . )
In particular , regular expressions can't be used to test a string for balanced parentheses .
This is because we need some kind of mechanism to count how many open parentheses are still pending and a finite state machine can't represent arbitrary integers .
So let 's start with a slightly more abstract description of what was going on last time so we can see the bigger picture .
We were storing strings in balanced trees with a kind of ' measurement ' or ' digest ' of the string stored in the nodes of the tree .
Each character mapped to an element of a monoid via a function calledand you can think of the measurement function as acting on entire strings if youtogether all of the measurements for each of the characters .
So what we have is a functiontaking strings to some type M ( in the last post M was a type of array ) with the properties
By noticing that String is itself a monoid we can write this asAnything satisfying these laws is called a monoid homomorphism , or just homomorphism for short .
So the technique I used worked like this : I found a homomorphism fromto some type with the useful property that for any string s , still contains all the information required to figure out if we 're dealing with a member of our language .
Ifturns a string into something more efficient to work with then we can make our string matching more efficient .
Now I want to make the notion of " contains all the information required " more precise by considering an example .
Consider strings that consist only of the charactersand .
Our language will be the set of strings whose parentheses balance .
In other words the total number ofmust match the total number of , and as we scan from left to right we must never see morethan .
For example , andare in our language , butis n't .
This language is called the Dyck language .
Suppose we 're testing whether or not some string is in the Dyck language .
If we seeas a substring then if we delete it from the string , it makes no difference to whether or not the string is in the Dyck language .
In fact , if we seeand so on they can all be deleted .
On the other hand , you can't deletewithout knowing about the rest of the string .
Deleting it frommakes no difference to its membership in the Dyck language , but deleting it fromcertainly does .
So given a language L , we can say that two strings , x and y , are interchangeable with respect to L if any time we see x as a substring of another string we can replace it with y , and vice versa , without making any difference to whether the string is in the language .
Interchangeable strings are a kind of waste of memory .
If we 're testing for membership of L there 's no need to distinguish between them .
So we 'd like our measurement homomorphism to map all interchangeable strings to the same values .
But we do n't want to map any more strings to the same value because then we lose information that tells us if a string is an element of L .
A homomorphism that strikes this balance perfectly is called the ' canonical homomorphism ' and the image of the set of all strings under this homomorphisms is called the syntactic monoid .
By ' image ' , I simply mean all the possible values that could arise from applying the homomorphism to all possible strings .
So lets go back to the Dyck language .
Any time we seewe can delete it .
But if we delete every occurence offrom a string then all we have left is a bunch offollowed by a bunch of .
Let 's say it 's p of the former , and q of the latter .
Every string of parentheses can be distilled down to a pair of integers ≥0 , ( p , q ) .
But does this go far enough ?
Could we distill any further ?
Well for any choice of ( p , q ) it 's a good exercise to see that for any other choice of ( p ' , q ' ) there 's always a string in the Dyck language where if you have ) as a substring , replacing it with ( p ' , q ' ) gives you something not in the language .
So you can't distill any further .
Which means we have our syntactic monoid and canonical homomorphism .
In this case the monoid is called the bicyclic monoid and we can implement it as follows :
Where did that code forcome from ?
Consider ) .
We can deletefrom the middle many times over .
Now we can more or less reproduce the code of last week and get a Dyck language tester .
Once we 've distilled a string down to ( p , q ) we only need to test whether or not p=q=0 to see whether or not our parentheses are balanced :
There 's a completely different way to test membership of the Dyck language .
Replace eachwith 1 andwith - 1 . Now scan from left to right keeping track of ( 1 ) the sum of all the numbers so far and ( 2 ) the minimum value taken by this sum .
If the final sum and the final minimal sum are zero , then we have matching parentheses .
But we need to do this on substrings without scanning from the beginning in one go .
That 's an example of a parallel prefix sum problem and it's what I talked about here
So here 's an extended exercise : adapt the parallel prefix sum approach to implement incremental Dyck language testing with fingertrees .
You should end up with a canonical homomorphism that 's similar to the one above .
It 'll probably be slightly different but ultimately equivalent .
And here 's an even more extended exercise : protein sequences are sequences from a 20 letter alphabet .
Each letter can be assigned a hydrophobicity value from certain tables .
( Pick whichever table you want . )
The hydrophobicity of a string is the sum of the hydrophobicities of its letters .
Given a string , we can give it a score corresponding to the largest hydrophobicity of any contiguous substring in it .
Use fingertrees and a suitable monoid to track this score as the string is incrementally edited .
Note how widely separated substrings can suddenly combine together as stuff between them is adjusted .
If you 're interested in Dyck languages with multiple types of parenthesis that need to match you need something much more fiendish
Not only do they serve long and tiring hours in the reserve forces , and not only are they forced to deal with violent clashes with settlers , but now , Border Guard officers of Ethiopian descent are also faced with rising racism .
Tensions High Senior security official : Youths in Hebron motivated by hatred / Efrat Weiss Violent Jewish youths in Hebron are motivated by hatred for State , senior security official tells Ynet Wednesday night ; rightist hardliner Daniela Weiss likely to be arrested soon , he says Full Story
" Niggers do n't expel Jews !
This is n't what we brought you to Israel for ! " are just some of the degrading slurs Border Guard officers reported hearing from masked settlers .
During the violent clashes between Israeli forces and settlers in Hebron on Tuesday " a bunch of veiled people started yelling at us :
Who are you to expel us from our home ?
An Ethiopian does not expel a Jew !
A nigger does not expel a Jew ! " one Border Guard officer of Ethiopian descent recounted .
" I just did n't know what to do with myself , " he said .
Officers ' deeply offended ' by remarks
And it turns out this was not the only such incident to take place .
Another officer reported that while arriving to make an arrest about a week and - a - half ago , a group of youths verbally attacked him saying , " Who told you to come and evacuate us ?
You Ethiopians .
What are you , this State 's niggers ?
Olmert 's niggers ? "
The officers said they were deeply offended by these remarks , but stressed that the ones making them were settler youths coming from outside of Hebron , and not the residents of the Jewish settlement or Kiryat Arba , who have treated them with respect .
Border Guard sources reported that racist remarks were also made against Druze soldiers .
" We knew that this would happen so we instructed our officers in advance , " said a source .
" We harshly condemn those extremists that bring a bad name to an entire public by using racial slurs against Border Guard fighters that spend night and day protecting residents of the West Bank .
" As part of the preparations for the mission the fighters were instructed to ignore such comments and carry out their mission with the utmost professionalism . "

If that hints at a new way forward for the film industry in this credit - crunch era , so does the theme of Slumdog Millionaire .
One of the delights of Beaufoy 's script is a contradiction : the portrayal of a city obsessed with amassing wealth – the hustle , the deal , the next get - rich - quick scheme – with a romantic young man at its centre who cares nothing for money .
Instead , the overwhelmingly important thing in his life is his love for Latika , a slum girl he has known since childhood .
He loses her for years at a time , and finally finds her living as a wealthy gangster 's girlfriend and pleads with her to run away with him .
" What will we live on ? " she asks anxiously , in the story 's key exchange .
" Love , " he says , simply .
Rove thinks Pelosi's out to get him
Karl Rove thinks Nancy Pelosi was talking about him when she opened the door to a House probe of Bush administration machinations on Sunday .
" What was she talking about yesterday ? " a Fox anchor asked Bush 's Brain on Monday .
" About prosecuting and investigating people in your administration . "
" What do you think she 's talking about ? "
Rove , a contributor to the network , responded with a grin .
" Who do you think she was pointing to ? ...
Read carefully the description of who she said we ought to be looking at . "
Then one of the hosts , apparently joking about a Rove persecution complex , quoted the Kinks :
" Paranoia will destroy ya . "

Controversial
Time began selecting a " Man of the Year " in 1927 and has selected a man , woman or group every year since .
In one year it chose the computer for the title .
TIME'S 'PERSON OF THE YEAR '
Time says its award recognises ' the most powerful individuals and forces shaping the world '
Many US presidents have been named Person of the Year , including George W Bush and Bill Clinton Controversially , Adolf Hitler , Joseph Stalin and Ayatollah Khomeini have also been given the title
In 2006 , the magazine gave the award to everyone who had used or created online content that year In 1999 , the title was changed to " Person of the Year " to be more inclusive .
The BBC's Andy Gallacher in Washington says receiving the accolade is usually considered an honour .
But is has also been awarded to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin in the past , for less honourable reasons .
Four runners - up for this year 's title were also announced , as well as 17 " people who mattered " .
The runners - up were US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson , French and current EU President Nicholas Sarkozy , Republican vice - presidential candidate and Alaskan governor Sarah Palin and Zhang Yimou , creative director of August 's Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing .
Among the " people who mattered " were released Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt , Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe , the former CEO of the collapsed bank Lehman Brothers and Tina Fey , the actress who impersonated Mrs Palin during the US election campaign .

Normally I try to let sleeping dogs lie .
But this is one hound who keeps barking and wo n't shut up .
I am speaking in this instance about one of the central figures in the Julie Amero case , Norwich Police Detective Mark Lounsbury .
In case you 're not up to speed on the Amero case , Lounsbury is the " computer forensics expert " who was used by the prosecution to help convict her .
In January 2007 Amero was found guilty of endangering minors by a Connecticut jury for exposing 7th graders to porn sites on a classroom computer .
In June 2007 the conviction was vacated and a new trial ordered by a judge after computer security experts intervened , saying this was clearly a case of a malware infestation spewing porn pop ups .
Amero finally pled guilty to a lesser charge last November just to get the case over with .
End of story , right ?
Not exactly .
Because now a new blog has appeared titled julie amero , alex eckelberry , rick green , et all [ sic ] .
The author of said blog ?
Yes , that 's right , Det. Mark Lounsbury .
Not that Lounsbury actually puts his name anywhere on the site .
The author of this one - pager calls himself " no-opinions - just - facts . "
He also posts a photograph of himself in a police uniform holding what looks like an M - 16 assault rifle .
And he clearly wanted those of us in Cringeville to see it , because earlier today " Mark " posted a comment linking to his blog to one of last month 's posts about Amero .
It 's a quasi - coherent rant at best , but as far as I can gather Lounsbury is convinced Julie Amero was actively seeking out porn primarily because a link on one of the pages displayed on her computer changed color .
Per the technical report [ PDF ] produced by that team of computer security wonks :
" Lounsbury testified that he solely relied on ComputerCop Professional for his forensic analysis .
By the company ’s own admission , the program is incapable of determining whether a site was visited intentionally or accidentally ....
It ’s worth noting that , to our knowledge , ComputerCop is not a program that is widely used in expert forensic circles , despite intimations otherwise on the company ’s website . "
What seems more likely to you ?
That a woman who 's seven months pregnant and technologically illiterate would be actively surfing lesbian sites in full view of a class of seventh graders ?
Or that a computer left wholly unprotected on the Net got infested with malware and began producing illicit pop-ups ?
Who seems more qualified to make that call ?
A team of seven highly experienced computer security experts ?
Or some lone cop with an obscure software program who emails messages filled with strange apocalyptic rhetoric to the experts and journalists following the case ?
In Lounsbury 's world , he 's sane and the rest of us are loonie tunes .
But do n't take my word for it .
Check out Mark 's blog and decide for yourself .
And whatever you do , if you 're ever passing through Norwich , Connecticut , try not to get arrested .
So who 's the sane one ?

Dr Spock now believes that circumcision of males is traumatic , painful , and of questionable value .
When a baby boy is circumcised , the sleeve of skin that normally covers the head of the penis ( the foreskin ) is pulled forward and cut off .
Circumcision is usually performed without anesthesia a few days after birth - on the unproven assumption that babies will not remember the pain later , although they certainly cry out with pain at the time .
The practice of circumcision has been around for at least 4,000 years .
It is traditionally practiced by Jews and Moslems .
But around 100 years ago , became a more widely accepted practice in this country for all infant boys , due to a new emphasis on cleanliness .
In fact , when circumcision came into vogue , it was believed to cure all manner of ailments in boys .
Today , of course , we know that this is not the case , but the practice has continued .
Approximately half of all male babies born in this country are still being circumcised .
But doctors are questioning whether or not routine circumcision < is , given the pain the baby experiences , the risks involved in performing the procedure , and the questions being raised about whether circumcision < actually prevents disease .
What I recommended to parents about circumcision < in early editions of Baby and Child Care is quite different from what I recommend now .
In the 1940s , I favored circumcision < performed within a few days of birth for a couple of reasons .
First , there was , at the time , a commonly held belief in medical circles that women married to uncircumcised men were more likely to develop cancer of the cervix .
The second reason I favored routine was that if the operation were performed on a newborn , there would be no chance of a physician scaring the bejeebers out of a boy by performing the operation when he was older .
I personally had known of several instances in which an uncircumcised boy had been brought into the family doctor because he had been holding onto his penis , which bothered the parents .
The physician would then suggest that the area under the foreskin had perhaps become mildly infected , causing an irritation of the penis , and that the best treatment would be to cut off the foreskin , which was believed to be harboring the infection .
But the psychological trauma of circumcising an older child cannot be overestimated .
Boys , especially between the ages of two and four , tend to become quite anxious about the safety of their penises : is at this time that they usually become aware that little girls do n't have a penis , and boys tend to assume that girls somehow lost theirs in an accident , or that it has been cut off .
And so , when an older boy is circumcised , even though the body of the penis remains , the circumcision suggests to the child that an attempt has been made to cut his penis off and , in fact , the attempt has been partially successful .
It is understandable , then , that a young boy would become deeply upset by the operation .
In the 1940s and 1950s circumcision became quite common .
By the 1960s , 90 percent of all male newborns in the United States were being circumcised as routine procedure .
Ten years later , however , opinion among doctors swung away from the belief that certain groups of women developed cancer of the cervix because their husbands were uncircumcised .
It was concluded that the cause was actually lack of good male hygiene - which is not as much of a problem in this country as it is in some other parts of the world .
Also , by the early 1970s , more physicians - though not all - were aware of the psychological harm that could come from after infancy , and of an older child was suggested as frequently as in the past .
In 1971 a task force of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that there is no medical reason to recommend routine , and I voiced the same opinion in the 1976 revision of Baby and Child Care .
I hoped that the controversy would then be settled once and for all .
But today , there are again some physicians who favor routine because they are of the opinion ( not substantiated by solid scientific proof ) that will decrease , at least to a small degree , the risk of contracting various venereal diseases in adulthood .
But many physicians , myself included , are unconvinced .
One recent study did indicate that urinary tract infections in infancy , which is an uncommon disease in boys , does occur less frequently among circumcised boys , but this has yet been confirmed by further studies .
There is no doubt in medical circles that routine circumcision does prevent cancer of the penis , but this is a very rare disease which causes only approximately 150 deaths a year in the United States .
Should one million baby boys be circumcised each year because of this small risk ?
Each parent must answer that question for him or herself .
In view of the renewed controversy regarding , the American Academy of Pediatrics has again appointed a task force to reconsider its position on routine circumcision , although no final decision has yet been reached .
Though the debate continues within the medical community , parents do have a few facts and various opinions on which to base their own decision on this matter .
In earlier days many parents were not informed about what the issues were .
The attending obstetrician or an intern or resident would appear at the mother 's bedside a few days after delivery and say , ``Do you want the boy circumcised ? '' or ` `I suppose you want him to be circumcised , '' as if it were the only sensible choice .
We now know that it is not the only choice , nor is it agreed that It is the most sensible choice .
My own preference , if I had the good fortune to have another son , would be to leave his little penis alone .
Dr. Spock , a contributing editor of Redbook , is the author of Baby and Child Care , which has sold more than 40 million copies .
Postscript - Dr. Benjamin Spock , the most famous pediatrician in the world , passed away in 1998 at the age of 94 .

President Obama used his radio address to continue to push for passage of his economic stimulus package , and also said that the American people will not excuse the arrogance and greed of those who took bailout money and paid themselves big bonuses .
Here is the video :

Obama had some harsh words for those who federal money , but paid themselves big bonuses , “ And adding to this outrage , we learned this week that even as they petitioned for taxpayer assistance , Wall Street firms shamefully paid out nearly $ 20 billion in bonuses for 2008 .
While I ’m committed to doing what it takes to maintain the flow of credit , the American people will not excuse or tolerate such arrogance and greed .
The road to recovery demands that we all act responsibly , from Main Street to Washington to Wall Street . ”
What the bonus story confirms is that Wall St. did n’t deserve a bailout .
It is outrageous that the same people who ran their companies into the ground , and came hat in hand to the government , showed such little respect to the American people .
While thousands are still losing their jobs and homes , these clowns are paying themselves big bonuses .
It is wrong and irresponsible , and the government should either pull their funding , or ask for our money back .
The flip side of the coin is that this kind of thing will happen when a piece of legislation is rushed through the Congress .
There was a lot of talk during the initial debate last fall about protecting the American taxpayer , but Congress neglected to provide the most common sense protections to prevent taxpayer money from being spent on this like jets , office remodeling , and bonuses .
Obama inherited a fine mess , and some may criticism him for trying to shame these crooks , I think he ought to turn up the heat even higher .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Preliminary water tests from rivers near a huge coal ash spill in Tennessee show elevated levels of pollutants such as mercury and lead , a environmental group said on Friday .
“ We ’re concerned that the water poses a greater risk to residents in the area than has been revealed so far , ” said Matt Wasson , a program director at Appalachian Voices , a environmental group that coordinated the testing of the water with scientists from Appalachian State University .
An earthen dike collapsed on December 22 at the Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Kingston coal - fired power plant , spilling coal ash across as much as 400 acres .
The ash , left from decades of coal burning , had been stored in a sludge pond .
The spill extended into a waterway , blocked a road , and ruined three homes , according to the TVA .
Fly ash , a byproduct of burning coal , is known to contain small amounts of heavy metals and other pollutants dangerous to human health .
In 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided that the ash would not be managed as a hazardous waste .
The environmental group ’s tests , which took place on December 27 , showed higher levels of the pollutants of arsenic , mercury and lead than reported by the TVA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Arsenic levels from the Kingston power plant canal , for example , tested at nearly 300 times the allowable limits in drinking water .
A sample from two miles downstream revealed arsenic at about 30 times the limit .
“ Although these results are preliminary , we want to release them because of the public health concern and because we believe the TVA and EPA are n’t being candid , ” Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , chair of the Waterkeeper Alliance , said in a release .
Wasson said the TVA and EPA have not revealed exactly where tests they reported took place and that some of them took place upstream from the spill , where heavy contamination would not be expected .
The TVA , which is spraying the spilled ash with straw and seed to minimize dust and erosion , has said on its
Web site that preliminary testing at the Kingston water treatment plant has shown levels of metals that are below limits for drinking water .
Other tests on rivers near the site showed safe levels , it said .
Appalachian Voices said it has not completed tests on drinking water yet , in part because it takes time for contaminants in surface water to filter down into ground water supplies .
Wasson said hunters and fishermen could also be at long - term risk from consuming fish and birds from near the spill .
Pollutants can accumulate in fish and birds that eat smaller animals living among contaminants to the point where they are dangerous to eat .
The EPA and TVA did not immediately return phone calls about whether they would release more details about tests .
Tisha Calabrese - Benton , a spokeswoman from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation , said the state agency would soon release results of tests of private water wells in the area .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered the new Legislature in to work on its first day , declaring a fiscal emergency Monday in response to the state ’s deteriorating finances and urging lawmakers to “ get off of their rigid ideologies . ”
But even as Schwarzenegger warned that California could run out of cash within two months , there was little indication that the Capitol ’s partisan gridlock has waned enough to allow for an easy resolution to the state ’s $ 28 - billion budget gap .
Republican lawmakers , who last week blocked a Democratic proposal to cut billions of dollars from schools , healthcare and welfare programs while tripling the vehicle license fee , quickly reiterated their opposition to any new taxes , which both Schwarzenegger and Democrats say are indispensable .
Democratic legislators again dismissed some of Schwarzenegger ’s proposals to ease labor rules on business in order to boost the economy .
“ Now , I compare the situation that we are in right now to finding an accident victim on the side of the road that is bleeding to death , ” Schwarzenegger said at a news conference at his Los Angeles office .
“ We would n’t spend hours debating over which ambulance we should use , or which hospital we would use , or which treatment the patient needs .
No , we would first stop the bleeding , and that ’s exactly the same thing we have to do here . ”

Schwarzenegger said immediate action is essential because although the state projects a $ 28 - billion deficit by mid-2010 , California is on track to run out of cash by February or March .
He said that if lawmakers fail to act within 45 days as required under his declaration of a fiscal emergency , they will have to find an additional $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion in savings or new revenue above what is needed right now .
He said the administration is already drawing up plans to lay off state workers .
“ It ’s like an avalanche , that it gains momentum , ” he said .
The November elections changed little in the partisan standoff .
Democrats picked up three seats in the 80 - member Assembly , bringing their majority to 51 , still three short of the two - thirds needed to pass fiscal measures .
No seats changed hands in the 40 - member Senate , where there are only 24 sitting Democrats because Mark Ridley - Thomas was elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors , leaving a vacancy .
That means Senate Democrats will now have to win over three Republicans -- one more than before -- to pass a budget .

Of the 120 legislators , 28 are new and several have served in the Legislature before .
Assembly Republican leader Michael Villines ( R - Clovis ) rebutted Schwarzenegger ’s criticism that lawmakers are too rigid , saying in a statement that his party ’s anti-tax stance “ is not blind ideology on the part of Republicans , but our sincere belief that higher taxes will hurt the economy and lead to more uncontrolled spending . ”
Darrell Steinberg , the new Senate president pro tem , challenged the governor ’s insistence that tax increases be coupled with economic stimulus measures .
“ Economic stimulus wo n’t matter if we do n’t make the necessary cuts and raise sufficient revenue to give bond - holders the confidence that California ’s credit is good , ” said Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .

Both Steinberg and Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) dismissed Schwarzenegger ’s proposals to help businesses by giving employers more leeway in setting workers ’ hours and lunch breaks .
“ I am open to some of what he is proposing , but what I have major problems about is dismantling labor laws , dismantling environmental laws , ” Bass said .
She also indicated that the onus was on Schwarzenegger to negotiate a solution that Republicans could sign on to , saying that “ one way that it would be very helpful for him to participate would be in getting to know the members of his party and persuading members of his party to vote on the budget . ”
For his part , Schwarzenegger implied that legislators were resisting his compromises not out of political courage but from fear .
He told reporters that in his attempts to end the impasse , “ I even proposed to them that they should pass a law to give me all the power for one hour , I ’d make all the decisions so that they do n’t have to be blamed for anything . ”

Lawmakers turned him down , he said .
Schwarzenegger had to declare the fiscal emergency in Los Angeles instead of in Sacramento as planned because the fog in the capital was too dense to allow planes to land .
He quickly departed for Philadelphia , where most of the governors will meet today with President - elect Obama .
In a tacit rebuke to Democrats such as Bass who have emphasized seeking federal aid to help the state out of its financial plight , Schwarzenegger told reporters :
“ The federal government should n’t give us a penny until we straighten out our mess and we can live within our means . ”

President - elect Barack Obama is still humble enough to do laundry -- ON HIS ABS !
Check out B.O. in Hawaii this weekend .
Somehow , the folks over at Bauer Griffin got the pic , despite the 1,400 motorcycles blocking the view .
“ The available credit for undergraduates is capped at $ 2,500 , ” said Betty Riess , a spokeswoman for Bank of America .
“ We want to take a fair and responsible approach to lending because we want to build the foundation for a longer - term banking relationship . ”
Ms. Riess said the bank had agreements with about 700 colleges and alumni associations , making it one of the biggest , if not the biggest , card issuer on campuses .
She said that only 2 percent of the open accounts under those agreements belonged to students , but also said it was not possible to determine what percentage of program revenue resulted from fees and charges on those student cards .
Stephanie Jacobson , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase , wrote in an e-mail message that the bank had fewer than 25 contracts with colleges or alumni associations and that while some of the contracts gave it the right to ask for and use lists of student names and addresses , the bank had not done so since 2007 .
That may be because football games present a marketing opportunity that requires no address information .
Abigail D. Molina , a second - year law student at the University of Oregon , applied in 2007 for a Chase Visa offered at a tent outside a football game .
In exchange , she received a blanket .
“ I mostly wanted the blanket , ” Ms. Molina said .
She added that this was her second university credit card .
In 1994 , when she was an undergraduate at the university , she applied for a card at a booth on campus and then accumulated about $ 30,000 in debt , almost all of it on the card .
In 2001 she filed for bankruptcy .
Looking back , she said it was “ shockingly easy ” to get the card , even as a first - year student .
Mr. Muneio , the Michigan State student , said he did not apply for a Bank of America card because he already had two Visa cards .
“ The last thing I need is another account to keep track of . ”
Many students are unaware of the contracts that universities have with credit card issuers and do not question the presence of marketers on campus or applications in their mailboxes , despite recent protests on a few campuses .
Hello , again !
This job search post will be formatted slightly differently than usual .
Instead of detailing my job search experience over the last few weeks , I will provide an extensive comparison between my old resume and my completed resume in order to point out where I was falling short and how I have corrected my mistakes .
This is the resume I was using about two months ago :
While this resume landed me a canvassing position at the Fund for Public Interest , it is full of errors .
Obvious immediate mistakes are that my objective section has a major grammatical error ( I forgot the word “ position ” and therefore did not even make a complete sentence ) , the spacing gives it a slightly cluttered feel , and I misspelled the word “ finished ” in my work experience section .
I worked on those errors before showing it to Wendy , my career counselor from Evergreen , and then continued to email it back and forth with her until it reached near perfection .
Before making a final revision for me , she gave me some tips :
Put my education on the top , and detail some academic projects I ’ve taken part in .
My job experience ( mostly in kitchens ) is not very relevant to my career goals , but my academic achievements are key .
Include computer skills , leadership accomplishments , and any other relevant information , keeping in mind that non-profits are looking for some different skill sets than other types of companies .
Use direct , concise language as opposed to weak or filler words .
Here is my current resume :
I made the following improvements :
Heading : I condensed the heading down to four lines to make room for more important information .
I got a more professional email address that uses a variation of my name instead of my screen name from high school .
Objective : I removed the objective .
There is some debate as to whether it is advantageous to include this section or not .
I chose not to because the jobs I am seeking out tend to ask for a cover letter , which is a better space for me to include my objective .
Also , removing my objective allowed me to make room for more important information about my academic career .
Education : I moved my education to the top of the resume and removed my high school information .
I added three academic projects that I wasinvolved with that relate directly to my field .
Leadership : Instead of listing vague qualifications , I created a section for leadership skills including my volunteer initiatives , my leadership awards and my abilities learned from my work experience .
Work Experience : I added my current job and made my work experience a little more concise .
I trimmed out unnecessary information - especially from my earlier jobs , which have little to do with my desired career path .
I replaced weak words with words from the list of action verbs from Evergreen ’s website .
Computer Skills : I added a brief section to inform potential employers about my basic computer capabilities and my position writing for this website .
References : I said the same amount of information about references with one line instead of three .
I trust that these tips will come in handy to many people in my situation , whether they are looking for a job in the public or private sector .
While much of this advice is fairly basic , every little tip adds up .
At first glance , my new resume does not appear much different , but a second look shows it to be easier to read , full of much more useful information , and a powerful yet concise summary of who I am and what I can offer a non-profit .
Next entry will return to the usual format , and I will provide updates about my job search , which is now being conducted from Los Angeles .
Review of Pro Django by Marty Alchin ( 1/2 ) ¶
5 second review : Reading this book will make you a much better Django Programmer .
In full disclosure , I was sent a review copy of this book by the publisher , but I had already pre-ordered it on Amazon , and the copy I am reviewing is that copy .
The review copy is now the office copy :)
I will do an overview , and then a specific breakdown of what I thought after reading each chapter .
This is currently only the first half of the book , but the book is already worth it ’s price ( perhaps in gold ) .
This covers chapters 1 - 6 , which is basically the normal URLs / Models / Views / Templates stuff .
The later sections appear to cover more specialized and advanced use cases .
You can download the table of contents also .
Also note , that you can see my further reviews and some other peoples over on Readernaut
Overview ¶ Pro Django is certainly not for the beginner .
It assumes a pretty decent amount of Django experience ( or at least the ability to learn / reference it easily ) .
I think that this is a good thing , because it does n’t get bogged down in silly details and explanations when what we want is upper level content .
If you have been doing Django stuff for a couple months , I think this book is amazingly good at pushing you to the next level of knowledge in the field .
I certainly recommend reading James Bennett ’s Practical Django Projects ( once version 2 gets released ) before this one , as it is an easier introduction .
These two books together provide an amazing 1 - 2 knockup punch to getting you to be a great Django developer .
Now onto the review .
Chapter 1 : Understanding Django¶
This chapter goes over the basics of Django and the philosophy that it has .
It is a great introduction into how to be a good member of the Django community .
It is available for free on the Apress website , and I recommend reading it , because I felt inspired by the prologue , and I think that Marty explains the value of the community around Django very well .
Links from the books pages are provided as links from prodjango.com , which is nice at first , but the obfuscation of the URLs is a pain later in the book .
It is used as a way to hide information ( “ The django irc channel ” , with a link ) instead of #django in irc.freenode.net .
Also , I have read some of the URLs linked to , but knowing where they go helps me decide if i need to read them .
Chapter 2 : Django is Python¶
With one of the best descriptions that I have read of metaclassing in python , this chapter starts off guns a - blazing .
It tries to show some of the more advanced Python features that Django uses , and stresses that Django is merely Python .
I loved the explanation of the gentlemen ’s agreement on interfaces , including file - like objects .
The explanation of metaclassing is finished up with a great example of implementing a plugin system for a password validator .
The code ends up being around 40 - 50 lines , flowing through my brain like a river , and beautiful .
It was also explained in a way that allowed me to see the abstract value of the ideas , and not simply how it is useful in this specific implementation .
It also includes a really heady implementation of decorators that blew my mind a little bit .
With my current intermediate level of python knowledge , it provided a reference for things that I mostly knew , and went into depth in the parts that were in need of it .
A great start to the book .
As of page 45 , my brain is already going full throttle and I ’m looking forward to what this book has in store .
Chapter 3 : Models ¶ I found this chapter to be a little less amazing than the previous , but still solid .
It did n’t quite flow as well for me , and I had to think about things a lot more .
I did n’t have a great understanding of how all of the subject matter fit together .
This might just be the fact that I ’m not as acquainted with the topics .
It has a cool example of creating a field that stores pickled data and returns it as a normal object .
As the chapter progressed the value of the explanations earlier in the chapter start to gel a bit , but not totally .
I think that this is one that re-reading , at least for me , will be really valuable after I ’m finished .
It provided a great reference to all of the different fields , and why we should care about them .
I really like the continuing theme of “ this is a brief explanation of what X is , and this is an in depth explanation of why you should care ”
Chapter 4 : Urls and Views ¶
This chapter does a good job of showing how URLs and Views are inextricably linked .
Your URLConf basically just hands off data to views , and it goes over all the interesting things that you can do in this space .
It flowed well , was just the right length , and left me really appreciating the value of decorators around views .
The concept of using a decorator on the view function in the URLConf , instead of around the view definition , is novel .
The ability to manipulate the arguments to the view in the URLConf file , returning objects instead of strings to the views is very powerful .
Using decorators to abstract boilerplate is a really powerful pattern .
The explanation of views and making them more generic was good , but I already knew it from Practical Django Projects .
This obviously lead into generic views .
He also discussed using a Class as a view ( and the downside of trying to reverse ( ) it ) , but it was lacking a discussion of Class - based Generic Views which I thought was coming .
This is going to be implemented by 1.2 , so it might have been a good time to at least mention it .
Chapter 5 : Forms ¶
This chapter is not as interesting to me , because I do n’t plan to be doing a lot of work on front end forms .
However , there is still a great explanation of the way that forms work on the backend ( almost exactly like models ) .
The harsh warning about verifying user input is good , because user input is indeed evil .
In example at the end of the chapter , Marty goes through how to create a form that can be saved and restored , no matter what the contents .
It ends up being implemented in a decorator , which blew my mind .
All you have is a view that handles a valid form , and a decorator gives you the ability to save and resume that same form , simply by posting an md5hash to it .
Pretty Crazy .
It also goes into Widgets and how to create your own to display forms .
There is a bit of a lack of how to include Javascript and CSS inline in your forms , but talks about how to embed custom attributes .
Also , there is no mention of creating forms from Models !
I feel that this is probably one of the most common operations I do with forms .
This might have been excluded because it is already well known and un-interesting .
Microsoft Corp. is seriously exploring significant work force reductions that could be announced as early as next week , in a sign that the weak economy is prompting tough decisions even at one of the steadiest ships in the technology industry .
According to people familiar with its plans , the Redmond , Wash. , giant is considering layoffs across its various divisions , a rare occurrence for the world 's largest software company .
However , plans for the cutbacks are still in flux and Microsoft could end up finding alternative methods ...

The film follows Powell , a government employee who decides to cook her way through legendary cook Julia Child ’s classic cookbook , “ Mastering the Art of French Cooking ” in one year ’s time out of her small Queens kitchen .
Powell blogs her daily experiences , gaining a loyal following along the way .
By a margin of 26 - 3 , the Israeli Central Elections Committee decided to ban the Balad Party from running in next month ’s election .
By a margin of 21 - 8 , they also banned the United Arab List - Ta’al ( UAL - T ) .
The two bans will prevent more than half of the current Arab members of Israel ’s Parliament , the Knesset , from running for reelection .
The Arab parties earned the ire of the most hawkish elements in the Israeli government by publicly opposing the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip .
Balad likewise made enemies by explicitly calling for equal rights for all citizens of Israel , regardless of national or ethnic identity , which the ruling Kadima Party said would “ undermine Israel ’s identity as a Jewish state . ”
A handful of Arabs will remain on the ballots across Israel , running for as - yet - unbanned Jewish majority parties , but with the general consensus among most of the population that Israeli Arabs are traitors based purely on their ethnic background , they would seem to have an uphill battle .
Many disillusioned Arab voters may not vote at all , now that the only significant Arab parties are n’t allowed on the ballot .
During the discussion , Balad Chairman Jamal Zahaika called the move to ban his party “ a test for Israeli democracy ” and warned that the ban would lead to an outright Arab boycott of the election .
Zahaika also asked Avigdor Lieberman , the driving force behind the ban , “ Why are you afraid of democracy ? ” Lieberman declared Balad a terrorist organization and said “ whoever values life ” would understand the need to ban it .
HELENA , Mont . ( AP )  A Montana judge has ruled that doctor - assisted suicide is legal in the state , but the decision is likely to be appealed .
The judge , Dorothy McCarter , issued the ruling late Friday in the case of a Billings man with terminal cancer who had sued the state .
In her ruling , Judge McCarter wrote that “ the Montana constitutional rights of individual privacy and human dignity ” give a mentally competent person who is terminally ill the right to “ die with dignity . ”
The ruling said that those patients had the right to obtain self - administered medications to hasten death if they found their suffering to be unbearable , and that physicians could prescribe such medication without fear of prosecution .
A while back I read parts of Kevin Caron ’s Studies in Mutualist Political Economy .
A while back .
I was particularly interested in his commentary on the labor theory of value .
[ T ]he labor theory of value is based , not on an inductive generalization from the observed movement of prices , but on an a priori assumption about why price approximates cost , except to the extent to which some natural or artificial scarcity causes deviations from this relationship .
Like Carson , I believe there is a case to be made for an a priori assumption about why price approximates cost , but the conclusion I reach is quite different .
The “ natural ” scarcity is embodied in the supply / demand diagram .
Prices will approximate costs ( in a free market ) , all else being equal , because competition makes it so .
FSK explains this pretty clearly in The Free Market Labor Arbitrage Process
If labor is underpaid ( relative to its fair value ) , then workers will form competing businesses , arbitraging away the difference .
If labor is overpaid ( relative to its fair value ) , then new workers will enter the industry , again arbitraging away the difference .
In a free market , the costs do not determine the prices , but rather the expectations of prices determine which costs will ( or will not ) be incurred .
To the extent that the entrepreneur is in error , costs will exceed prices .
Of course , the costs of production in a free market approach or equal the opportunity cost for the respective productive resources , which are also intimately and inextricably linked to the perceived value to be thereby provided .
Is it true that price ( i.e. , value of the final good ) approximates cost of production ?
In the long run , yes this is true .
But a theory of value needs to speak to more than just long - run trends , does it not ?
Ultimately , value is determined subjectively and with some uncertainty ; it is not determined by the costs of production .
Rather , the costs of production are determined by the anticipated value of the output .
I cannot resist the temptation to bring up the ditch - diggers or make - work programs .
These things are costly ; expensive .
But as Bastiat noted over a century ago , they are not valuable .
Lest I be accused of setting up straw men , these examples are only fallacious in the sense that such unproductive dispositions of labor and resources are unlikely to occur , and even less likely to persist , in a truly free market .
But the fact remains : it does n’t matter how hard or how long a man works towards a project which others do not value .
One objection might be that the labor costs are determined by labor ’s opportunity costs , and so in a free market the labor - theory still holds .
But the opportunity costs are also appraisals of the potential future values of whatever else may be produced by labor , and these values are no more certain than the anticipated value of what labor in - fact chooses to produce .
No matter which course of action taken by labor , unless the final product is subjectively deemed “ valuable ” on the market , it ’s price will not be sufficient to cover the perceived disutility or discomfort of labor “ costs ” incurred during its production .
We know or assume to know what value will be produced by a certain amount of labor , and this knowledge guides economic actors in their determination of the prices to be paid for such productive resources .
So what we can conclude is that value is the independent variable in the equation , by which final prices are ultimately determined .
Carson continues ,
Or to approach it from the opposite direction , we can start with the law of cost as the basis of price , and from there systematically eliminate all the subordinate factors that only have a price because of artificial scarcity , leaving only labor as a creator of exchange - value in its own right ( at least for the equilibrium prices of goods in elastic supply ) .
Although price and cost should tend towards convergence in a truly free market , the important distinction , though , is that labor simply does n’t “ create ” or imbue a product with “ value ” .
Demand , utility , desire , the ability to fulfill needs or satisfy discomfort , these abstract notions are what acting man finds valuable .
However true it is that labor is the ultimate “ creator of exchange - value in its own right , ” but although labor certainly assists in the creation of all things valuable , value ( at the terminus ) is not determined by the past labor embodied during the production process .
+++
For further reading on the topic , I suggest Bob Murphy ’s The Labor Theory of Value : A Critique of Carson ’s Studies in Mutualist Political Economy .
Murphy restates “ the case for the superiority of the marginal , subjective theory versus the labor ( or more generally , cost ) theory of value ” Murphy concludes that “ everything true of the cost ( labor ) theory can be incorporated in the subjective theory of value ” .
I do n’t normally do product or services reviews because truthfully I stink at them but when I got passed the release from Shout ’em I thought it was be interesting enough to take a look at and share my thoughts on it .
What is Shout ’em ?
The simplest explanation would be – take a heaping helping of Twitter and mix with a dash of Ning – mix together and voila – Shout ’em .
With Shout ’em you can create your own private microblogging universe ; or as many as you like .
Members can customize their networks as far as the look as well as how it functions .
There are options to allow file sharing and photo sharing among others .
As well you can select whether you want any of your created networks to be private or public .
Setting up your Shout ’Em microblogs
The process of setting up a microblogging network on Shout ’em is actually quite simple and painless .
It is a three step process but you can fine tune the settings for individual networks later on from within each network .
The first step of course is the standard naming one where you enter in the name for you new Shout ’
Em microblogging network along with a tagline for it .
The next step is the start of the personalization of your new network where you can select the theme ; or ‘ skin ’ as Shout ’em calls the available styles .
There are quite a number of really nice looking ones which is nice to see .
Usually this type of option when made available is pretty limited in the beginning but Shout ’em has made sure you have a nice selection of themes to choose from on day one .
The third step is where you can select the features you want available on your network .
This includes whether or not this is a public or private network .
As well you can add features that not even Twitter has yet , such as file sharing .
I will admit this is one area of the service that I think could be a real advantage even though I can also see ways in which it could be misused .
Once you ’ve finished with the third setup page you are launched into your new microblog where you can sign in and finished setting up things like your profile and make any changes to the overall settings for your microblog .
Thoughts on Shout ’Em
To be honest I ’m not sure on the long term viability of services like Shout ’Em .
Sure it ’s neat to be able to setup your own Twitter - like universe but really for what reason .
I can however see how such a services could be really useful for in - house project teams or for corporate use in general .
With the ability to make the microblog private as well as having file and photo sharing Shout ’
Em could find a nice niche market in the business world .
As for the general surfing public – well I ’m not so sure about that .
The official launch of Shout ’ Em will be at this year ’s LeWeb in France so until then I believe setting up new microblogging networks on Shout ’ Em is by invitation only .
If you want to give it a try for your self head on over to the Shout ’em and use the invite code of doneright
In the meantime you can check out the Inquisitr microblog I set up ( http://inquisitr.shoutem.com) – I ’ll make sure to hang out there for a while .
Not to sound like a broken record , but the state of the mitochondria inside your cells is very important .
The level of damaged suffered by these mitochondria is a determinant of your future health and longevity because of the further damaging processes set in motion by faulty mitochondria .
Furthermore , we can point to some known ways to extend longevity - such as calorie restriction - and show that they cause changes in biochemical processes that act to eliminate damaged mitochondria before they cause significant harm or prevent that damage from occuring in the first place .
As this recent abstract points out for one small facet of aging :
The mechanisms by which caloric restriction preserves skeletal muscle health with aging continue to be explored ; however , mounting evidence points toward a convergence of effects at the level of the mitochondrion .
Specifically , caloric restriction reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and promotes mitochondrial renewal via enhanced drive on mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy .
The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging describes in detail how it is proposed that increasing numbers of damaged mitochondria lead to the slow breakdown of systems within the body .
A crucial point here is that each of your cells contains thousands of mitochondria , a population constantly in flux with members being broken down when damaged and replaced through binary fission of remaining mitochondria , dividing in two like bacteria .
Mitochondria have their own internal DNA , separate from nuclear DNA in your cells , and when that mitochondrial DNA gets damaged then every future generation of mitochondria carry the damage with them .
The core of the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging is an explanation as to how certain forms of mitochondrial DNA damage , such as large deletions , can subvert the normal processes that check for damaged mitochondria to recycle .
These damaged mitochondria will be recycled more slowly than their pristine counterparts and will thus soon replicate unchecked to take over the entire mitochondrial population of a cell .
Things start to go downhill for that cell and all other nearby cells soon thereafter as the mechanisms of metabolism run awry .
Here is a paper providing solid evidence for that concept :
Age - dependent accumulation of partially - deleted mitochondrial DNA ( DeltamtDNA ) has been suggested to contribute to aging and the development of age - associated diseases including Parkinson 's disease .
However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and accumulation of DeltamtDNA have not been addressed in vivo .
In this study [ we ] obtained in vivo evidence that DeltamtDNAs with larger deletions accumulate faster than those with smaller deletions , implying a replicative advantage of smaller mtDNAs .
These findings identify DSB , DNA repair systems and replicative advantage as likely mechanisms underlying the generation and age - associated accumulation of DeltamtDNA .
More damage means more replication of damaged mitochondria .
This is n't all idle research , of course : having identified damage to mitochondrial DNA as a significant contributer to degenerative aging , there are a wealth of potential ways to reverse or eliminate it through medical science , some already demonstrated in laboratory animals .
Look back in the Fight Aging !

Parents sometimes tell lies about their children as occasional drivers A growing number of people are lying on insurance applications in an attempt to get a better deal , according to the Association of British Insurers ( ABI ) .
Those involved in the fraud are risking their deals being invalidated , as well as putting up the cost of premiums to others , the ABI said .
Common deceptions include failing to disclose a youngster as a main driver or hiding motoring convictions .
Yet the industry admits that " very few " culprits are convicted .
Warning
The ABI said a growing number of its members were uncovering cases of " fronting " to get cheaper insurance .
This is when parents add a son or daughter to their motor insurance policy as an occasional driver when the youngster is , in fact , the main driver .
Other issues that could put policies at risk , according to the ABI , are people failing to disclose previous claims or not being honest about how much they smoke or drink on life insurance applications .
" Honesty is the only policy .
Cheating to get cheaper insurance puts your cover in jeopardy , with potentially disastrous consequences , " said Nick Starling , of the ABI .
" Being truthful and shopping around will mean that your insurance delivers when you need it , and that you get the best possible deal . "
He said the vast majority of applicants were honest , but those who lied caused average premiums to be £ 30 a year more expensive than they needed to be .

When it comes to people committing crimes , most fugitives try to do it in a way so that police and law enforcement officials wo n’t be able to find them .
While some succeed , most do not , simply because as humans we make mistakes , and others will eventually pick up on those mistakes .
In the world of crime , those who are caught are sentenced and usually spend time in jail or some other place that ’d make the common person freak .
However , those who have not been caught , well … let ’s just say they ’re either lucky , smart , or just really good at hiding and escaping from the police .
Or , they have some sort of high connection to those in elite places in society .
Though government agencies pledge to one day catch these men , it has already proven to be much harder than anyone would have thought .
Here are the top 10 fugitives that were never caught .
10 . Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov
Tokhtakhounov is part of a Russian mob group .
Though born and raised in Uzbekistan , he looks very Asian , which is where he gets the name “ Taiwanchik . ”
The US government sees Tokhtakhounov as a huge figure in international Eurasian organized crime .
He is known to have taken part in stealing vehicles , trafficking , selling arms illegally , and distributing guns .
He is also wanted for possibly fixing events ranging from beauty pageants to Olympic events .
In 2002 he was captured in Italy , but he was eventually freed and has not been found since .
He is said to possibly be in Russia .
9. Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar
Kaskar is India ’s most wanted man .
He is a leader of D - Company , which is a group of organized crime that bases itself out of Mumbai .
He is known to oversee a criminal empire that takes part in counterfeiting , weapon smuggling , murder , and drug trafficking .
Even though his father is a policeman , this has failed to slow him down .
Kaskar is mostly wanted for his association with the Bombay Blasts in 1993 that killed 257 and wounded 713 .
He is also wanted for his possible ties with Al Qaeda .
Today he stands as a “ global terrorist . ”
He has been able to successfully avoid having his assets frozen .
Kaskar is said to be in Yemen , India , or Pakistan .
8. Matteo Messina Denaro
Denaro over the years has proven to be the world ’s most famous organized crime leader .
He is a big part and organizer of the Italian mafia .
He is known as “ Diabolic ” and is often showing off his money in any way he can .
From expensive cars , to women , to large homes , to jewelry , Denaro has it all .
However , most of the money he has has been obtained illegally : through the use of drug sales and even murder .
Today , Denaro is said to be climbing the hierarchy ladder within the Italian mafia .
Denaro is wanted for his role in the 1993 Cosa Nostra campaign which involved bomb attacks .
This was put in place to attempt to slow the government ’s move on the mafia .
7. Joseph Kony
Kony is the leader of the Lord ’s Resistance Army .
This guerilla group of men has spent years attempting to create and run a theocratic government in Uganda .
However , their plan involves using brutal means to begin this government .
Under the rule of Kony , the LRA has abducted many children as well as displaced at least 2 million people .
This group has the largest child abduction rate worldwide .
Alone , he has been able to direct and control the abduction of 60,000 people , half of them being children .
Most of those abducted were forced to fight for his campaign and beliefs .
He sometimes even forces children to kill their own parents as initiation .
Kony is wanted for war crimes as well as crimes against humanity .
6. Omid Tahvili
Tahvili has been the kingpin of a Persian crime family that works throughout Canada .
His group is connected to the Triads as well as many other groups set up to commit crime .
He is better known as Nino .
Though he was once in jail in British Columbia , he bribed a guard with $ 50,000 in order to release him .
Tahvili is wanted for torture , drug trafficking , theft , and for a fraudulent telemarketing business that scammed Americans out of at least $ 3 million .
Today , Tahvili is still at large .
He is said to have connections throughout the Middle East as well as Europe .
5. Joaquin Guzman
Guzman is the leader of an international drug trafficking organization known as the Sinaloa Cartel .
He has become Mexico ’s top drug kingpin .
Since the 80s , Guzman has been associating himself with drug trafficking .
In 1993 , Guzman was plotted against to be assassinated ; however , the plot failed .
As a result of this , Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo , a Roman Catholic cardinal was killed by Guzman or someone in his drug ring .
Though he was captured in 1993 in Guatemala , he escaped and has n’t been found since .
There is a $ 5,000,000 reward in the US for information leading to his arrest .
4. James J. Bulger
Bulger has been a wanted man since the 1970s .
He has committed several murders , or taken part in helping kill many people during the 70s and 80s .
He is known to be part of an organized crime group that deals with drug deals , extortion , and sometimes killings .
This group focuses its time in places around or near Boston , Massachusetts .
Bulger is known to have used 12 different aliases .
The FBI is offering a $ 2,000,000 reward for information leading directly to his arrest .
3. Aribert Heim
Better known as Dr. Death , Aribert Heim took part as a SS officer .
Though he is 94 years old , he is still wanted .
He is one of the last few major Nazi fugitives that are still at large .
He left Germany in 1962 and has since never been found .
He is accused of killing and torturing inmates that were held at the Mauthausen concentration camp .
He tortured and eventually killed these people by injecting toxic chemicals into the victims ’ hearts and then performing surgery without any type of anesthetic .
He is most wanted by the Austrian government for a $ 495,000 reward .
2. Chief Ratko Mladic
Mladic was a Bosnian Serb leader that led Karadzic ’s army .
He is a well - known key figure that took part in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims as well as Croats .
The UN International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted Mladic in 1995 ; however he has yet to be captured .
He is wanted for genocide , crimes against humanity , and numerous war crimes as well as taking of hostages amongst UN peace - keeping personnel .
1. Osama Bin Laden Killed
Surely you have heard of this man .
If you have n’t , get out from under your rock !
In any case , Bin Laden is wanted by the FBI and has been for more than a decade .
He is the main leader of Al - Qaeda and has been on the run since 1998 , when he was connected to the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in many different nations .

Grapes contain potentially beneficial chemicals
An extract from grape seeds can destroy cancer cells , US research suggests .
In lab experiments , scientists found that the extract stimulated leukaemia cells to commit suicide .
Within 24 hours , 76 % of leukaemia cells exposed to the extract were killed off , while healthy cells were unharmed , Clinical Cancer Research reports .
The study raises the possibility of new cancer treatments , but scientists said it was too early to recommend that people eat grapes to ward off cancer .
What everyone seeks is an agent that has an effect on cancer cells but leaves normal cells alone , and this shows that grapeseed extract fits into this category
Professor Xianglin Shi
University of Kentucky Grape seeds contain a number of antioxidants , including resveratrol , which is known to have anti-cancer properties , as well as positive effect on the heart .
Previous research has shown grapeseed extract has an effect on skin , breast , bowel , lung , stomach and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory .
It can also reduce the size of breast tumours in rats and skin tumours in mice .
However , the University of Kentucky study is the first to test its impact on a blood cancer .
Lead researcher Professor Xianglin
Shi said : " These results could have implications for the incorporation of agents such as grapeseed extract into prevention or treatment of haematological ( blood ) malignancies and possibly other cancers .
" What everyone seeks is an agent that has an effect on cancer cells but leaves normal cells alone , and this shows that grapeseed extract fits into this category . "
The researchers exposed leukaemia cells to grape extract in a range of different doses .
Apoptosis
One of the higher doses produced a marked effect , causing large numbers of the cells to commit suicide in a process known as apoptosis .
This is a natural method of getting rid of damaged and potentially dangerous cells .
When the mechanism behind apoptosis breaks down , cancerous cells can survive and multiply .
The researchers found grapeseed extract activates a protein called JNK which helps to regulate apoptosis .
When they exposed the leukaemia cells to an agent that inhibits JNK , the grapeseed extract effect was cancelled out .
Silencing the gene that makes JNK also blocked the extract 's ability to kill cancer cells .
Kat Arney , Cancer Research UK 's senior cancer information officer , warned against jumping to firm conclusions .
She said : " This is yet another story highlighting the potential cancer - fighting properties of naturally - occurring chemicals .
" Although interesting , it 's still a long way from being a treatment that we can give to patients . "

Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was defeated in his bid for re-election on Tuesday .
Mr. Stevens , a Republican and a 40 - year incumbent , was trailing his Democratic challenger , Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage , by 3,724 votes out of more than 315,000 cast after state election officials on Tuesday counted about 25,000 absentee and other outstanding ballots .
Only an estimated 2,500 ballots remain to be counted next week , according to Gail Fenumiai , the state elections director .
“ I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States Senate , ” Mr. Begich said .
“ It ’s been an incredible journey getting to this point , and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day . ”
Mr. Stevens did not immediately concede the race .
Presuming the results are certified , the senator could request a recount , but he would have to pay for it .
According to designer Ivo Vos , the catapulting toaster is one of several products “ that address the desire for skill , struggle , rituals , perfection , preparation and anticipation – qualities lost when we indulge in the comforts of prozac technology . ”

I am not immune to the weak economy and I ’ve been working double - time on my more commercially driven websites .
Colleges , students , and even student loan companies have n’t been quite able to escape the consequences of a lockup in global financial and credit markets .
In fact , 180 students at George Washington University were just informed that their student loans had to be canceled mid-year .
The government has been scrambling to restore liquidity to these credit and capital markets , not just for banking and finance at large but specifically for student loan borrowers and lenders .
A recent press release from none other than Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Department of Education Secretary Margaret Spellings states that :
President George W. Bush signed H.R. 6889 , the extension of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act .
We appreciate Congress providing the Department of Education , in coordination with the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget , renewed temporary powers to use federal funds to ensure students and families continue to have access to student loans .
The loan purchase and participation interest programs implemented over the last few months have helped ensure that Federal student loans were available to students enrolling in postsecondary institutions for the 2008 - 2009 school year , and Federal student lending is exceeding last year ’s pace .
Our financing program has supported just over 40 percent of the Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ) loans that have been disbursed this year .
Over 800 lenders have enrolled in our loan purchase program .
Almost $ 51 billion of federally guaranteed loans have been originated for the current school year , up from approximately $ 45 billion for the same period last year .
This was released just a few weeks before National Education informed its customers at George Washington University that they ’d be losing access to future student loan funds .
So despite all the government - mandated taxpayer spending – despite all the debt that students are taking on to keep going to school , there ’s clearly no “ order ” and stability in the student loan market .
If you ’re looking for student loans , make sure to not only compare prices but also take a look at the reliability ratings you can find online .
Do n’t end up relying on a company that could just suddenly cut you off – this can lead to a huge mess in your transcripts and a hard time adapting back to the flow of degree completion .
Diversify your tuition paying income – even if that means finding a few smaller scholarships to apply for and taking on a part time job .
The less you rely on a single source , the better your chances of surviving the worst .
Be careful out there !

Crime The Bobbear.co.uk website , a not - for - profit project that lists details of phishing scams and other types of online attacks , has been out of action for the weekend .
The downtime comes after a previous attack on the site last week was blamed on cybercriminals based in Russia .
Bob Harrison , the man behind Bobbear.co.uk , told Web User : " We 're still looking into why the site has been down over the weekend - details are a little hazy at the moment . "
He said that the site was being " hit very hard " on Friday 21 November and that it appeared that another DDoS ( distributed denial of service ) attack had knocked the site out a little before 2100GMT .
Harrison told Web User that the company that hosts the site was looking into the causes of the problem and the Metropolitan Police were also monitoring the site .
Bobbear.co.uk had also suffered a DDoS attack the previous weekend , which had been traced back to a Russian domain .
The location of the source of the new attack has not yet been discovered .
Sophos ' Graham Cluley said that the fact that cybercriminals were targetting the site proved how effective it had been .
" The only consolation that Bobbear can take from this situation is that they must be having an impact on the fraudsters if they are prepared to go to such lengths to put the site out of operation , " he said .
UPDATE 1545GMT : The Bobbear .co.uk site is up and running again .

Season Wrap Up
Cincinnati had a dismal season once again , going 74 - 88 and finishing fifth in the National league Central .
After the hire of manager Dusty Baker in the off season , many believed the Reds would improve this year and while they received some good individual performances from some young talent , they were still disappointing in the standings .
Their general manager , Walt Jocketty was able to get rid of his overpaid talent when he traded both Ken Griffey Jr. and Adam Dunn during the middle of the season .
In return for their trades , it seems like the Reds made some smart moves and acquired some talent that looks promising and may even contribute as soon as next season .
While they are not famous for spending a lot of money , they did have a respectable $ 74.1 million invested last season which placed them 18th in the majors .
Holes to Fill
Like every other team this off season , the Reds will be looking to add some power to their line - up in various places .
While they were able to get rid of some aging , or overpaid talent , they were not able to pick up any proven power hitters to replace them .
Near the end of the season , it seemed like there was very little pop from a line - up that has been known for having no trouble tearing the cover off the ball at times .
They have needs at almost every position including left and center field , shortstop ( although it seems like Alex Gonzalez could win that spot if he can stay healthy ) , third base and catcher .
Obviously they would be happy with any power in any of these positions .
Their young starting rotation is no doubt the strength of their team , but they are extremely inexperienced .
Acquiring one , or even two , mid -level free agents to compliment what Baker already has in his rotation could only help their young guns learn the ropes in the majors .
Free Agents
The Reds free agents include right handed pitchers Mike Lincoln , Josh Fogg and David Weathers , left handed pitchers Kent Mercker and Jeremy Affeldt , outfielder Corey Patterson , catchers Paul Bako and Havier Valentine , as well as utility man Jerry Hairston Jr .
The majority of these players will probably leave via free agency , or in the case of Mercker , retire .
Although the team has expressed interest in attempting to re-sign some of the players and Hairston has headed this list .
Weathers is another name that the Reds seem content on keeping as long as the price fits what they are aiming for and it seems very likely that he could end up playing in south west Ohio again next season .
The Outlook
The Reds really need to improve across the board in all statistical categories and seemed to make moves during the season that would better them for the future .
While they have yet to land any player via free agency or trade thus far in the young off season , Jocketty is usually good at targeting the players he deems to be future performers at his price range and some how corralling them to Cincinnati .
While the play of Joey Votto at first was no doubt one of the highlights for the Reds this season , they have many holes to fill and while his stability is nice , Jocketty will be looking to build a line - up around him that can hopefully use his skill set to its fullest potential .
Starters Johnny Cueto and Edison Volquez started the season wet behind the ears , but were featured on national sports shows perhaps more than any other Red because of their sterling performances this season .
Even though these players preformed well for the team last year , the Reds are still a long way from competing ( especially in their division ) .
They may be able to climb up a spot , in their division ranking , but going any further than that would seem unlikely .
Off Season Moves Made so Far
The Reds have not made a single transaction this off season .
The last acquisition they made was on September 12 when they named pitcher Micah Owings the player to be named later in a deal they made earlier in the season with the Arizona Diamondbacks .
Pricing your products effectively is n’t just about assigning a set of numbers to items that you sell .
It ’s also about managing perceptions and understanding consumer psychology .
A common misconception is that customers shop primarily based on logical thinking .
Especially with the advent of the internet and instant price comparisons , you might think that most purchasing decisions are made based on numbers and hard data .
But in fact , the average customer is not only illogical but malleable as well .
Studies have shown that the perception of value presented to a customer can easily be massaged and enhanced with a variety of psychological techniques .
Here are a few examples of some of the ways you can enhance a customer ’s perception of value .

Make Your Customer Forget About The Percentages
Prices are rarely evaluated in absolute terms .
Instead , most people evaluate discounts based on the percentage savings off the overall retail price .
To illustrate this fact , let ’s say you are shopping at a store that sells a particular item for 20 dollars .
Would you drive to a different store 10 minutes away if that other store sold the same item for 5 dollars ?
My Asian blood would force me to do so : ) .
Now in a different example , let ’s say the item cost 10000 dollars .
Would you bother making the same trip if the item was 9985 dollars at the other store ?
The decision becomes a little more difficult .
You are saving 15 dollars in both cases , yet driving your car to a store 10 minutes away feels more worthwhile when you are saving 75 % than when you are saving a fraction of a percent .
This discrepancy manifests itself because our perceptions of value are heavily influenced by percentages .
Why is this important ?
It ’s valuable information because it tells you that you should n’t even bother offering a discount if it ’s going to be perceived as insignificant to the customer .
Instead of offering a small discount , give away an item for free instead or offer something else of value that is hard to quantify .
A good example of this is when you buy a new car .
Instead of giving you a couple of hundred bucks in discounts which you wo n’t perceive as very much , car dealers will make you feel better about your purchase by offering you free financing or free servicing of your car for a set period .
The discounts are most likely equivalent either way but seem more attractive because they are presented to you differently .
Appeal To Your Customer In A Good Light
A customer is likely to pay more for an item if they believe that they are purchasing the product from a company that is fundamentally perceived as good .
For example , if your store donates a portion of the proceeds to charity , a customer will be more inclined to shop with you even if you have slightly higher prices .
I ’m seeing a lot of companies go “ green ” these days .
Going “ green ” carries the connotation that a company really cares about the environment .
Call me a cynic , but I personally think that many companies are going “ green ” to extract higher prices from customers .
In any case , the gist of it is that if you can project an aura of compassion or good from your company , you will be able extract higher pricing .
This concept carries a very close analogy to establishing a good brand for your business .
Provide Different Reference Points
Ever notice why there ’s always a wide variety of products for sale that span an entire gamut of prices ?
It ’s because we as customers are always trying to establish what we consider a reasonable reference price for a particular product .
By skewing the prices of different styles of the same item , stores can heavily influence customers to purchase a more expensive product .
This is best illustrated with an example .
A study was conducted where 2 sets of customers were asked to select between models of flat panel television sets .
One set of customers were asked to choose between 2 television sets priced at 700 and 1000 dollars respectively .
The 2nd set of customers were asked to select between 3 models priced at 700 , 1000 and 2000 dollars respectively .
The results of the study showed that customers were more likely to purchase the 1000 dollar model when presented with 3 choices rather than two .
The majority of customers will stick to the middle of the road .
By introducing additional high priced items to your mix , you can effectively push a customer to spend more money because their perceptions of the median will be skewed .
Another technique that works well is to introduce a really expensive item and provide a deep discount off of the over - inflated price .
50 % off of an item that retails for 100 dollars sounds much more appealing than 10 % off of an item retailing for 55 dollars .
If you are selling products that do n’t have an established price , this technique can heavily sway buyers to make a purchase .
Frame Your Incentive In A Positive Light
Avoid negativity when presenting your prices .
Always present your product prices in terms of gains and not losses .
Frame your prices in the most positive light possible .
What exactly does this mean ?
Let ’s illustrate this with an example .
Which deal below sounds better to you ?
Item A sells for 1200 dollars with an instant cash rebate of 200 dollars .
Item B sells for 800 dollars with an additional courtesy fee of 200 dollars .
The deal for item A sounds infinitely more appealing to me .
I personally detest getting nickel and dimed at a store .
I hate being presented with a low price only to be beset with hidden fees at checkout .
Its much better to present a higher initial price with incentives than it is to offer a lower price with an additional fee .
Always present your prices in terms of gains and your customer will always feel better about the purchase .
Taking Advantage Of Consumer Behavior
The tactics presented above are by no means a replacement for having a strong unique selling proposition for your online store .
After all , if you are selling the same stuff that everyone else is , then customers will comparison shop and these strategies wo n’t matter .
However , if you sell unique products and you want to increase your profit margins , then the tactics mentioned in this post are great ways to do so in a more subtle fashion .
Make sure you think twice and consider how you structure a promotion before it goes live to maximize your sales .

First , in the old days , Henry Kissinger could fly to three capitals , meet three kings , presidents or prime ministers and strike a deal that could hold .
No more .
Today a peacemaker has to be both a nation - builder and a negotiator .
The Palestinians are so fragmented politically and geographically that half of U.S. diplomacy is going to be about how to make peace between Palestinians , and build their institutions , so there is a coherent , legitimate decision - making body there  before we can make peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
Second , Hamas now has a veto over any Palestinian peace deal .
It ’s true that Hamas just provoked a reckless war that has devastated the people of Gaza .
But Hamas is not going away .
It is well armed and , despite its suicidal behavior of late , deeply rooted .
The Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank will not make any compromise deal with Israel as long as it fears that Hamas , from outside the tent , would denounce it as traitorous .
Therefore , Job 2 for the U.S. , Israel and the Arab states is to find a way to bring Hamas into a Palestinian national unity government .
As the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen says , “ It is not enough for Israel that the world recognize that Hamas criminally mismanaged its responsibility to its people .
Israel ’s longer - term interest is to be sure that it has a Palestinian partner for negotiations , which will have sufficient legitimacy among its own people to be able to sign agreements and fulfill them .
Without Hamas as part of a Palestinian decision , any Israeli - Palestinian peace will be meaningless . ”
But bringing Hamas into a Palestinian unity government , without undermining the West Bank moderates now leading the Palestinian Authority , will be tricky .
We ’ll need Saudi Arabia and Egypt to buy , cajole and pressure Hamas into keeping the cease - fire , supporting peace talks and to give up rockets  while Iran and Syria will be tugging Hamas the other way .
And that leads to the third new factor 
Iran as a key player in Palestinian - Israeli diplomacy .
The Clinton team tried to woo Syria while isolating Iran .
President Bush tried to isolate both Iran and Syria .
The Obama team , as Martin Indyk argues in “ Innocent Abroad : An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East , ” “ needs to try both to bring in Syria , which would weaken Hamas and Hezbollah , while also engaging Iran . ”
So , just to recap :
It ’s five to midnight and before the clock strikes 12 all we need to do is rebuild Fatah , merge it with Hamas , elect an Israeli government that can freeze settlements , court Syria and engage Iran  while preventing it from going nuclear  just so we can get the parties to start talking .
Whoever lines up all the pieces of this diplomatic Rubik ’s Cube deserves two Nobel Prizes .
Phoebe Price and Maitland Ward are some of the greatest examples of never giving up , being resilient , not taking themselves too seriously , and capitalizing on the little celebrity that they have , to get into any and all holidays – where they produce their own brand of slutty content around said holiday , hoping the world or at least their fans promote or talk about them , and we do , because they are perfect … .
Both in their 40s , both pre-social media / internet marketing / both still doing it , bringing it , and I ’m glad they are both my friends who hate me because I laugh at them … but really I ’m laughing with them , as they troll the world with their big old tits that have n’t , at least as far as I ’m concerned , but I have low expectations out of life … and I just like all girls with big old tits willing to send me their santa themed erotica to masturbate to …and they do n’t need to be shot by paparazzi or excited to be in tabloid kind of girls who had dreams of fame and celebrity … but did n’t bother with actually booking any acting jobs …

Not a packet was traveling , not even an apt - get ;

While visions of oc - 48 lines danced in their heads ;
And flamers on their PC's , and I on my mac ,

Charlie Brown concedes in CA - 04 Tom McClintock ( R ) has been elected to the House in CA - 04 .
His Democratic opponent , Charlie Brown , conceded yesterday .
McClintock won by just under 1800 votes .
House seats in OH - 15 , VA - 05 , LA - 02 , and LA - 04 are still unresolved .
The latter two will have runoffs Saturday .
133 Ballots Missing in Minnesota Somehow 133 ballots vanished in one Minnesota precinct that went strongly for Al Franken .
The number of votes in the recount is lower than in the original count by 133 votes .
Franken estimates that these missing votes cost him 46 votes .
These missing votes will surely figure in subsequent court cases .
It boggles the mind that precincts are so sloppy with ballots .
The NY Times proposes abandoning the recount and flipping a coin .
Who Will Fill Obama 's Senate Seat ?
Sometime in the next month or so , Gov. Rod Blagojevich ( D - IL ) , the nation 's least popular governor , with an approval rating of 13 % , will get to appoint a United States senator .
Politico has a list of potential candidates : - Tammy Duckworth , an Iraq veteran and director of the state 's Dept. of veterans affairs
- Emil Jones , a black man who is president of the state senate
- Jesse Jackson , Jr. , a two - term representative and son of Rev. Jesse Jackson
- Lisa Madigan , the Illinois attorney general and potential Blagojevich opponent in 2010
- Danny Davis , a liberal congressman from Chicago
Of course , Blagojevich could surpise people and pick someone else .
Among other things , he has to be concerned about the appointed senator 's ability to win election in 2010 .
Obama 's Approval Rating is 78 % President - elect Barack Obama is earning high marks for his initial cabinet picks .
A Gallup poll shows that 78 % of Americans approve what he has done so far .
This number compares favorably to the approval ratings of President - elect Bush in 2000 ( 65 % ) and President - elect Clinton in 1992 ( 67 % ) .
Almost 70 % approve of his pick of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and 80 % approve of his pick of Robert Gates to run the Defense Department .
This increased popularity strengthens his already large mandate for change in the months ahead .
What is the Meaning of Chambliss Win in Georgia ?
According to Amy Walter of the National Journal , nothing .
Georgia is a reliably Republican state to start with , the Democrat , Jim Martin , had no statewise base , black turnout was way down compared to Nov. 4 , and Barack Obama did n't want to use up much political capital helping Martin ( all he did was make one radio ad for Martin ) .
Walter does n't believe this is a first step in rebuilding the GOP .
Winning Georgia is n't very hard for Republicans .
Rebuilding the Republican Party Walter 's colleague Charlie Cook has a good column on whither the Republican Party .
He talked to a number of top GOP strategists and got some insight .
One strategist had excuses for everything : it was Bush , it was the economy , it was everything except the what the party stands for .
Another said the party was pretty good at being against things but not so good at being for things .
Yet another point is that Republicans are losing the suburbs because they do n't have solutions to the problems real people have such as education , health care , and retirement .

Fresh reports on Iran ’s nuclear capability contradict National Intelligence Estimate
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Thursday , Nov 20 , 2008
Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned that any strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities undertaken by the Israeli air force will take place with the explicit backing of the U.S. government .
Speaking to Press TV , Iran ’s state backed news agency , the Congressman warned that unilateral Israeli action would be an impossibility .
“ No matter what they do , it is our money , it is our weapons , and they are not going to do it without us approving it , ” Paul commented .
The Congressman ’s warning comes in light of a report in the New York Times by nuclear physicist Richard Garwin that suggests Iran has produced nearly enough nuclear material to create one atomic bomb .
The report contradicts last year ’s National Intelligence Estimate which stated that Iran halted work toward a nuclear weapon under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015 .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called on the world to join Israel in putting a stop to Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ Iran has not terminated its pursuit of nuclear weapons , ” Olmert told a gathering of North American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem .
“ Iran can not become nuclear .
Israel cannot afford it …the free world must not accept it .
We must all do whatever we can to prevent it . ”
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said the US and Europe should set aside their differences with China and Russia and help Israel put up a united front against Iran .
Israeli Air Force Commander General Ido Nehushtan has said that his forces are ready to follow any order to thwart Iran ’s nuclear programs .

Newsbeat US reporter in Santa Fe
Sex addicts do everything from watch porn to visit prostitutes Like alcohol , drugs , and gambling , sex can become addictive too .
Celebrities Russell Brand and David Duchovny threw a spotlight on sex addiction by checking into rehabilitation centres in the States to get treatment for it .
Last year , Newsbeat discovered that sex addiction was a growing problem among men in the UK .
80 % of the sex therapists we contacted said an increasing number of males were asking for help with sex addiction .
Today there are more than eight clinics in America offering specialist treatment to those who suffer from the disorder .
Newsbeat was given exclusive access to one of them .
The Life Healing Centre ( LHC ) is in Santa Fe , New Mexico , and it offers two sex addiction programmes : one for men and the other for women .
The centre is based at the top of a mountain range .
It 's 7,500 ft ( 2,286 m ) above sea level .
The high altitude can make people feel light headed for a while .
From the balcony on campus , you can see nothing but mountains and desert .
Lose control Rob Weiss is an addiction specialist .
He created the sex addiction programme at LHC .
He said : " Sex addicts are people who lose control over healthy sexual choices .
I was compulsive self - pleasuring , using pornography , going to prostitutes and having people sexually abuse and torture me for my pleasure
Andy , 31 , claims to have been a sex addict for years " They say things to themselves like , ' I 'm not going to go to that place for sex ' or ' I 'm not going to see that person for sex ' but they continue to do it anyway .
" They show behaviours that are common to all addicts and they show consequences and thinking that is common to all addicts . "
According to Mr. Weiss , 80 % of sex addicts in the US are men .
It is impossible to say how many sex addicts there are though , as many do n't admit to having the problem .
Psychologist and author Doctor Patrick Carnes , who has done substantial research in the area , estimates three to 5 % of Americans suffer from the disorder .
Their behaviour can vary from compulsively watching porn online to visiting prostitutes at every opportunity .
Andy is 31 and is enrolled in the programme .
He claims to have been a sex addict for years .
The Life Healing Centre in Santa
Fe treats a wide variety of patients
He said : " I was compulsive self - pleasuring , using pornography , going to prostitutes and having people sexually abuse and torture me for my pleasure . "
His addiction got so out of control that he was unable to walk for a month after a dominatrix severely sexually abused him at his request .
" I was the masochist .
Once I was so physically harmed because I 'd taken it to an extreme level , " he added .
Talking
So what goes on at this clinic which claims to cure sex addicts like Andy ?
At LHC they focus on communication .
Through hours of self - evaluation , the therapists and councillors attempt to get to the bottom of the cause of the addiction .
They believe in trauma exploration because many of the addicts have difficult pasts ranging from child abuse to problematic up - bringings .
The group sessions focus on reducing the shame in patients which goes along with the disorder .
The male addicts at LHC explained their addiction as being a force that was too great to control .
No TVs , phones or mobile phones are allowed in the clinic But Phillip Hodson , fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy , disagrees and says sex is about choices .
He said : " We think that sex addiction is not a proper definition .
" I mean it 's up to you whether you go out and have sex with somebody .
" You have a choice or you stay in and watch EastEnders . "
He thinks the condition would be better described as compulsive , obsessive or greedy .
Rob Weiss understands the scrutiny that comes with the term " sex addiction " but argues that it is a genuine problem and not just a glamorous term for someone who has a high sex drive .
He said : " I never think of sex addiction as being glamorous .
" The people I work with are often engaging in acts that they themselves are n't comfortable with .
" They hate themselves often for the types of places they go to and the behaviours they engage in .
" No sex addict would describe their behaviour as glamorous . "
A 35 - day programme at the centre does n't come cheap .
It costs around £ 20,000 .
Doug is a sex addict and has been in rehab for several weeks .
He said : " As far as the number of women I 've been with , it runs in the hundreds .
I do n't count .
" But now I hope to live a normal life , and have a normally functioning sex life . "

私は昔からマイコン工作に興味があったのですが、周りに知っている人もおらず、マイコン用のプログラムを書いたりPROM を焼いたり、そういう基本的な事が全く分からず指をくわえておりました。最初
Arduino の事を聞いた時、オープンソースだとかフィジカルコンピューティングだとか、こりゃまた口当たりの良いセールストークを使った意味不明な奴らだと思っていたのですが、ふと、これは単にマイコン工作を簡単にした物だという事をちょっと前に知って、がぜん興味が湧いたのでした。で、ぽちっと通販してまったのです。
これが買った奴 。Adafruit Indstries の Arduino Starter Pack http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=68 です。写真の左下にある Arduino だけだったら 30 ドルです 。Arduino のまず凄いのは純粋にこの本体を買っただけでも何か出来るという事です。電源は
USB から供給出来るし 、LED が一つ本体に付いていて、誰もがまずやる LED チカチカを実験出来ます。親切すぎてかえって残念な事に、最初っから
LED チカチカ入りで出荷されています。最初の感動を味わえるように何も入ってない状態で出荷して欲しかったです。
本体だけで遊べるとはいえ、LED と 9V の四角い電池くらいはあった方が良いと思います。特に電池があると、パソコンから外しても動くので感動がひとしおです。私は怠惰なので一通りそろった
65 ドルの Starter Pack を買いました。他にも小さなブレッドボードと、万能拡張ボードと、パーツが沢山ついて来ます。拡張ボードはシールドと呼ぶらしいです。これが一般的な呼称なのか
Arduino 業界言葉なのかは知りません。それから入門ペー ジ
http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson0.html の通りに勉強始めました。

が、ここまでやって文章が多くてしんどいのでサンプルを上から順にやる事にしました。
ちなみに、よく Arduino は Processing 言語 で動くとありますが 、Processing というのは言語では無く、開発環境の名前です。つまり、VisualStudio みたいなもんで 、Arduino の開発言語 は C です。 もしかして世の中には開発環境やライブラリの事を言語と呼ぶ流儀があるのかも知れませんが、Processing 言語という言葉に惑わされてしまったのでここに書いておきます。
The Screen Actors Guild shared the wealth among this year ’s biggest stars , showering Sean Penn and Meryl Streep with leading actor awards during the live telecast Sunday .
Streep humorously acknowledged her surprise while accepting the award for outstanding female actor in a leading role for Doubt .
“ I did n’t even buy a dress , ” said the actress , who wore black pants .
“ I ’m really , really shocked . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
But Streep , who was beat out in the leading actress category by Kate Winslet at the Golden Globes , used her time at the podium to make a serious point .
“ There is no such thing as the best actress , ” she said .
“ There is no such thing as the greatest living actress .
I am in a position where I have secret information that I know this to be true .
I am so in awe of the work of the women this year – nominated , not nominated – so proud of us girls .
Everybody wins when we get parts like this . ”
Best in Film
If Sunday ’s victories were any indication , those leading stars would be wise to prepare Academy Award acceptance speeches .
With 15 categories recognizing acting achievement on television and in the movies , the SAG Awards – which are voted on by the union celebrating actors and are broadcast from Los Angeles ’s Shrine Auditorium – are considered by many in the industry to anticipate Oscar winners .
Honored for his role as Harvey Milk in the biopic Milk , Penn poignantly noted that “ as actors , we do n’t play gay / straight … we play human beings . ”
Said the star : “ This is a story about equal rights for all human beings . ”
( Penn ’s victory comes after The Wrestler ‘s Mickey Rourke has picked up leading actor wins at various other ceremonies . )
Another big winner :
The cast of Slumdog Millionaire was named outstanding cast in a motion picture , foreshadowing a probable Best Picture Oscar win .
Supporting Stars
A favorite this award season , Kate Winslet was named best female actor in a supporting role for her part in the Holocaust drama The Reader .
Already a double Golden Globe winner , the actress was overwhelmed by her early honor .
“ It ’s really an honor to be included in what , I think , is such a remarkable year [ in film ] , ” she said .
In the supporting male category , Heath Ledger earned another posthumous trophy for his role as the macabre Joker in The Dark Knight .
“ I ’m quite emotional , ” said castmate Gary Oldman , who accepted the award .
“ He was an extraordinary young man with an extraordinary talent , and it is wonderful that you have acknowledged that . ”
( Ledger was nominated for an Oscar for the role on the first anniversary of his death . )
30 Rock Sweeps
Meanwhile , another leading lady , Tina Fey , had a big night , too .
The 30 Rock star earned the outstanding female actor award , while the show took home the best ensemble comedy series .
Fey collected the evening ’s first award and dedicated it to her daughter Alice , whom she called “ the funniest person in my family . ”
The actress has been on an award - show roll :
She also recently nabbed a Golden Globe for the same role .
In another Golden Globe redux , Fey ’s 30 Rock castmate Alec Baldwin picked up the evening ’s second award , male actor in a comedy series .
“ I get to do this show with a bunch of people who are just the funniest and sweetest people , ” said the actor , who brought his daughter Ireland as his date for the evening .
Soon , Baldwin was joined by his costars , as they joyfully accepted the ensemble in a comedy series award .
Dramatic Wins
It was also a big night for AMC ’s Mad Men .
The show earned best ensemble in a drama series , and leading actor Jon Hamm lightened the moment .
He referenced the show ’s ratings struggle by thanking its “ dozens of viewers . ”
RIYADH , Jan 12 ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia accused Israel on Monday of " racist extermination " in its attack on Gaza and expressed hope that incoming U.S. president Barack Obama would work to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
" The cabinet said the extermination Israel is launching upon the Palestinian people in Gaza has denuded Israeli leaders of humanity and places their policies in the ranks of racist extermination , " said a statement carried by the state news agency SPA .
" The cabinet expressed its optimism over the statements of president - elect Barack Obama concerning how affected he was by the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza , and his intention to move in an immediate and orderly fashion towards finding a fair resolution of the Palestinian question . "
Medical officials said the Palestinian death toll in Israeli offensive , which began on Dec. 27 , had risen past 900 and included at least 380 civilians .
Israel says 13 Israelis have died -- three civilians hit by rockets and 10 soldiers .
Obama said on Sunday the deaths of civilians in the fighting were " heartbreaking " , and that his administration would act immediately as a third party that wants to see a fair resolution to the historic conflict .
The Saudi statement said that the cabinet " looks forward to an incoming American administration that is more serious , objective and independent in dealing with the Palestinian issue " , SPA said .
Arab governments have long complained that U.S. administrations lean towards Israel in the conflict .
Saudi Arabia has organised an aid campaign for Palestinians that has gathered over 100 million riyals ( $ 27 million ) , as the government tries to respond to popular anger over the offensive while preventing street protests .
The Saudi government has refrained from explicitly blaming Hamas for the Israeli offensive , but some writers in Saudi media have attacked Hamas for aligning itself with Shi'ite power Iran .

" We 're not dealing with poor people , " said the man , who claimed his name was Mateen Khan .
" We are only going to kidnap people who have foreign money from all around the world and who have taken it for themselves .

Hemp Plastics Hempcrete Hemp Building Materials
Hemp can be made into any building material , including fiberboard , roofing , flooring , wallboard , caulking , cement , paint , paneling , particleboard , plaster , plywood , reinforced concrete , insulation , insulation panels , spray - on insulation , concrete pipes , bricks , and biodegradable plastic composites which are tougher than steel .
Foundations can be made out of hemp hurds , a processed based on ancient technology adapted for modern use .
To do this , set up a plywood frame ( preferably hemp plywood ) , then fill with a mixture of hemp hurd ( wood chip - like substance ) and combine with lime , sand , plaster , some cement , and enough water to dampen , and let the mixture set for a day .
Then take the frame down , but let the mixture continue to harden for about a week .
The lime and the hurds create a chemical reaction which binds the mixture together .
Amazingly these structures continue to get harder and stronger everyday until they fossilize , as is testament by a 6th century hemp - reinforced bridge in France .
After this happens , the hemp foundation walls are as strong as stone .
Hemp foundation walls are 7 times stronger than concrete foundations , half as light , and three times as elastic , which means that these building will bend , but not break .
Because of their superior strength and flexibility , hemp foundations are resistant to stress - induced cracking and breaking .
Even earthquakes and other natural disaster cannot break or crack these structures .
Hemp foundation homes and buildings are self - insulated , including thermal and sound insulation , resistant to rotting , rodents , insects , and they are fire proof , waterproof , weather resistant , and the walls breath so the rooms do not get stuffy .
Hemp homes stay warm in the winter , and cool in the summer .
If hemp were legal in the United States , it would be the cheapest source of raw material for concrete - like foundations .
Plus hemp hurds can be processed in existing wood mills without major changes to the equipment .
Hemp - foundation homes are ecologically appropriate because they are inexpensive , and can be prepared on site using only a cement mixer , and the material would be cheap and abundant .
Foundation floors can be made in much the same way as the foundation .
Hemp resists seepage , and so hemp cement is applicable for pouring onto a soil base to make a foundation floor .
The floor insulation hardens into a solid mass which will not shift under pressure .
A German company produces a product called Mehabit , a hemp hurd substance covered with coal - based bitumen , which is sticky , and when leveled out on a hemp cement floor , will dry to form a thermally and phonetically insulated floor .
Washington State University has produced hemp fiberboard is lighter , twice as strong , and three times as elastic as wood fiberboard , plus it has sound proofing and pressure isolative characteristics absent from wood fiberboard .
These composites are also resistant to pests , moisture , and funguses .
The process involves chipping the hemp stalk , bonding it together with resins and glues , and clamping it down into molds under high pressure until it hardens .
Concrete pipes can be made out of hemp fiber which cost 1/3 that of polypropylene .
These pipes have greater flexibility , greater elasticity , and are resistant to cracking .
Stones can also be made out of hemp by wetting the stalk 's cellulose , and forming it into a hard black rock , which can be cut , drilled , cast , carved , or formed into any shape .
Hemp building material could allow us to replace the need for wood , bricks , and fiberglass insulation .
Germany and France are using hemp for construction material , replacing drywall and plywood .
A French company has built over 250 homes using hemp materials .
Hemp homes have also been built on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota .
Using hemp is economically smart and ecologically appropriate , plus the homes built with hemp are as hard as stone and are not subject to natural disaster .
Wow , sounds kind of like a miracle , does n't it ?
What are we waiting for ?
Rebuilding in a developing world .
by Scott Blossom
The ecosystem is beginning to show many signs that the Earth is continually seeking to balance the many forces that are acting upon it .
We can no longer deny the fact that our continual drive for economic growth has a drastic effect on the natural capital that our traditional economy is based upon .
Many great leaders of this country such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington have sighted the importance of local agriculture and independence from foreign resources .
Unfortunately , as we continue to put pressure on the Earth to supply us with non-renewable materials , massive amounts of energy are released in ways that can detrimental the human existence .
Although many of these changes may seem to be on a scale that is much too large for us to control , we are beginning to see the increasing role that humans have in a fragile , yet powerful ecosystem .
In recent years , we 've seen dramatic weather changes , along with increased risk of storm , flood and fire .
Natural disasters , such as those that are represented by what we have seen recently on the East Coast in the form of Hurricane Isabelle , and on the West Coast in the form of large forest fires , present a realistic view of the natural changes that are currently happening are currently influencing our ecosystem .
In addition , we are seeing human induced occurrences influencing the ecosystem as well .
Many of our water resources are exhibiting decreasing water quality , and increased flood activity due to our creation of impervious surfaces and runoff laden with toxic materials .
As a result of this , we are seeing much of our soil , our valuable and usable land , being polluted washed away with increased amounts of erosion , and our agricultural fields being filled with sedimentation .
When our children can no longer safely sunbathe , or swim in rivers , there is evidence that the once - finely tuned relationship between humankind and nature is out of balance .
Although many natural disasters are beyond human intervention , we do have a direct influence on the environment with our methods of re-building after their occurrence .
Development can actually repair environmental destruction with intelligent bioengineering and advanced ecological agriculture .
Most importantly , we can heed the advice of our forefathers , while taking advantage of current technology , and begin to make intelligent planning and engineering decisions as we continue to develop and grow into a society that can be can be economically and environmentally stable .
In this developing world we must actively design communities that allow us to work with the environment , while utilizing the production of our building materials as an actual method of remediation and retrofitting of our current situation .
By doing so , we can continue to grow at a rate that is sufficient to keep the economy strong , as well as allow our environment enough time to regenerate , even as we harvest agricultural resources that will replace synthetic materials .
By using renewable materials that alleviate the need to extract those of which have taken years to form , we can release the many levels of pressure on the earth , before forces of nature release themselves .
With this goal in mind , we are guided to design solutions that utilize renewable resources such as the industrial hemp plant .
In the development of a community plan we may explore how a renewable resource such as industrial hemp can be used in conjunction with innovative design to stabilize the economy , as it stabilizes the environment .
Site
One of the first aspects in developing a new community , or renovating an existing community is to select a site that is suitable for sustainable development , which in many cases , requires the treatment of areas that have been previously impacted .
The industrial hemp plant can be used in remediation of brownfields , as it has a higher nutrient uptake than any other agricultural crop .
The industrial nature of this crop lends itself well to these types of applications as its products can be used for many industrial applications ( as we will discuss later ) other than consumption .
In addition , the hemp plant can be an integral part of the reforestation projects that are necessary after a large forest fires , or a large clear cuts .
Industrial hemp is excellent sown in a fallow field , as well as in crop rotation ; the roots loosen soil , and fallen leaves return beneficial organic matter to the soil .
In many cases industrial hemp can be planted as a means to stabilize soil , thus lessening the amount of valuable land that is lost to erosion .
In addition , the fibers from the hemp plant can be arranged in a fiber matrix that can be secured to eroding slopes as erosion control blanketing and matting , as well as into fiber logs that help in the prevention of shoreline erosion .
The actual growth of the plant itself can alleviate the need for the millions of pounds of toxic fertilizer that contaminates our watersheds .
In all of these ways , the growth of industrial hemp can help in the restoration of our watersheds and streams , as it is grown for usable materials that will be later used in the community design .
Cutting edge methods of managing stormwater using low impact development techniques such as bioretention and vegetated filter strips as a means reducing peak runoff rates , improving water quality , and replenishing aquifers , lend a whole new potential for the incorporation of the industrial hemp plant into our landscape .
Building Many traditional methods of buildings utilized local materials to construct buildings and sheds .
By strengthening agricultural base we can return power back into the people who work American soil , thus decreasing the need for dependence on foreign resources .
Industrial hemp holds the potential to strengthen growing communities on reservations and rural areas , as the fibers and hurd from the hemp plant can reinforce traditional adobe and fiber reinforced concrete mixtures .
In addition , one acre of hemp produces as much cellulose fiber pulp as 4.1 acres of trees , resulting in an excellent material to be used in the composites industry .
Hemp resin can be used as an additive in the creation of biodegradable polymers that help to reduce the problems of waste disposal associated with toxic materials .
Biodegradable polymers can potentially be combined with plant fibers to produce biodegradable Eco-Composite materials .
The reinforcement of these polymers by means of vegetable fibers improves their mechanical properties and opens up new fields of application within the construction industry with the use of techniques such as film stacking , injection molding , and press consolidation .
A mixture of hemp fibers and hurds subjected to extreme heat and pressure can be molded into a completely biodegradable material that possesses excellent thermal and acoustic capabilities , as well as being fire - resistant and competitive in mechanical characteristics ( tensile and compressive strength ) with modern materials that are produced with a petrochemical base .
Many of these qualities have been extensively tested with techniques such as electron microscopy an analysis of crystallographic changes that occur within the organic biopolymer that exists within the hempen matrix .
Research in the area of biological renewable materials has shown that the main building blocks of life &endash ; carbohydrates , fats , proteins , and their derivatives &endash ; could be substitute products from the modern non-renewable resources .
( Almost everything made from a hydrocarbon can be produced from a renewable carbohydrate . )
The advantage of using a renewable resource as the root of our building industry can be seen as we assess the life cycle of the material through its growth harvest and production , as well as in the examination of the gases that are released into the environment ( or household ) after construction .
Many modern materials produce harmful off - gas that silently infiltrates into our bodies during everyday activities .
By using industrial hemp to manufacture non-toxic products , we can alleviate the release of many harmful chemicals into the atmosphere , as well as improve upon the overall health of the community .
The cellulose from the hemp plant can be extruded into almost any product .
By varying the heat , pressure , chemistry , and retention time with the extrusion process a range of fiber and cellular materials with multiple strength characteristics can be generated .
Products for the home industry that have been created using the industrial hemp plant include , but are not limited to : eco-composite paneling , fiberboard beams , roof shingles , carpets , biodegradable paints , curtains , and rugs .
Transportation and Energy
The biomass from the hemp plant can converted into many forms of energy that can be used throughout the household and the community .
Biomass can be converted to methane , methanol , ethanol , or gasoline at a fraction of the current cost of oil , coal , or nuclear energy .
As an energy crop , hemp can contribute to the biodiesel industry in applications such as heating homes , as well as a trillion dollar biofuel industry that can supply the fuel necessary to run automobiles or airplanes .
Think of all the college students booking flights for a Cancun all inclusive , or the wealthy people vacationing in a Dominican Republic hotel .
All of those gallons of jet - fuel could be replaced by hemp .
These methods have been proven capable of competing with the non-renewable fossil fuel industry , as well as reversing the Greenhouse Effect through its growth and harvest that removes CO2 from the atmosphere .
In addition being an excellent lubricant for industrial applications , hempseed oil can be used as lighting oil .
As Abraham Lincoln demonstrated , it produces the brightest lamplight , and offers an alternative to costly energy bills .
Perhaps one of the most beneficial characteristics of this renewable resource is that the hemp plant can be used in its entirety , and that a streamlined life - cycle assessment yields positive impacts on the environment throughout the growth , harvest , and production stages .
The industrial hemp plant offers a wide variety of high performance applications through the many aspects of community design , and will help strengthen our local economy , return power back to our local agricultural industry , and restore the environment as it grows .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Interest in President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration is running so high that one ticket broker is asking $ 20,095 for a single ticket .
The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far for Barack Obama 's presidential inauguration on January 20 .
Entry to the biggest event in Washington is free if your congressman or senator grants your request , but with demand outpacing supply a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace .
Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the swearing - in of Barack Obama for thousands of dollars , even for standing - room areas on the National Mall .
Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the January 20 ceremony .
" We think it 's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets .
We understand some people want to make a buck , but for those people thinking of buying tickets , it 's buyer beware , " warned Howard Gantman , staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies .
Watch why the tickets are going for top dollar »
The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far , holding them in a secure location .
For information on how to get one , check out http://inaugural.senate.gov/.
Ticket brokers act as middlemen , selling inaugural tickets they say they purchase from Capitol Hill employees and people who get them from members of Congress .
Since the government releases tickets at the last minute -- less than a week before the inauguration -- ticket brokers cannot ensure they will receive enough tickets to cover their orders .
Do n't Miss Inauguration prompts travel rush to Washington
Web sites promise a full refund if tickets are not secured to buyers , but that offer may be little consolation to people who invest in a trip to Washington to see the inauguration .
Since tickets do not have attendees ' names on them , Gantman said it 's inevitable some will be sold .
" Some will be distributed this way .
It happens with baseball games and concerts .
But we are going to take every step we can to make sure these tickets get into the hands of those who themselves intend to attend this event . "
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , the chairwoman of the inauguration committee , said Monday she she was prepared to ask Congress to make it a crime to scalp inauguration tickets .
" We have heard reports that there are people trying to scalp Inaugural tickets for more than $ 40,000 each .
This is unconscionable and must not be allowed , " Feinstein said in a statement .
" This inauguration will be the major civic event of our time , and these tickets are supposed to be free for the people .
Nobody should have to pay for their tickets , " she added .
The inaugural committee is alerting lawmakers that it is a violation of Congress ' code of ethics for members or staff to sell their tickets .

Salute : A moving tribute
By Richard Phillips and Ismet Redzovic
20 January 2009
Salute is a documentary about Australian sprinter Peter Norman and his public gesture of political solidarity with African American athletes John Carlos and Tommy Smith at the 1968 Olympic Games .
Directed by Matt Norman , it was first shown at the 2008 Sydney Film Festival where it won the Best Australian documentary prize .
( See interview with Matt Norman ) .
The review below was originally posted on September 19 , 2008 as part of the World Socialist Web Site 's coverage of last year 's Sydney Film Festival .
Salute was recently named as the biggest earning Australian documentary for 2008 and will be released on DVD this month .
Salute
Peter Norman ( 1942-2006 ) , an Australian sprinter whose sporting career was cut short following his gesture of political solidarity with medal - winning African - American athletes at the Mexico City Olympic Games in 1968 , is the subject of Salute , one of the better documentaries at the 2008 Sydney Film Festival .
The lead - up to the Mexico Games occurred in the midst of a series of violent and bitter struggles by working people around the world .
The assassination of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King in April 1968 provoked the eruption of ghetto riots in US cities ; French workers and students challenged capitalism in the May - June general strike ; and in Mexico City the military opened fire on thousands of protesting students in Tlatelolco plaza demanding democratic reform and social justice just 10 days before the Olympic Games opening ceremony .
Over 500 Mexican students were arrested and at least 200 killed , with some investigations putting the death toll as high as 1,000 .
One year prior to the Games , an American civil rights organisation — the Olympic Project for Human Rights — proposed that African - American athletes who qualified for the international event boycott it in order to highlight ongoing racial oppression in the US .
The athletes decided , however , that they would gain more publicity for the civil rights movement by participating , but that each individual should be free to develop their own protest at the Games .
This led to one of the most iconic images in the history of the Olympic Games , when Tommie Smith and John Carlos , the first and third place - getters in the 200 - metre sprint , raised their clenched fists during the medal presentation ceremony as the American national anthem was being played .
Norman , who came second in the event , stood on the podium wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights button given to him by one of the athletes just prior to the ceremony , and then publicly defended their protest .
To his credit , Salute 's director Matt Norman — Peter Norman 's nephew — spends considerable time outlining the historical and political context of the event .
Utilising archival footage , interviews and intelligent narration , he makes clear that the heroic actions of the three athletes were not accidental , but an organic part of an international movement against racism and for democratic rights .
A couple of local film reviewers have superficially criticised Salute , claiming that the documentary is too long .
Matt Norman , however , explained in one media interview that he wanted to " push the archival footage to the max to show younger people what it was like " and to " promote civil rights issues " .
Salute , for example , details the Tlatelolco massacre in October , 1968 when Mexican authorities shot student demonstrators , an event that was hidden from the athletes and the international media at the time .
In addition , the movie explains the social and political tensions in Australia in order to provide some background to Norman 's actions .
Importantly , Matt Norman was able to bring the three athletes together before the cameras to tell their story .
The two black athletes had previously given slightly different versions about the 200 - metre race , with Carlos claiming that he let Smith win the event .
Fortunately the interview was held not long before Norman 's untimely death from a heart attack in 2006 .
And what a remarkable and inspiring story it is .
Smith and Carlos consulted with Peter Norman before the medals ceremony , in case he might have felt that they were spoiling his moment of glory .
Norman immediately agreed with their proposed protest , and decided to wear the Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in solidarity .
While the rest is history , the subsequent events and how the protest ruined the sporting careers of all three athletes are not well known .
Prior to and during the Mexico Games , US sporting authorities repeatedly threatened African - American athletes that any form of protest would lead to instant dismissal from the Olympic team .
There were anonymous death threats and a rumour circulated that there was a sniper in Mexico City 's main stadium prepared to shoot any African - American athlete who dared stage a protest .
The three athletes , therefore , had real reason to fear for their lives .
After the ceremony , Smith and Carlos were immediately expelled from the Games by the US authorities and both lost their jobs ; Smith 's mother died from a heart attack in 1970 when local farmers sent her manure and dead rats in protest against her son's actions ; and Carlos 's wife committed suicide .
Likewise Norman , who qualified for the next Olympic Games in Munich in 1972 , was excluded by Australian Olympic officials .
The Australian selectors were so eager to punish Norman over his participation in the 1968 protest that they decided against sending any Australian sprinters at all , in order to prevent him from competing .
Norman 's sprint times were fast enough for him to qualify for both the 100 and 200 - metre events in Munich .
In fact , his Mexico City 200 - metre sprint would have been a gold medal winning time at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 .
So trenchant was the vendetta by Australian sporting officials against Norman that they refused to even invite him to the 2000 event .
Peter Norman comes across in the documentary as a warm and remarkably modest man , with no sense of regret or bitterness over his appalling treatment by Australian sporting officials .
His sense of humour is infectious and on camera he constantly downplays his role in the protest , simply emphasising that he felt privileged to be part of the historic protest .
Salute is a fitting tribute to Norman 's humanity and an important reminder that there was a time when champion athletes courageously spoke out in defence of democratic rights and in defiance of their national governments .
Like Mr. Bundy , Mr. Madoff used a sharp mind and an affable demeanor to create a persona that did n’t exist , according to this view , and lulled his victims into a false sense of security .
And when publicly accused , he seemed to show no remorse .
Television footage of Mr. Madoff entering his apartment building on East 64th Street at Lexington Avenue after federal authorities charged him with fraud in December does n’t seem to show a man exhibiting any sorrow or regret .
With a battery of reporters asking him whether he felt remorse , he declined to respond and pushed his way into his building .
( Thus far , his only public apology has apparently been in letters left in his lobby for fellow tenants who suffered through the media circus outside their building . )
To some extent , analysts of criminal behavior say , defining Mr. Madoff is complicated by the wide variety of possible explanations for his scheme : a desire to accumulate vast wealth , a need to dominate others and a need to prove that he was smarter than everyone else .
That was shown , they say , in an ability to dupe investors and regulators for years .
Like the former F.B.I. agent Mr. McCrary , Dr. Meloy cautions that he has not met Mr. Madoff and ca n’t make a clinical diagnosis .
Nevertheless , he says individuals with psychopathic personalities tend to strongly believe that they ’re special .
“ They believe ‘ I ’m above the law , ’ and they believe they cannot be caught , ” Mr. Meloy says .
“ But the Achilles ’ heel of the psychopath is his sense of impunity .
That is , eventually , what will bring him down . ”
He says it makes complete sense that Mr. Madoff would have courted regulators , even if he ran the risk of exposing his own actions by doing so .
“ In a scheme like this , it ’s very important to keep those who could threaten you very close to you , ” Dr. Meloy explains .
“ You want to develop them as allies and shape how they go about their business and their attitudes toward you . ”
Walking the Terrorist Tightrope Pakistan 's President Zardari Attempts the Impossible
Pakistan 's President Zardari is trying to avoid a conflict with India without completely alienating his own powerful army .
The attempt may be doomed .
His crackdown on Islamists suspected of planning the Mumbai attacks has already made him many enemies within the military .
Popular wisdom says that Apple invents and Microsoft copies .
In reality , though , it 's not quite that simple .
Over the years both firms have liberally borrowed from one another - and while Windows 7 draws plenty of inspiration from OS X , it 's also added some nifty things that we'd love to see Apple improve upon .
Here are 10 neat Windows 7 features that can teach Apple a thing or two about building a must - have OS .
1. Taskbar thumbnails
Windows 7's new Taskbar is clearly inspired by OS X's Dock , but its taskbar thumbnails - little images that show you all open windows when you hover the mouse over a program icon - take the idea a step further .
The OS X dock gets awfully cluttered when you 've got lots of apps open and windows minimised ; if Apple were to nick this one it'd make things much more straightforward .
2. Touch - screen input
In some respects Apple is way ahead of Microsoft when it comes to touch input - it 's already shipping touch - enabled kit - but Apple 's approach is to use touch on the trackpad .
Multi - touch screens are much more fun .
3 and 4 . Libraries and Homegroups
Libraries are a bit like search folders .
Simply create a library for a particular topic or project , drag the files and folders you want from your local storage and any connected devices or PCs , and you can then view and access them all from a single location .
It 's a good way of managing content on multiple machines , especially when you team it up with Homegroups .
Best described as networking for people who do n't know anything about networking , Homegroups make it easy to share the aforementioned libraries in a home network .
5. Device Stage
If third parties do n't ruin it , Device Stage is handy .
Each device - MP3 players , printers and other peripherals - gets a nifty selection of buttons to do sensible things such as managing the device , checking for firmware upgrades , opening the manual and so on .
6. Media Center
Front Row is great , but it 's really just a front end for iTunes and the iTunes Store .
Windows ' Media Center , on the other hand , is a proper home entertainment system that uses TV tuners to deliver live TV and personal video recording .
7. Jump lists
Jump lists are context - sensitive menus that appear when you right - click on a program icon , providing quick access to common tasks and to recently opened documents .
OS X has this to an extent , but only when the application is actually running .
8. DirectX
Once again , Microsoft makes games developers happy with a new version of its Direct X media API .
Apple ?
As ID Software 's John Carmack said in 2008 , " The truth is Steve Jobs does n't care about games . "
The success of iPhone gaming suggests that perhaps he should .
9. BitLocker
Windows 7's version of BitLocker drive encryption makes it easy to protect external drives and even USB flash drives .
OS X's FileVault , while easy to use and very secure , only encrypts your home directory .
10 . Netbook compatibility
Windows 7 has been designed to run on the humblest hardware and install from a USB drive , because people really like netbooks .
Apple could easily produce a cracker , but we 're not convinced Snow Leopard is the place to start : the iPhone 's OS X is already optimised for modest hardware .

Mark Begich leads Stevens by a 3,724 - vote margin. 58 and counting : Stevens gets the boot
Senate Democrats grew significantly stronger on Tuesday with Ted Stevens getting the boot from voters and Joe Lieberman getting a light rap from his colleagues .
Democrats now have 58 seats and a real shot at the filibuster - proof 60 if things go their way in Minnesota and Georgia .
Simply put , Barack Obama will begin his presidency with a very muscular majority in the Senate .

Stevens was declared the loser in Alaska on Tuesday night after a two - week - long process of counting nearly 90,000 absentee and early votes from across Alaska .
With this victory , Democrat Mark Begich has defeated one of the giants in the U.S. Senate by a 3,724 - vote margin , a stunning end to a 40 - year Senate career marred by Stevens ' conviction on corruption charges a week before the election .
The Associated Press called the race Tuesday evening .
About 2,500 absentee ballots from overseas remain , but they would not change the outcome of the race .
Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , would become the first Democrat elected to Alaska ’s Congressional delegation in nearly three decades .
“ I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States Senate , ” Begich said in a Tuesday night statement shortly after he was declared the winner .
“ It ’s been an incredible journey getting to this point , and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day .
I ca n’t wait to get to work fighting for Alaskan families . "
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer released a statement congratulating Begich on the victory .
“ Mark Begich will be an outstanding Senator for Alaska and the country , and with seven seats and counting now added to the Democratic ranks in the Senate , we have an even stronger majority that will bring real change to America , " Schumer said .
The Begich victory also spares Senate Republicans from having to take an embarrassing vote to expel Stevens from the Senate Republican Conference .
That vote had been planned for Tuesday but was postponed because it looked like Stevens would actually lose the election .
Stevens could ask for a recount , but because Begich ’s margin of victory is greater than 0.5 percent , his campaign would have to pay for the procedure .
Begich is leading Stevens by a 1.2 percent margin of victory .
Stevens ’ defeat marks the end of his dominance both in Washington and Alaska .
The longest - serving Republican in the United Senate , Stevens is renowned for steering billions of dollars in federal funding to his home state .
The airport in Anchorage was renamed Ted Stevens International Airport in 2000 , and he was named Alaskan of the century that same year .
Nine days before the election , he was convicted on seven counts of corruption charges by a federal grand jury over failing to report more than $ 250,000 in improper gifts and home renovations he received from the oil services company VECO .
Stevens has said he will be appealing the conviction .
On Election Night , Stevens had reason to be optimistic .
He led Begich by about 3,200 votes in the initial post- election tally , but there were about 90,000 outstanding absentee and early vote ballots that took two weeks to finish counting .
Nearly one - third of Alaska voters opted to cast their ballots before Election Day – and the clear majority of them were Begich supporters who were encouraged to cast their votes early .
Many of Stevens ’ GOP colleagues , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , called on Stevens to resign if re-elected , distancing themselves from the scandal - plagued senator .
Republicans , though , postponed a vote on whether to expel Stevens from the GOP Conference as Stevens ’s re-election prospects grew dimmer .
After his conviction , Stevens returned home to Alaska for a whirlwind final week of campaigning where he railed against the federal government for abusing its prosecutorial power .
The state , which has a long history of distrusting the federal government , appeared to respond to his criticism of prosecutorial abuse .
But it was too little , too late .
“ I do n't think there 's anyone in Alaska who would n't want to thank Ted Stevens for what he 's done for this state , and wish him well on the appeal of his conviction .
Alaska would n't be what it is today if it were n't for him , ” said longtime Alaska pollster Ivan Moore .
“ However , times are changing and Alaska must too . ”
' Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people " may well be the most widely quoted observation of the last half - century regarding poetry in Britain .
It was Adrian Mitchell 's preface to Poems ( 1964 ) , his first major collection .
By the time of Mitchell 's death last weekend , more Brits were relishing masses more poetry , because so much more poetry has got involved with so many more people .
This has happened in huge measure due to the non-stop commitment of Mitchell himself to reversing the situation he found so demoralising at the outset of his vocational path .
His ground - breaking work as a political and performance poet , songwriter and playwright dedicated to the creative potential of all children and adults will live just as surely , and for just as long , as that of the forebears and contemporaries whose examples he frequently drew on .
These include Shakespeare , Burns , Whitman , Lear , Carroll , Owen , Auden , Brecht , Beckett , Kenneth Patchen , Allen Ginsberg , Joan Littlewood , Lennon and McCartney , the ( black ) blues greats , and above all William Blake .
Mitchell 's mother Kathleen was a Fabian socialist nursery school teacher who " encouraged me to argue " , having lost two of her brothers in the First World War .
In " My Father 's Hand " , Adrian recalls how his father Jock , a research chemist , had also suffered the desolation of the trenches , " Sent , by the King , to hell in a kilt " .
Many of Mitchell 's poems , songs and plays explore and illuminate the extremes of innocence and experience in childhood , etching , shading and colouring in the lines between his own and those of others .

He was badly bullied every day at a prep school in Somerset during the Second World War , and was still pretty traumatised remembering it 65 years later : " I went home one day and said , ' I am not going back , I 'd rather be dead ' .
My mother said , ' Is it the maths ? '
I said , ' No , it 's the torture ' .
I was getting death threats , and told her what had been happening – but not everything , because when you are a victim you feel ashamed " .
Hence his lifelong non-violent opposition to violence , and poems like " My Mother and Father or Why I Began to Hate War " and " Back in the Playground Blues " ( " Heard a deep voice talking , it had that iceberg sound : / It prepares them for Life – but I have never found / Any place in my life that 's worse than the killing ground . " )
After National Service in the RAF , which reinforced his pacifism , and Oxford , where he edited Isis magazine , Mitchell worked as a journalist from 1955 to the mid-1960s , since when his freelance writing and performances went from strength to strength .
He wrote four novels – If You See Me Comin ' ( 1962 ) , The Bodyguard ( 1970 ) , Wartime ( 1973 ) and Man Friday ( 1975 ) – some 50 volumes of poetry , and around twice that number of plays and adaptations for stage and TV .
In the early 1960s he befriended the actor Celia Hewitt , who soon became the prime personal mover of his remaining 47 years .
His collaborations on Peter Brook 's multimedic Royal Shakespeare Company productions of Marat / Sade ( 1964 ) and US ( 1966 ) , were seminal both for his subsequent theatrical efflorescence , and for the further evolution of radical - cultural activism worldwide .
US exposed the way sex gets converted into racist carnage by the war machine : witness this chorus from one of Mitchell 's lyrics : " I had a dream about going / With Ho Chi Minh / But I 'll only be crowing / When I 'm zapping Pekin / I 'll be spreading my jelly /
With a happy song / Cos I 'm screwing all Asia / When I 'm zapping the Cong " .
The show was a clear case of grassroots agit - prop that worked .
Mitchell observed how " People with short memories wonder why British artists ever imagined they could have any influence on the Vietnam war .
At that time there was pressure from the US as well as from intellectuals like Amis and Levin for British troops to be sent to fight alongside the Americans .
If the British anti-war movement did nothing else , it squashed that one flat . "
Of his more than 30 works for the theatre , Pied Piper ran for three years at the National Theatre , while his adaptation of The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe was a much - loved production at the RSC .
Another successful adaptation was Gogol 's The Government Inspector at the National , and he also wrote songs for Peter Hall 's version of Orwell 's Animal Farm .
Along with his friends Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky , Christopher Logue and the Liverpool poets , and the transatlantic beats and rockers , Mitchell functioned as arch - forerunner and pace - setter to the restoration of voice , body , music and heart to verse in our time .
One of his most constantly resonant moments will probably remain his cathartic renditions at the first Poetry Internationale at Royal Albert Hall in 1965 , some of whose highlights were captured for posterity in Peter Whitehead 's film Wholly Communion .
Adrian 's spot was shorter than any of the 18 others that evening , but ( with the possible exception of Ernst Jandl 's sound - poems and Ginsberg 's finale ) elicited the most concerted fellow feeling from around 7,500 auditors .
One of his poems , " You Get Used To It " was an implacable cry against murderous racism " in hell or Alabama " .
The other , " To Whom It May Concern " , with its nursery - rhymey counting - out refrain , was to become an anthem for the continuing " Stop the War " movements : " You put your bombers in , you put your conscience out , / You take the human being and you twist it all about /
So scrub my skin with women / Chain my tongue with whisky / Stuff my nose with garlic /
Coat my eyes with butter /
Fill my ears with silver / Stick my legs with plaster /
Tell me lies about Vietnam . "
It was a classic demonstration of the then new voices ' reinvention , as Mitchell put it , of poetry as what " We do together " – meaning with our fellow poets and , equally , our diverse audiences .
He was probably the British poet I most often featured in the thousands of Live New Departures , Jazz Poetry SuperJam and Poetry Olympics gigs between 1959 and this year , and it came naturally to publish his texts in nearly every issue of my New Departures series and give him pride of place amid the 64 younger bards I anthologised in Children of Albion : Poetry of the Underground in Britain ( 1969 ) .

He was characteristically prescient in an interview quoted in the " Afterwords " to that book , railing against British military conscription because our boys are " going to have to fight a white man 's war , which is what this whole [ Vietnam ] thing is .
And it 's leading up to a global white man 's war , eventually – maybe 20 , 30 years away if we 're lucky . "
Again , his adaptation of Lope de Vega 's Fuente Ovejuna ( 1989 ) set out to raise the still all too fatally under - examined problem that " When people 's backs are rubbished against the wall , some of them are going to take up arms ; when children are being starved or murdered , wives being raped , husbands jailed and tortured for speaking out , they 're liable not only to kill in turn , but can get infected and enjoy nothing better than taking the most bloodthirsty revenge . "
At a 1967 " Legalise Pot " rally in Hyde Park he read a poetic oration ( also quoted in Children of Albion ) of a kind he was to develop more and more charismatically , inflected like his musical stage play Tyger ( 1971 ) and TV play Glad Day ( 1979 ) with his signature neo-Blakean cadences : " These flowers are for love . / Good .
That seems to be what we 're alive for .
/
But is it a vague gas of love which evaporates before it touches another human being /
Or is it a love that works ? /
A love so strong that it can free / A prisoner in Spain or Russia ? /
A love so bright that it can illuminate forever /
The hideous darkness of the African sky ? /
A love so loud that it can shout BE FREE / To the imprisoned states of South America ? . . .
Or is it so small a love /
That it has no more chance of changing the world /
Than a poppy seed planted under the concrete floor /
Of a nuclear power station ? //
It must become a love huge enough /
To tear down all the offices /
Where poverty , hunger , imprisonment and war are planned .
/
It must become a love intelligent and vast enough / To build Jerusalem , a million Jerusalems , / A world more loving / Than our most astonishing visions . "
His Love Songs of World War Three ( 1989 ) synthesise poetry , drama , song and political protest at as high a level as that of any comparable collection I have read .
He sees the Third World War as having begun in August 1945 with the gratuitous atom - bomb demolitions of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , when Harry Truman knew full well that Japan had been suing for surrender months before .
Admittedly many of the lyrics make such volumes resemble hymn books , only fully fulfilled when they are heard and chanted , as his Little Richard update exemplifies : " You so draggy Ms Maggie / You tore this land apart / With your smile like a laser /
And your iceberg heart /
You taught the old and jobless /
What poverty means / You sent the young men killing Irish and Argentines . "
But , as in every one of his books , there are gentler and more multiply communicative pieces , such as " For My Son " , that reward many silent readings , too .
With hard - won but unfailing stamina , Adrian was giving himself to audiences at each event with ever greater intensity the older he got .
And he also got more and more turned on and delighted by turning on and delighting children in particular into both writing and performing verse , songs and drama – their own as well as their elders ' , though not necessarily betters .
I know of no other author ( though perhaps some will now be considering it ? ) who forbade any use of any of their writings to be included in any way in examinations or tests : " I think that tests and exams dominate education and squash it .
They 're an educational experiment that has failed dismally " .
Mitchell frequently celebrated his blood family as well as his extended ones , affirming his sense of kinship with nature and all sentient beings in poem after poem : " Long live the Elephants and Sea Horses / the Humming - Birds and the Gorillas / the Dogs and the Cats and Field - Mice / all the surviving Animals / our innocent sisters and brothers // Long live the Earth , deeper than all our thinking // we have done enough killing // Long live the Man / Long live the Woman / Who use both courage and compassion / Long live their Children " .
Adrian Mitchell wrote his last poem , " My Literary Career So Far " , the day before he died , and it will cheer up anyone who visits his publisher 's website , bloodaxebooks.com – it was intended as a Christmas gift for all the friends , family and animals he loved , and was post - scripted " Merry Crambo and a Hippy New Year with love ( I can't write letters and it's hard to phone as I recover from two months in Pneumonia , so take this new riff with a glass of good wine and drink to Peace in 2009 ) " .
Three more books will be published next year : his final collection of poems , Tell Me Lies : Poems 2005 - 2008 ; his collected poems for children Umpteen Poems ; and Shapeshifters , his versions of Ovid 's Metamorphoses .
May his soul rest in the infinite peace he spent so much expensive energy spreading around .
May his many works go on forever strengthening the resolve and achievements of those who , in Blake 's words , work continuously for the rebirth of wonder and the enduring transcendence of Mental over Corporeal War .

“ I suggest you go and look for your Vespa there , ” said the policewoman , handing me a photocopied map .
It seemed that the scooter I had left parked outside King ’s Cross Station two days earlier , on my way to the Scottish Highlands , had been discovered abandoned and vandalised by a gang .
It now lay in an alleyway in the middle of a large council estate about a mile south of the station .
Thirty minutes later , holding my map like a first - time visitor to London , I was on the edge of the estate .
It was dark and I had accepted that I was going to be mugged or even knifed .
So I put my credit cards and cash into a sock and my watch down my pants .
I clearly was n’t very sensible to be carrying a laptop .
Around the first corner came a gang of children .
Ignoring their gibes , I put my head down and made for the alley .
Apart from being on her side , the Vespa did not look too badly damaged .
Then I picked her up .
The wires and fan had gone .
The handlebars now faced away from the wheel .
The side was smashed in ; the storage box had been ripped off and the contents , including , strangely , my tax return form , removed .
The only things left were two parking tickets , which lay taped to the engine in a mocking fashion .
My scooter had been assaulted savagely and left for dead .
How was I to get her home ?
As I typed the third digit of the AA ’s number into my mobile the battery died .
There was no sign of a payphone , so I headed towards a little cafe under a block of flats .
Inside , seven very large African men were watching Spanish football on an old television .
I asked if they had a phone .
They laughed to each other for a bit before one of them , wearing a suit , responded .
“ Who you wanna call ? ” “ Um , the AA . ” I explained what had happened .
He let me borrow his phone .
“ You can stay here with us .
This place is not safe , there are bad people .
You will be safe in here . ”
I ca n’t remember ever feeling more grateful .
It was a Somali cafe : a fridge with a few fizzy drinks , a sandwich counter with pastries and a tatty Somali tourist board poster .
We discussed football , the US election and the large increase of pirates in Somalia .
My new friends assured me the pirates would not be around much longer now they had been stupid enough to capture a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks and weaponry .
Mohammed , the man in the suit , asked me what I did , so I showed him a copy of Finch ’s Quarterly Review , the luxury publication I co-launched earlier this year .
He began to fill in the subscription form .
They were all bus drivers , he explained , who worked 60 hours a week .
If only I had mentioned needing a tow truck at the start , they could happily have helped get me and the scooter home without charge .
Why , they ran right past the end of my road .
Every now and again a local hoodie would come in and look perplexed to find me sitting there .
But now transport had arrived and my host escorted me back to my scooter .
As the loitering gang made threatening noises and I climbed with relief into the cab , I realised that I had men from a country renowned for its lawlessness and violence to thank for so kindly protecting me .

Economics reporter , BBC News
The US economic is set to continue to shrink in 2009
The sharp slowdown in the US economy will push the federal budget deficit to more than $ 1 trillion , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) says .
The deficit of $ 1.186 trillion for the fiscal year ending on 30 September would be the largest on record .
The projected deficit does not include the extra $ 800 bn spending being planned by US President - elect Barack Obama .
But it highlights the deep economic difficulties facing Mr Obama when he is inaugurated on 20 January .
The CBO says that the slowing economy will lead to the US budget deficit more than doubling from last year 's figure of $ 455 bn .
WHY DEFICITS MATTER
Increased debt costs for government Increased risk of inflation Long - term pressure on dollar Could lead to higher taxes and spending cuts later
And it says that , although the economy may recover by 2010 , the deficit will still be more than $ 700bn , and it projects an accumulated deficit of nearly $ 2 trillion over the next five years .
As a percentage of total economic output , the deficit will be 8.3 % of GDP .
The previous record was 6 % of GDP , set in 1983 .
The major reason for the deficit is the sharp decline in tax revenues , projected to fall by 6.6 % , as well as the increase in spending due to the cost of the recession and the bail - out .
Rescue plan Mr Obama is trying to build a bipartisan consensus on the economy
The size of the budget deficit makes the shape of Mr Obama 's stimulus package more of an issue .
Mr Obama has described America 's economy as " very sick " and has said that the situation is worsening .
And he warned : " Potentially we 've got trillion - dollar deficits for years to come , even with the economic recovery that we are working on at this point . "
He has been urging Congressional leaders to back his stimulus package , which is expected to cost between $ 700bn and $ 800 bn over two years and create up to three million jobs .
The plan would include about $ 300bn in tax cuts , as well as additional spending on infrastructure and aid to the states .
But he has said that he is determined to present plans to bring the long - term budget outlook into balance , and has appointed Nancy Killefer to the new post of governmental performance officer , charged with improving efficiency in government .
He said that in order to rebuild trust in government , it was necessary to " put government on the side of taxpayers and everyday Americans " .
However , Mr Obama is also committed to major reforms of health care , education and the environment , all of which could increase spending .
The US central bank , the Federal Reserve , has already cut interest rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate the economy .
But even former Republican economists , such as Martin Feldstein , who advised Ronald Reagan , now say that a fiscal stimulus is needed because of the dysfunctional credit markets .
" The heavy lifting will have to be done by increased government spending , " he said in a paper to the American Economic Association .
Job losses
Meanwhile , further signs of the weakening of the US economy are likely this week .
Unemployment is rising as the slowdown bites The US Labor Department will release its December employment report on Friday .
Many economists are expecting the jobless figure to rise by 500,000 , bringing the total US job losses for 2008 to about 2.5 million .
Mr Obama will be under pressure to allocate further funds to bail out the auto industry , with GM and Chrysler both having received short - term funding from the government for the next three months .
The automakers say that up to three million jobs could be at risk if the industry goes under .
In addition , the budget deficit does not include some $ 350bn in bail - out funds for the financial sector which have not been spent so far - half of the $ 700 bn package approved in October .
In the longer run , the government also faces sharply higher costs for social security retirement payments and health care , as the Baby Boomer generation retires over the next decade .

Rep. Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , speaks at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , Tuesday , Sept. 2 , 2008 .
Bachmann praises Obama 's win , now
After suggesting that Barack Obama had anti-American views in an exchange three weeks ago with MSNBC host Chris Matthews , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R- Minn . ) told Politico Thursday that she was “ extremely grateful that we have an African - American who has won this year . ”
She called his victory “ a tremendous signal we sent . ”
“ I have not seen the United States as a racist nation , ” said Bachmann , who represents Minnesota ’s 6th Congressional District , in the east - central part of the state .
“ In my district , I do n’t sense racism , and that ’s why I ’m thankful that hopefully this will send a national signal across our country that America is not a nation made up of racists .
...
On the same hand , I hope that the national media will not confuse disagreement with Obama ’s policy positions with being consumed [ by ] racism . ”

Some analysts had written off the linguistically intemperate Bachmann as a casualty of her calamitous “ Hardball ” interview , but she graduated to being a sophomore in the House of Representatives in Tuesday ’s election .
In a telephone interview , Bachman said she was gratified that voters in her district did n’t “ let the media intervene ” in the race , which she ultimately won by three points over Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg .
But in surveying the wreckage to her party that the election wrought , Bachmann was quick to acknowledge that , going forward , “ clearly the views and opinions of conservatives wo n’t be prevailing . ”
As she looks ahead to her next term in Congress , Bachmann , a former U.S. Treasury attorney who now sits on the Financial Services Committee , said she ’s hoping for a spot on the House Ways and Means Committee , the panel charged with writing tax legislation and bills affecting Social Security , Medicare , and other entitlement programs .
Minnesota Rep. Jim Ramstad , a nine - term Republican who is retiring , is currently the only Minnesotan on that committee .
“ My husband and I were Joe the Plumbers , ” said Bachmann , referring to the 42 - employee Christian therapy business she and her husband started , as well as the ubiquitous plumber from Ohio who was elevated to the status of Everyman during the campaign .
“ I think my business background and tax background works very well on Ways and Means . ”
Bachmann said that she had always expected her race to tighten toward the end , but she seemed willing to accept the connection between her gaffe on “ Hardball ” and the closeness of her race .
“ My opponent did not do a stellar job fundraising , ” Bachmann said , noting that it was only after her interview on MSNBC that “ there was money coming from [ the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] and outside money , and that significantly impacted race . ”
Fundraising records show that her challenger raised more than $ 1.3 million in a week .
“ What that did is , it opened the door for a phenomenal outpouring of negative media coverage .
It was the echo chamber of the left media , and it was overwhelming , and that was difficult to overcome that level of vitriol . ”
Bachmann said that aggressive Democratic organizing in her district this year , combined with the “ great resources they had in trying to defeat me in ’ 06 ” made reelection a breakneck climb .
“ I had laid a strong foundation , ” Bachmann said , explaining how she pulled out the win .
“ That is something we knew all along .
For two years I worked enormously hard in the district . ”
“ People knew that I am a serious member of Congress , that I take issues seriously , and that I worked extremely hard .
...
They know I ’m not a nuanced politician that waffles and changes my mind with whatever is popular at the moment . ”
After raising her national profile in cable news interviews about the presidential race and energy issues , Bachmann said her primary focus going forward will be the concerns of her constituents .
She said her party would have to wait to see the specifics of the Democratic agenda , then offer “ positive ” alternatives .
“ It was a decisive win [ for Democrats ] on every level : presidency , House and Senate , ” Bachmann said .
“ Even in Minnesota , we passed a state sales tax increase .
That ’s pretty phenomenal when you think about the difficult environment of the economy .
The fact we could pass a tax increase and have such a strong Democratic showing ... it just shows what an overpowering Democratic year this was , and that ’s why I feel very gratified to have survived the storm . ”
A previous version of this story said that Rep. Jim Ramstad lost his seat in Tuesday ’s election .
He is in fact retiring .
A National Audit Office report however showed that the vehicles will not be ready for another four years and the Ministry of Defence has had to replace them with 13 JCB excavators from America at a cost of £ 6.2 million .
I 'm really happy with the widescreen addition :)
Now I can upload my videos without having to add letterboxes .
The borders around the 4:3 videos are a bit silly though .

Daniel Lynch from Buncrana Town Council with the new kerbstones
A new plastic kerbstone could have the age - old problem of tribal pavement painting finally licked .
Red , white and blue or green , white and orange kerbstones traditionally marked territory in loyalist and nationalist areas of Northern Ireland .
But an eco-friendly kerb could put paid to the practice .
Party colours do n't stick to the paint - resistant plastic ... so the pavements remain staunchly neutral .
The Roads Service in Northern Ireland organised a trial of the new plastic in Lisburn but there has been no decision as yet about using it .
However , 15 councils in the Republic of Ireland have started installing the new kerbs .
In Donegal , the stones went down in the village of Falcarragh this week .
Buncrana is soon to follow suit .
Durakerb chief David O'Neill who has the licence for all of Ireland said his company offered an eco-friendly alternative to concrete stones .
' Recycled '
His kerbstones - made from recycled milk cartons - could easily be cleaned , he said , a street sweeper would easily remove any layer of paint that had been put on .
Unlike their cement cousins , the kerbstones are resistant to oil , petrol and , most importantly in Northern Ireland , paint .
" The paint does not stick to them , the road sweeper would take any paint off , " he explained .
Durakerb has already laid about 30,000 metres in Ireland since they got approval in April .
Fifteen councils in the Republic of Ireland are using them .
In Northern Ireland , Mr O'Neill said a trial run had been carried out by the Roads Service in Lisburn in 2005 .
He said the kerbstone was very light , weighing about 6 kgs , a major advantage compared to the traditional cement stone which is so heavy that they need to be handled by two men .
The plastic is lego like and clicks together .
Its light weight makes it user - friendly .
You can lay about 80 to 100 concrete kerbs a day but you can lay about 80 plastic kerbs in an hour , Mr O'Neill said .
Early last week , I spent the last couple of days before Christmas wrapping up the grades on my Programming Languages course for fall semester .
While grading the final exam , I seemed surprised by something on almost every problem .
Here are a few that stand out :
cons and list
... are not the same .
We spent some time early in the semester looking at how cons allocates a single new cell , and list allocates one cell per argument .
Then we used them in a variety of ways throughout the rest of the course .
After fifteen weeks programming in Scheme , how can so many people confuse them ?
Overuse of accumulator variables
... is endemic to undergraduate students learning to program functionally .
Two of the exam problems asked for straightforward procedures following the structural recursion pattern .
These problems were about as simple examples of structural recursion as you can find :
The largest value in a binary tree is the larger of
the largest value in the left subtree , and
the largest value in the right subtree .
The zip of two lists is a list with a list of their car s consed into the zip of their cdr s.
Many students used an accumulator variable to solve both problems .
Some succeeded , with unnecessarily complex code , and some solutions buckled under the weight of the complexity .
Habits are hard to break .
I have colleagues who tell me that OOP is easy .
I look at their code and say , " yes , but .... "
The code is n't really OO ; it just bears the trappings of classes and methods .
Sequential , imperative programming habits run deep .
An accumulator variable is often a crutch used by a sequential programmer to avoid writing a functional solution .
I see that in my own code occasionally -- the accumulator is as often a code smell as a solution .
At a time when the world is looking to parallel computing in a multicore world , we need to find a way to change the habits programmers form , either by teaching functional programming better or by teaching functional programming sooner so that students form different habits .
Scheme procedure names
... are different than primitive procedure names in most other languages .
They are bound to their values just like every other symbol .
They can be re-bound , either locally or globally , using the same mechanisms used to bind values to any other names .
This means that in this code :
( lambda ( f g ) ( lambda ( x ) (+ ( f x ) ( g x ) ) ) )
the + symbol is a free variable , bound at the top level to the primitive addition operator .
After we talked about this idea several times through the semester , I threw the students a bone on the final with a question that asked students to recognize + symbol as a free variable in a piece of code just like this one .
The bone sailed past most of them .
Bound and free variables
... remain a tough topic for students to grasp , at least from my teaching .
We spent several days in class talking about the idea of bound and free variables , and then writing code that could check a piece of code for bound and free variables .
One of those sessions made a point of pointing out that occurs bound does not equal does not occur free , and that occurs free does not equal does not occur bound .
For one thing , a variable could occur both bound and free in the same piece of code .
For another , it might not occur at all !
Yet when a final exam problem asked students to define an occurs - bound ?
procedure , several of them wrote the one - liner ( not ( occurs - free ? x exp ) ) .
If only they knew how close they were ...
But they wrote that one - liner without understanding .
Syntactic abstraction
... is an idea that befuddles many of my students even after half a semester in which we work with the idea .
Our Quiz 3 is tough for many of the students ; it is often their lowest quiz grade of the course .
In past semesters , though , students seemed to go home after being disappointed with their Quiz 3 score , hit the books , and come away with some understanding .
This semester , several students came to the final exam with the same hole in their knowledge -- including students with two of the top three scores for the course .
This makes me sad and disappoints me .
I can't do much to ensure that students will care enough to hit the books to overcome their disappointments , but I can change what I do .
The next time I teach this course , I will probably have them start by working with for and while constructs in their own favorite languages .
Maybe by stripping away the functional programming wrapping and the Scheme code we use to encounter these ideas , they will feel comfortable in a more familiar context and see the idea of syntactic abstraction to be really quite simple .
Postlude
Am I romanticizing the good old days , when men were men and all students went home and learned it all ?
Maybe a little , but I had a way to ground my nostalgia .
I went back and checked the grades students earned in recent offerings of this course , which had very much the same content and structure .
The highest score this semester was higher than the top score in the two most recent offerings , by 2 - 4 % .
Overall , through , grades lower .
In fact , after the top score , the entire group had shifter down a whole letter grade .
I do n't think the students of the recent past were that much smarter or better prepared than this group , but I do think they had different attitudes and expectations .
One piece of evidence for this conclusion was that this semester there were far more 0s in the final grid of grades .
I even had a couple of 0s on quizzes , where students simply failed to show up .
This is , of course , much worse than simply scoring lower , because one things students can control is whether they do their work and submit assignments .
As I wrote recently , each person must control what he or she can control .
I am not sure how best to get juniors and seniors in college to to adopt this mindset , but maybe I 'll need to bring Twyla Tharp -- or Bobby Knight -- into my classroom .
The method , used at all levels of American football , remains virtually unchanged and unnoticed after 100 years , taking place beyond the scope of the television camera and the focus of the fans until a precise measurement is needed .
Even at this time of year , in the midst of the college bowl season and the start of the N.F.L. playoffs , little thought is given to how the 10 - yard increments are measured in the country ’s most popular sport .
On a first down , one end of the chains is placed along the sideline by one member of the seven - person chain gang — hired for game - day duty by the home teams — six feet from the field , supposedly even with the front tip of a football that will be snapped at least 25 yards away .
When a play ends , an official estimates the spot , usually marking it with a foot and tossing the ball to another official to set for the next play .
When a first down is too close to call , the chains are trotted onto the field .
Sometimes the drive continues by an inch .
Sometimes it ends by less .
“ There must be a better way , ” said Pat Summerall , the longtime N.F.L. player and broadcaster .
“ Because games are decided , careers are decided , on those measurements . ”
There are two sides to the equation .
The spot of the ball , now reviewable under the N.F.L. ’s replay rules , is often a subject of great consternation .
Rare is the debate over whether the chains , not the ball , are in the wrong place .
But every couple of years an inventor patents an alternative to the chains intriguing enough to warrant an audience with the N.F.L. ’s competition committee , which debates rules changes .
You look through the telescope .
Blink .
Shake your head and look again .
The planet you expected to see in the eyepiece is not the one that 's actually there .
Too much eggnog ?
No , it 's just Saturn 's crazy Christmas tilt .
All year long , the rings of Saturn have been tilting toward Earth and now they are almost perfectly edge - on .
The opening angle is a paper - thin 0.8o .
Viewed from the side , the normally wide and bright rings have become a shadowy line bisecting Saturn 's two hemispheres - - a scene of rare beauty .
Amateur astronomer Efrain Morales Rivera of Aguadilla , Puerto Rico , has been monitoring Saturn and he created this composite image to show how the geometry has changed ( see image above ) .
Astronomers call the phenomenon a " ring plane crossing . "
As Saturn goes around the sun , it periodically ( once every 14 to 15 years ) turns its rings edge - on to Earth .
Because the rings are so thin , they can actually disappear when viewed through a backyard telescope .
At the precise moment of crossing , Saturn undergoes a startling metamorphosis .
The ringed planet becomes a lonely ball of gas , almost unrecognizable : Hubble photo .
( Historical note : Shortly after Galileo discovered Saturn 's rings in 1610 , they disappeared in precisely this fashion .
Galileo did n't understand the nature of the rings and the vanishing act confused him mightily .
Nevertheless , his physical intuition prevailed .
" They 'll be back , " he predicted , and without ever knowing why , he was correct . )
We 're not quite there yet .
The opening angle wo n't be precisely 0o until Sept. 4 , 2009 .
Do n't bother marking your calendar , though .
Saturn will be so close to the sun , no one will be able to see the rings wink out .
The best time to look is now .
The 0.8o opening angle of Christmas 2008 is the minimum for some time to come .
In January 2009 the rings begin to open up again , a temporary reversal caused by the orbital motions of Earth and Saturn .
By the time narrowing resumes in summer 2009 , Saturn will be approaching the sun ; looking through a telescope then could actually be dangerous .
The next ring plane crossing that 's easy to watch wo n't come until 2038 .
So wake up before sunrise on Dec. 25th , point your telescope at the golden " star " in Leo , and behold Saturn 's crazy Christmas tilt : sky map .

Baghdad , Iraq Going Solar With Help From the US Army
January 28th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Say what you will about the occupation of Iraq — you ca n’t fault the US Army for neglecting to equip the country with renewable energy .
In the northwest section of Baghdad alone , US forces are conducting nearly two dozen solar projects in an attempt to alleviate Iraq ’s electricity crisis .
Baghdad ’s Amariyah clinic , for example , recently received a $ 165,000 solar installation .
Previously , the clinic received only 12 hours of electricity each day , and many vaccines were spoiled .
While the clinic now has enough power only for the essentials , Amariyah ’s solar installation will save $ 2 million over 25 years .
The US military has also purchased over 1,000 bulletproof solar - powered streetlights for the city , and is planning similar installations in Fallouja and Ramadi .
All in all , US forces will spent a cool $ 6 million on solar projects in northwest Baghdad .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
This past Sunday I was relaxing at the water ’s edge of a local beach when a young boy ran full speed right by me and into the shallow surf .
He continuously hopped up and down as he was running forward , kicking his little legs in the air and across the surface of the water before inevitably falling face - first into the waves .
He got back up and repeated this act several times , each time with more determination than the previous attempt .
It became obvious that he was trying to run across the surface of the water .
I could n’t help but to laugh .
His combined levels of determination and exertion were priceless .
After several attempts , he noticed my laughter and walked over to me .
“ What ’s so funny ? ” he asked .
“ You remind me of me , and it makes me smile . ” I said .
“ Do you know how to walk on water ? ” he asked .
“ Like a superhero ? ”
“ Well , I think I can help you out . ” I said .
“ Let me give you a few pointers . ”
Curious , the boy sat down on the sand next to me .
His mother scurried over , worried … but I reassured her that her son was n’t bothering me .
Relieved , perhaps , to have her son sitting safely on the sand instead of flying face - first through the air , she went back to her beach chair 20 feet away and continued a conversation with another lady .
“ So , you want to walk on water , eh ? ” I asked .
He nodded his head anxiously .
A Rough Summary of What I Told Him
Make sure you were born to walk on water .
–
You must follow your heart , and be who you were born to be .
Some of us were born to be musicians … to communicate intricate thoughts and rousing feelings with the strings of a guitar .
Some of us were born to be poets … to touch people ’s hearts with exquisite prose .
Some of us were born to be entrepreneurs … to create growth and opportunity where others saw rubbish .
And still , some of us were born to walk on water … to invent the capability of doing so .
If you ’re going to walk on water , you better feel it in every fiber of your being .
You better be born to do it !
Decide that nothing can stop you .
– Being born to walk on water is n’t enough by itself .
We must each decide to accept our calling .
Unfortunately , most of us make excuses instead .
“ But I might drown trying , ” we say .
Or , “ But I have a family to think about first . ”
Walking on water , or doing anything that has n’t been done before , requires absolute , unconditional dedication .
The only person who can control your level of dedication is you .
If you ’re serious about walking on water , you must decide that nothing … not gravity , not a group of naysayers , NOTHING … can stop you !
Work on it for real .
–
While many of us decide at some point during the course of our lives that we want to answer our calling … to accomplish our own version of walking on water , only an astute few of us actually work on it .
By “ working on it ” , I mean truly devoting oneself to the end result .
The rest of us never act on our decision .
Or , at best , we pretend to act on it by putting forth an uninspired , half - ass effort .
But to truly walk on water , you ’ll have to study physics , rheology , hydrophobic substances , etc … and then you ’ll have to define and redefine next - generation theories and complex hypotheses , which must be tested relentlessly .
When the tests fail , you must be ready to edit your theories and test them again .
This kind of work , the real kind , is precisely what enables us to make the impossible possible .
Let the whole world know what you ’re up to .
–
When you ’re trying to walk on water , or do anything that nobody else has done before , life can get lonely pretty quickly .
To keep your motivation thriving , it ’s important to let others know that you ’re attempting to defeat the formerly impossible .
Do n’t be shy !
Let the whole world know that you ’re trying to walk on water .
No doubt , it ’ll place a bit of extra pressure on your back , and you ’ll almost certainly hear some laughter in the crowd .
But this kind of pressure fuels motivation , which is exactly what you ’ll need to accomplish such a colossal undertaking .
And when you finally do succeed , the last bit of laughter heard will be your own .
Value the people who value your ambitions .
–
When most people hear about your “ mission impossible ” aspirations , their natural reaction may be to roll their eyes , call you crazy , and tell you to quit being foolish .
But fortunately , the world is also inhabited by pioneers and believers who see the value in your dreams .
These people understand that achieving the formerly impossible is one of the greatest gifts human beings possess .
They ’ll likely give you tips , bits of assistance , and the extra push you need to succeed .
These are extraordinary people , and you ’ll want to surround yourself with them , because they will ultimately assist you over the hurdles and across the surface of the water .
Think of them as an influential , personal support team .
Without them , walking on water will be a far more difficult feat , if not completely impossible .
Ignore the negative naysayers .
–
No matter how much progress you make , there will always be the people who insist that walking on water is impossible , simply because it has n’t been done before .
Or they may incessantly suggest that the idea as a whole is utterly ridiculous because nobody really cares about walking on water anyways .
When you come across these people , do n’t try to reason with them .
Instead , forget that they exist .
They will only waste your time and energy .
Prepare yourself for the pain .
–
Even though you ’re no longer mindlessly running face - first into the oncoming ocean surf , but instead forming complex theories based on the studies of rheology and fluid viscosity , it does n’t mean you wo n’t experience your fair share of pain .
You ’re in the business of walking on water , of doing something that has never been done before .
You ’ll likely get a waterlogged , lungful of water on a regular basis .
But the pain will seem like a small price to pay when you become the first person to jog across the rapids of the Mississippi .
Enjoy the pain of your greatest challenge .
– Superheroes are n’t real .
In real life nobody has ever walked on water .
But lots of people have achieved formerly impossible feats , and continue to enjoy the possibilities of new challenges .
These people will all tell you there ’s nothing more gratifying than the thrill of your greatest challenge .
The inherent pains along the way are simply mile markers on your trip to the finish line .
When you finally do finish , you may actually find yourself missing the daily grind .
Ultimately , you ’ll realize that pleasure and pain can be one and the same .
Never give up !
Never quit ! –
The reason nobody has walked on water is n’t because people have n’t tried .
Remember , you just tried several times in a row , and I ’m sure many others have too .
The reason nobody has succeeded is , simply , that within the scope of modern science and physics , it ’s currently impossible .
But this does n’t mean that with your help it wo n’t become possible in the future .
If you were born to do it and truly dedicate yourself to the end result , anything , including walking on water , is entirely possible !
Just a Chance
When we were done talking , the young boy got up and ran back over to his mother .
He pointed over to me and I smiled and waved back .
Then he said to her , “ Mommy , mommy !
That guy just taught me how to walk on water ! ”
A few moments later she walked over to scold me for supposedly giving out reckless advice .
She told me I was giving her son a false sense of hope .
I told her all I was giving him was a chance .
Smoke contains toxins damaging to health Many people are unaware that even smoking away from babies or pregnant women presents a risk , according to US research .
Poisons in cigarette smoke can linger on fabrics or hair , but a survey of 1,500 households found that fewer than half of smokers knew this .
Only a quarter had strict rules about not smoking in the house , according to the report in the journal Pediatrics .
UK baby charity Tommy 's said it was vital that pregnant women were alerted .
When you smoke - any place - toxic particulate matter from tobacco smoke gets into your hair and clothing .
Professor Jonathan Winickoff
Massachusetts General Hospital
There is plenty of evidence that " second - hand " smoke - breathed when you are in the same room as someone smoking - can be harmful , particularly to children , and some parents adopt a strategy of never smoking in their child 's presence .
However , Professor Jonathan Winickoff , from Massachusetts General Hospital , said this would not offer complete protection .
Toxic particles in cigarette smoke can remain on nearby surfaces , as well as the hair and clothing of the smoker , long after the cigarette has been put out , and small children are susceptible because they are likely to breathe in close proximity , or even lick and suck them .
Other studies have linked this exposure to learning problems in children .
Breastfeeding mothers who smoke also pass toxins on to their baby in their milk , he said .
His team surveyed more than 1,500 households , asking smokers and non-smokers about their attitudes .
They found that while 95 % of non-smokers and 85 % of smokers agreed that direct inhalation of second - hand smoke was harmful to children , just 65 % of non-smokers , and 43 % of smokers believed the same for " third - hand " smoke .
Just 26.7 % of households which included a smoker had strict rules about not smoking in the home .
Complication risk Professor Winickoff said : " The dangers of third - hand smoke are very real - when you smoke - any place - toxic particulate matter from tobacco smoke gets into your hair and clothing . "
Professor Andrew Shennan , from Tommy's , said the results had " significant implications " , particularly for pregnant women , who may have stopped smoking themselves , but are still in contact with others that do .
" It is vital that women are made aware of the possible risks associated with third hand smoke , and alert those around them of the impact it could potentially have on the health of their unborn baby .
" The chemicals in cigarettes are known to significantly increase the risk of serious pregnancy complications . "

California ’s failure to check the criminal backgrounds of health professionals extends well beyond nurses , encompassing tens of thousands of doctors , dentists , psychiatric technicians and therapists .
The Times reported this fall that regulators had not vetted about 195,000 of the state ’s registered and vocational nurses , exposing patients to caregivers with histories of violence , addiction , predatory behavior or corruption .
Prompted by those articles , the state Department of Consumer Affairs has identified 104,000 more professionals from all levels of medical care to add to that tally .
All told , the agency now estimates that close to a third of the state ’s 937,100 licensed healthcare workers have not been screened through fingerprint checks .

Licensing boards maintain inconsistent rules about who must be fingerprinted and when .
Fingerprints are the primary tool that regulators can use to root out convictions and allow law enforcement agencies to automatically alert regulators if a licensee has ever been arrested .
Those who have not been fingerprinted include almost three - quarters of psychiatric technicians ; nearly half of family therapists , social workers and dentists ; and 12 % of physicians .
“ We depend on the state of California . . . to screen out those who are incompetent or impaired or dishonest or otherwise unqualified , ” said Julianne D’Angelo Fellmeth , administrative director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego .
“ If the state does n’t do that for whatever reason , we ’re all in trouble . ”
After the reports by The Times , which collaborated with the investigative news organization ProPublica , the state Department of Consumer Affairs moved quickly .

Agency Director Carrie Lopez ordered the 20 health - related boards and bureaus she oversees , including the Medical Board of California , to collect fingerprints from any licensee who had not provided them .
She also told the agencies to begin asking licensees whether they had been convicted of a crime since their last renewal .
Other states ’ boards , including those in Arizona and Texas , already do that .
Lopez urged regulators to more quickly pursue professionals who may pose a danger to the public .
“ I have and fully intend to make use of all resources to ensure that we remove threats to the public safety and well - being of Californians , ” Lopez said in a written statement .

The Board of Registered Nursing received expedited approval from the state Office of Administrative Law last month to collect fingerprints from the 147,000 nurses licensed before 1990 .
The board estimated that the new fingerprinting requirement will cost more than $ 4 million to implement over the first three years and $ 1.7 million annually thereafter .
In seeking the requirement , nursing board officials wrote that The Times ’ “ articles packaged information in a different way and in a different light than the board had done in the past .
Moreover , these articles raised the issue with respect to specific licensees with notable criminal histories that the board had never disciplined . ”
The Bureau of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians plans to seek a fast - track review for proposed fingerprint regulations .
It also has sought to discipline some of those mentioned in The Times ’ articles , including Cynthia Knott , convicted in 2007 for selling drugs that had been stolen from her job at the Fresno County Jail to an undercover investigator .
The consumer affairs department , which oversees all licensed professionals in the state , said it is focusing on healthcare first but intends to expand fingerprinting to other boards as well , including those that govern auto repair and contractors .
Advertisement
Fingerprinting requirements originally were adopted because boards believed that some crimes could reflect poorly on a licensee ’s character , competence or ability to safely perform the job .
But gathering missing fingerprints has not been a priority .
The Dental Bureau of California , for example , started requiring fingerprints in 1986 but has almost none on file for any dentist licensed before then -- some 16,000 people , said Cathleen Poncabare , the board ’s executive officer .
The board knows about some criminal convictions through complaints or direct contact with law enforcement , but “ without the fingerprints , we do n’t know ” what else may be out there , she said .
Advertisement
The new background checks will probably flag such cases as that of Kiyoshi Fukuda , a dentist from Santa Rosa .
Licensed in 1969 , he has a clear record , according to the bureau ’s website .
Yet reporters found that he is a registered sex offender , listed on the state ’s Megan ’s Law website .
Fukuda , 63 , was convicted in 1990 of two counts of oral copulation on a child under 16 .
In an interview , Fukuda said he had disclosed his conviction to the board when he renewed his license years ago and never heard anything back .
He closed his private practice in January and said he recently sent a request to the dental board to cancel his license .

The conviction “ did not have anything to do with my office , my profession or anything .
It was something that was on the private side .
But should they have checked ?
My guess would be yes .
. . .
I ’ve done everything since then to try to atone for this , ” he said .
Poncabare , who has been in her post about six months , said she could n’t explain why the bureau did not seek fingerprints from every dentist sooner .
“ It ’s perplexing to me that it was never done , ” she said .
Fingerprinting is not always the issue .
Some licensing boards have known about professionals ’ convictions or pending charges for years but still have not acted .

Michael Marcus , a dentist from San Jose , for example , was arrested in July 2005 for allegedly touching a 17 - year - old patient ’s breasts and making inappropriate comments to her during an exam .
Prosecutors charged him with misdemeanor sexual battery against three patients , and he is set to stand trial next month .
Although the dental board cooperated in the investigation , Marcus continues to practice without restriction , and the board ’s website lists only a previous disciplinary action against him from 1996 .
In that case , the dental board suspended him for 30 days and placed him on five years ’ probation for fondling the breasts of three patients .
In an interview , Marcus said the criminal charges are not true and should be dealt with by the courts before any action is taken by the dental board .
A spokesman for the Department of Consumer Affairs said the board was aware of the case but could not comment on it .
Laura Moskowitz , a staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project in Oakland , said the state should proceed with caution as it gathers arrest and conviction information on health professionals .
The law requires proof that the convictions are “ substantially related ” to the qualifications and duties of the job , she said .
Advertisement
“ There are thousands and thousands of people who may have had something happen in the past , and it ’s not reflective of who they are today and the kind of work they can perform , ” she said .
The Times and ProPublica have found more than 115 recent cases involving registered nurses and an additional 27 cases among vocational nurses in which the state did n’t seek to pull or restrict their licenses until they had racked up three or more convictions .
Many of the convictions involved off - the - job incidents , such as driving while intoxicated , stealing and taking drugs , or petty thefts .
But the chaos and impairment often affected the nurses ’ ability to care for patients , sometimes in critical - care settings .
Escondido nurse Mary Eileen Cahill - Therrien was convicted three times in 2000 and 2001 , of vandalism , driving under the influence and disturbing the peace .
The registered nursing board failed to step in before she showed up for a home - care assignment at a patient ’s house seemingly drunk and refusing to wash her hands .
According to a later ruling by an administrative law judge , she also left the patient ’s catheter in too long and had to be asked to leave .
Advertisement
Weeks later , Cahill - Therrien was fired from a different hospital job after she appeared to be drunk and refused to take a drug and alcohol screening test .
Even after the board filed an accusation against her , she was able to get work at another hospital .
She was fired after showing up drunk there too , the judge wrote .
Her license was revoked in 2007 .
Cahill - Therrien could not be reached for comment .
Her former attorney declined to discuss her case , citing attorney - client confidentiality .
Linda
Whitney , chief of legislation for the medical board , which oversees about 125,000 physicians , said her board plans to seek prints from up to 15,000 physicians licensed before 1968 , who have never provided them .
But , she said , her board has long used other methods to snag convictions among doctors .
“ Could something slip through the cracks ?
Absolutely , ” she said .
“ There could be a doctor licensed in 1965 that could be convicted next week and we may never hear about it .
. . . For consumer protection , which is our No. 1 mission , we do n’t want even one to slip through the cracks . ”

Graphics reporting by Charles Ornstein
WITH billions of federal dollars flowing to General Motors , and with the incoming administration likely to discover that still more assistance is required , we can expect renewed calls for G.M. ’s chief executive , Rick Wagoner , to lose his job as the price of failure .
This view presupposes that Mr. Wagoner has not been willing to bring G.M. into line with the new global reality , that he has not designed cars Americans want to buy and that the company is a “ dinosaur , ” to quote Senator Richard C. Shelby , Republican of Alabama .
In reality , Mr. Wagoner has presided over the most sweeping transformation of G.M. since the 1920s .
He has reversed management ’s long practice of meekly going along with the demands of the United Auto Workers , notably with a deal to transfer health care costs to a union - controlled trust over the next two years .
During his tenure , as president , then as chief executive , Mr. Wagoner also put in place a previously unthinkable two - tier wage system to reduce the company ’s average cost per worker ; halved the company ’s unionized work force in the United States through layoffs and plant closures ; spun off Delphi Corporation , its largest parts supplier ; and sold controlling interest of GMAC , its financing arm .
A decade ago , suggesting that Mr. Wagoner attempt these restructuring goals would have been ridiculed as unrealistic .
But these moves have largely succeeded and by 2010 should strip $ 5,000 from the cost of every G.M. vehicle .
Aging O
The presidency is no fountain of youth .
Use the arrows above to age president - elect Barack Obama
1992
2000
2000
2008
“ When I started this campaign , everybody called me a young man — they ’re not calling me that anymore , ” Barack Obama remarked in August on the campaign trail .
“ I ’m getting gray hair — running for president will age you quick . ”
If Obama thought campaigning for president had grayed his mane at warp speed , just wait till he starts working in the Oval Office .
“ The reality of it is that he will probably age 20 years in the first term , ” says Deirdre Hogan , of the Toronto - based Aprilage Development Inc. , whose aging software has been used in hospitals and science museums for almost a decade .
Cases in point : Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
On their respective inaugurations , Presidents 42 and 43 were youthful - looking baby boomers , nary a gray hair or wrinkle to be seen .
Two terms later , both Clinton and Bush looked drastically grayer and more careworn .
You can tell by their before - and - after pictures , seen here .
With that in mind , we asked Aprilage to predict how the 47 - year - old Obama might look after four and eight years in the White House .
Using its database of 7,000 photographs of people of diverse ages , ethnicities , and lifestyle habits , Aprilage identified images of men physically comparable to Obama and then applied an average of these attributes to a photograph of the president - elect .
The pictures , as you can see , speak for themselves .
So , what is it about the U.S. presidency that seems to age its occupant in dog years ?
“ His job is so much harder , ” says Dr. Kevin R. Lough? lin , a presidential health expert .
“ The whole world rests on his decisions . ”
Medically , there ’s a relationship between stress and aging , says Dr. Simon S. Yoo , assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology at Northwestern ’s School of Medicine .
Long - term stress can damage the melanocytes , pigment - producing cells in the hair and skin , causing age spots and gray hair .
Moreover , chronic stress elevates the cortisol level in the body , which pulls the blood away from the skin , making it look more sallow .
While there ’s a link between stress and premature aging , there is n’t necessarily a proven correlation between the American presidency and accelerated aging .
It may just be in the eye of the beholder .
Says Yoo : “ Presidents are constantly in the public eye , so you notice it more . ”

Update :
This is a sick day / personal day / site issues / Thanksgiving Eve look back at the Busted Coverage archives .
This post was originally published Jan. 21 , 2009 .
We miss the “ Legendary Neckbeard Kyle Orton . ”
He had to go and grow up .
Get married .
Quit hitting the bars .
No more pounding Jack straight from the bottle .
He ’s now a Chicago QB who will likely see a free agent brought in to steal his position .
All we are left with are the memories ( and these pictures ) of the good days from 2005 - early 2008 .
Those years were filled with nights passed out in some random bed with chicks taunting the million - dollar slinger after another evening of getting tanked .
We ’re calling this one “ 2 Girls .
No Cups . 1 Passed Out Kyle Orton . ”
Get a quick glimpse of the legend at work .
Here is the setup on this one .
Orton , supposedly drinking by himself at a random bar , runs into these chicks after obviously hitting the bar early and often .
He dresses up for the evening in one of his Doors shirts from the massive collection of band threads the legend owns .
The ladies , infatuated by star power such as this , proceed to somehow lead Orton back to someone ’s house where a bed awaits .
There , the power of the alcohol takes over .
Orton crashes .
The ladies attack .
Just another night in the past life of the Neckbeard .
We ’ve always heard of athletes having these bedroom trysts but never actually thought they ’d pass out before the good stuff .
Then again , Orton is a machine built from a different type of steel .
Maybe this was a strategic play and he went on to have torrid sex with these two .
The smart bet is he never woke up until the sweet smell of kegs , eggs and bacon crossed his nose .
The University of Twente , located in the city of Enschede in The Netherlands , has a new building with 87 apartments for students .
The building is nine stories high , and features a climbing wall on one side .
The building was designed by Arons and Gelauff Architects .

The high rise at the Campagneplein location lies in the middle of the Residential and Social Centre on the Boulevard facilities street .
The project stands between the Bastille by Piet Blom and the Herman Haan sport centre .
Just like the Calslaan project , this building is also on a former parking lot .
The building is nine stories high on the sport fields ’ side .
On the Boulevard side , the building fits the small - scale character of this pedestrian street with two building layers .
The supermarket and the hairdresser are on this side .
On the first floor , the dwellings are situated round a communal roof terrace .
The façade facing the sport centre is fitted out as a climbing wall .
These two student dormitories – a courtyard building in the forest and a highrise with a climbing wall – are located on the campus of Enschede university in the east of the Netherlands .
Thanks to a functional mix of housing , study and leisure and the arrangement of the buildings as solitaires in the landscape , the university compound from the 1950ies is one of the few real campuses in the Netherlands .
According to a new masterplan , the dorms were originally meant to be built next to a new straight aisle through the forest .
In order to avoid this interference with the landscape , we looked for alternative sites and found two more or less abandoned parking lots in strategic locations .
The highrise at Campagneplein also stands on a former parking lot and borders on a sports field in the south .
The sports theme has been literally integrated into the architecture , in the form of a 30 metre high climbing wall .
In this case , the floor plans as well as the building envelope were already determined by the client .
From these starting points , we generated a 9 - storey building next to the sports field , connecting to a 1 - storey building housing a supermarket and some commercial spaces .
On the north side , there ’s an additional row of student studios on top of the low building , whose roof serves as a collective garden .
The façade materials are the same as for the courtyard building in the forest : juicy red glass panels and dark brick .
The climbing wall with 2500 grips is the second highest in the Netherlands and forms the eyecatcher of the otherwise rather straight - forward building .
It was a gift from the client to the inhabitants of the campus , because the university of Enschede has a very active and successful mountaineering club – however paradoxical that may sound in the flat Netherlands .
As a climber in the Netherlands , one anyway has to resort to artificially created training spots , so why not combine architecture and climbing wall ?
The folds of the wall look like the urban abstraction of a mountain and give the building a sculptural appearance .
Seen from the sports field , it seems to be bending its hip .
The brick frame around the glass panel façade emphasizes this impression and creates a logo - like shape .
The western wall of the low - rise building is also covered in grips and can be used for „ bouldering “ .
The climbing wall instills a fun factor into the building and therefore forms a contrast to the chique red glass façade .
As motive for a sculptural deformation , it also gives the highrise character and recognizability .

( CNN ) --
One of the planet 's most fragile and pristine ecosystems sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels .
Melting polar ice is making the Arctic more accessible to shipping and other industry .
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil , 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the Arctic Circle .
And the fight over who owns those resources may turn out to be the most important territorial dispute of this century .
Russia , Canada , the United States , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Iceland and Finland all have a stake in the Arctic 's icy real estate .
But both the exploration , and the likely drilling at the top of the Earth , have scientists deeply concerned .
One reason : Global warming has hit the Arctic 's plant and animal life ferociously .
The stresses and possible pollution caused by drilling only increase the risks .
" The ecosystem that is there has been protected by thousands of years of ice .
Even if there was no territorial dispute , the ice is going away , " said oceanographer David Carlson , director of the International Polar Year 's Program Office .
The International Polar Year ( http://www.ipy.org/) is a global scientific study focused on the Arctic and the Antarctic from March 2007 to March 2009 .
Arctic sea ice is usually 1 to 3 meters , or as much as 9 feet , thick .
It grows during autumn and winter and shrinks in spring and summer .
Scientists have monitored sea ice conditions for 50 years .
The disappearance of the ice in the past decade is astounding , climate scientists say .
" We 've been seeing a retreat year after year , " said Marika Holland , an oceanographer with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado .
" The sea ice loss we observed in the summer of 2007 was shocking . "
Soon there may be no sea ice anywhere in the Arctic during some months of the year .
Although environmentalists are concerned by this melting trend , shipping and energy companies are salivating at the prospect of smaller ice caps , which makes Arctic drilling and commerce easier .
Cargo ships may be able to travel from Asia to North America more cheaply and efficiently , for example .

Diplomats , politicians and oil company executives are feuding over who owns what under the ice .
But the real power players might be the geologists who evaluate undersea land formations .
Unlike Antarctica , which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims , there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the Arctic .
So questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes , let alone who bears responsibility for environmental damage , are somewhat murky .
According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores .
Some countries with a stake in the Arctic 's riches are trying to extend that zone , some in more brazen ways than others .
In a showy technological display August 2 , 2007 , a Russian submarine planted an underwater flag 14,000 feet ( 4,200 meters ) below the North Pole .
Russian scientists are keen on proving that the seabed below the North Pole is part of the Eurasian continental shelf , an area called the Lomonosov Ridge .
If that 's the case , the region would be under Russian control .
Moscow argued before a United Nations commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory .
But the U.N. asked for more evidence .
Meanwhile , dueling geologists elsewhere are looking for land formations with a different provenance .
Danish scientists are trying to prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to Greenland , and Canadian scientists are looking for links between the ridge and Ellesmere Island , a Canadian territory .
Some territorial questions are not in dispute , however .
" Most of the estimated undiscovered resources are in areas with agreed - upon territorial boundaries , " said Don Gautier , research geologist at the USGS .
" Exceptions are the East Barents Basins , where Russia and Norway are involved in bilateral discussions of the offshore boundary .
Another exception is the Alaska . / Canada boundary offshore , which is also subject to bilateral discussions between U.S. and Canada , " he said .
The United States has unrestricted access to Arctic resources in northern Alaska .
But the Bush administration 's sale of oil drilling rights in prime polar bear habitat has upset environmentalists , who fear drilling 's impact on the threatened species .

Security expert John Pike , director of GlobalSecurity.org , thinks power in the Arctic may lie with whoever has the best physical access to this forbidding region .
" The Russians have got a half - dozen icebreakers .
Americans have a pair of icebreakers , but they are old and worn out , " Pike said .
And of course , much of countries ' access to the Arctic will come down to money .
" Building a ship to operate in a foot of ice is no big deal .
Building an icebreaker that can get through 2 yards of ice , now you 're talking serious icebreaking .
The Russians can get through 2 yards of ice without breaking a sweat , " Pike said .
Ultimately , questions about what is drilled for in the Arctic , and by whom , will depend on the global economy .
Recovering oil from a forbidding frozen wilderness makes sense when it 's selling for $ 150 a barrel , but not so when it is at $ 40 a barrel .

The surge in local and state mandates to derive ever - increasing amounts of energy from “ clean ” sources appears to be spurring a return to the nation ’s rivers and other waterways for power .
In the short term , this translates into upgrades and expansions of existing hydroelectric plants , or adding turbines to dams that were not designed to produce electricity with turbines .
From The Associated Press on Monday :
American Municipal Power - Ohio is a nonprofit wholesale power supplier for 123 municipal systems in Ohio , Kentucky , Pennsylvania , Virginia , West Virginia and Michigan .
It already owns a hydro plant on the Ohio River and is involved in developing five more . …
There are 20 navigation and flood control dams on the Ohio River along its 981 miles from Pittsburgh to Cairo , Ill .
Hydro plants at six of the dams already are producing electricity , with a generating capacity of more than 300 megawatts ; four more that have been licensed would double that perhaps be on line in 2013 .
In October , USA Today called the uptick in hydropower licensing and construction , “ the biggest hydropower expansion since the 1980s .
Utilities are proposing more than 70 projects that would boost U.S. hydroelectric capacity by at least 11,000 megawatts , or 11 percent , over the next decade . ”
Currently , conventional hydropower accounts for about 7 percent of electricity generation in the United States , according to the Energy Information Administration .
Still , the “ clean ” credentials of hydropower have long been in dispute .
While the particulate and greenhouse gas emissions of a typical hydropower facility tend to be far lower than those of comparably sized fossil fuel - based plants , there are demonstrable environmental trade - offs — including effects on fish and other wildlife — that have put power companies and conservationists at odds .
The release of methane , too — a potent greenhouse gas — when areas behind a dam are flooded and left to decay , has also tarnished hydropower ’s image .
But other methods for harnessing energy from rivers are continually being explored and developed — including riverbed turbines like those recently tested in the East River , often called kinetic hydropower .
Here , the ebb and flow of a rivers tides spin underwater turbines in much the same way wind turns the giant rotors on land - based turbines .
A separate and potentially more invasive form of tidal energy capture involves sequestering water in lagoons and other basins during high tides , and then distilling it back through a system of turbines as the tide recedes .
Earlier this year , Britain started a two - year feasibility study into both technologies for potential deployment at Bristol Channel .
Smaller “ run - of - river ” projects , which make use of gravity by channeling the natural downward flow of water from highlands to lower lying areas without the need for dams or reservoirs , are also gaining renewed interest .
Two such projects , costing roughly $ 3.4 billion , have been proposed in Canada .
General Electric ’s financial - services unit , along with Plutonic Power of Vancouver , submitted bids to help build two facilities last week .
Another technology appearing on the horizon , which has the potential to take advantage of much slower currents , involves a system of cylinders inspired by the way fish swim .
From Britain ’s Guardian newspaper on Monday :
As water flows past , the cylinder creates vortices , which push and pull the cylinder up and down .
The mechanical energy in the vibrations is then converted into electricity .
Cylinders arranged over a cubic metre of the sea or river bed in a flow of three knots can produce 51 watts .
This is more efficient than similar - sized turbines or wave generators , and the amount of power produced can increase sharply if the flow is faster or if more cylinders are added .
A “ field ” of cylinders built on the sea bed over a 1 km by 1.5 km area , and the height of a two - storey house , with a flow of just three knots , could generate enough power for around 100,000 homes .
Just a few of the cylinders , stacked in a short ladder , could power an anchored ship or a lighthouse .
Systems could be sited on river beds or suspended in the ocean .
The scientists behind the technology , which has been developed in research funded by the U.S. government , say [ it ] … would require up to 50 times less ocean acreage than wave power generation .
Questions of scalability for any of these dam alternatives , of course — as well as the environmental trade - offs — remain to be worked out .
The mystery of why ancient South American peoples who created the mysterious Nazca Lines also collected human heads as trophies has long puzzled scholars who theorize the heads may have been used in fertility rites , taken from enemies in battle or associated with ancestor veneration .
A recent study using specimens from Chicago 's Field Museum throws new light on the matter by establishing that trophy heads came from people who lived in the same place and were part of the same culture as those who collected them .
These people lived 2,000 to 1,500 years ago .
Archaeologists determined that the severed heads were trophies because holes were made in the skulls allowing the heads to be suspended from woven cords .
A debate has been raging for the past 100 years over their meaning .
Trophy heads in the Field collection were gathered from the Nazca Drainage of the arid southern Peruvian coast 80 years ago by noted American anthropologist Alfred Louis Kroeber ( 1876-1960 ) .
He also collected remains of some people buried normally .
In some cases , the trophy heads were buried with their collectors .
Because Nazca is among the driest places on Earth , said Ryan Williams , a Field Museum curator , the specimens Kroeber collected were very well preserved .
The dead bodies were naturally mummified and some trophy heads still had their hair as well as the display cords attached to the skull .
The museum also has several examples of Nazca pottery illustrated with trophy heads ; some of the pots are on display in the museum 's Ancient Americas exhibition .
" Illustrations on some pots depict warriors and trophy heads , " said Williams .
" But there are also scenes that link trophy heads to agricultural fertility .
Mythical creatures depicted on some pots carry trophy heads as well . "
Researchers speculated that if trophy heads were spoils of war , they likely would have come from people who lived somewhere beyond the Nazca area .
To test this notion , scientists took samples of tooth enamel from 16 trophy heads in the Field collection and 13 mummified bodies buried in the Nazca region .
The results clearly show that donors of the trophy heads were from the same place as the people who kept the trophies , Williams said .
This conclusion was based on research using modern technology to look for subtle differences in three elements found in the samples .
Those elements – strontium , oxygen and carbon – each display a slightly different atomic structure that varies by geographic location .

" You are what you eat , " said Williams , " and the elements you consume become a part of your bones ' chemical signature . "
People ingesting food produced in different regions will have different strontium isotope ratios in their bones that mirror the age of the bedrock where the food was grown , he said .
Carbon also displays different isotopic patterns that vary with the plants that process it .
Carbon from corn looks different than carbon from wheat .
Oxygen absorbed from water has an isotope signature that varies with climate , altitude and other factors .
" We used the latest technology to study samples that were gathered 80 years ago , " said Williams .
" This demonstrates the value of maintaining the vast collections that museums keep . "
Scientists from Arizona State University , the University of Illinois at Chicago and Indiana University collaborated with Williams to do the study , which appears in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology .
The lead author is ASU professor Kelly Knudson .
There is still more to learn .
Determining why the Nazca people collected trophy heads could be important in understanding how civilization progressed in South America , Williams said .
" The vast majority of trophy skulls came from the same populations as the people they were buried with .
They still could be the trophies of war ; maybe warfare was oriented against related communities , or maybe this was ritual . "
New data on the changes in trophy head taking by the Nazca through time could be important in understanding how politics developed in early societies .
" This small scale agrarian society was succeeded by an empire with regional authority , " Williams said .
" For the first time people were governed by others who lived hundreds of miles distant .
Understanding how this came about may help us better understand how these forms of government first emerged . "
In his post on why the traditional CPM model does n't work anymore , Dave McClure breaks the CPM denial balloon , noting that the popular content - centric , keyword - based Google Adword model delivers a click - through rate of less than 1 % .
Dave posits that the problem is not Google - specific , but reflects the problem with the CPM model in the new world of social networks and distributed conversations .
As an answer to the problem with lackluster clicks , especially within social networks like Facebook , Dave looks to widgets to serve up content based on the interests of individuals :
" The Revolution Will Not Be Televised .
It will be Widgetized .
Fortunately , that revolution is already happening ... it 's called widgets .
and Facebook apps .
it 's about engaging users via application workflow , and discovering intent .
then you do n't have to advertise anymore , you just serve up the stuff that users find interesting . "
Social Networks
What 's clear is that while the appeal of social networks is growing — with 44.3 % of U.S. Internet users expected to participate by year 's end according to eMarketer — the CPM model as a means to evoke a response from consumers is not just flailing , but failing .
Ad networks like Lookery , which target Facebook users , have cut ad rates nearly in half .
It 's a move that has worked for Lookery in the short term — at least in providing relief to frustrated application developers .
However , cutting ad rates is not exactly the hallmark of a solid revenue model .
These guarantees are more like a Band - Aid than the full - scale surgery that is required of online advertising .
Why CPMs Do n't Work
The reason CPMs do n't work in social networks is that they are trying to target new media users using old media technology and thinking .
The CPM model asks , " What is the content on the page ? "
But social media conversations are n't ON any one page anymore .
They jump from one site to another , they take place on a variety of platforms and media types , across blogs and Twitter and FriendFeed and Facebook and MySpace .
In this AdAge article , Steve Rubel talks about the role of social search in the changing role of online advertising :
" Social - network advertising to date … has been a mixed bag .
Everyone is innovating , but the draw on social networks is your group of friends .
That makes it harder to be distracted by ads .
Enter search .
Watch for contextual advertising and programs such as Facebook 's social ads .
New models will emerge where social algorithms and keywords trigger contextual ads . "
Finding a Solution
It 's clear that a solution to the social media monetization puzzle cannot be solved by content alone .
Tools that track the context within which the social media participant engages within various communities are important .
Context - based discovery and social search play a role in bringing relevant content to receptive audiences .
Interest - based user engagement — based on user context , not content -– tracks interest across various conversations and among the plethora of social media sites .
Knowing – based on her participation across social sites – that a social media participant is a New England Patriots fan who vacations frequently in Hawaii and loves water sports and high - tech gadgets is invaluable to creating a tailored interaction between that participant and companies with offers that are relevant to her .
Universal Profiles
Universal user profiles can inform and strengthen the relationship between social media users , third - party application developers , and advertisers .
In contrast to the fragmented identities we maintain in all of the social sites we participate on , universal profiles present a hyperlinked record of users ' participation across sites .
Universal profiles have supercharged the idea of " context " as it relates to the distributed Web , offering the best of both worlds .
These profiles track and present the activity of users across communities , while leaving control of the data in the hands of the community or site owner .
They are proving to increase traffic for site owners while providing the community with non-intrusive ways to monetize content and build reputation .
This context - based approach to social media advertising offers a creative , secure way to breathe new life into an old model .
With a new way to seamlessly present meaningful offers , and even customized environments , to users , advertisers can now understand and appeal to an individual 's online and offline interests based on the fullness of their participation across social media sites .
Greeting users on their own terms –- rather than force - feeding them ads based on key words and content — can , over time , transform Internet users from " mouse clicks " and " targets " to fully engaged participants and willing customers .

The Bush admin­is­tra­tion is report­ed­ly using its final months in office to exact ret­ri­bu­tion on fed­er­al employ­ees who have spo­ken out against agency poli­cies dur­ing the past eight years .
Since April , the admin­is­tra­tion has dis­missed – or noti­fied of pend­ing dis­missal – more than a dozen fed­er­al whistle­blow­ers , accord­ing to Mar­sha Cole­man - Ade­bayo , founder of the civ­il rights group No Fear Coali­tion and direc­tor of the Nation­al Whistle­blow­ers Cen­ter .
Some have come as recent­ly as Novem­ber .
They include staffers at the Depart­ments of Com­merce , Labor , Edu­ca­tion and Trans­porta­tion .
And , Cole­man - Ade­bayo says , those are only the employ­ees who are will­ing to go on record .
“ We have a much longer list , ” she says .
​ “ A num­ber of peo­ple have asked us not to share their names pub­licly as they are hop­ing to keep their gov­ern­ment jobs . ”
For Cole­man - Ade­bayo , the fir­ings are a ​ “ final act of retal­i­a­tion ” against employ­ees – many of them long­time staffers – who have expressed dis­sent with­in Pres­i­dent Bush ’s high­ly politi­cized fed­er­al agencies .
So far , the dis­missals have flown large­ly under the radar .
Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the Gov­ern­ment Account­abil­i­ty Project ( GAP ) and the Project on Gov­ern­ment Over­sight – promi­nent whistle­blow­er advo­ca­cy groups – say they were unaware of the recent fir­ings but were not surprised .
Jes­se­lyn Radack , a for­mer Jus­tice Depart­ment whistle­blow­er who serves as home­land secu­ri­ty direc­tor at GAP , says such purges have been a Bush admin­is­tra­tion pol­i­cy since the beginning .
“ It ’s hard to imag­ine that they ’re doing it at a faster rate than the mete­oric pace they already have been , ” Radack wrote in an e‑mail .
​ “ I would view such a phe­nom­e­non as just a con­tin­u­a­tion of [ the administration ’s ] noto­ri­ous eight - year long , bru­tal cam­paign of retal­i­a­tion against any­one who dis­sents , dis­agrees or exer­cis­es inde­pen­dent judgment . ”
Cole­man - Ade­bayo , her­self a pol­i­cy ana­lyst and whistle­blow­er at the Envi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency ( EPA ) , received notice of her own dis­missal on Oct. 30 .
She had 15 days to respond to the rough­ly 200 - page doc­u­ment , which cit­ed ​ “ med­ical inabil­i­ty to per­form the duties of her posi­tion ” as the rea­son for her ter­mi­na­tion .
Cole­man - Ade­bayo suf­fers from hyper­ten­sion and had been work­ing from home .
She is cur­rent­ly on unpaid med­ical leave from the EPA .
Coleman - Adebayo ’s trou­bles with the EPA began under the Clin­ton admin­is­tra­tion .
On assign­ment in Africa , she raised a red flag over a U.S. cor­po­ra­tion that was poi­son­ing its work­ers with tox­ic waste in South Africa .
When the EPA failed to act , she went pub­lic – a move her supe­ri­ors did not appreciate .
In the months fol­low­ing her whistle­blow­ing , Cole­man - Ade­bayo , who is African Amer­i­can , was sub­ject­ed to racial and sex­u­al harass­ment , accord­ing to details released in the ensu­ing court bat­tle .
In 2000 , a jury award­ed her $ 600,000 – the largest award ever levied against the EPA .
“ Essen­tial­ly , the EPA was reduced to find­ing some­thing that is pret­ty far­fetched and actu­al­ly ille­gal to fire me , ” Cole­man - Ade­bayo says .
​ “ So this is clear­ly a last - minute ​‘Hail Mary ’ in terms of get­ting rid of me – they sim­ply did n’t have any oth­er basis . ”
EPA spokesman Jonathan Schrad­er declined to dis­cuss the Cole­man - Ade­bayo case in depth , say­ing it is against agency pol­i­cy to com­ment on per­son­nel matters .
“ All I can say at this point is that she remains an EPA employ­ee , ” he said , adding , ​ “ If you call back in about a week , that could change . ”
Schrad­er stressed that his deci­sion not to elab­o­rate on the case ​“ is cer­tain­ly not an admis­sion that any of her accu­sa­tions are truthful . ”
Cole­man - Ade­bayo has worked close­ly with law­mak­ers to pass the Noti­fi­ca­tion of Fed­er­al Employ­ees Anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion and Retal­i­a­tion Act. Known as the No FEAR Act , it cre­at­ed guide­lines that fed­er­al agen­cies must fol­low in deal­ing with whistle­blow­er com­plaints and noti­fy­ing employ­ees of their rights .
In 2002 , Bush signed the act into law .
Cole­man - Ade­bayo says she plans to chal­lenge her dis­missal – a fight she expects to win .
But she says the real test will come Jan. 20 .
“ I ’m hop­ing the new pres­i­dent will send a clear mes­sage that he will not tol­er­ate this kind of ille­gal retal­i­a­tion and harass­ment , and one way that he can do that is to rein­state whistle­blow­ers who were ter­mi­nat­ed at the end of the Bush admin­is­tra­tion , ” she says .
​ “ It would be a very pow­er­ful gesture . ”
A Natural History of Civilisation : How the Scottish Enlightenment Reconciled our Biology with our Progress
Posted by William Coleman
Invoking the example of the shipwreck of the Batavia in 1629 , Dr William Coleman - Reader in Economics at the Australian National University and the author of Economics and its Enemies : Two Centuries of Anti-Economics - comes to the defence of the Scottish Enlightenment vision that it is not Nature which is in conflict with Civilisation , but that it is the Unnatural which is in conflict with Civilisation .
The notion that Nature and Civilisation are in conflict is a popular one .
And it is a fertile ground for contrary ideological offspring .
For the presumption of conflict suggests that - since we cannot have both - we must choose between them .
So we might side with Nature over Civilisation , and incline to an ethic of " Natural Barbarism " .
Or we might side with Civilisation over Nature , and favour an ethic of " Perverse Civilisation " .
What this column wishes to press is that liberal conservatives of the Enlightenment - pre-eminently Hume and Smith - upheld a completely opposed conception of the relation of Civilisation and the Natural .
In their mind the Natural and the Civilised were consistent .
Civilisation does not erase , or block or dam human impulses - be they good or bad .
Civilisations may channel impulses differently , but does not diminish their force .
In the minds of the liberal conservatives of the 18th century the conflict lies not between the Civilised and the Natural , but the Civilised and the Unnatural .
The locus classicus of this position is Bernard Mandeville 's Fable of the Bees ( 1728 ) .
Human nature to Mandeville is not elevated - it is proud , covetous , guiltless , pitiless .
And civilisation does not curb these sentiments .
It merely has them expressed in a more sophisticated manner .
So pride becomes less guileless in its presentation .
Covetousness becomes less blatant .
The love of victory and domination remains , and merely changes form , from gross physical combat to one - upmanship .
Vengeance , too , remains .
It is no longer Odysseus bellowing , " You die in blood " , but ( say ) the poison pen letter .
Neither , in the Mandevillian vision , does Civilisation extinguish the passion for destruction and violence .
It only sophisticates it ; makes it more capital intensive , more technological , more planned , more efficient to a purpose , cleverer .
This may be illustrated by the contrast between the warfare of the Romans with that of barbarians .
Or the warfare of the western colonial garrison vs. that of the colonial insurrection .
Chlorine gas is not nicer than the spear or the bayonet , but it can claim to be more sophisticated .
Fritz Haber , the man who first weaponised gas , and who directed the first large scale release of chlorine gas at Ypres , France on 22nd April , 1915 declared , upon receiving the Nobel Prize in chemistry 1919 , that gas was " a higher form of killing " .
Higher , in one sense .
Evidently , Civilisation is at something of a discount in the Mandevillian vision .
Civilisation is not the thing that preserves us from poison gas .
Yet , all the same , Mandeville - like almost all of the lumi�res - emphatically believed in Civilisation .
It is just that - and this is the point - he did not believe in Civilisation on account of its supposed reformation of an ugly human nature .
At the same time the Mandevillian vision puts Nature at a bit of premium .
Not because it is elevated , but because Nature , at the very least , does not interfere with Civilisation .
Indeed , Mandeville and Smith believed that human nature and Civilisation were positively complementary .
Thus " the propensity to truck barter and exchange " - on which all of Smith 's vision rested - might be , in his view , " an original principle of human nature " .
The complementarity of the Natural and the Civilised has a companion thesis ; that the Civilised is offended by the not Natural .
The unnatural and the Civilised are antagonistic .
This hypothesis finds one expression in commonplace political rhetoric that has political adversaries painted , not just as adversaries , but as crooks or criminals .
Deviants or degenerates .
Drunks or " tea drinkers " .
They are , in one variant , sick in the head : they are " mad " , " insane " , " maniacs " .
This rhetoric lends itself well to the political cosmology of the Right , where the adversary is often identified as the outsider ; the atypical " deviant " .
But the rhetoric is also deployed by the Left whenever it suits it ( e.g. Brecht 's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui ) .
It is not simple to decide the justice of the vision of the Civilised as menaced by the unNatural .
This column simply wishes to offer up an anecdote that speaks to this thesis ; a tiny pixel of the panorama of human experience : the wreck of the Batavia [ See Batavia 's Graveyard , Mike Dash , 2002 ; and The Wreck of the Batavia and Prosper , Simon Leys , 2005 ] .
In 1629 the Batavia was dispatched by Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) to sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies .
Aboard was one Jeronimus Cornelisz , a bankrupt apothecary , fleeing creditors and possibly the " Court of Holland " which was , in its bloody way , investigating the associates of Torrentius : artist , libertine , and suspected Anabaptist .
" Anabaptism " comprehends many things in the " radical Reformation " , but can include the doctrine that " killing infidel was pleasing to their God " .
Some have speculated that Cornelisz was a crony of Torrentius , and had been introduced by him to weird theories to the effect that " crimes committed by god 's elect are not crimes at all " ( see Leys , p. 18 ) .
On 3rd June the Batavia was wrecked on the Houtman Abroholos ; a group of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean .
The wreck was not ( immediately ) the catastrophe it must have seemed .
300 persons survived the surf to struggle onto Beacon Island .
There they found water .
And there was food .
And there was hope .
For the Batavia 's skiff had survived , and it now set out to brave the long sea voyage to Java to bring back a rescue party .
But , fatefully , in the skiff also went the captain and all the ship 's senior officers .
The elaborate rules of VOC required that there was always somebody in command of any group of VOC personnel .
The rules stipulated , not surprisingly , that command was always invested in the most senior person present .
The most senior person amongst the shipwrecked survivors happened to be Cornelisz , even though he had only just joined the company .
" Cornelisz seemed to be the natural heir to authority " ( Leys , p. 27 ) .
Cornelisz was also �a remarkable speaker ; his eloquence exerted an almost irresistible power� .
A menace to Cornelisz 's power lay in the fact that , before he was washed to shore , some soldiers had already " spontaneously gathered " round one of their own , a certain Wiebbe Hayes ( Leys , p. 33 ) .
Therefore , Cornelisz had Hayes and his followers transported to a neighbouring isle , High Island , supposedly to allow them reconnoitre it , but with the real purpose of abandoning them on an island that Cornelisz was convinced was waterless .
Now ( apparently ) secure on Beacon Island , Cornelisz instituted a charismatic , blood soaked tyranny , of the flavour of the notorious " millenarian " Anabaptist Kingdom of Munster of 1534 .
All children were murdered , their mothers enslaved , and almost all adults killed in " aberrant atrocities " ( Leys , p. 9 ) .
There is no need to rehearse the horrors that were involved in this deed .
But the point is worth pressing that much of the violence on " Batavia 's Graveyard " seems not to have been instrumental ; it was pointless .
Or , to put it another way , it had a " just for fun " motivation : the island had become a carnival of murder .
Some of the denizens of Beacon Island managed to escape to High Island , and alert the still perfectly alive Wiebbe Hayes .
Hayes prepared High Island as a sanctuary for escapees , and an outpost of resistance .
Cornelisz attempted to subjugate High Island , but was successfully resisted until the fortuitous arrival of the VOC 's rescue ship from Java ( at a rather critical moment , just like the arrival of the Royal Navy in the Lord of The Flies ) .
In accordance with the law , Cornelisz had both hands amputated , and was then " hung " ( = strangled ) .
His last words were " Revenge ! Revenge ! "
The key point is that the wreck of the Batavia is not a Lord of the Flies story ; it is not a story of the constraints of civilisation wrenched off by circumstance ; and then , being cast off , barbaric human nature - the stranger within , the ape beneath the skin , - emerging .
It can not be such a story because there are two islands ; one on which there is a disaster , and one not .
Further , it was Beacon Island - where the " social capital " of the VOC 's rules of leadership had survived - that experienced catastrophe .
A Lord of the Flies vision is inadequate to explain what happened on Beacon Island , and what did not happen on High Island .
The apparent explicatory difference between the two islands is that Beacon Island was ruled by a " criminal and pervert " , and High Island was not .
Thus Leys draws his lesson of The Batavia ( Leys , p. 36 ) :
a civilised society is not one in which the percentage of criminals and perverts is lower ( the proportion must be about the same in all human communities ) ; it is simply one that gives them less opportunity to indulge their inclinations .
We may query if the Batavia corroborates Leys ' thesis that civilisation and " opportunity for criminals and perverts " are mutually exclusive .
For it seems the greater survival of civilisation on Beacon Island ( as manifested in survival of the leadership structures of the VOC ) gave a greater opportunity to criminals and perverts .
The complete , or more exact lesson of the Batavia , may be that damaged Civilisation gives an opportunity to criminals and perverts .
Modern times surely gives a resonance to the notion that a damaged civilisation gives to " criminals and perverts " a licence to practice crime .
On occasion its historical substantiation has been attempted .
Thus in Hippolyte Taine 's analysis of the French Revolution , the Jacobin was [ quoted in Donald Greer , The Incidence of the Terror During the French Revolution : a Statistical Interpretation , 1935 , p. 5 ] :
intellectually an automaton energised by the ideas of Rousseau and Mably : but he was also a social delinquent , at best a small town failure , unstable visionary , clever rogue or charlatan ; at worst - the majority - a cutthroat , vagabond , or jailbird .
Indeed ,
Taine could have put in service of his thesis much juicier cuts than the " vagabond , or jailbird " .
As is well known , the Marquis de Sade was imprisoned in the Bastille until July 1789 , and released during the Revolution .
What is less well - known is that in 1792 he was elected to the regicide National Convention , and there represented the far left .
Donatien Alphonse Fran�ois , le Marquis de Sade seems to constitute a spectacular corroboration of the incongruence of Civilisation and the Unnatural .
It is testimony to the power of intelligent men to use their intelligence to evade the obvious that Kenneth Clark , in his Civilisation , saw fit to enlist de Sade for a contrary inference .
Clarke saw fit to enlist de Sade in his effort to denigrate the Enlightenment 's reverence for the Natural , and so bear out his own perception of a tension between Civilisation and Nature .
De Sade , Clark tells us , " saw through the new god [ of Nature ] from the start ! " .
To clinch the point he quotes from De Sade in 1792 :
Nature averse to crime ?
I tell you that nature lives and breathes by it , hungers at all her pores for bloodshed , yearns with all her heart for the furtherance of cruelty .
Nature averse to crime ?
The Enlightenment thought so - and that crime was averse to Nature .
For Clark to invoke de Sade to have us think otherwise is truly perverse .
Dr William Coleman is Reader in Economics at the Australian National University and the author of Economics and its Enemies : Two Centuries of Anti-Economics , ( Palgrave Macmillan , 2002 ) .
To read William Coleman 's earlier essays on the conflict between Nature and Civilisation , see : Perverse Civilisation and Natural Barbarism : William Coleman explores two doubtful moves in social theorising and examines Malthus 's debate with Godwin over population - and the subsequent Benthamite libelling of Malthus and The Civilised Way of Death : Nature vs. Civilisation in the novels of Aldous Huxley , Evelyn Waugh and William Godwin .
Pinax is a collection of reusable django apps that brings together features that are common to many websites .
It allows developers to focus on what makes their site unique .
Here is an example of adding your own functionality to Pinax .
It will also be an example of writing a reusable app since every individual app currently in Pinax can be used separately .
Also , I ’ve bundled the example files into a google code project .
My example will be to create a list of books and allow them to be tied to any object using Django ’s ContentType framework .
The books could be recommended reading for the members of a tribe ( pinax group ) , a class , or anything in your project and will include title , description , and tags ( requires django - tagging ) .
In another post I ’ve shown how to create template tags to make it easy to show the list of books and a form to add a book .
Obviously , there is a lot more that could be done with this app , but I will leave it out of the example to keep it simple .
Starting the App
Create a folder in the apps directory or any place that is on the python path ( ex. / path/to/pinax/projects/complete_project/apps/books/) and include these files :
__init__.py even though it might be empty , it is required
forms.py
models.py
urls.py
views.py
models.py
I will start with creating the model for the project .
Below is all of the code I am placing in the file .
I ’ve added a lot of comments to explain everything that is happening .
#import all of the things we will be using from django .
db import models from tagging .
fields import TagField # to help with translation of field names from django .
utils .
translation import ugettext_lazy as _ # to have a generic foreign key for any model from django .
contrib .
contenttypes import generic # stores model info so this can be applied to any model from django .
contrib .
contenttypes .
models import ContentType class Book ( models .
Model ) : " " " The details of a Book " " " # fields that describe this book name = models .
CharField ( _ ( ' name ' ) , max_length= 48 ) description = models .
TextField ( _ ( ' description ' ) ) # to add to any model content_type = models .
ForeignKey ( ContentType ) object_id = models .
PositiveIntegerField ( ) content_object = generic .
GenericForeignKey ( ' content_type ' , ' object_id ' ) # for the list of tags for this book tags = TagField ( ) # misc fields deleted = models .
BooleanField ( default= 0 ) created = models .
DateTimeField ( auto_now_add= True ) # so that {{book.get_absolute_url}} outputs the whole url @models .
permalink def get_absolute_url ( self ) : return ( " book_details " , [ self . pk ] ) # outputs name when printing this object as a string def __unicode__ ( self ) : return self .
name
forms.py
Use Django ’s ModelForm to create a form for our book model .
from django import forms from books .
models import Book class NewBookForm ( forms .
ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = Book exclude = ( ' deleted ' , ' content_type ' , ' object_id ' , ' created ' )
views.py
In this file we create a view to show the details of a book and a view to create a new book for an object .
from django .
shortcuts import render_to_response from django .
shortcuts import get_object_or_404 from django .
http import HttpResponseRedirect from django .
template import RequestContext from django .
core .
urlresolvers import reverse from django .
utils .
translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django .
contrib .
auth .
decorators import login_required from tribes .
models import Tribe from books .
models import Book from django .
contrib .
contenttypes .
models import ContentType @login_required def new ( request , content_type_id , object_id , template_name= " books/new.html " ) : " " " creates a new book " " " from books .
forms import NewBookForm # if a new book was posted if request .
method == ' POST ' : book_form = NewBookForm ( request .
POST ) if book_form .
is_valid ( ) : # create it book = book_form .
save ( commit= False ) content_type = \ ContentType. objects .
get ( id = content_type_id ) content_object = \ content_type .
get_object_for_this_type ( id =object_id ) book .
content_object = content_object book .
save ( ) request .
user .
message_set .
create ( message= _ ( " Successfully created book ' %s ' " ) % book .
name ) # send to object page or book page try : return HttpResponseRedirect ( content_object . get_absolute_url ( ) ) except : return HttpResponseRedirect ( reverse ( ' book_details ' , args= ( book .
id , ) ) ) # if invalid , it gets displayed below else : book_form = NewBookForm ( ) return render_to_response ( template_name , { ' book_form ' : book_form , } , context_instance=RequestContext ( request ) ) @login_required def details ( request , book_id , template_name= " books/details.html " ) : " " " displays details of a book " " " book = get_object_or_404 ( Book , id =book_id ) return render_to_response ( template_name , { ' book ' : book , } , context_instance=RequestContext ( request ) )
urls.py
To tie our views to some urls , add this to the urls .
py file .
from django .
conf . urls .
defaults import * from django .
conf . urls .
defaults import * urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , # new book for object url ( r ' ^new / (? P< content_type_id > \d +)/(?
P< object_id > \d + ) ' , ' books.views.new ' , name= " new_book " ) , # display details of a book url ( r ' ^details / (?
P< book_id > \d +) $ ' , ' books.views.details ' , name= " book_details " ) , )
More Features
The rest of the application is described in the post titled : How to Write Django Template Tags .
You can also check out all of the code from the google project by doing the following command :
svn co http://django-books.googlecode.com/svn/trunk books
in a directory on the python path .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

School board President Lillian Cravens said the campaign to oust the board is in keeping with the community 's quarrelsome style .
Notorious for political bickering and personal rivalries , the district has run through seven superintendents in the last eight years and 15 school board members in the last five .
" These people are always fighting up here , " she said .
" They are always threatening a recall .
This time they just followed through . "
Students at Tioga high school in Groveland , California were so angry when their favorite math teacher was fired , they organized a recall campaign against the entire school board .
The Big Oak Flat - Groveland school board thought they were acting properly when they ousted Ryan Dutton over allegations of plagiarism .
Dutton , a former punter for the Amsterdam Admirals ( NFL Europe ) , was accused of copying from another student at Cal State Fresno while he was working toward his teaching credentials .
He was also removed from his position as Tioga 's baseball coach .
Cal State Fresno said the allegations were unfounded , but the board refused to reinstate him , claiming they were acting on " private information . "
So the students staged a one - day protest that shut down the school , and then continued on with the entire recall .
According to an article in the Los Angeles Times , the Groveland community is just a bunch of cranks :
The school board will meet this week so they can receive officially receive notice that the town does not like them , and will soon come after them with pitchforks and torches .
The board actually has the option of calling the election itself , which would cause the vote to be done by mail , although it will probably be held on May 5 , thus allowing the board an opportunity to back down and reinstate Dutton .
My guess is they 're going to pull a Rod Blagojevich and stay in office for as long as they can .---
I ’ve known for a while that the replace function can call native functions in Firefox and IE .
It works something like this :-
‘ alert ( 1 ) ’.replace (/.+/,eval )
So the regexp searches for the alert string and passes the result to the eval function which it receives as an argument .
But does it stop there ?
Well no actually .
There ’s more .
Then we can use unicode escapes to encode the string further like so :-
' \u0061\u006c\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0028\u0031\u0029'.replace(/\u0061\u006c\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0028\u0031\u0029/,\u0065\u0076\u0061\u006
c )
Remember javascript and regexp both accept unicode strings , this is interesting because we can double encode the vector like the above .
The string contains javascript unicode escapes double encoded and the regular expression contains that string encoded .
So that ’s gotta be it right ?

The above uses RegExp and eval both of which are unicode escapes .
Because the RegExp constructor is used we can pass a string that becomes decoded by javascript but we can then encode again as unicode regular expressions .
[ - 1 ] signifies the text from the regular expression constructor we use this to replace .
Having trouble decoding ?

Shocking news for long - time gamers this week , with reports that Ziff Davis publishing will end production of its popular magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly ( EGM ) .
In addition , it has sold fan - favorite web site 1up.com to UGO , which in turn has terminated the gaming page .
At first , news that UGO had acquired the site did n't seem all bad for 1up.com employees .
UGO chief executive officer J. Moses told the media that the acquisition of 1up.com would allow his company " to expand our base of quality content and represents a major step forward in UGO 's mission to become the leader in the games space . "
( Source : dmwmedia.com )
To anyone listening , that sounded like UGO 's main intent was to make itself bigger and better by acquiring the Ziff Davis product and gamer favorite .
Ziff Davis , for its part , indicated similarly , with CEO Jason Young telling workers in an email , " many of our employees will travel with this business and become part of the UGO team . "
Not long afterwards , it was revealed that most 1up.com employees would be out of a job entirely .
Tech publications like Ars Technica are referring to the event as " a scorched - earth policy " .
( Source : arstechnica.com )
Equally painful for gamers will be news of Electronic Gaming Monthly 's termination .
Popularly referred to as " EGM " , the magazine has been in publication for two decades .
Unfortunately , a combination of a slackening economy and print publication woes will make this month EGM 's last .
" With demand for print continuing to decline amongst both advertisers and readers and the content being produced by 1UP no longer available for use in the publication , it simply did not make sense for us to move forward with this business any longer , " Young stated .
1up.com site director Sam Kennedy referred all questions about the layoffs to Ziff Davis bosses .
He seemed less frustrated with UGO , stating , " All I can say to that is UGO held onto as many people as they could to run the business going forward and [ kept ] a lot of all - star key players . "
The double - whammy is evidence that both the tech industry and the publishing companies that cover it have met their toughest opponent yet in this sadistic , sliding economy .
Here 's hoping that 1up.com and EGM employees keep up the good work elsewhere .

" If I were to be the CEO of Google or the founders of Google I would be very [ displeased ] that the best search engine in the world continues to provide as a first link , Wikipedia , " he said .
" Is this the best they can do ?
Is this the best that [ their ] algorithm can do ? "
Mr Cauz , who is visiting Australia , said the changes were the first in a series of enhancements to the britannica.com website designed to encourage more community input to the 241 - year - old institution and , in doing so , to take on Wikipedia in the all important search engine rankings .
" What we are trying to do is shifting ... to a much more proactive role for the user and reader where the reader is not only going to learn from reading the article but by modifying the article and - importantly - by maybe creating his own content or her own content , " he said .
Mr Cauz said that any changes or additions made to Britannica entries online would have to be vetted by one of the company 's staff or freelance editors before the changes were reflected on the live site .
He said the encyclopedia had set a benchmark of a 20 - minute turnaround to update the site with user - submitted edits to existing articles , which are written by the encyclopedia 's paid expert contributors .
Many of those changes will eventually appear in the printed version of the encyclopedia , which is published every two years .
In addition to the community editing features , Britannica.com will enable approved users to add their own creative input which will sit beside the authorised articles .
Wikipedia , which ranks among the world 's top - 10 most visited websites , is maintained by volunteers from all over the world and anyone with an internet connection can create and edit articles and publish them on the site .
Would - be editors on the Britannica site will have to register using their real names and addresses before they are allowed to modify or write their own articles .
Mr Cauz characterised Wikipedia as containing " plenty of cracks on it in terms of the quality " .
" It 's very uneven , the facts are not always correct , the model contains a lot of pitfalls . "
Damning his competitor with faint praise , he said a big problem was that many users considered Wikipedia to be " fine " or " good enough " .
" What is really unfortunate is that when it comes to knowledge - which is really what makes humans evolve or not evolve into the future - we tend to be non-discriminating .
And that 's really the troublesome thing . "
Asked if he looks at Wikipedia , he said he spent several hours a day online .
" I think it would be impossible not to look at Wikipedia when one goes to Google .
It 's the most symbiotic relationship happening out there , " he said .
" It 's very much used by many people because it covers many topics and it's the No.1 search result on Google .
It 's not necessarily that people go to Wikipedia . "
( Google 's PageRank search algorithm is designed to look for the most relevant and cited web page and often that happens to be a Wikipedia entry ) .
Encyclopedia Britannica was first published in 1768 - two years before Captain James Cook 's discovery of Australia .
Founded in 1994 , the Britannica.com 's database contains articles comprising more than 46 million words - not counting other forms of media content .
Founded in 2001 , Wikipedia is now available in more than 250 languages and attracts about 700 million visitors annually .
The English editon alone contains nearly 2.7 million articles .

I was amused to see this pop up on the Stack Overflow home page a few days ago :
If you do n’t know who Alan Kay is , first of all , shame on you — he ’s one of the most important figures in modern computing :
Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object - oriented programming , which he named , along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the Norwegian Computing Center .
He conceived the Dynabook concept which defined the conceptual basics for laptop and tablet computers and E - books , and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface ( GUI ) .
Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform , Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning , and indeed , many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform , with which Kay is actively involved .
I had previously remarked on Twitter that , while browsing Stack Overflow , I noticed that Alan Kay responded to a question about him .
It looks like a few people took that opportunity to vote his response up .
So did I .
Now , it ’s likely that Alan was just responding to an automated web search alert for pages containing his name ; I have these set up too and I do the same thing from time to time .
( Although I desperately try to avoid being an internet - era Beetlejuice who appears in a magical puff of smoke whenever his name is invoked three times . )
It ’s likely , in my opinion at least , to be the real Alan Kay .
He has been known to reply in blog comments in the past .
So , if you ’ve ever wondered if there are famous developers using Stack Overflow , indeed there are !
Short of Knuth himself posting , Alan Kay gets my vote for being the most famous participant so far .
Thanks for stopping by , Alan — and as always , it ’s encouraging to see someone of your stature still actively engaging with the community .
Oh , and enjoy that silver Good Answer badge .
I ’d say you definitely earned it .
Update : Alan posted a followup question : Significant new inventions in computing since 1980 .

Flying in [ to Washington ] , we take the route over the Lincoln Memorial , the Jefferson , the Tidal Basin : the signs and symbols of the great republic .
And you ’ve seen it all a thousand times but you ca n’t stop looking , and you ca n’t help it , your eyes well .
After a minute you realize you must have a moony look on your face , and you lean back .
OK , she ’s excited about these signs and symbols .
That ’s understandable .
But what does this “ great republic ” stand for ?
I think many people would say “ freedom . ”
Even if that ’s not true , it ’s comforting .
But read on and see the enormity that she seems to delight in :
A cabdriver crows that he ’ll have an easy time getting around next week : “ No traffic allowed into town but cabs and limos ! ”
The USAir agents at Reagan National say they ’ll be sleeping over in the airport–in cots , right over there where the shuttle security lines are–on Monday and Tuesday nights .
Roads in and out of the city will be closed .
In other words , people will be forcibly prevented from using the roads .
Does this sound like a free country or like two days of Maoist China with some 21st - century technology thrown in ?
She continues :
Barack Obama is n’t president yet , but already is he is omnipresent .
At the Hay - Adams Hotel , security tents block off the street .
Motorcades come and go .
He dines at a private home in a neighborhood where you ca n’t see the numbers of the houses from the street , but it ’s clear where the gathering is from the sharpshooters on the roof .
Of course ; why did n’t I think of it ?
That ’s how you ’d know where to find the president of a free country .
Look for the sharpshooters .
Ms. Noonan later writes :
What is required for full enjoyment of an inauguration , from opening prayers to speeches to marching bands is , in the great 19th - century phrase , the willing suspension of disbelief .
Which raises the question : Ms. Noonan , what exactly would you disbelieve if you let yourself disbelieve ?
We ’re talking about the head of one of the most powerful governments in the world .
The main tool government uses is force .
It uses this force mainly against innocent people , at home and abroad .
That ’s not just what I believe .
That ’s what I know .
Thanks , Ms. Noonan , but no thanks .
I ’m not willing to suspend that knowledge for anyone .
For most of us , money is tight this year .

In their new book , Welfare for the Rich , Phil Harvey and Lisa Conyers analyze the many ways that federal and state governments provide handouts — subsidies , grants , tax credits , loan guarantees , price supports , and many other payouts — to millionaires , billionaires , and the companies they own and run .
Welfare for the Rich paints a comprehensive picture of a system where the government keeps wealth and power flowing from the many to the few .
Join us for this book forum on October 1st to learn what we can do about this situation .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Bush administration official has publicly described a detainee 's treatment at the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , as torture , according to a published report .
The detention of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , has been a source of controversy .
Susan Crawford , the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commision , has refused to refer the case of Mohammed al - Qahtani to prosecutors because of that assessment , The Washington Post reported Wednesday .
" We tortured ( Mohammed al - ) Qahtani , " Crawford told the Post .
" His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that 's why I did not refer the case " for prosecution .
Military prosecutors have accused al - Qahtani of helping to plan the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , and believe he may have sought to participate , possibly as the " 20th hijacker . "
The United States had been seeking the death penalty against al - Qahtani and five other men in connection with the 9/11 attacks .
Crawford approved charges against the other five .
She told the newspaper she came to her decision based on the combination of the interrogation techniques , their duration and the effect on al - Qahtani 's health .
" The techniques they used were all authorized , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , " she said .
" You think of torture , you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual .
This was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health .
It was abusive and uncalled for .
And coercive .
Clearly coercive .
It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge " to call it torture , she told the paper .
When asked later Wednesday about the report , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino responded , " It has never been the policy of this president or this administration to torture .
" Because of command influence concerns , I have not commented about individual cases from this podium and ... that 's as much as I can say about it . "
Pressed further on the issue , Perino said , " The commander - in - chief should not be commenting on cases where the government is bringing a case against a detainee .
It would be inappropriate to do so from the White House . "
The Department of Defense issued a statement Wednesday defending the military treatment of al - Qahtani .
" We have conducted more than a dozen investigations and reviews of our detention operations , including specifically the interrogation of al - Qahtani , the alleged 20th hijacker .
" The investigations concluded the interrogation methods used at Gitmo ( Guantanamo ) , including the special interrogation techniques used with Qahtani in 2002 , were lawful .
" However , subsequent to those reviews , the department adopted new and more restrictive policies , and improved oversight procedures for interrogation and detention operations .
" Some of the aggressive questioning techniques used on al - Qahtani , although permissible at the time , are no longer allowed in the updated Army field manual . "
In November , military prosecutors said they would try to refile charges against al - Qahtani based on later interrogations that did not use harsh techniques , the paper reported .
Crawford , who dismissed war crimes charges against al - Qahtani in May 2008 , said she wo n't let the prosecutors pursue other charges .
His interrogation took place over 50 days -- from November 2002 to January 2003 , and he was held in isolation until April 2003 , she said .
" For 160 days , his only contact was with the interrogators , " she said .
Crawford , who studied interrogation and other military records , said al - Qahtani was forced to stand naked in front of a female agent , threatened with a military dog named Zeus , " forced to wear a woman 's bra and had a thong placed on his head " during questioning , and " was told that his mother and sister were whores , " the newspaper reported .
Al - Qahtani , a Saudi national , was denied entry to the United States by an immigration officer in August 2001 , and later was captured in Afghanistan .
In January 2002 he was sent to Guantanamo , where he has remained in custody as an enemy combatant .
The agency said it is now focused on ensuring the proper treatment of detainees .

Video ( 02:10 ) : Norm Coleman plans to contest the certification of ballots that put Al Franken in the lead of the U.S. Senate race .
Surrounded by cheering supporters , Republican Norm Coleman , who received 225 fewer votes than DFLer Al Franken in the U.S. Senate recount , vowed Tuesday to wage a court battle to challenge the outcome .
" Not every valid vote has been counted , and some have been counted twice , " Coleman said .
" Let 's take the time right now in this contested race to get it right . "
In deciding to fight on , Coleman rejected Monday 's ruling of the state Canvassing Board , which certified the results that gave Franken the lead .
The next phase of the dispute will take place in Ramsey County District Court , where Coleman will try to convince a three - judge panel that he was hurt by votes that were wrongly excluded and improperly included in the recount .
Coleman made his announcement at a news conference surrounded by a feisty group of supporters in a room of the State Office Building in St. Paul .
When Coleman was asked whether he had considered conceding the race , the crowd shouted in chorus , " No ! " Later , Franken 's lead recount attorney , Marc Elias , called Coleman 's case " an uphill battle to overturn the will of the people " and said it raised no decisive issues .
" It is essentially the same thin gruel , warmed - over leftovers ... that they have been serving the last few weeks . "
Elias also said that the Franken campaign will use the court contest to raise its own questions about whether more ballots should have been tallied .
The campaign has secured affidavits from several voters who said their ballots were n't counted , he said .
A trial is expected to begin within 20 days , and a Coleman lawyer said a decision may not be known until two months from now .
Coleman 's decision to go to court came as pressure was building for him to concede .
Former Republican Gov. Arne Carlson said Tuesday that Coleman should consider bowing out .
" I do n't think it 's winnable , " said Carlson , who served from 1991 - 99 .
He said contesting the recount results could hurt the Republican 's image .
" I think there will be a tremendous amount of public anger , I think it will hurt his reputation , " Carlson said .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said Coleman is " entitled to the opportunity to proceed however he sees fit .
But for someone who 's been in the trenches on a number of these elections , graciously conceding , like his friend John Ensign did , would be the right step .
This can't drag on forever . "
Asked about such comments , Coleman acknowledged " a desire by a small number of people to simply move on , " but said , " Speed is not the first objective .
Fairness is .
...
We will not permit the full process to be shortcut .
That would only cast greater doubt and uncertainty over the final result . "
New range of issues
The Canvassing Board 's work focused on interpreting voter intent on ambiguous ballots challenged by the campaigns .
But the court contest will examine a wider range of issues .
Coleman 's lawsuit says the Canvassing Board 's rulings on ballot challenges were inconsistent , and that ballots were both improperly rejected and wrongly counted by local elections officials and the secretary of state to the advantage of Franken .
After Coleman 's announcement , his recount lawyers Tony Trimble and Fritz Knaak released a 33 - page summary of documents filed in Ramsey County Court .
The file includes dozens of copies of envelopes for rejected absentee ballots that the campaign says should have been accepted .
Some went unopened even though they were marked " accepted , " others were delivered to the wrong precinct , and still others were rejected over other clerical errors .
Knaak said campaign lawyers are in the process of conducting " a very real investigation , " interviewing local elections officials and taking statements that can be used in court .
He promised testimony about double - voting in some precincts .

An 11 - year - old Franco - Mexican boy has killed six young bulls in a single fight , despite moves to stop the event .
Michelito Lagravere has been bullfighting since he was four years old .
Last year several of Michelito 's bullfights in France were banned after protests by animal rights groups .
This time the controversial spectacle was given a last minute go - ahead despite pressure from child protection and anti-bullfighting campaign groups .
The mayor of Merida , where the fight took place , had earlier suspended the event , saying it was illegal for youths under the age of 18 to take part in high - risk public performances .
But the state prosecutor 's office overturned the ban just hours before the fight after Michelito 's father - a former French bullfighter - launched an appeal .
" I 'm happy to have achieved this great victory , " Michelito Lagravere said as he left the ring in Merida .
Courting controversy
Some 3,500 people , including many children , reportedly gathered to witness the fight at the ring in the eastern city of Merida in Yucatan state .
The child matador is already an international star in the world of bullfighting .
Michelito first entered a bullfighting ring when he was four
He first entered the ring when he was four , killed his first bull calf two years later and has since taken on dozens of animals around the world .
His rise to fame has not been without controversy , but the little bullfighter has been defiant in the face of criticism .
" The bullfighting opponents should n't stick their nose in things they do n't like , " he said ahead of his fight .
" No - one is forcing them to watch bullfights or to keep informed about them .
It 's as if I told a boy who does motocross not to do it , it 's very bothersome . "
Last year , the child prodigy caused a public outcry in France while he was touring the bullfighting circuit there .
Several cities banned him from killing animals during his appearances after anti-bullfighting activists waged a high profile campaign .
They said they had targeted him over other younger matadors because " he fights in corridas [ bullfights ] aiming to kill " .
An earlier version of this story suggested Michelito Lagravere might have achieved a Guinness World Record .
In fact Guinness World Records says it was not aware the event was taking place , and will not recognise the result as it does not accept records based on the killing or harming of animals .

Cellular senescence likely evolved as a defense against cancer : Damaged cells stop dividing , preventing cells that have sustained oncogenic mutations from proliferating and forming tumors .
One down side is that the proliferative capacity of the organ goes down ; another is that persistent senescent cells secrete factors that damage the extracellular matrix and contribute to age - related decline in tissue function .
Because senescent cells accumulate with age , senescence has been considered a biomarker of aging — that is to say , a measurable feature of a tissue that would allow us to calculate its “ biological ” or “ physiological ” age without necessarily knowing the chronological age of the donor .
This makes abundant sense : tissues with more senescent cells would have lower proliferative capacity and higher levels of deleterious secreted factors ; given two samples of the same chronological age , one could argue that the one containing more senescent cells was “ older ” in some meaningful way .
This idea is central to a recent paper demonstrating that senescence correlates negatively with the efficacy of a transplanted tissue .
Grafts from older donors have poorer outcomes than those from younger donors , but some older tissues work just fine — what ’s the difference between an old graft that works and an old graft that does n’t ?
The answer , in part , is the level of expression of senescence markers :
Higher expression of senescence - related genes predicts a poorer outcome in a transplant .
In other words , controlling for chronological age , physiological age is a negative correlate of transplant efficacy .
From McGlynn et al. :
Cellular senescence in pre-transplant renal biopsies predicts post - operative organ function Older and marginal donors have been used to meet the shortfall in available organs for renal transplantation .
Post transplant renal function and outcome from these donors is often poorer than chronologically younger donors .
Some organs , however , function adequately for many years .
We have hypothesised that such organs are biologically younger than poorer performing counterparts .
We have tested this hypothesis in a cohort of pre-implantation human renal allograft biopsies ( n=75 ) that have been assayed by Real Time - PCR for the expression of known markers of cellular damage and biological ageing , including CDKN2A , CDKN1A , SIRT2 , and POT1 .
These have been investigated for any associations with traditional factors affecting transplant outcome ( donor age , cold ischaemic time ) and organ function post transplant ( serum creatinine ( SC ) levels ) .
Linear regression analyses indicated a strong association for SC with pre transplant CDKN2A levels ( p=0.001 ) and donor age ( p=0.004 ) at six months post transplant .
Both these markers correlated significantly with urinary protein to creatinine ratios ( p=0.002 and p=0.005 respectively ) , an informative marker for subsequent graft dysfunction .
POT1 expression also showed a significant association with this parameter ( p=0.05 ) .
Multiple linear regression analyses for CDKN2A and donor age , accounted for 24.6 % ( p=0.001 ) observed variability in SC levels at six months and 23.7 % ( p=0.001 ) at one year post transplant .
These data indicate that allograft biological age is thus an important novel prognostic determinant for renal transplant outcome .
Note that the authors measured the levels of senescence - associated gene expression , rather than the number of cells in the tissue that were senescent .
This is a subtle but important point , given what we know about the biology of senescence :
Gene expression is an imperfect marker for the extent of senescence within a tissue :
A given amount of RNA could mean a small number of cells with intense expression or a larger number of cells with lower expression .
Distinguishing between these alternatives may be clinically important , depending on whether the increased senescence is causing the poorer transplant performance — and if so , why ?
Regeneration is likely necessary for optimal organ performance after a transplant ; since senescent cells are permanently nondividing , the presence of a large number of them would predict poorer regenerative capacity .
Alternatively ( though not mutually exclusively ) the protein factors secreted by senescent cells might have deleterious consequences on the function of the tissue itself , and this might interfere with transplant efficacy .
Figuring out which is more decisive — the number of senescent cells in a tissue , or their aggregate production of secreted factors — will become very important if we ’re someday able to selectively destroy senescent cells .
In the “ increased numbers ” case , such treatments would n’t help ( the cells are equally unable to divide whether they ’re alive or not ) , but in the “ increased secretion ” case , anti-senescence therapeutics could make the difference between success and failure in organ transplants of many kinds .
An 11 - year - old girl was set on fire by a relative in India 's northern city of Jaipur for wearing lipstick and being " inappropriately dressed " , media reports said today .
- Child , 11 , burnt for lipstick
- Relative said to be responsible
- Burns to 90 % of body
The girl suffered burns over 90 per cent of her body .
Her chances of survival were bleak , police officers told the NDTV network .
Police arrested her great uncle , who allegedly poured kerosene on the girl and set her ablaze yesterday .
Investigators told the PTI news agency that the 55 - year - old man , a conservative Muslim , had told the police he was enraged at the girl wearing lipstick and being " scantily dressed " .
The great thing about a laboratory experiment is that you can control the environment .
Wall Street securities carry uncertainties — more , lately , than many people expected — but this experimental security is a sure thing .
“ The fundamental value is unambiguously defined , ” says the economist Charles Noussair , a professor at Tilburg University , in the Netherlands , who has run many of these experiments .
“ It ’s the expected value of the future dividend stream at any given time ” : 15 times 24 cents , or $ 3.60 at the end of the first round ; 14 times 24 cents , or $ 3.36 at the end of the second ; $ 3.12 at the end of the third ; and so on down to zero .
Participants do n’t even have to do the math .
They can see the total expected dividends on their computer screens .
Here , finally , is a security with security — no doubt about its true value , no hidden risks , no crazy ups and downs , no bubbles and panics .
The trading price should stick close to the expected value .
At least that ’s what economists would have thought before Vernon Smith , who won a 2002 Nobel Prize for developing experimental economics , first ran the test in the mid-1980s .
But that ’s not what happens .
Again and again , in experiment after experiment , the trading price runs up way above fundamental value .
Then , as the 15th round nears , it crashes .
The problem does n’t seem to be that participants are bored and fooling around .
The difference between a good trading performance and a bad one is about $ 80 for a three - hour session , enough to motivate cash - strapped students to do their best .
Besides , Noussair emphasizes , “ you do n’t just get random noise .
You get bubbles and crashes . ”
Ninety percent of the time .
So much for security .
These lab results should give pause not only to people who believe in efficient markets , but also to those who think we can banish bubbles simply by curbing corruption and imposing more regulation .
Asset markets , it seems , suffer from irrepressible effervescence .
Bubbles happen , even in the most controlled conditions .
Experimental bubbles are particularly surprising because in laboratory markets that mimic the production of goods and services , prices rise and fall as economic theory predicts , reaching a neat equilibrium where supply meets demand .
But like real - world purchasers of haircuts or refrigerators , buyers in those markets need to know only how much they themselves value the good .
If the price is less than the value to you , you buy .
If not , you do n’t , and vice versa for sellers .
Financial assets , whether in the lab or the real world , are trickier to judge : Can I flip this security to a buyer who will pay more than I think it ’s worth ?
In an experimental market , where the value of the security is clearly specified , “ worth ” should n’t vary with taste , cash needs , or risk calculations .
Based on future dividends , you know for sure that the security ’s current value is , say , $ 3.12 .
But — here ’s the wrinkle — you do n’t know that I ’m as savvy as you are .
Maybe I ’m confused .
Even if I ’m not , you do n’t know whether I know that you know it ’s worth $ 3.12 .
Besides , as long as a clueless greater fool who might pay $ 3.50 is out there , we smart people may decide to pay $ 3.25 in the hope of making a profit .
It does n’t matter that we know the security is worth $ 3.12 .
For the price to track the fundamental value , says Noussair , “ everybody has to know that everybody knows that everybody is rational . ”
That ’s rarely the case .
Rather , “ if you put people in asset markets , the first thing they do is not try to figure out the fundamental value .
They try to buy low and sell high . ”
That speculation creates a bubble .
In fact , the people who make the most money in these experiments are n’t the ones who stick to fundamentals .
They ’re the speculators who buy a lot at the beginning and sell midway through , taking advantage of “ momentum traders ” who jump in when the market is going up , do n’t sell until it ’s going down , and wind up with the least money at the end .
( “ I have a lot of relatives and friends who are momentum traders , ” comments Noussair . )
Bubbles start to pop when the momentum traders run out of money and can no longer push prices up .
The technical term for it is “ negative feedback loop . ”
The rest of us just call it a panic .
How else to explain yet another plunge in the stock market Tuesday that sent the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index to its lowest level in five years  particularly in the absence of another nasty surprise ?
If anything , the markets should have been buoyed by the Federal Reserve saying it would shore up another troubled corner of finance by lending money directly to companies .
Stocks did open higher , but then quickly tumbled as rumors swirled about the viability of big financial firms like Morgan Stanley and the Royal Bank of Scotland .
Anybody searching for cause - and - effect logic in the daily gyrations of the market will be disappointed  even if the overarching problem of a crisis of confidence in the global economy is now becoming clear .
Instead , the market has become a case study in the psychology of crowds , many experts say .
In normal times , it runs on a healthy mix of fear and greed .
But fear now seems to rule , with investors often exhibiting a Wall Street version of the fight - or - flight mechanism  they are selling first , and asking questions later .
This is the second episode from Gateway1 .
The game has a very simple premise : guide the character through a series of rooms .
Solve a mini-puzzle within each room to advance .
In 2008 , nearly 480,000 books were published or distributed in the United States , up from close to 375,000 in 2007 , according to the industry tracker Bowker .
The company attributed a significant proportion of that rise to an increase in the number of print - on - demand books .
“ Even if you ’re sitting at a dinner party , if you ask how many people want to write a book , everyone will say , ‘ I ’ve got a book or two in me , ’ ” said Kevin Weiss , chief executive of Author Solutions .
“ We do n’t see a letup in the number of people who are interested in writing . ”
The trend is also driven by professionals who want to use a book as an enhanced business card as well as by people who are creating books as gifts for family and friends .
“ It used to be an elite few , ” said Eileen Gittins , chief executive of Blurb , a print - on - demand company whose revenue has grown to $ 30 million , from $ 1 million , in just two years and which published more than 300,000 titles last year .
Many of those were personal books bought only by the author .
“ Now anyone can make a book , and it looks just like a book that you buy at the bookstore . ”
To be sure , self - publishing is still a fraction of the wider publishing industry .
Author Solutions , for example , sold a total of 2.5 million copies last year .
Little , Brown sold more than that many copies of “ Twilight ” by Stephenie Meyer just in the last two months of 2008 .
But in an era when anyone can create a blog or post musings on Facebook or MySpace , people still seem to want the tangible validation of a printed book .
“ I wanted the satisfaction of holding the book in my hands , ” Mr. Bendat said .
As a result of his iUniverse book , the British news channel Sky News asked Mr. Bendat to provide live commentary on Inauguration Day .
A group of Washington hotels ordered 500 copies to give to guests who were in town for the event .
Identifying such a rare bird is very difficult A bird more often found in the sub - zero climes of Siberia has been spotted in London , over 3,000 miles off course .
The rare Siberian chiffchaff was seen at London Wildlife Trust 's East Reservoir Community Garden in Stoke Newington , Hackney , east London .
The chiffchaff is one of the rarest species spotted in the area , along with an Iceland gull ( actually from Greenland ) sighted in mid December .
An MP3 of the bird's ' call ' was used to ensure the sighting was clarified .
Mark Pearson , community officer for the London Wildlife Trust said : " The identification of eastern races of chiffchaff is a dark art , and a whole suite of features are required .
The quality and quantity of migrants that occur here is unrivalled by any other similar sized site
Mark Pearson London Wildlife Trust " The best way to tell them apart ( in tandem with a full description of appearance , and ideally good quality photos ) is by their contact call . "
He added : " Chiffchaff subspecies all call in very different ways - and the clincher with our bird here is that it calls perfectly as a Siberian chiffchaff .
" It even responds instantly to an MP3 of Siberian chiffchaff played via my mobile phone .
So we have a full ' body of evidence ' to ascertain its ID . "
East Reservoir sits in the middle of Hackney and includes a large man-made lake .
London Wildlife
Trust is trying to make it more accessible , for both people and wildlife .
Mr Pearson added : " East Reservoir is important for birds for a variety of reasons - it's an oasis of precious , mixed habitats in a very built - up , inner city environment .
" Breeding birds include reed bunting , common pochard and sedge warbler , and , for migrant species , it 's an amazing ' magnet ' in an otherwise unforgiving urban sprawl .
" The quality and quantity of migrants that occur here is unrivalled by any other similar sized site . "

Taking a cue from the cellphone industry , an upstart South African airline is selling flights by the minute and allowing customers to buy tickets and book flights via text message .
Airtime Airlines takes to the sky later this month , offering three flights a day from its base in Durban to Johannesburg , Cape Town and Port Elizabeth .
Passengers purchase minutes much like they would for a prepaid cell phone and redeem them for a ticket .
Fees are assessed according to the length of the flight — say , 75 minutes for the run from Durban to Johannesburg — and could save as much as half of what competing airlines charge .
Vino Eargambram , the airlines chief executive , calls Airtime " a low - key operation targeting a very distinct market — young professionals and self - employed business people . "
And while low fares are central to the airline 's business plan , Eargambram says it will stand out from its competitors by offering complimentary snacks , drinks and other amenities that have become in - flight luxuries elsewhere .
Assuming Airtime gets off the ground .
IAfrica.com reports the airline , which is owned by Blackbird Aerospace and includes at least one cellular provider as a partner , must clear several regulatory hurdles before its planned launch later this month .
And Business Day says Airtime 's deal to lease three Boeing 737s from Air Aquarius fell through , leaving it without any aircraft .
If Airtime irons out those details , passengers will buy minutes instead of a traditional point - to - point ticket .
They can buy a " starter pack " of prepaid minutes and top off their accounts by purchasing more minutes — by text message — at the going rate of 5 Rand ( about 53 cents ) a minute .
Flight times have been mapped out in advance , so sitting on a runway for three hours wo n't triple the cost of your ticket .
Topping off accounts is where things get interesting .
The cost for Airtime minutes can fluctuate , presumably according to promotions and market factors , so topping off becomes an exercise comparable to fuel hedging .
Buy a big block of minutes when you think they 're at their cheapest and you look smart , unless the price drops again the next day .
Then again , it might go up .
The price recently rose from 3 Rand to 5 Rand , meaning the cost of a round - trip flight from Durban to Cape Town climbed from about 750 Rand ( $ 81 ) to 1,250 Rand ( about $ 134 ) .
Still that 's cheaper than the $ 200 it would cost on South African Airlines .
Business Day reports that Airtime 's unusual approach and rock - bottom fares could prompt a price war , but one competitor say Airtime 's fares are a gimmick that can't be sustained .
It is tough to see how Airtime has much chance once the novelty fades .
Paying for flights by the minute is interesting but not at all intuitive .
Airtime 's competitors in the crowded South African market are n't likely to roll over and play dead , and the state of the economy means that times are tough for even the best - run airline , let alone a startup with a strange business model .
Does anyone remember Hooters Air ?
How about Ted or Song ?

Taxpayers take on trillions in risk in Fannie , Freddie takeover
WASHINGTON 
The unprecedented federal takeover of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced on Sunday is a bold attempt to stabilize financial markets and restore the faltering housing market , but it thrusts trillions of dollars of risk directly onto taxpayers ' shoulders .
" You can call it a bailout , you can call it a safety net or you can call it a rescue package , but the bottom line is the American taxpayer is left footing the bill , " says Richard Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
At a Sunday morning news conference , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and James Lockhart , director of the newly formed Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) , announced that Fannie Mae ( FNM ) , based in Washington , D.C. , and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , based in McLean , Va. , will begin operating immediately under a federal government conservatorship .
Unlike a receivership , the arrangement leaves hope for shareholders that investments may regain some value .
President Bush signed housing legislation in July that gives the government clear authority to intervene as it has .
If the plan settles the bond market as government officials hope , borrowers may find mortgages at slightly lower rates .
In taking over the companies , the government ousted their CEOs ; otherwise , work continues as normal .
Though the companies have n't been at imminent risk of collapse , deep losses from the housing meltdown have raised concerns from investors around the world about their ability to meet financial commitments .
" I have determined that the companies cannot continue to operate safely and soundly and fulfill their critical public missions without significant action to address our concerns , " Lockhart said .
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae combined own or guarantee $ 5.4 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt .
The government 's decision to place both agencies into a conservatorship — in essence , taking on responsibility for that debt by wresting control from the corporations — is an historic move .
It is still uncertain how much capital the companies may need from the government .
What that means to taxpayers ultimately depends on what happens with the faltering housing market .
To the extent homeowners continue to make timely mortgage payments , pressure on the government is lessened .
Continued foreclosures and troubles in the mortgage market could run up an expensive tab .
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported Friday that more than 4 million homeowners , or 9 % of those with mortgages , were delinquent by at least one payment or in foreclosure at the end of June .
It 's the highest rate ever , the MBA says .
Terms of the government takeover call for drastically reducing , over time , the roles that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae play in the mortgage market .
Government officials say the duration of the conservatorship is indefinite , and Paulson said policymakers need to use the time to decide whether the role of the companies is best played by private corporations , the government , or hybrids such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .
Although Fannie and Freddie are public companies , owned by shareholders , their debt has had an implicit government guarantee .
Paulson and Lockhart unveiled a four - part plan to come to the aid of the companies , which have sustained combined losses of $ 14 billion in the past four quarters .
FROM THE TREASURY : Secretary Paulson on the move | Senior preferred stock plan | Buying GSE mortgage - backed securities What is the Government Sponsored Enterprise Credit Facility
FROM THE FHFA : Statement on the move | Q&A
Key elements of the plan :
• Government purchase of mortgage - backed securities .
Initially , the government will spend $ 5 billion to buy the securities , to demonstrate Treasury support for continued mortgage availability .
• Gradual portfolio reduction .
Starting in 2010 , the companies ' mortgage portfolios will be reduced at a rate of 10 % per year .
This would dramatically reduce the role that Freddie and Fannie play in the mortgage market .
Together , their market share of all new mortgages reached more than 80 % earlier this year , but is now falling .
• A new lending program .
The companies will have access to a new line of government credit if they run into serious trouble borrowing funds on the open market .
Treasury officials say they consider it a symbolic step to provide confidence to investors in Fannie and Freddie debt .
• Purchase of preferred shares .
The government would be allowed to buy new preferred shares that pay dividends that would be considered senior to the current common and preferred stock .
The Treasury may purchase up to $ 100 billion of this new senior - preferred stock in each company to preserve the companies ' positive net worth .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must give Treasury $ 1 billion in senior preferred stock today , as an upfront fee for agreeing to consider doing this in the future .
A closer look
The move to put Freddie and Fannie into conservatorship was triggered in part by closer government scrutiny of the agencies , prompted by the July housing legislation .
The Treasury Department recently signed a contract with Morgan Stanley to investigate the financial position of Fannie and Freddie , with help from the FHFA .
" Based on what we have learned about these institutions over the past four weeks , including what we learned about their capital requirements , and given the financial markets today , I concluded that it would not have been in the best interest of the taxpayers for the Treasury to simply make an equity investment in these enterprises in their current form , " Paulson says .
Lack of confidence in the agencies has meant that to build capital , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have had to pay more for borrowing in the bond market and have had to tighten credit standards .
The takeover is intended to boost confidence in the two companies .
They could then find it easier to get funding , which could lead to lower mortgage interest rates .
That could spur buyers and help rejuvenate the housing market .
" It 'll bring ( mortgage rates ) down a little bit , " says Bert Ely , a banking consultant in Alexandria , Va . " Freddie and Fannie now are piggybacking on the credit of the United Sates government , and that will allow them to borrow more cheaply " and , in turn , lend more cheaply .
" It might not happen overnight .
But it sure wo n't drive up interest rates . "
" Effectively , this is nationalization , " Paul Miller , an analyst at investment firm Friedman Billings Ramsey , said before the announcement .
" Freddie and Fannie need help .
This is the best way . "
But Sung Won Sohn , an economist at California State University , warned that the government 's financial standing could get shakier .
" The U.S. government has trillions of dollars of debt outstanding .
With the takeover of Fannie and Freddie , the government will add trillions more to the burden , because the Treasury will , in fact , guarantee all the Fannie and Freddie debt , " he said .
Widespread backing
But many supported the move , since financial problems at Freddie and Fannie risk inflaming problems far beyond the U.S. housing market .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares each are down about 90 % from a year ago .
Central banks around the world hold their securities .
Bond investors traditionally have believed that the U.S. government would backstop the companies , even in the absence of an explicit guarantee .
The action Sunday removes any doubt .
In a statement Sunday , Bush supported Paulson 's move , saying , " As we determine the appropriate role for the companies in the future , it is crucial that they not pose similar risks to our economy or the financial system again . "
Republican presidential candidate John McCain told CBS television program Face the Nation that it was a necessary step .
" We 've got to keep people in their homes , " he said .
" There 's got to be some confidence that we 've stopped this downward spiral . "
Democratic candidate Barack Obama told ABC
News he 's " inclined to support some form of intervention to prevent a long - term , much bigger crisis . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement Sunday that " these necessary steps will help to strengthen the U.S. housing market and promote stability in our financial markets . "
Spokesmen for Freddie and Fannie had no comment Sunday .
The takeover also means the ouster of current CEOs at Freddie and Fannie .
At Fannie Mae , Herbert Allison , former CEO at mutual fund company TIAA - CREF , replaces Daniel Mudd .
At Freddie Mac , David Moffett , who was vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp , replaces Richard Syron .
Syron and Mudd will remain as consultants for an undetermined time .
Freddie and Fannie were chartered by the government in an effort to help stabilize the mortgage market by buying loans from lenders .
Fannie Mae was first established in 1938 , during the Great Depression , and Freddie followed in the 1970s .

Events developed really quickly this evening in Davos .
Turkish PM 's wife said Israeli president lied in Davos and she bursted into tears .
“ Everything ( Israeli President Simon ) Peres said was lie , ” Emine Erdogan told reporters in Davos after she burst into tears .
Then , according to AFP , Peres called and apologized to Erdogan .
" Israeli President Shimon Peres apologised by telephone to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Thursday after the latter stormed out of a Davos debate , the Anatolia news agency reported .
" Peres spoke to Erdogan for five minutes and apologised , the news agency said , citing a source close to the Turkish premier . "
In a press with Erdogan the organizer and founder of Davos Forum Schwab said " What is more important is I have to pay tribute his role in the Middle East peace process .
This role gives us hope .
I am very sorry and deeply concerned . "
Erdogan said the following .
" In the panel in the evening Ban ki-Moon spoke fore 15 minutes , I spoke for 12 minutes and Mr. Amr Moussa cut his speech short when it reached to 12 minutes .
" On the other hand President Peres spoke for 25 minutes and during the speech he turned and speak at me at a manner that we do n't see in Davos .
And president Peres raised his voice time to time .
" When I intervened to take the floor the moderator did not allow me to do .
And I showed reaction to the moderator and left the meeting .
I wanted to express these thoughts so that there would be no misunderstanding .
We will talk about this with Mr. Schwab .
My reaction here was towards the moderator .
Such moderation will cast a shadow over peace efforts .
" I have respect for Mr. Peres therefore I did not raise my voice .
Otherwise I would have raised my voice .
He does n't speak truth .
History and political science deny him . "
The President of Israel Shimon Peres will hold a press conference on Friday to address the incident .
However , as we mentioned above he has already called and apologized to Erdogan .
He had said that he raised his voice not because he was angry , but to be heard .
Israeli Turkish Realtions Unlikely To Be Hurt
Turkish based Hurriyet writes that " the impacts of Turkish Prime Minister 's reaction to leave the stage during the Gaza session in Davos with Israeli president are unlikely to be seen directly but it is expected to have indirect effects .
" Erdogan 's reaction unlikely to have direct impact on Turkey - Israel ties .
Tayyip Erdogan 's reaction sent shockwaves in the Turkish foreign ministry .
But it is unlikely Turkey to reduce the level of diplomatic relations such as recalling the ambassador in Tel Aviv , diplomatic sources said . "
Well pothead , you looked ahead at your workday and decided that eight hours of Joe- jobbery was simply too boring to get through sober .
Congratulations dude , you ’ve just joined a demographic known as the “ willingly dumb . ”
If you ’re anything like me ( please dear God let there be others like me ) , your menial job in customer service / administration / lil ’ bitchdom is so terribly unchallenging you need to give your brain a handicap .
As in golf , recommended highness will vary from stoner to stoner , but the main rule is to not be a shithead .
Realize that going to work high can sometimes be even more stressful than regular work .
Chatty coworkers , needy customers , and confusing office appliances can frustrate your already struggling mind , and draw unwanted attention from the higher ups .
But not if you follow these rules , pothead : Blaze Naked - Stoners are always worried about whether they smell like pot .
Do you really reek of “ Green Jamboree , ” or is it all in your head ?
To solve this problem , simply get high BEFORE putting your clothes on .
Yes , this means you ’ll be ass naked sucking from a wildly colored glass pipe at 8:23 am , and whether you count this as a positive or negative is up to you .
In my book , anytime I am simultaneously naked and high is a major plus .
Greet Short -
You ’ve made it to work , but so have your coworkers , and it ’s time to socialize .
This part ’s easy , just do n’t be too long - winded with your morning hellos .
Now is not the time for oral acrobatics ; you ’ve got the forethought of an autistic turtle .
Do not second - guess your ability to pull off a normal “ Good morning Brian , ” and instead giggle out a paragraph of incoherent tangents like a taffy - tongued Bob Dylan .
Basically , the less you say , the less people can judge you by , and believe me , they are judging you .
Constantly .
Something to Stare
At - Your jelly brain will naturally want to zone out , which is fine , but do n’t do it to something stupid , like a stapler .
I agree , both the mechanics and legacy of a Swingline are endlessly fascinating , but that ’s no reason to stare at it for 12 minutes .
Remember ( I know this is asking a lot ) , you need to create the illusion of intellectual presence , so bring a “ smart ” book .
This does not mean a dictionary , but rather something so highfalutin your coworkers wo n’t care to ask you about it , like War and Peace .
Heck , you might even learn something !
( note : you will definitely not learn something ) .
Congratulations ! -
Whew , that was harder than I thought .
Time for another hit .
Oh yeah , in case it comes up , neither you nor I have a problem .
This is youthful folly dammit !
Youthful folly !
Army recruiter to Iraq veteran : President Obama will save you from redeployment RAW STORY
Published : Sunday November 9 , 2008
Print This Email This One Army recruiter has picked up a new tool to attract applicants : President Obama .
VetVoice 's Brandon Friedman was forwarded an e-mail sent to an Iraq veteran and former Army captain encouraging the individual to join a Reserve or National Guard unit on a two - year mobilization deferment to avoid the risk of being redeployed overseas as part of the Individual Ready Reserves .
" A President Elect who says he 'll get us out of Iraq .
What are you waiting for ? " the recruiter asks .
" Stop taking your chance 's ( sic ) in the IRR and be safe from deployment for 2 years .
By that time our new President will have gotten us out of these other countries . "
" So has this career counselor simply gone ' rogue ' on us ?
Or is this going to be the new method by which the Army attracts soldiers into -- and back into -- the ranks ? "
Friedman asked .
" Leaving aside for a moment the fact that the recruiter is making a promise he knows he can't keep , I 'll be honest : I 'd be lying if I said the prospect of an Obama administration had n't made me consider the possibility of rejoining .
So , in essence , this career counselor has probably just taken a logical , reasonable step .
" But larger questions become immediately apparent : Was this career counselor told to use this tactic by his chain of command or not ?
Is this going to be a shift in recruiting Army - wide ?
Is the Army going to use President Obama as a recruiting tool ?
If so , this would symbolize a stunning -- if not totally rational -- renunciation of the Bush administration and its handling of the military .
If this becomes an Army policy , it represents a true ' ding - dong the witch is dead ' moment for the service . "
Today I played with SmallCheck .
Interested in what happened when I tried to find a small unsatisfiable boolean formula that is not easily detected as such ?
Watch my attempts !
( strip .html suffix for executable Haskell file )
Update
After realising that the crucial step to enable SmallCheck to find the formula was not the limitation to conjunctive normal form but the limitation to only two variables , I tried what happens when incorporating this limitation in the original Serial instance for Boolean s :
instance Serial Boolean where series = const [ Var 0 , Var 1 ] \/ cons0 Yes \/ cons0 No \/ cons1 Not \/ cons2 ( :&& : ) \/ cons2 ( : | | : )
Using this instance , SmallCheck finds a counter example at depth three in about 30 seconds :
Depth 3 : Failed test no .
10682586 .
Test values follow .
( Var 0 :&& : Not ( Var 0 ) ) : || : ( Var 1 :&& : Not ( Var 1 ) )
This is a condensed version of the formula found before ( which is the CNF of this one ) .
Seems like by generating only CNFs I was barking up the wrong tree !
It is Drew who is credited with the saying “ He who sells what is n’t his ’n , must buy it back or go to pris’n . ”
For the cornerer , there is also the risk that rules will change when powerful people get in trouble .
That was one of the things that broke the Hunt brothers ’ attempted corner in silver back in 1980 .
The authorities made it almost impossible to bet on silver prices rising , and the Hunts went broke .
Now , from Germany we have a new version of the corner , using derivatives in a way that may have removed much of the risk for the people planning the corner .
Briefly , here are the relevant facts : Porsche , for some reason , wants to control Volkswagen , and has been building up its stake , thereby driving up the price .
Hedge funds , figuring the share price would fall as soon as Porsche got control and stopped buying , sold a lot of VW shares short .
Then last weekend , Porsche revealed that it owned 42.6 percent of the stock , and had acquired options for another 31.5 percent .
It said it wanted to go to 75 percent .
The result : instant short - squeeze .
The German state of Lower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in VW , which it said it would not sell .
That left precious few shares available for anyone else .
The shorts scrambled to cover , and the price leaped from about 200 euros to a high of over 1,000 euros .
VW became the world ’s most valuable company , if you believed that market price .
It appears that Porsche put one over on whoever wrote that option , or options .
The options are said to be cash - settled , although we do not know much more about them than that .
That means Porsche does not have to buy the shares  which it might have a lot of trouble paying for .
Instead , at settlement it merely has to accept the cash difference between the market price and the price it has agreed to pay .
The result could be tens of billions of euros in profits , without the headache of owning shares no one else wants to buy .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Many wind turbines mounted on homes in British cities are contributing to global warming , not fighting it , according to a new study .
And although many environmentally - friendly homeowners also hope to cut their bills by generating their own power , most micro-turbines will never save as much money as the equipment costs , according to the study by the Building Research Establishment Trust .
“ In large urban areas such as Manchester , even with very favorable assumptions about efficiency , lifetime and maintenance , micro-wind turbines may never pay back their carbon emissions , ” the report says .
“ Even in the most favorable location considered in the study , there is no financial payback within the expected life of the systems , with the current system and electricity costs . ”
The study analyzed the likely performance of three of the most common household wind turbines in Manchester and Portsmouth in England and Wick in Scotland .
In many cases -- and across most of Manchester -- more climate - warming carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture , installation and maintenance of the turbines than they save by generating “ green ” power over their expected lifetime .
“ These studies have shown a large variation in the expected CO2 payback periods from a few months in good locations to situations where they never pay back , in poor locations , ” the report says .
Only those climate - conscious homeowners in the best locations in the two smaller cities studied can expect to save more carbon dioxide than their turbines are responsible for producing .
While studies suggest vegans and vegetarians live longer , we all have to go sometime .

Israel 's Looming Catastrophe
For the past three decades , Israel has charted a course that invites its own destruction by relying on two risky propositions : first , that it could extend its security perimeter beyond the reach of a devastating missile attack , and second , that it could permanently control the political debate inside its crucial ally , the United States .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Israel ’s current assault on Gaza is only the latest manifestation of this dangerous strategy , but – whether or not Israel succeeds in its stated goal of stopping the launching of short - range Hamas rockets – the more troubling writing for Israel remains on the wall .
If Israel continues to engender hatred across the Muslim world – and thus feeds the growth of Islamic extremism – eventually some radical government or group will get hold of a missile or some other means of delivering a payload against Tel Aviv that would wreak mass devastation .
In that event , Israel would almost surely turn to its sophisticated nuclear arsenal and launch a massive retaliatory strike .
But to what end ?
Whatever counter - devastation could be delivered , it would not solve the strategic dilemma facing Israel .
Indeed , retaliation would likely make matters worse by engendering even a stronger determination among Muslims to eliminate whatever would be left of Israel .
The situation might even be beyond the military power of the United States to set right .
Yet , this Israeli conundrum is not discussed inside the United States , where – for the past three decades – American neocons have led a powerful propaganda apparatus that demonizes any public figure who dares question hard - line Israeli strategy .
Even Americans with strong affection for Israel are denounced as “ anti-Semites ” or “ pro-terrorist ” if they challenge the Israel - is - always - right conventional wisdom that dominates modern Washington , where Democrats and Republicans alike line up to pander to the annual American - Israel Public Affairs Committee conference .
Former President Jimmy Carter , for instance , has become almost a political pariah although he arguably did more than any U.S. official to advance Israel ’s security by negotiating the Camp David accords in 1978 .
However , it was that event – the agreement between Israel and Egypt , returning the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for a lasting peace commitment – that marked the strategic turning point for both Israel and the United States .
Begin ’s Fury Though Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the peace deal , he was furious over the pressure Carter put on him .
Begin – who had led a Zionist terrorist group before Israel ’s independence in 1948 and founded the right - wing Likud Party in 1973 – decided he must take steps to prevent Carter from pushing for a broader Israel - Arab peace deal in a potential second term .
Begin ’s views were described by Israeli intelligence and foreign affairs official David Kimche in his 1991 book , The Last Option .
Kimche wrote that Begin ’s government believed that Carter was overly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and was conspiring to force Israel to withdraw from the West Bank .
“ Begin was being set up for diplomatic slaughter by the master butchers in Washington , ” Kimche wrote .
“ They had , moreover , the apparent blessing of the two presidents , Carter and [ Egyptian President Anwar ]
Sadat , for this bizarre and clumsy attempt at collusion designed to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967 , including Jerusalem , and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state . ”
Kimche continued , “ This plan – prepared behind Israel ’s back and without her knowledge – must rank as a unique attempt in United States ’s diplomatic history of short - changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation . ”
Begin particularly dreaded the prospect of a second Carter presidential term .
“ Unbeknownst to the Israeli negotiators , the Egyptians held an ace up their sleeves , and they were waiting to play it , ” Kimche wrote .
“ The card was President Carter ’s tacit agreement that after the American presidential elections in November 1980 , when Carter expected to be re-elected for a second term , he would be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms , without having to fear the backlash of the American Jewish lobby . ”
Begin ’s fear of Carter ’s reelection – combined with alarm over Carter 's perceived bungling in Iran where Islamic extremists took power in 1979 – set the stage for secret collaboration between Begin and the Republican presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , according to another Israeli intelligence official , Ari Ben-Menashe .
In his 1992 memoir , Profits of War , Ben-Menashe said the view of Begin and other Likud leaders was one of contempt for Carter .
“ Begin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David , ” Ben-Menashe wrote .
“ As Begin saw it , the agreement took away Sinai from Israel , did not create a comprehensive peace , and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel ’s back . ”
Ben-Menashe , an Iranian - born Jew who had immigrated to Israel as a teen - ager , became part of a secret Israeli program to reestablish its intelligence network in Iran after it had been decimated by the Islamic revolution .
Ben -Menashe wrote that Begin authorized shipments to Iran of small arms and some spare parts , via South Africa , as early as September 1979 .
In November of that year , events in Iran took another troubling turn when Islamic radicals seized the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans hostage , prompting a U.S. trade embargo .
Carter Catches On By April 1980 , however , Carter had learned about the covert Israeli shipments , which included 300 tires for Iran ’s U.S. - supplied jet fighters .
That prompted an angry complaint from Carter to Begin .
“ There had been a rather tense discussion between President Carter and Prime Minister Begin in the spring of 1980 in which the President made clear that the Israelis had to stop that , and that we knew that they were doing it , and that we would not allow it to continue , at least not allow it to continue privately and without the knowledge of the American people , ” Carter ’s press secretary Jody Powell told me .
“ And it stopped , ” Powell said .
At least , it stopped temporarily .
Questioned by congressional investigators a dozen years later , Carter said he felt that by April 1980 , “ Israel cast their lot with Reagan , ” according to notes I found among the unpublished documents in the files of a congressional investigation in 1992 .
Carter traced the Israeli opposition to his reelection to a “ lingering concern [ among ]
Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs . ”
Carter ’s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski also recognized the Israeli hostility .
Brzezinski said the Carter White House was well aware that the Begin government had “ an obvious preference for a Reagan victory . ”
Extensive evidence now exists , too , that Begin ’s preference for a Reagan victory led Israelis to join in a covert operation with Republicans to contact Iranian leaders behind Carter ’s back and delay release of the 52 American hostages until after Reagan defeated Carter in November 1980 .
In his book and in sworn testimony about this so - called “ October Surprise ” controversy , Ben-Menashe asserted that then - vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush personally participated in a key meeting in October 1980 in Paris .
Bush denied that claim at two press conferences in 1992 but was never questioned under oath in any formal government investigation .
More Evidence Since then , additional evidence has emerged linking the senior Bush to the clandestine Republican contacts with Iran during the 1980 campaign .
Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean said he was informed by a well - placed Republican Party source in mid-October 1980 that Bush was heading to Paris for a meeting with Iranians about the hostage crisis .
David Andelman , a former New York Times correspondent who was assisting French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches on his memoir , said deMarenches described arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians in Paris but insisted that be left out of the book for fear it would hurt his friend , George H.W. Bush .
After checking its intelligence files at the request of the U.S. Congress , the Russian government submitted an extraordinary report in January 1993 that identified the senior George Bush as one of several Republicans who negotiated with the Iranians in Paris during the 1980 campaign .
The congressional task force that requested the Russian report as part of its “ October Surprise ” investigation in 1992 never made the report public or even disclosed its existence .
I discovered the Russian document in a storage box left behind by the task force , which – by the time the Russian report arrived – had already decided to “ debunk ” the allegations of a Republican - Iranian hostage deal .
The task force cleared Bush without ever questioning him .
In 1993 , former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , who followed Begin to power in Israel , became another voice endorsing the allegations of a Republican - Iranian “ October Surprise ” deal back in 1980 .
When asked in an interview whether there had been a Republican “ October Surprise ” operation , Shamir responded , “ Of course , it was . ”
[ For details on this mystery , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The 52 American hostages were released on Jan. 20 , 1981 , just as Ronald Reagan was beginning his inaugural address .
Though the allegations of a Republican - Iranian deal have remained in dispute , investigations into the controversy confirmed that Israel did resume military shipments to Iran in 1981 with the knowledge of Reagan - Bush officials who permitted the secret deliveries to go forward .
By the mid-1980s , the Reagan - Bush administration was playing both sides of the Iran - Iraq war , funneling financial and some military support to Iraq while also selling missiles to Iran , both through third countries such as Israel and directly from U.S. stockpiles .
Rise of the Neoconservatives The election of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in 1980 also coincided with the emergence of a political movement known as neoconservatism .
Many neoconservatives had been liberals or even leftists but broke with the Democratic Party in the 1970s to favor a more aggressive policy toward the Soviet Union .
The neoconservatives also wanted a more staunchly pro-Israeli position in the Middle East .
The Reagan - Bush administration rewarded the neocons for their support in the 1980 campaign with their first taste of executive power , giving them credentials that would prove crucial more than two decades later in their ability to push through the Iraq War.
Elliott Abrams and Paul Wolfowitz became assistant secretaries of state in the Reagan - Bush administration .
Abrams now handles Middle East affairs at the National Security Council , and Wolfowitz was an architect of the Iraq policy as deputy secretary of defense .
One of Wolfowitz ’s protégés from the Reagan - Bush era , I. Lewis Libby Jr. , became Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff and a leading hawk on Iraq .
Another key neocon -- and Iraq policy architect -- was Richard Perle , an assistant secretary of defense under Ronald Reagan .
Perle ’s former counsel was Douglas Feith , who returned as under secretary of defense for policy under George W. Bush and strongly promoted the invasion of Iraq .
Besides bringing intellectual firepower to the Reagan - Bush team , the neocons tapped into a powerful right - wing media apparatus that began to take shape in the late 1970s and pushed propaganda that advocated a more aggressive U.S. approach toward Israel ’s “ terrorist ” adversaries in the Middle East .
Over the ensuing three decades , the neocons – and their right - wing Republican allies – came to dominate the Washington news media , especially on Middle East policy .
Critics of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians were routinely denounced as “ anti-Semites ” and found little space on the major editorial pages to argue their positions .
Once the neocons returned to power under George W. Bush ( and especially after the 9/11 attacks ) , the space for any debate shrank further , with anyone who questioned hard - line policies toward Iraq or Israel ’s other Muslim enemies called “ soft on terror . ”
With debate suppressed , the neocons pushed for the invasion of Iraq almost without opposition .
Though the war was pitched as necessary to protect the American people from Iraq ’s supposed stockpiles of WMD , the invasion was viewed by many neocons as necessary to protect Israel ’s long - term security .
The idea was that by transforming Iraq into a permanent base for the American military , U.S. power could be projected throughout the Middle East , forcing “ regime change ” in Iran and Syria and undermining other groups threatening Israel , such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories .
The neocons saw the U.S. military in Iraq as the guarantors against any long - range assault on Israel .
In other words , if Israel could n’t reach some of those distant threats , the United States could .
The neocons also assumed that their tough - talking ways – especially President Bush ’s then - popular swagger – would keep the American people in line with Washington ’s Israel - is - always - right consensus .
Strategic Defeat President Bush ’s strategic defeat in Iraq – defined by the new “ status - of - forces agreement ” that prohibits permanent U.S. bases and insists on a full U.S. withdrawal by the end of 2011 – marks a major turning point in the Middle East .
Plus , the American neocons have been severely damaged domestically by their overreach in Iraq .
Though they remain influential – especially inside the national press corps with control of the Washington Post ’s editorial pages and other influential media outlets – the neocons are increasingly despised by the broad American public .
One of their chief advocates , Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , went down to decisive defeat on Nov. 4 , 2008 , to a political newcomer in Barack Obama , despite right - wing and neocon smear campaigns emphasizing his middle name “ Hussein ” and claiming that he is a secret Muslim who would be sworn in using a Koran .
Though Obama has given the neocons some hope by handing the State Department to the staunchly pro-Israel Hillary Clinton and by keeping on Bush ’s Defense Secretary Robert Gates , the neocons will probably never reclaim the kind of sweeping influence they had during George W. Bush 's presidency .
These new facts - on - the - ground – both in the Middle East and in Washington – add to the imperative for the Israeli people to reassess the three - decade strategy of balking at reconciliation with their Arab neighbors and counting on the neocon dominance of the U.S. political debates .
Israeli leaders might want to do whatever they can to turn back the clock to the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter showed a possible route to long - term security for Israel – by making respectful peace deals with its Arab neighbors .
Rather than trying to bomb and kill their way to security , Israeli leaders might want to consider a new strategy that steps away from endless confrontation with Arab enemies and instead seeks to integrate Israel into the economic life of the Middle East , as a center of science , technology , industry and finance .
Surely , this approach would not be easy .
Given the past three decades of tit - for - tat atrocities , there would be extremists on both sides who would commit additional outrages to derail any progress .
It would have been much easier if Menachem Begin and his successors had understood that some of their greatest American friends were those – like Jimmy Carter – who recognized legitimate interests on both sides of the conflict , rather than those – like George W. Bush – who embraced the most extreme neoconservative positions .
So , whatever the outcome of Israel ’s Gaza offensive , it cannot disguise how untenable Israel ’s long - term position has become .
Even if Hamas ’s little short - range missiles can be silenced for the time - being , the hatreds will continue to fester .
The Arab Street will turn , increasingly , against authoritarian Arab leaders in countries such as Egypt and Jordan who have taken the most moderate positions regarding Israel ’s right to exist .
And beyond Israel ’s immediate neighbors – assuming those mutual hatreds are not defused – Muslim extremists will eventually get hold of a weapon of mass destruction , possibly in Pakistan if its current fragile civilian government falls .
At some point , someone will have a missile or some other means of delivering a powerful weapon against Israel .
Meanwhile , in Washington , Bush and his neocon advisers may have imagined themselves ensuring security for Israel by taking aggressive action against its regional adversaries but have instead worsened Israel ’s predicament .
Now , the neocons find themselves widely discredited inside the U.S. political process .
It is this combination of realities – Bush ’s failed adventurism in the Middle East and the decline of the neoncons at home – that could become the impetus for a new and serious peace initiative in the Middle East , as the best hope for Israel ’s success and survival .

Non-atomic things are not illusions
posted Dec 31 , 2008
in Practical Epistemology
It 's unusual for me to repost something I left as a comment on another site , but I thought this was worth sharing here , even stripped of its context .
Tweaked for posting here .
One of the great dangers of brain research today is that as we find the " explanation " for things , we will conclude they are just illusions and not real .
Well , the thing is , we 're pretty sure at this point then that everything is " an illusion " by this standard .
Religious experience , love , red , pain , it 's all just an illusion brought on by neurons firing in certain patterns , right ?
Moving into the computer realm , the text box I am typing this into is an illusion brought on by clever programming , as is the browser .
It 's not an isolated series of claims of illusoriness , you need to consider the whole of them at once , including not just the politically popular ones ( religion ) , but everything that argument makes sense for ( red , mathematics , scary ) .
I submit to you that this view , while popular , is silly .
How can everything be an illusion ?
That stretches the meaning of " illusion " beyond sensibility .
I propose to you that the " illusion " is in fact the real thing , and what you considered reality was in fact an illusion brought on by your ignorance of how things truly work .
Finding a neural explanation for an experience does not make it illusory , it merely brings it into the fold of things you partially understand , displacing your previous ignorant ideas about what is " real " .
Learning about the various exotic phenomena that can occur with a " self " should cause you to refine your view of self , not discard it .
I believe failing to take this view is extraordinarily dangerous to yourself .
I think the belief that all consciousness and experience is " an illusion " is the sort of pernicious idea up there with Social Darwinism and Eugenics in its capacity for destruction of societies and individuals through the psychological enabling of deeply evil acts towards self and others .
This text box is not an illusion .
It is a text box in every way that matters .
I send it keystrokes , it puts up text , you read it later .
What more do you want ?
Red is not an illusion .
It impinges upon my eyes , I see it and process in certain characteristic manners , all of which are every bit as real as anything else .
The failure that we have is that we come at these ideas with the unspoken belief that these concepts are atomic , that there is an indivisible " self " , an indivisible " red " , and so on .
Thus , when we find these things are in fact not indivisible , we rush to declare them " illusions " .
You can see the same thing in how many people react to the discovery of atoms and the vast amounts of " empty space " in matter with the claim that matter is then an illusion .
Higher levels of organization are not " illusions " merely because they are not atomic .
My car is made of nuts and bolts and fabric and metal , and it is those things , profoundly , but it is also a car .
My brain and self is made of neurons and glia and blood flow and individual firings , but it is also my self , nevertheless .
My text box is no less real for being built twenty layers deep on various more atomic APIs .
To apply this directly to a contentious point , establishing the neural location of religious experiences does prove or disprove them any more than establishing the neural locations of " pain " proves pain is n't real .
To disprove a worldview , you need to use logic of the form " Given your worldview , this fact about the world conflicts " , and " I found your religious experiences in the brain " does n't fit that mould .
Christians , Muslims , and other religions with creator gods will claim that the creator god put the circuits there because they tap something real .
Hindus may not claim a creator god put it there ( I know less about Hinduism ) , but they will still claim it is there because it taps something real .
And so on , for many religions .
I 'm not saying this disproves the atheistic , Darwinistic view of religion the " I found the neurons " discovery engenders for such people .
I 'm saying it does n't disprove most religions to any greater extent , either ; it 's basically null evidence on that front .
( And while I 'm making controversial statements , may I also add that this viewpoint very nicely harmonizes the traditionally disparate " Western " and " Eastern " views of the world , and that they not only need not be at loggerheads but actually fuse into something quite nice .
The traditional Eastern worldview emphasizes the whole over the parts and the Western worldview emphasizes the parts over the whole ; the truth does not lie in between , the truth is that both are true at the same time and that they feed into each other .
East misses the trees for the forest and West misses the forest for the trees ; the ideal is to see both . )

The LA Times Food section embarks on a perilous and ambitious project today : collecting 1,001 recipes featuring that porky product most commonly known as bacon ( less commonly known as " Taste Explosion Happy Fat Yummy Time ! " and " Vegetarians , Weep " ) .
Why bacon ?
Well , apparently because " bacon works so well in so many dishes , from soups and salads to chili and stuffed pork chops " .
Uh , yeah guys : is a pig 's pussy pork ?
Anyway , so far the list is only five items long , but includes such creative ( if questionable ) items as a Candied Bacon Martini ( ew ? ) and a roasted potato salad ( that 's definitely more my steez ) .
They 're welcoming comments and suggestions from readers , so head on over and school those fools on how to add some dazzle to your dinner .
Of course , some contributors are taking the opportunity to advance an agenda : in the category of " missing the point , " we have commenter " Rainey Reitman , " who sanctimoniously requests " some recipes that are n't supporting the industrial factory - farming system that is polluting our waters , causing rampant obesity in our children , impoverishing family farms and torturing animals across America . "
THANKS DEBBIE DOWNER !!
Way to spoil a good time !
You 're not related to LAist commenter " Paul , " by any chance , are you ?
Anyway , dude clearly has n't read his Michael Pollan : it 's corn , not bacon , that 's proving to be the Downfall of Everything in America .
Yes , including the economy !
Including terrorism !
Including the Jonas Brothers ! and Britney 's breakdown !
I say : in this brave , frightening new world where humanely , sustainably raised piggy bellies are pearls beyond price ( although you can get Niman Ranch bacon at Trader Joe 's for a price much much less than pearls ! ) , it is perhaps only bacon that can save us now .
Ok , so that in mind : what are YOUR best bacon recipes ?
( I 'm allowing " Facon " recipes only because Zach " Cult of Vegetarian Masochists " Behrens is holding a virtual gun to my head right now via Gmail ) .
If you 're very nice , I might even tell you how to make the best BLT in the universe .
Answering recent coverage about his health , Steve Jobs has published this letter .
Looks like our source was partly right : Jobs ' condition was the a reason for his Macworld no - show .
But he will get healthier .
Updated

Dear Apple Community ,
For the first time in a decade , I 'm getting to spend the holiday season with my family , rather than intensely preparing for a Macworld keynote .
Unfortunately , my decision to have Phil deliver the Macworld keynote set off another flurry of rumors about my health , with some even publishing stories of me on my deathbed .
I 've decided to share something very personal with the Apple community so that we can all relax and enjoy the show tomorrow .
As many of you know , I have been losing weight throughout 2008 .
The reason has been a mystery to me and my doctors .
A few weeks ago , I decided that getting to the root cause of this and reversing it needed to become my # 1 priority .
Fortunately , after further testing , my doctors think they have found the cause — a hormone imbalance that has been " robbing " me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy .
Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis .
The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment .
But , just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this Spring to regain it .
I will continue as Apple 's CEO during my recovery .
I have given more than my all to Apple for the past 11 years now .
I will be the first one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer continue to fulfill my duties as Apple 's CEO .
I hope the Apple community will support me in my recovery and know that I will always put what is best for Apple first .
So now I 've said more than I wanted to say , and all that I am going to say , about this .
Steve
Without the pretty prose , this is what Jobs ' letter in chronological order :
1 . His weight and health was declining through 2008 .
2 . He recently decided to exclusively focus on discovering the reason of his declining health instead of his company .
3 . The doctors think now that they have discovered the reason .
4 . He has already begun a treatment to fix his illness .
5 . Doctors expect him to be fully cured in spring .
Advertisement
What does this mean ?
First and foremost , that his health is not declining rapidly now , as our source affirmed .
Thank god for that .
Like I said in the original article , I hoped our source was wrong about this point , and it was .
The source 's information was probably from earlier in the year .
While Steve Jobs weight and health was declining during 2008 , the doctors " think " they have now found the cause of his declining health .
He has " already begun " a " relatively simple and straightforward " treatment .
He also says he is recovering .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
That 's excellent news .
Our source was right that a big part of the reason why Steve Jobs is not doing the Macworld 2009 keynote is his health .
The letter above states that he 's putting priority # 1 , his health , ahead of doing the last Macworld Keynote .
The truth , as written by Steve Jobs himself , is that he has to recover from a medical condition .
He did n't want to put himself through the ordeal of preparing the keynote - the hardest part - and delivering it for two hours .
That 's why he decided to take time off with his family and keep recovering .
Advertisement
While there are plenty of other reasons why it makes sense to put other executives on stage — to let the public know that there are other capable people leading apple , for one , or because the products this year are not worthy of Steve 's presentation — none of them make as much sense as this personal decision .
Apple PR muscle tried to mislead the public again saying that the entire reason was the irrelevance of Macworld .
They said they did n't want to give importance to a show that Apple was pulling away from .
Other media , actually only CNBC's Jim Goldman and some followers , railed against Gizmodo saying that Steve 's health had nothing to do with him not showing up for the Macworld keynote :
I spoke to Apple after these headlines crossed and the company , which officially does n't comment on rumors , reiterated the reasons it offered two weeks ago : Apple was pulling out of Macworld because the company did n't see the need to continue its investment in the expo , which included Steve Jobs ' keynote .

While I can understand Apple not telling the truth , perhaps a brilliant journalist and blogging aficionado like Goldman should have known better than trusting Apple 's VP of Worldwide Corporate Communications Katie Cotton , specially when she lied before .
On the other side , coming from a guy who writes things like this :
AppleTV , take two , has a real shot .
The power of technology .
The power of Apple and Steve Jobs .

Well , I 'm not surprised .
Click to viewAnyway , who cares .
I 'm happy to know Steve is recovering and happy to know that he 's doing fine despite his weight loss and health problems .
I 'm happy to know that his doctors have discovered the cause now , and he has already begun treatment .
I - and everyone at Gizmodo - wish his recovery process goes perfectly well and that this spring he 's again in top form .
Advertisement
Update : Apparently Jim Goldman is kind of correcting his previous story on CNBC now .
He said that if they he did n't have information that contradicts what Apple is saying , he had to take the company at its word .
He 's also saying that Steve can be sick but still be able to function as CEO and talking about people who can " easily step in " as CEO : " There are people who can take over , when ...if... he decides to leave . "
[ 2:30 PST , 1/6/09 : A quick note from me , Brian , about this post , which I 've been thinking about a bit more in between the busy days this week planning for CES and Macworld .

A day later , I have a bit more hindsight on how we could have edited this to be a bit more clearly presented .
While the letter above does not factually and outright state that Jobs choose to work on his health instead of Macworld , we find it reasonable to conclude that this is the case , however unpleasant it is to think about .
Allow me to explain the thought process behind this line of reasoning then to people from fellow publications and readers wondering how we came to this conclusion when there is no explicit sentence , just implicit messages , stating such a thing .
A proper challenge deserves a response , and I 'd like to thank everyone who wrote or discussed the piece 's finer points with us .

Ever since we heard that Steve Jobs would not be presenting at Macworld , we were dumbfounded .
Sure , Apple was pulling away from the show , and next year , they are n't doing a keynote at all .
But this year , the Keynote did go on , and the tradition for over 10 years , was for Steve to present , no matter what .
Even when all he had to show was software , even when it was around the time he had cancer , he presented .
Nothing could stop the man .
Based on the text in this letter , which goes just short of contradicting the reasons outright that Apple stated before , and talks entirely about his health in the context of rumors and Macworld , we believe the only thing that could possible stop Jobs from presenting Macworld a company he has his all to for " the past 11 years now " , would be a new " number one " priority , his health .
( The previous number one thing being Apple , the company he 's given everything to . )
Although there are tons of pieces of speculation regarding the other reasons for him not to present at Macworld — distribution of responsibility to execs to reduce the appearance of dependence on jobs , Jobs refusing to present without better products , an Apple / IDG disagreement over the keynote — none of them seem powerful enough to break 11 years of tradition , especially in the tradition 's twilight year .
We consider our source half right because he did make the call that Steve is sick again , and that was a reason for him not presenting at the keynote .
We consider that he got it — and we got it — half wrong because his information said that he was " declining rapidly " , which is n't true any longer since he found a fix for his weight loss .
[ Update : As is was demonstrated later , what Brian 's saying was n't true and the story was , sadly , 100 % right .
He was truly sick at this time but Brian decided to believe Apple 's official line — JD ]
But it was all done to the best of our ability with a source who has checked out multiple times , and hedged because it would be disingenuous to actually say we knew the truth here .
No one does but Steve and his doctor and close friends .
And the fact that he was sick at all is a revelation brought about by these series of posts .
Even if improving , his health is not great .
That is news .
Advertisement
Remember : Apple 's line of reasoning here was that Macworld was not cool enough to attend any more .
They did n't need Macworld .
That may be true , but its crazy to think that this or any of the weaker reasons above are the primary causes here for him to not present .
We believe only health , his number one priority , could stop such a grand tradition , in its twilight year .
And this letter Steve wrote , a huge letter outlining his current state of health , backs that up and lends massive credibility to the theory above all others .
Perhaps the majority of the word count is about his health because he 's only focusing on this in response to the rumors , and dismissing the other minor factors in the decision .
But that does n't change the fact that the letter above so strongly alludes , more than any other interpretation you can dream up , that health was his primary personal factor .
People who disagree might wonder why he did n't outright say he was not doing Macworld because of his health .
But these people should stop to think that he could n't say this was the main reason , because it would contradict previous statements by Apple .
He spared them the actual position of having lied , but I think if you read between the lines , and even read the lines , you can see that this letter is about macworld and his health and the interchange in priorities the man has regarding the two .
They 've swapped .
Advertisement
But these reasons above are why I back up Jesús Diaz 's analysis , reading between the lines and following our source , just as we did last week when we published the fully disclosed , single source rumor about his health being a reason for him not attending macworld in the first place .
Even if I would have written it a bit more softly in the first place , I did not edit it to such a state when I got the story in my hands .
That 's my fault .
As a personal note , I fucking hate this story .
I despise writing about the man 's health , and that 's perhaps a conflict in professional and personal sentiment and responsibility I will never rectify .

I wish we'd never gotten that tip , personally , although I very much appreciate the tipster .
Happy new year , and wishes for good health to Steve and everyone reading this post . ]
[ Macworld 2009 coverage ]
The scandal around the so called investment guru Madoff is the second big case in this year as masses of people have lost their fortune .
The first case was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
Many people are lured to invest their money in financial market instruments that promise attractive yields .
These instruments are , however , as opaque as black boxes .
Hedge funds as black holes
Hedge funds bet with complex structures of derivatives .
Most of them lack the transparency .
The common investors do not understand how they work .
Institutional investors usually invest in funds of hedge funds .
Their managers claim to be capable of picking the promising funds .
Funds of funds absorb a cascade of fees that have to be subtracted from the yield .
There is a wide variety of investment styles among the hedge funds .
It seems that the general lack of transparency of the hedge funds industry has made it possible that the Madoff Ponzi could remain undetected for such a long time .
The Madoff scandal demonstrates also a failure of the SEC as well as of the involved audit firms .
Hedge funds should correlate with other asset classes , e.g. stocks or bonds , according to the theory .
The fact is : Hedge funds have badly performed during the actual financial crisis .
The global hedge - fund industry lost $ 64 billion of assets in November 2008 says Bloomberg .

Structured products as another black hole
Masses of people have lost their savings with structured products that have been issued by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers .
People who have been badly advised to invest their money in a Lehman Brothers productS .
They were persuaded to invest in products that they did not really understand .
Structured products are a combination of a traditional investment ( e.g. shares , bonds , foreign currency , commodities ) and a derivative financial instrument .
There are several types of structured products .
The most popular ones are those that promise full or partial protection of the capital .
The people trust the word “ capital protection ” on the label , but they forget the issuer as a risk factor .
Lehman Brother was an issuer that went bankrupt and thus was not able to fulfill its obligation .
Keep It Smart and Simple
What is the lesson learned from Lehman Brother bankruptcy and the Madoff scandal ?
Structured products and hedge funds are complex and difficult to understand .
They can behave like black holes and absorb the investors ’ fortune .
Even professional and institutional investors did or could not look through it in the case of the Madoff scandal .
The best way to protect the money is to invest in assets that are transparent and easily understandable for everybody .
People are well off who live in their own flat or house .
Residential buildings are the best and safest investment for individuals and institutional investors .
Another safe investment class are investments in government bonds .
Gold is a volatile asset , but gold performs well during times of crisis and war .
Other kinds of investments should be scrutinized cautiously by individuals .
The thumb of rule is : high yield – high risk .
10 Open Source Projects Make the Cut As Rookies of the Year
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 21 , 2009

Black Duck Software released a list of the top 10 projects launched in 2008 that have the most promising future in the open source community .
The company also says if you 're trying to decide which FOSS horse to back in the next year or so , you should put your money on mobile apps .
Black Duck playfully calls the projects the Open Source Rookies of the Year for 2008 and says that of the more than 17,000 new projects released last year , 10 specific ones stand out from the crowd .
While culling the list of freshly - registered projects during 2008 , Black Duck discovered that 47 % use the C programming language , and the number two choice was Java at 28 % .
( Since only 6 % of the projects are written in Ruby , it looks like programmers really are window - shopping . )
They whittled down the massive list by looking at which projects had the most developer activity .
" When a developer has something that they want to share , they tend to wrap it up in a tarball ( or equivalent ) and produce a release .
We would expect projects that support a large number of releases to tend , more often than not , to have a more committed team of talented developers .
Our view is that rookie projects that have a larger number of releases , and thus a greater amount of developer activity , are definitely worth further study , " reads a news release on the company 's Web site .
Black Duck eventually settled on 10 projects that range from anime management software to an authentication / authorization system for RubyOnRails .
Here 's the full list of the rookies that made the cut :
1 ) Beacon Cache - Peer - to - peer file sharing web cache based on Gnutella 2 ) AnimeVision - Anime management software 3 ) Wordpress Themes & Plugins - Themes and plugins for the Wordpress open source blog publishing application 4 ) Artica - postfix - Protects an SMTP mail server from malicious programs and spam 5 ) sorian - ai- mod - A game called " Sorian AI Mod for Supreme Commander : Forged Alliance " 6 ) SysDirector - Configuration management system 7 ) Lockdown - Authentication / authorization system for RubyOnRails 8 ) Bombusmod ( bm2 ) - Modified version of the Bombus instant messaging client for mobile phones 9 ) notefinder - Cross - platform desktop note - taking application 10 ) jbooktrader - Automated trading system for market securities .
Black Duck says also there 's a clear increase in the amount of projects geared toward creating mobile phone apps .
There are more than 120 new open source projects focusing solely on the mobile market and over 40 developed for the iPhone specifically , including a comic viewer and a copy of Wikipedia that requires no network access .
By George Friedman Last Wednesday evening , a group of Islamist operatives carried out a complex terror operation in the Indian city of Mumbai .
The attack was not complex because of the weapons used or its size , but in the apparent training , multiple methods of approaching the city and excellent operational security and discipline in the final phases of the operation , when the last remaining attackers held out in the Taj Mahal hotel for several days .
The operational goal of the attack clearly was to cause as many casualties as possible , particularly among Jews and well - to - do guests of five - star hotels .
But attacks on various other targets , from railroad stations to hospitals , indicate that the more general purpose was to spread terror in a major Indian city .
While it is not clear precisely who carried out the Mumbai attack , two separate units apparently were involved .
One group , possibly consisting of Indian Muslims , was established in Mumbai ahead of the attacks .
The second group appears to have just arrived .
It traveled via ship from Karachi , Pakistan , later hijacked a small Indian vessel to get past Indian coastal patrols , and ultimately landed near Mumbai .
Extensive preparations apparently had been made , including surveillance of the targets .
So while the precise number of attackers remains unclear , the attack clearly was well - planned and well - executed .
Evidence and logic suggest that radical Pakistani Islamists carried out the attack .
These groups have a highly complex and deliberately amorphous structure .
Rather than being centrally controlled , ad hoc teams are created with links to one or more groups .
Conceivably , they might have lacked links to any group , but this is hard to believe .
Too much planning and training were involved in this attack for it to have been conceived by a bunch of guys in a garage .
While precisely which radical Pakistani Islamist group or groups were involved is unknown , the Mumbai attack appears to have originated in Pakistan .
It could have been linked to al Qaeda prime or its various franchises and / or to Kashmiri insurgents .
More important than the question of the exact group that carried out the attack , however , is the attackers ' strategic end .
There is a tendency to regard terror attacks as ends in themselves , carried out simply for the sake of spreading terror .
In the highly politicized atmosphere of Pakistan 's radical Islamist factions , however , terror frequently has a more sophisticated and strategic purpose .
Whoever invested the time and took the risk in organizing this attack had a reason to do so .
Let 's work backward to that reason by examining the logical outcomes following this attack .
An End to New Delhi's Restraint
The most striking aspect of the Mumbai attack is the challenge it presents to the Indian government — a challenge almost impossible for New Delhi to ignore .
A December 2001 Islamist attack on the Indian parliament triggered an intense confrontation between India and Pakistan .
Since then , New Delhi has not responded in a dramatic fashion to numerous Islamist attacks against India that were traceable to Pakistan .
The Mumbai attack , by contrast , aimed to force a response from New Delhi by being so grievous that any Indian government showing only a muted reaction to it would fall .
India 's restrained response to Islamist attacks ( even those originating in Pakistan ) in recent years has come about because New Delhi has understood that , for a host of reasons , Islamabad has been unable to control radical Pakistani Islamist groups .
India did not want war with Pakistan ; it felt it had more important issues to deal with .
New Delhi therefore accepted Islamabad 's assurances that Pakistan would do its best to curb terror attacks , and after suitable posturing , allowed tensions originating from Islamist attacks to pass .
This time , however , the attackers struck in such a way that New Delhi could n't allow the incident to pass .
As one might expect , public opinion in India is shifting from stunned to furious .
India 's Congress party - led government is politically weak and nearing the end of its life span .
It lacks the political power to ignore the attack , even if it were inclined to do so .
If it ignored the attack , it would fall , and a more intensely nationalist government would take its place .
It is therefore very difficult to imagine circumstances under which the Indians could respond to this attack in the same manner they have to recent Islamist attacks .
What the Indians actually will do is not clear .
In 2001 - 2002 , New Delhi responded to the attack on the Indian parliament by moving forces close to the Pakistani border and the Line of Control that separates Indian - and Pakistani - controlled Kashmir , engaging in artillery duels along the front , and bringing its nuclear forces to a high level of alert .
The Pakistanis made a similar response .
Whether India ever actually intended to attack Pakistan remains unclear , but either way , New Delhi created an intense crisis in Pakistan .
The U.S. and the Indo - Pakistani Crisis The United States used this crisis for its own ends .
Having just completed the first phase of its campaign in Afghanistan , Washington was intensely pressuring Pakistan 's then - Musharraf government to expand cooperation with the United States ; purge its intelligence organization , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , of radical Islamists ; and crack down on al Qaeda and the Taliban in the Afghan - Pakistani border region .
Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had been reluctant to cooperate with Washington , as doing so inevitably would spark a massive domestic backlash against his government .
The crisis with India produced an opening for the United States .
Eager to get India to stand down from the crisis , the Pakistanis looked to the Americans to mediate .
And the price for U.S. mediation was increased cooperation from Pakistan with the United States .
The Indians , not eager for war , backed down from the crisis after guarantees that Islamabad would impose stronger controls on Islamist groups in Kashmir .
In 2001 - 2002 , the Indo - Pakistani crisis played into American hands .
In 2008 , the new Indo - Pakistani crisis might play differently .
The United States recently has demanded increased Pakistani cooperation along the Afghan border .
Meanwhile , President - elect Barack Obama has stated his intention to focus on Afghanistan and pressure the Pakistanis .
Therefore , one of Islamabad 's first responses to the new Indo - Pakistani crisis was to announce that if the Indians increased their forces along Pakistan 's eastern border , Pakistan would be forced to withdraw 100,000 troops from its western border with Afghanistan .
In other words , threats from India would cause Pakistan to dramatically reduce its cooperation with the United States in the Afghan war .
The Indian foreign minister is flying to the United States to meet with Obama ; obviously , this matter will be discussed among others .
We expect the United States to pressure India not to create a crisis , in order to avoid this outcome .
As we have said , the problem is that it is unclear whether politically the Indians can afford restraint .
At the very least , New Delhi must demand that the Pakistani government take steps to make the ISI and Pakistan 's other internal security apparatus more effective .
Even if the Indians concede that there was no ISI involvement in the attack , they will argue that the ISI is incapable of stopping such attacks .
They will demand a purge and reform of the ISI as a sign of Pakistani commitment .
Barring that , New Delhi will move troops to the Indo - Pakistani frontier to intimidate Pakistan and placate Indian public opinion .
Dilemmas for Islamabad , New Delhi and Washington
At that point , Islamabad will have a serious problem .
The Pakistani government is even weaker than the Indian government .
Pakistan 's civilian regime does not control the Pakistani military , and therefore does not control the ISI .
The civilians can't decide to transform Pakistani security , and the military is not inclined to make this transformation .
( Pakistan 's military has had ample opportunity to do so if it wished . )
Pakistan faces the challenge , just one among many , that its civilian and even military leadership lack the ability to reach deep into the ISI and security services to transform them .
In some ways , these agencies operate under their own rules .
Add to this the reality that the ISI and security forces — even if they are acting more assertively , as Islamabad claims — are demonstrably incapable of controlling radical Islamists in Pakistan .
If they were capable , the attack on Mumbai would have been thwarted in Pakistan .
The simple reality is that in Pakistan 's case , the will to make this transformation does not seem to be present , and even if it were , the ability to suppress terror attacks is n't there .
The United States might well want to limit New Delhi 's response .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice is on her way to India to discuss just this .
But the politics of India 's situation make it unlikely that the Indians can do anything more than listen .
It is more than simply a political issue for New Delhi ; the Indians have no reason to believe that the Mumbai operation was one of a kind .
Further operations like the Mumbai attack might well be planned .
Unless the Pakistanis shift their posture inside Pakistan , India has no way of knowing whether other such attacks can be stymied .
The Indians will be sympathetic to Washington 's plight in Afghanistan and the need to keep Pakistani troops at the Afghan border .
But New Delhi will need something that the Americans — and in fact the Pakistanis — can't deliver : a guarantee that there will be no more attacks like this one .
The Indian government cannot chance inaction .
It probably would fall if it did .
Moreover , in the event of inactivity and another attack , Indian public opinion probably will swing to an uncontrollable extreme .
If an attack takes place but India has moved toward crisis posture with Pakistan , at least no one can argue that the Indian government remained passive in the face of threats to national security .
Therefore , India is likely to refuse American requests for restraint .
It is possible that New Delhi will make a radical proposal to Rice , however .
Given that the Pakistani government is incapable of exercising control in its own country , and given that Pakistan now represents a threat to both U.S. and Indian national security , the Indians might suggest a joint operation with the Americans against Pakistan .
What that joint operation might entail is uncertain , but regardless , this is something that Rice would reject out of hand and that Obama would reject in January 2009 .
Pakistan has a huge population and nuclear weapons , and the last thing Bush or Obama wants is to practice nation - building in Pakistan .
The Indians , of course , will anticipate this response .
The truth is that New Delhi itself does not want to engage deep in Pakistan to strike at militant training camps and other Islamist sites .
That would be a nightmare .
But if Rice shows up with a request for Indian restraint and no concrete proposal — or willingness to entertain a proposal — for solving the Pakistani problem , India will be able to refuse on the grounds that the Americans are asking India to absorb a risk ( more Mumbai - style attacks ) without the United States ' willingness to share in the risk .
Setting the Stage for a New Indo - Pakistani Confrontation
That will set the stage for another Indo - Pakistani confrontation .
India will push forces forward all along the Indo - Pakistani frontier , move its nuclear forces to an alert level , begin shelling Pakistan , and perhaps — given the seriousness of the situation — attack short distances into Pakistan and even carry out airstrikes deep in Pakistan .
India will demand greater transparency for New Delhi in Pakistani intelligence operations .
The Indians will not want to occupy Pakistan ; they will want to occupy Pakistan 's security apparatus .
Naturally , the Pakistanis will refuse that .
There is no way they can give India , their main adversary , insight into Pakistani intelligence operations .
But without that access , India has no reason to trust Pakistan .
This will leave the Indians in an odd position :
They will be in a near - war posture , but will have made no demands of Pakistan that Islamabad can reasonably deliver and that would benefit India .
In one sense , India will be gesturing .
In another sense , India will be trapped by making a gesture on which Pakistan cannot deliver .
The situation thus could get out of hand .
In the meantime , the Pakistanis certainly will withdraw forces from western Pakistan and deploy them in eastern Pakistan .
That will mean that one leg of the Petraeus and Obama plans would collapse .
Washington 's expectation of greater Pakistani cooperation along the Afghan border will disappear along with the troops .
This will free the Taliban from whatever limits the Pakistani army had placed on it .
The Taliban 's ability to fight would increase , while the motivation for any of the Taliban to enter talks — as Afghan President Hamid Karzai has suggested — would decline .
U.S. forces , already stretched to the limit , would face an increasingly difficult situation , while pressure on al Qaeda in the tribal areas would decrease .
Now , step back and consider the situation the Mumbai attackers have created .
First , the Indian government faces an internal political crisis driving it toward a confrontation it did n't plan on .
Second , the minimum Pakistani response to a renewed Indo - Pakistani crisis will be withdrawing forces from western Pakistan , thereby strengthening the Taliban and securing al Qaeda .
Third , sufficient pressure on Pakistan 's civilian government could cause it to collapse , opening the door to a military - Islamist government — or it could see Pakistan collapse into chaos , giving Islamists security in various regions and an opportunity to reshape Pakistan .
Finally , the United States ' situation in Afghanistan has now become enormously more complex .
By staging an attack the Indian government can't ignore , the Mumbai attackers have set in motion an existential crisis for Pakistan .
The reality of Pakistan cannot be transformed , trapped as the country is between the United States and India .
Almost every evolution from this point forward benefits Islamists .
Strategically , the attack on Mumbai was a precise blow struck to achieve uncertain but favorable political outcomes for the Islamists .
Rice 's trip to India now becomes the crucial next step .
She wants Indian restraint .
She does not want the western Pakistani border to collapse .
But she cannot guarantee what India must have : assurance of no further terror attacks on India originating in Pakistan .
Without that , India must do something .
No Indian government could survive without some kind of action .
So it is up to Rice , in one of her last acts as secretary of state , to come up with a miraculous solution to head off a final , catastrophic crisis for the Bush administration — and a defining first crisis for the new Obama administration .
Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once said that the enemy gets a vote .
The Islamists cast their ballot in Mumbai .
I finished Fallout 3 maybe six or eight weeks ago , and it was hands - down one of the best games I 've ever played .
A game like that gets you in the mood for more gaming , so I thought to myself : " Hey , I should plop down $ 160 for Fable II !
" Actually that 's not exactly what I thought , but it's what happened .
I bought the game for $ 60 , fired it up , got up to the part in the intro where a bird craps on your head ( yes , this is how it starts ) , and it locked up hard .
Reset the XBox , tried again , and this time got as far as some guy selling snake oil gadgets before it locked up again .
Snake oil , indeed .
I tried playing for about an hour , with the game crashing every 3 to 5 minutes , and I finally went online to read about how it kills XBoxes and it's the Game of Death and blah blah blah , all interesting but not especially helpful .
Eventually I stumbled across discussions of the " install to hard drive " option .
Nobody actually said how to do it , so it took another hour of digging to deduce that you need to purchase a $ 100 wireless network adapter ( or 100 feet of network cable , I guess ) .
So I shut it down for the night , waited for the stores to open , forked over the $ 100 , and installed the game to the hard drive .
To Lionhead 's credit the game never crashed again , making it significantly more stable than Oblivion or Fallout 3.I tried hard to like Fable 2 .
I did n't even need to like it $ 160 .
I would have settled for a $ 60 value .
I vaguely remember liking Fable 1 , although I can't remember anything about the game except for one neat scene where you had to escort two NPCs through a dark valley .
One of the NPCs has been bitten by a Balverine ( a werewolf ) , and the two argue the whole trip about whether he 's going to turn .
It 's a funny conversation and the scene has a funny ending .
Other than that , I just have vague recollections of shooting birds on the roof of some guild , and needing to get a 6 - foot handlebar moustache for some side quest .
The rest of it is basically a blank .
But I had set some flag to the effect that " I liked it , " and I wanted to like the sequel too .
Unfortunately , with a few noteworthy exceptions that I 'll call out in the " Highlights " below , the game is entirely forgettable .
It 's already fading from memory as we speak .
It was n't as bad as some people make it out to be .
It 's playable for a couple of days , and it has its fun moments .
But it 's not a very good game , and it 's definitely not a very memorable game .
This is sad , considering the amount of effort that went into its development .
The no-spoiler synopsis of Fable 2 is that it 's a bad Zelda clone .
You can smell the desperation ; there are dozens and dozens of direct rip - offs from the Zelda franchise .
Heck , I would n't have minded a half - decent Zelda clone ; they 're some of the best games of all time .
But Fable 2 misses the mark by a mile .
The humor is juvenile bordering on imbecilic , the hints are hamfisted , the areas are small and cramped , the minigames are lackluster , the music is virtually nonexistent , and the story pacing is rushed and breathless .
It 's a cargo - cult copy of Zelda that winds up having no identifiable soul : forgettable across the board .
I 've given up every piece of Microsoft software and hardware I own except for the XBox , which I had been holding onto just for Fable 2 .
Now that it 's come and gone like a bird crapping on my head , I 'm giving up .
No more XBox or PC games for me .
Ever .
Hence , Fable 2 cost me $ 160 .
I hope you got it for cheaper than that .
Anyway , here 's a quick rundown of the lowlights and highlights of the game , as I see them .
Enjoy !1 ) Fable 2 tries hard to incorporate humor into the game — too hard .
The writers use the trusty old " stopped clock " approach to humor , in which they inundate you with jokes , and 1 out of every 43,200 of them is funny .
Amazingly , this perseverance leads to 3 or 4 genuinely funny ones , mostly near the entrance to the Crucible ( arena ) .
But by the time you get there , you 've already tuned out all attempts at humor and have probably even tried killing yourself a few times .
So they may fail to register . 2 ) .
The game features an old lady who watches everything you do and talks at you constantly .
This starts in the very beginning of the game and lasts until the very end , with no option to turn her off .
Your character can't so much as take a crap without Theresa piping in with helpful advice on which hand to use .
" That is ancient paper .
Be cautious . "
She uses some magical form of communication system that only breaks down in the fog — probably shortwave radio — and there 's no way to turn the fugging thing off .
I really hated Theresa.3 ) .
You can't talk to people .
Instead , the game gives you a series of increasingly repugnant forms of nonverbal communication .
Initially you 're limited to belching , farting , giving people the finger and making lewd pelvic thrusting motions , but as you rise in fame Theresa informs you that you 've earned the right to use the " kiss my ass " expression .
I am not making this up .
I tried to avoid using expressions altogether , but the game forces you to do it once in a while .
Made me want to take a shower . 4 ) .
Fable 2 is nauseatingly saturated .
They just do n't know how to lay off the paint gun .
There are a few OK - ish - ly tasteful areas , such as the big trees in Bower Lake , but most of the game is a frightully garish mix of lime greens , oranges , purples , reds , blues , and general oil - spill iridescence .
It makes you color - blind fast , even if you did n't start that way .
Finding anything onscreen is like trying to spot where someone threw up on a Matisse . 5 ) : the game is unrelentingly linear for the first hour or two ( a _long_ time ) , after which it settles into , well , linearity .
The gameplay occasionally approaches the smashing - through - lines - of - baddies feel of Gauntlet Legends , which I liked , but mostly it makes you feel like a rat running a big maze , following a neverending golden trail of cheese .
A major contributor to the linear feel , even after the game opens up , is the plethora of tiny little fences and obstacles that you can't hop .
It makes it really hard to know where you can walk , and it feels like you 're constantly bumping into things , because , well , you are .
So the game is linear at all resolutions : high ( the plotline ) , medium ( most of the level designs ) and low ( the path designs ) .
Linearity can cramp even the best of games — Kingdom Hearts comes to mind .
It 's just a bad way to design things .
And Fable 's linearity felt especially suffocating after just having finished Fallout 3 , which is immense and wide - open . 6 ) .
It 's been a long time since I played a game whose controls were so accident - prone .
Normally a game 's controls take some getting used to , and then it 's like driving a car .
In Fable 2 , even after days of play , I 'd still be trying to hop a fence and wind up shooting the front door off a mansion , blowing boards everywhere and scaring the shit out of the villagers .
Hell , even when I was trying to buy my final sword ( this was a $ 50 k sword I 'd been looking for all day ) , I tried to bring up the " buy sword " menu for the blacksmith , and I accidentally wound up casting a massive Inferno spell , causing him to literally run screaming across town .
It was weeks of in - game time before I saw him again .
God dammit .
They really should have had different controls in safe zones . 7 ) .
I do n't know what planet these guys have been living on , but giant udders fell out of fashion at least two or three decades ago .
Every single woman in Fable 2 had knockers significantly bigger than her head .
It reminded me of my trip to Paris , where every statue of a woman is bare - breasted , presumably so that you can tell it's a woman — a practice which unfortunately suggests that there 's really no other way to tell .
Dumb French statue - making assholes .
I mean , the people in Fable 1 were ugly — the main character worst of all .
They all had this " I'm a programmer who never gets outdoors " look , and I expected ( and got ) no better from Fable 2 .
But I was really disappointed that every female in the game was a fugging dairy farm .
I mean , someone with some taste and maturity should have a talk with these asshats , and explain to them what women actually look like .
Or they should pick up a frigging Victoria 's Secret catalog or watch a goddamn Target commercial or something .
Jesus .
The milk jug thing ... it was really just too much .
I have zero respect for those jerk - offs at Lionhead . 8 ) .
This was probably the most serious problem with the game .
It was a disease in Fable 1 that went malignant in Fable 2 .
Whoever designed these games was apparently neglected as a child , because the gameplay revolves around gaining " renown " .
Lionhead 's hopelessly adolescent view of " renown " is that villagers should follow you around and say things like " yay ! " and " hurrah ! "
It 's even worse than I 'm making it sound .
They spent so much time coding this crap that they forgot to code pushing into the game : you can't push people out of your way .
So as soon as you wander into a dead - end alley you 're fucked : a bunch of people will crowd in after you asking for autographs and offering you gifts and all this sickening bullshit .
To the game 's credit , and I count this as a highlight , if you pull out your six - barreled rifle , take the safety off , and aim right at their heads , it clears everyone out pretty fast .
You can imagine how desperate I was by the time I tried that approach .
But they coded it correctly , bless ' em.9 ) .
The game just was n't hard , period .
There were no hard fights .
I never died .
I do n't even know what happens when you die in Fable 2 .
I used a couple of Resurrection Phials , but only because I had become so lazy in combat that I did n't care anymore .
This was a serious flaw in the game : it essentially removed the element of fear , which was the only emotion ( other than disgust ) that the game had a chance of evoking .
10 ) Oh man , oh man .
These were probably the low point of the whole game .
They made me want to puke .
I would run past them as fast as I could so I did n't have to listen to their inane drivel .
This was some of the worst game writing I 've ever seen .
I just do n't want to talk about it .11 ) .
They really should have stuck with copying Zelda , and Kingdom Hearts , and Gauntlet : Legends , and all the other games they copied blindly , and badly .
Because whenever they introduced something entirely new , it almost invariably sucked .
Examples ?
OK .
Sure .
Since you asked , and all .
How about the " innovation " that when you eat nearly any food ( and it only takes a few bites ) , you bloat up to the size of Orson Welles , and the only way to get rid of it is to eat celery .
No amount of exercise will make any difference , but eating a few bites of celery makes it go away .
Innovative !
Innovation : you can purchase almost any property in the game .
Is this realistic ?
No .
In reality , not everything would be for sale ( and especially not posted on the front doors ) .
Real - estate transactions would n't be instantaneous .
You would need the owner present to buy something .
Etc , etc .
So given that this feature makes the game less realistic , what purpose does it serve ?
Is it fun ?
No .
Buying real estate is about as fun as attending insurance seminars , so I do n't know what the hell they were thinking .
It could have been fun in the right setting , with suitable other human participants , in a Parker - Bros .
Monopoly kind of way .
Maybe .
But slapping it on the side of an RPG and calling it innovation ?
It boggles the mind .
And what about the the busywork jobs ( blacksmith , woodcutter , bartender ) for making gold ?
Um , dudes -- busywork jobs only exist in MMORPGs to limit per-player CPU usage .
They 're .
" Innovatively " bringing them into a single - player game was just flat - out brain damaged .
12 ) .
What age group is the target market for this game ?
If you enumerate the possibilities , you arrive at the inescapable conclusion that the game was either ( a ) created by imbeciles , or it was ( b ) created for imbeciles , or possibly ( c ) all of the above .
It 's presumably not intended for kids , or you would n't be finding condoms in treasure chests , soliciting and obtaining sex from male and female prostitutes of all shapes and sizes , performing pelvic thrusts to solve quests , and so on .
It 's not for adults either , or you would n't be bombarded with the constant barrage of scatological humor , beginning with the bird shitting on your head , continuing with warnings about " extending the fart command and messing it up " , and going pretty much straight downhill from there .
Is it intended for teenagers , then ?
Poooossibly , but ( a ) that ignores their primary demographic , which is 30 - year - olds , and ( b ) I do n't know any teenagers that are that stupid , nor so hard - up for attention that they need AI villagers to yell " hurray ! " whenever you pass them , even if you 're in a graveyard at midnight .
Dipshits .
This game was designed by dipshits .
The coding was great , the artwork was great , the sound effects were great ; the details were for the most part rock - solid .
But the creative direction was just inexcusably bad .
OK , I 've been pretty tough on the game so far .
Fable 2 did actually have a few genuine highlights worth calling out .
You could even argue that these highlights make the game almost worth playing , in spite of all the crap you have to suffer through in order to get to them .
1 ) Fable 2's banshees are , in a word , awesome .
I 've been racking my brain trying to think of a VG monster as cool as these banshees in any game I 've ever played .
I 'm coming up with a few ties , but nothing that beats them .
The YouTube videos do n't come close to doing them justice .
Fable II is worth playing just to get to Wraithmarsh .
The only real problem with the banshees is that since none of the combat is challenging ( see Lowlight # 9 ) , they 're nowhere near as scary as they could have been .
But they 're amazingly stylish .
I 'd call them an innovation , but I 'm inclined to believe Lionhead stole their basic design from some other game , given all the other copying they 've done .
( The Fable 2 Trolls , for instance , are about as Zelda - clone - esque as you can get without inviting a lawsuit . ) 2 ) , where he addresses the recruits .
Really great speech .
Riveting and convincing .
Amazing how Microsoft - run studios that are so consistently bad at humor are so good at creating convincingly evil speeches about taking over the world .
Actually the whole centerpiece drama in the tower was very nicely done .
I have to give them credit for that part of the game : it was exceptional by any standard .
It basically saved the game from being a total loss .3 ) .
She 's cool .
Great voice acting , surprisingly good scripting , neat character , lots of depth .
One of the better - realized VG supporting characters I 've seen in many years .
4 ) Apparently there was a lot of hype about the dog .
Or so I hear , after actually having played the game .
Whatever the hype , the reality is that it's a very believable dog .
I especially liked how it would run ahead of you -- I 've seen pets that follow you , but the dog would often anticipate your direction and run ahead , kinda turned back towards you like " c'mon ! let 's go ! "
I encountered no glitches with the dog ; the coding was rock solid .
Overall it was , well , very ... doggy .
And what more could you ask for in a dog , really ?
As a tribute to the believability of the dog , I 'll offer a minor spoiler .
( Skip ahead if you do n't want a spoiler ! )
At the end of the main storyline , you are granted one wish .
Your choices are : ( a ) get all the people who died back , ( b ) get your dog back , or ( c ) get a bunch of money .
What I really wanted was a sort of amalgam of the 3 choices : I wanted my money back for this dog of a game .
But when push came to shove , I picked the dog .
I kinda missed him .
5 ) Overall the architecture was really nice .
The only somewhat dubious exception was Bowerstone , which looks almost exactly like Euro Disney .
I kept expecting Tigger to come waltzing around , cursing in French under his breath , just like he did on my real - life trip to Euro Disney a few years back .
Other than the Euro Disney influence , which I could take or leave , I thought the architecture was nice throughout the game .
I liked the waterfront town of Bloodstone .
I liked the manors in Oakfield .
I liked the gypsy wagons .
I liked the vendor carts .
I loved pretty much every creepy structure in Wraithmarsh .
The overall look of the game was beautiful , once you got past the color - saturation problem , and the architecture was a huge contributor . 6 ) .
Unlike in Fable 1 , most of the music in Fable 2 is forgettable background / atmosphere music .
They did n't get Danny Elfman this time around , and it shows .
The theme for Bower Lake is nice as far as it goes , which is exactly 2 chords over and over and over .
But it 's still OK .
The rest of the music did n't leave any sort of impression on me at all , except for the fight music , which almost made up for everything .
It was very good .
There were at least two fight themes and both of them were cool .
If only the rest of the music had been ... present .
It was like it was n't even there .
It phoned in its performance .
Folks at Dorkhead studios : Zelda 's music is one of the top five reasons for its success as a franchise .
Same goes for Mario and Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy .
Their music is always great , and it 's always in your face .
The music is n't muttering or mumbling ; it 's shouting .
And they can get away with it because it 's always great .
Even when it 's bad or annoying , which is rare , the music still anchors each place and event in the game in your memory , in a way that only music can .
You guys really screwed the pooch on this one . 7 ) .
They did a great job of setting things up so that you could use melee , ranged weapons and magic effectively in combat .
It was refreshing to be able to switch styles in mid-fight : you could use your sword to kill everything near you , then start blasting everything ten feet or more distant with your rifle .
Or you could clear a little space and cast a time - slowing spell , and then just start zinging around whaling on bad guys .
The combat was never hard , but it was on the whole fairly satisfying .
The downside of ultra -convenient access to melee , range weapons and spells was that you could effortlessly use them all simultaneously while trying to buy vegetables from a produce stall in the main market .
I really wish they 'd made it just a teeny bit harder to cast spells in public areas .
8 ) I thought of some more lowlights , though : long area loads , unresponsive controls during " scenes " , only a handful of available spells , months of coding / design effort wasted on useless features like " groin shots " and tatoos ... Oh , and the lack of control over when quest scenes actually unfold — they trigger from proximity to the relevant NPC rather than interacting with the NPC because , oh , that 's right , you can't interact with anyone except to fart on them or give them the finger .
Oops !
So you 're always accidentally wandering into a dungeon that triggers some quest , and there 's no way out except to back entirely out of that phase of the quest , which may involve losing hours of your time , all because you walked through the wrong door .
Damn that pissed me off .
And how the hell do you sleep in an Inn ?
I never managed to figure it out .
I 'd wind up spending $ 10 k for some hovel just to get a frigging bed to sleep in .
It was amazingly bad UI design , if there even is a way to do it .
If not , then their helpful tutorial message lied to me at least a dozen times .
Argh .
Well , this highlights section is going downhill in a hurry , so I think I 'll end it here .
Maybe , maybe .
But compared to Fallout 3 , Fable 2 pretty much sucked .
It had a couple of nice features , but they were drowned in an ocean of painfully adolescent design .
Such a shame .
I 've tried to be fair here .
I do n't mean to discourage you from playing the game , since for all I know there 's nothing better out there right now .
If you do decide to play it , I hope I 've set your expectations very low .
That way , well , who knows ?
You might actually have some fun with it .
But if you open even one of those Demon Doors I 'll lose all respect for you .
Once in a while a person might like to encrypt a file for security purposes .
In Linux it is real easy to create good encryption using openssl with the Triple - DES Cipher . :
openssl des3 - salt - in unencrypted - data.file \ - out encrypted-data.file.des3
After entering this command , openssl will ask for you to enter the password twice .
And decryption is likewise :
openssl des3 -d - salt - in encrypted-data.file.des3 \ - out unencrypted-data.file
Warning :
Make sure you do n’t accidentaly reverse the file names in the decryption process or you ’ll lose all your data !
Remembering this command though is the tricky bit so I decided to create a couple bash scripts that made the process thoughtless .
I named the bash scripts “ crypten ” and “ cryptde “ .
#!/bin/bash # crypten - a script to encrypt files using openssl FNAME = $ 1 if [ [ -z " $ FNAME " ] ] ; then echo " crypten < name of file > " echo " - crypten is a script to encrypt files using des3 " exit ; fi openssl des3 - salt - in " $ FNAME " - out " $ FNAME .des3 "
The filename ends with .des3 to be easy to recognize .
#!/bin/bash # cryptde - a script to decrypt files using openssl FNAME = $ 1 if [ [ -z " $ FNAME " ] ] ; then echo " cryptde < name of file > " echo " - cryptde is a script to decrypt des3 encrypted files " exit ; fi openssl des3 -d - salt - in " $ FNAME " - out " ${ FNAME % .[ ^. ]* } "
I like to put my bash scripts in a ~ /.bin folder .
Do n’t forget to make both files executable :
chmod +x crypten cryptde
This shouldhelp make encrypting / decrypting files easier .
I spotted this graffiti on the side of Tyvek - clad 1111 E. Pike earlier this summer ( July 4 , 2008 ) .
It was up for less than 24 hours before it was painted over .
I ’m guessing that this was done by a downtown resident who set up a telescope pointed at the West - facing side of 1111 E Pike , but I ’d love to hear the real story , if anybody knows it .

James Lovelock thinks humanity has only one remaining option to halt climate change and save ourselves ( Image : Eamonn McCabe / Camera Press )
With his 90th birthday in July , a trip into space scheduled for later in the year and a new book out next month , 2009 promises to be an exciting time for James Lovelock .
But the originator of the Gaia theory , which describes Earth as a self - regulating planet , has a stark view of the future of humanity .
He tells Gaia Vince we have one last chance to save ourselves – and it has nothing to do with nuclear power …
Giedrius inquires via email :
yesterday I argued with friends about statism and got from them such an argument : State is the same as corporation .
All people of particular area own all land in this area , they elect board of directors ( government ) which makes rules by which this land can be used .
If board of directors decide that you can live on the property of this company ( state ) only if you buy whole packet of services provided by this company ( state ) , you have a choice to agree or to go to the other company ( state ) which meet your needs better .
I have my arguments about this , but would be very interesting to hear yours .
The government - as - trustee / steward argument is closely related to the argument from Social Contract .
If you ’re interested in my opinions on that matter , I ’d suggest the following posts :
The particular argument Giedrius relays is a pretty common Statist objection .
It is 100 % wrong , for the simple fact that , as Oppenheimer noted , no government was ever established in such a manner .
There are other issues which one might ultimately raise , including but not limited to issues regarding the severability of jointly - held property , the impossibility of buying out one ’s stake in “ the corporation ” in the same manner one might buy out a partner in business , etc .
However , as long as the necessary precondition ( i.e. , a “ state ” formed by voluntary means as set forth in the argument above ) does not hold , these further objections are not worth mentioning except in passing .
The people who disapprove of the State are always askedforced to leave , thus ensuring support among those who remain .
( cf. If You Do n’t Like It , Get the F**k Out ! )
At the very least , this argument subordinates whatever “ ownership ” rights they might ’ve held in the State , which neatly invalidates the outmoded principles of “ equality ” or “ justice ” , sacrificing both in order to appease the false god of Democracy .
Suggesting that the would - be secessionist is obligated to move ( to another State , mind you ! ) is tantamount to saying that he is not , nor was he ever in any meaningful sense , one of the alleged “ owners ” of the State ; he will surely not be compensated for his “ share ” of the ownership .
He cannot “ sell ” the share which he presumably owns , and he cannot “ buy ” his share from the others .
He cannot even say , “ It ’s not worth the trouble : I ’m going to peacefully resume my own life and privately secede in a non-violent , inoffensive manner . ”
This is quite the paradox , indeed .
Interestingly enough , were he to mount a violent rebellion against the State , they would decry him as a criminal or a terrorist .
This is interesting , because conquest is essentially the only claim to title recognized by the State , and it is in all likelihood the very foundation of the title it unilaterally claims .
A further , and significant difference between the State and the corporation ( left - libertarian quibbles , aside ) is the fact that the State claims absolute monopoly over a certain geographic area , which it defines for itself and which are enforced by violence in all cases .
Additionally , the State claims ( for itself , of course ) the unique privilege of being the sole and final arbiter of all disputes arising within its borders , including those disputes to which the State itself is party ( Hoppe ) .
As I argued in Why Ca n’t We Secede ?
How embarrassingly nonsensical is it , for a group of men to say , “ We want you to be a part of our group , our enlightened ‘ Society ’ so badly that we ’re willing to kill you if you reject our offer ? ”
Of course , by “ offer ” what they really mean is , “ You ’re going to pay us for a bunch of things you do n’t want , simply because we ca n’t ( or do n’t want to figure out how to ) unbundle the “ services ” we allegedly provide for your benefit . ”
That X happens to be a “ public ” good ( which is in most cases a “ club ” good ) , is not sufficient moral justification for the levying of taxes .
I concluded that post the same way I will conclude this one :

Igniting a provocative new debate , senior military officials are pushing the Pentagon to go on the offensive in cyberspace by developing the ability to attack other nations ’ computer systems , rather than concentrating on defending America ’s electronic security .
Under the most sweeping proposals , military experts would acquire the know - how to commandeer the unmanned aerial drones of adversaries , disable enemy warplanes in mid-flight and cut off electricity at precise moments to strategic locations , such as military installations , while sparing humanitarian facilities , such as hospitals .
An expansion of offensive capabilities in cyberspace would represent an important change for the military .
For years , U.S. officials have been reluctant to militarize what is widely seen as a medium for commerce and communication -- much like space .
But a new National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations , declassified earlier this year , fueled the Pentagon debate and gave the military a green light to push for expanded capabilities .

The monthslong debate took on added urgency after the electronic attacks that coincided with the Russian military ’s early August push into Georgia and reflects a newfound uncertainty over the state of global cyber - warfare capabilities .
Military officials have not concluded whether the electronic network attacks in Georgia were coordinated by Moscow or were the work of freelance hackers or paramilitary groups .
Still , the use of cyberspace by Russia and other countries is drawing intense scrutiny by the Pentagon .
“ As we go forward in time , cyber is going to be a very important part of our war - fighting tactics , techniques and procedures , ” said Michael W. Wynne , a former Air Force secretary .
Under Wynne , the Air Force established a provisional Cyber Command in 2007 and made operating in the cyber domain part of its mission statement , on par with air operations .
Wynne clashed with superiors over the Air Force approach to cyberspace and other issues and was fired in June after breakdowns in U.S. nuclear weapons security procedures .
New Air Force leaders now are reassessing plans for a permanent Cyber Command , which under Wynne ’s leadership would have included some offensive capabilities .

Most other U.S. efforts focus on defending military and government networks and mining international systems for intelligence .
Both the Army and Navy have long - standing operations but primarily focus on intelligence gathering .
The Army , in particular , has used a variety of electronic networks to gather intelligence on insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The most advanced expertise on operating in cyberspace is held by the National Security Agency , the Defense Department intelligence arm that monitors foreign phone calls , e-mails and other communication .
A senior defense official said the NSA “ is where the mother lode of expertise is .
Those are the folks that have been looking at the capability for the longest period of time . ”
Overseeing all of these various military efforts in cyberspace is the Defense Department ’s Strategic Command , which is primarily responsible for the nation ’s nuclear arsenal .
Several senior Pentagon officials would discuss the Defense Department ’s cyberspace work only if their names were withheld because of sensitive intelligence issues .
But officials involved in the cyberspace debate are sparring over not only what to do but who within the military should do it .

Because of the difficulty of training cyber - warriors and the need to closely monitor their work long term , many top Pentagon officials believe that the most advanced cyber - experts should remain at the NSA .
A senior Pentagon official said that “ exploiting ” computer networks to gather intelligence is currently the most important use of cyber - power .
“ Clearly , the exploitation activities have been preeminent , ” the official said .
But citing Russia ’s use of cyberspace , some current and former officials believe that the U.S. military services , if allowed , could move beyond intelligence gathering and develop a broad array of offensive capabilities that would fit well with conventional combat .
“ Let ’s not mistake intelligence collection with military operations , ” said Lani Kass , a senior Air Force official and former director of the service ’s Cyberspace Task Force .
“ The mission of the NSA is to collect signals intelligence , and it is very good at it .
But the NSA is not a war - fighting organization . ”

If the military is allowed to develop more advanced cyber - warfare methods , the United States would be able to routinely launch an airstrike at a target and simultaneously use an electronic attack to disable defenses or spread disinformation , said Wynne , the former Air Force secretary .
“ It is n’t just about protecting your networks , ” Wynne said .
“ It is about having a soldier with an invasive tool he can fire at an antenna , and put some information into it , and from there do some damage . ”
While declining to specify every cyberspace activity they might want to develop , military officials emphasized that all such efforts would be governed by the laws of war and international treaties .
Other senior officials are skeptical of what they see as “ Buck Rogers ” scenarios and argue that defending U.S. computer systems is more urgent .
The Pentagon is probed every day by hackers and would - be cyber - intruders , making protection of military networks the top priority , said the senior defense official .
Advertisement
More importantly , potential U.S. adversaries are unlikely to depend on electronic networks as much as the Pentagon does , the official said .
That means defending U.S. capabilities is more vital than disrupting enemy capabilities .
“ The United States , more than any other military , is a Net- centric operation , ” the senior official said .
“ Any adversary we would tend to go after -- anyone we can currently foresee -- would n’t use it to the same extent .
Therefore , defending that capability and making sure it is not denied to you -- that has to be critical . ”
To some , the tension over cyberspace echoes military debates through the centuries .
Maj. Gen. William T. Lord , head of the Air Force cyber - effort , said that such discussions were akin to an old military puzzle known as “ intelligence gain - loss . ”
“ Do you not destroy a target because you can exploit it ?
Or do you destroy the target -- and lose the ability to exploit -- because troops are in harm ’s way ? ”
Lord said .
“ That is not a debate .
It is a discussion that goes on in war fighting . ”

Wynne agrees that there will always be such arguments .
But unless the military services are given the resources to develop strong offensive capabilities , top officials will not have the option of using them , he said .
“ This is all about preparedness and making sure the U.S. military is awake and alert , ” Wynne said .
“ And I say : Make sure we can do it to them before they can do it to us . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama is considering issuing an executive order to reverse a controversial Bush administration abortion policy in his first week in office , three Democratic sources said Monday .
Obama 's second full day as president falls on the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the United States .
Do n't Miss High expectations for Obama inaugural address
The sources said Obama may use the occasion to reverse the " Mexico City policy " reinstated in 2001 by Bush that prohibits U.S. money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information , counseling or referrals about abortion services .
It bans any organization receiving family planning funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development from offering abortions or abortion counseling .
The " Mexico City policy , " commonly referred to by critics as " the global gag rule , " was devised by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 at a population conference in Mexico City .
President Bill Clinton lifted the ban in January 1993 as one of his first acts as president , but President George W. Bush reinstated it in his first executive order on January 22 , 2001 , the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
At the time , critics -- including Planned Parenthood -- called the move a " legislative ambush . "
Bush defended the action , saying then : " It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortion or actively promote abortion . "

The Stig(s ) unmasked : Top Gear use FOUR different mystery test drivers
To viewers of Top Gear , the Stig is a mystery - part man , part machine with his face always hidden by a helmet .
Speculating on the identity of the driver , who posts lap times for cars being reviewed and trains celebrities to race round a circuit , has become part of the BBC2 show 's mythology .
But today it can be revealed that the BBC employs at least four drivers to don his pristine racing whites .
Revealed : One of Top Gear 's Stigs has been identified as former racer Ben Collins
The truth came out after a possible name of one of the drivers was disclosed as Ben Collins , a 33 - year - old Bristol - based former American speedway driver and stuntman who doubled for Daniel Craig in the latest James Bond film .
Suspicions were raised that he might not be the only Stig after pictures emerged yesterday showing a separate man the BBC claimed to be the Stig attending the National Television Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on October 29 last year .
This Stig - dressed of course head to toe in racing whites and hiding behind a black visor - drove after the awards to the BBC HQ of Top Gear .
Eyewitnesses told how that Stig entered the studio late at night to change and was soon after pictured emerging from the building in jeans and teeshirt with a distinctive tight - fitting ' Arai ' motor - racing woolly hat pulled over the top of his head .
Man behind the mask :
The driver , pictured in his racing gear , let slip his big secret in the unlikely setting of an art store in Bristol
With perhaps a hint of irony , the tee - shirt , now available on high streets carried the slogan ' I Am The Stig ' .
The man in question went by the name of ' Will ' .
The trail heated up yesterday when a Top Gear source offered up another name .
Julian Bailey , a 47 year - old formula one driver who raced with Tyrrell and Lotus teams was also claimed to be currently working as Stig .
There is one more unidentified Stig on the loose .
Further possible Stigs are also rumoured to take over when the other drivers ' schedules were full .
A source on the show added : ' Look at the pictures of the Stigs from show to show .
If you look at the height of Stig in different pictures , that tells its own story .
Need for speed : Ben Collins racing under his real identity
' In some he looks a lot taller than others .
People have become obsessed with finding who the Stig is but they have not considered that it is possible that it is more than one person .
' The simple fact of the matter is that there are currently four Stigs who drive on the test track .
' Since the Stig first drove on the show , it has never been practical to have one single driver taking care of all the Stig 's many commitments . '
The source added there was frustration at the repeated attempts to identify the mystery driver .
He said : ' We love to have the mystery around who he is .
I just wish people would give it a rest , it 's like telling people there is no Father Christmas .
‘ All the kids that come to meet the Stig they want to believe he is a robot with magnetic knees . '
A BBC spokesman said : ‘ We never comment on speculation as to whom or what the Stig is . ’

500 BC BUDDHA , THE WORD ( The Eightfold Path ) THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS THUS has it been said by the Buddha , the Enlightened One :
It is through not understanding , not realizing four things , that I , Disciples , as well as you , had to wander so long through this round of rebirths .
And what are these four things ?
They are the Noble Truth of Suffering , the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering , the Noble Truth of the Extinction of Suffering , the Noble Truth of the Path that leads to the Extinction of Suffering .
As long as the absolutely true knowledge and insight as regards these Four Noble Truths was not quite clear in me , so long was I not sure , whether I had won that supreme Enlightenment which is unsurpassed in all the world with its heavenly beings , evil spirits and gods , amongst all the hosts of ascetics and priests , heavenly beings and men .
But as soon as the absolutely true knowledge and insight as regards these Four Noble Truths had become perfectly clear in me , there arose in me the assurance that I had won that supreme Enlightenment unsurpassed .
And I discovered that - profound truth , so difficult to perceive , difficult to understand , tranquilizing and sublime , which is not to be gained by mere reasoning , and is visible only to the wise .
The world , however , is given to pleasure , delighted with pleasure , enchanted with pleasure .
Verily , such beings will hardly understand the law of conditionality , the Dependent Origination of every thing ; incomprehensible to them will also be the end of all formations , the forsaking of every substratum of rebirth , the fading away of craving ; detachment , extinction , Nirvana .
Yet there are beings whose eyes are only a little covered with dust : they will understand the truth .
FIRST TRUTH THE NOBLE TRUTH OF SUFFERING WHAT , now , is the Noble Truth of Suffering ?
Birth is suffering ; Decay is suffering ;
Death is suffering ; Sorrow , Lamentation , Pain , Grief , and Despair , are suffering ; not to get what one desires , is suffering ; in short : the Five Groups of Existence are suffering .
What , now , is Birth ?
The birth of beings belonging to this or that order of beings , their being born , their conception and springing into existence , the manifestation of the groups of existence , the arising of sense activity - this is called Birth .
And what is Decay ?
The decay of beings belonging to this or that order of beings ; their getting aged , frail , grey , and wrinkled ; the failing of their vital force , the wearing out of the senses - this is called Decay .
And what is Death ?
The parting and vanishing of beings out of this or that order of beings , their destruction , disappearance , death , the completion of their life - period , dissolution of the groups of existence , the discarding of the body - this is called Death .
And what is Sorrow ?
The sorrow arising through this or that loss or misfortune which one encounters , the worrying oneself , the state of being alarmed , inward sorrow , inward woe - this is called Sorrow .
And what is Lamentation ?
Whatsoever , through this or that loss or misfortune which befalls one , is wail and lament , wailing and lamenting , the state of woe and lamentation this is called Lamentation .
And what is Pain ?
The bodily pain and unpleasantness , the painful and unpleasant feeling produced by bodily contact - this is called Pain .
And what is Grief ?
The mental pain and unpleasantness , the painful and unpleasant feeling produced by mental contact - this is called Grief .
And what is Despair ?
Distress and despair arising through this or that loss or misfortune which one encounters , distressfulness , and desperation - this is called Despair .
And what is the " suffering of not getting what one desires ? "
To beings subject to birth there comes the desire : " O that we were not subject to birth !
O that no new birth was before us ! "
Subject to decay , disease , death , sorrow , lamentation , pain , grief , and despair , the desire comes to them : " O that we were not subject to these things !
O that these things were not before us ! "
But this can not be got by mere desiring ; and not to get what one desires , is suffering .
THE FIVE GROUPS OF EXISTENCE
And what , in brief , are the Five Groups of Existence ?
They are Corporeality , Feeling , Perception , [ mental ]
Formations , and Consciousness .
Any corporeal phenomenon , whether one 's own or external , gross or subtle , lofty or low , far or near , belongs to the Group of Corporeality ; any feeling belongs to the Group of Feeling ; any perception belongs to the Group of Perception ; any mental formation belongs to the Group of Formations ; all consciousness belongs to the Group of Consciousness .
[ Our so - called individual existence is in reality nothing but a mere process of these " bodily and mental " phenomena , which since immemorial times was going on before one 's apparent birth , and which also after death will continue for immemorial periods of time .
In the following , we shall see that these five Groups , or Khandhas - either taken separately , or combined - in no way constitute any real " Ego-entity , " and that no Ego - entity exists apart from them , and hence that the belief in an Ego - entity is merely an illusion .
Just as that which we designate by the name of " chariot , " has no existence apart from axle , wheels , shaft , and so forth : or as the word " house " is merely a convenient designation for various materials put together after a certain fashion so as to enclose a portion of space , and there is no separate house - entity in existence :- in exactly the same way , that which we call a " being , " or an " individual , " or a " person , " or by the name is nothing but a changing combination of physical and psychical phenomena , and has no real existence in itself . ]
THE " CORPOREALITY GROUP " OF FOUR ELEMENTS
What , now , is the Group of Corporeality ?
It is the four primary elements , and Corporeality derived from them .
And what are the four primary elements ?
They are the Solid Element , the Fluid Element , the Heating Element , the Vibrating Element .
[ The four elements , or - to speak more correctly - the four elementary qualities of matter , may be rendered in English as : Inertia , Cohesion , Radiation , and Vibration .
The twenty - four corporeal phenomena which depend upon them are , according to the Abhidharma : eye , ear , nose , tongue , body , visible form , sound , odor , taste , masculinity , femininity , vitality , organ of thinking , gesture , speech , space ( cavities of ear , nose , etc. ) , agility , elasticity , adaptability , growth , duration , decay , variability , change of substance . ]
1 . What , now , is the Solid Element ?
The solid element may be one 's own , or it may be external .
And what is one 's own solid element ?
The dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are hard and solid , as the hairs of head and body , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidneys , heart , liver , diaphragm , spleen , lungs , stomach , bowels , mesentery , excrement , or whatever other dependent properties which on one 's own person and body are hard and solid - this is called one 's own solid element .
Now , whether it be one 's own solid element , or whether it be the external solid element , they are both only the solid element .
And one should understand , according to reality , and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
2 . What , now , is the Fluid Element ?
The fluid element may be one 's own , or it may be external .
And what is one own fluid element ?
The dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are watery or cohesive , as bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , lymph , tears , semen , spit , nasal mucus , oil of the joints , urine or whatever other dependent properties which on one own person and body are watery or cohesive - this is called one 's own fluid element .
Now , whether it be one 's own fluid element , or whether it be the external fluid element , they are both only the fluid element .
And one should understand , according to reality , and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
3 . What , now , is the Heating Element ?
The heating element may be one own , or it may be external .
And what is one 's own heating element ?
The dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are heating and radiating , as that whereby one is heated , consumed , scorched , whereby that which has been eaten , drunk , chewed , or tasted , is fully digested ; or whatever other dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are heating and radiating this is called one 's own heating element .
Now , whether it be one 's own heating element , or whether it be the external heating element , they are both only the heating element .
And one should understand , according to reality , and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
4 . What , now , is the Vibrating Element ?
The vibrating element may be one 's own , or it may be external .
And what is one 's own vibrating element ?
The dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are mobile and gaseous , as the upward - going and downward - going winds ; the winds of stomach and intestines ; in - breathing and out - breathing ; or whatever other dependent properties , which on one 's own person and body are mobile and gaseous - this is called one 's own vibrating element .
Now , whether it be one 's own vibrating element , or whether it be the external vibrating element , they are both only the vibrating element .
And one should understand , according to reality , and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
Just as one calls " hut " the circumscribed space which comes to be by means of wood and rushes , reeds , and clay , even so we call " body " the circumscribed space that comes to be by means of bones and sinews , flesh and skin .
DEPENDENT ORIGINATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Now , though one 's eye be intact , yet if the external forms do not fall within the field of vision , and no corresponding conjunction takes place , in that case there occurs no formation of the corresponding aspect of consciousness .
Or , though one eye be intact , and the external forms fall within the field of vision , yet if no corresponding conjunction takes place , in that case also there occurs no formation of the corresponding aspect of consciousness .
If , however , one 's eye is intact , and the external forms fall within the field of vision , and the corresponding conjunction takes place , in that case there arises the corresponding aspect of consciousness .
Hence , I say : the arising of consciousness is dependent upon conditions ; and without these conditions , no consciousness arises .
And upon whatsoever conditions the arising of consciousness is dependent , after these it is called .
Consciousness whose arising depends on the eye and forms , is called " eye-consciousness . "
Consciousness whose arising depends on the ear and sound , is called " ear- consciousness . "
Consciousness whose arising depends on the olfactory organ and odors , is called " nose-consciousness . "
Consciousness whose arising depends on the tongue and taste , is called " tongue-consciousness . "
Consciousness whose arising depends on the body and bodily contacts , is called " body- consciousness . "
Consciousness whose arising depends on the mind and ideas , is called " mind-consciousness . "
Whatsoever there is of " corporeality " in the consciousness thus arisen , that belongs to the Group of Corporeality .
there is of " feeling " - bodily ease , pain , joy , sadness , or indifferent feeling - belongs to the Group of Feeling .
Whatsoever there is of " perception " - visual objects , sounds , odors , tastes , bodily impressions , or mind objects - belongs to the Group of Perception .
Whatsoever there are of mental " formations " impression , volition , etc. - belong to the Group of mental Formations .
Whatsoever there is of " consciousness " therein , belongs to the Group of Consciousness .
And it is impossible that any one can explain the passing out of one existence , and the entering into a new existence , or the growth , increase , and development of consciousness , independent of corporeality , feeling , perception , and mental formations .
THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF EXISTENCE
All formations are " transient " ; all formations are " subject to suffering " ; all things are " without an Ego - entity . "
Corporeality is transient , feeling is transient , perception is transient , mental formations are transient , consciousness is transient .
And that which is transient , is subject to suffering ; and of that which is transient , and subject to suffering and change , one cannot rightly say : " This belongs to me ; this am I ; this is my Ego . "
Therefore , whatever there be of corporeality , of feeling , perception , mental formations , or consciousness , whether one 's own or external , whether gross or subtle , lofty or low , far or near , one should understand , according to reality , and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
Suppose , a man who is not blind , were to behold the many bubbles on the Ganges as they are driving along ; and he should watch them , and carefully examine them .
After carefully examining them , they will appear to him empty , unreal , and unsubstantial .
In exactly the same way , does the monk behold all the corporeal phenomena , feelings , perceptions , mental formations , and states of consciousness - whether they be of the past , or the present , or the future , far , or near .
And he watches them , and examines them carefully ; and , after carefully examining them , they appear to him empty , void , and without an Ego Whoso delights in corporeality , or feeling , or perception , or mental formations , or consciousness , he delights in suffering ; and whoso delights in suffering , will not be freed from suffering .
Thus I say How can you find delight and mirth , Where there is burning without end ?
In deepest darkness you are wrapped !
Why do you not seek for the light ?
Look at this puppet here , well rigged , A heap of many sores , piled up , Diseased , and full of greediness , Unstable , and impermanent !
Devoured by old age is this frame , A prey of sickness , weak and frail ;
To pieces breaks this putrid body , All life must truly end in death .
THE THREE WARNINGS
Did you never see in the world a man , or a woman , eighty , ninety , or a hundred years old , frail , crooked as a gable roof , bent down , resting on crutches , with tottering steps , infirm , youth long since fled , with broken teeth , grey and scanty hair , or bald - headed , wrinkled , with blotched limbs ?
And did the thought never come to you that also you are subject to decay , that also you cannot escape it ?
Did you never see in the world a man , or a woman , who being sick , afflicted , and grievously ill , and wallowing in his own filth , was lifted up by some people , and put to bed by others ?
And did the thought never come to you that also you are subject to disease , that also you cannot escape it ?
Did you never see in the world the corpse of a man , or a woman , one , or two , or three days after death , swollen up , blue - black in color , and full of corruption ?
And did the thought never come to you that also you are subject to death , that also you cannot escape it ?
SAMSARA , THE WHEEL OF EXISTENCE
Inconceivable is the beginning of this Samsara ; not to be discovered is any first beginning of beings , who , obstructed by ignorance , and ensnared by craving , are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths .
[ Samsara - the Wheel of Existence , lit. , the " Perpetual Wandering " - is the name by which is designated the sea of life ever restlessly heaving up and down , the symbol of this continuous process of ever again and again being born , growing old , suffering , and dying .
More precisely Put : Samsara is the unbroken chain of the fivefold Khandha - combinations , which , constantly changing from moment to moment , follow continuously one upon the other through inconceivable periods of time .
Of this Samsara , a single lifetime constitutes only a vanishingly tiny fraction ; hence , to be able to comprehend the first noble truth , one must let one 's gaze rest upon the Samsara , upon this frightful chain of rebirths , and not merely upon one single lifetime , which , of course , may be sometimes not very painful . ]
Which do you think is the more : the flood of tears , which weeping and wailing you have shed upon this long way - hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths , united with the undesired , separated from the desired this , or the waters of the four oceans ?
Long time have you suffered the death of father and mother , of sons , daughters , brothers , and sisters .
And whilst you were thus suffering , you have , verily , shed more tears upon this long way than there is water in the four oceans .
Which do you think is the more : the streams of blood that , through your being beheaded , have flowed upon this long way , or the waters in the four oceans ?
Long time have you been caught as dacoits , or highwaymen , or adulterers ; and , through your being beheaded , verily , more blood has flowed upon this long way than there is water in the four oceans .
But how is this possible ?
Inconceivable is the beginning of this Samsara ; not to be discovered is any first beginning of beings , who , obstructed by ignorance , and ensnared by craving , are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths .
And thus have you long time undergone suffering , undergone torment , undergone misfortune , and filled the graveyards full ; verily , long enough to be dissatisfied with all the forms of existence , long enough to turn away , and free yourselves from them all .
SECOND TRUTH THE NOBLE TRUTH OF THE ORIGIN OF SUFFERING WHAT , now , is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering ?
It is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth , and , bound up with pleasure and lust , now here , now there , finds ever fresh delight .
[ In the absolute sense , it is no real being , no self - determined , unchangeable , Ego -entity that is reborn .
Moreover , there is nothing that remains the same even for two consecutive moments ; for the Five Khandhas , or Groups of Existence , are in a state of perpetual change , of continual dissolution and renewal .
They die every moment , and every moment new ones are born .
Hence it follows that there is no such thing as a real existence , or " being " ( Latin esse ) , but only as it were an endless process , a continuous change , a " becoming , " consisting in a " producing , " and in a " being produced " ; in a " process of action , " and in a " process of reaction , " or " rebirth . "
This process of perpetual " producing " and " being produced " may best be compared with an ocean wave .
In the case of a wave , there is not the slightest quantity of water traveling over the surface of the sea .
But the wave structure , that hastens over the surface of the water , creating the appearance of one and the same mass of water , is , in reality , nothing but the continuous rising and falling of continuous , but quite different , masses of water , produced by the transmission of force generated by the wind .
Even so , the Buddha did not teach that Ego-entities hasten through the ocean of rebirth , but merely life - waves , which , according to their nature and activities ( good , or evil ) , manifest themselves here as men , there as animals , and elsewhere as invisible beings . ]
THE THREEFOLD CRAVING
There is the " Sensual Craving , " the " Craving for Eternal - Annihilation . "
Existence , " the " Craving for Self - Annihilation . "
[ The " Craving for Eternal Existence , " according to the Visuddhi - Magga , is intimately connected with the so - called Eternity - Belief , " i.e. , the belief in an absolute , eternal , Ego - entity persisting independently of our body .
The Craving for Self - Annihilation is the outcome of the so - called " Annihilation - Belief , " the delusive materialistic notion of an Ego which is annihilated at death , and which does not stand in any causal relation with the time before birth or after death . ]
But , where does this craving arise and take root ?
Wherever in the world there are delightful and pleasurable things , there this craving arises and takes root .
Eye , ear , nose , tongue , body , and mind , are delightful and pleasurable : there this craving arises and takes root .
Visual objects , sounds , smells , tastes , bodily impressions , and mind - objects , are delightful and pleasurable : there this craving arises and takes root .
Consciousness , sense impression , feeling born of sense impression , perception , will , craving , thinking , and reflecting , are delightful and pleasurable : there this craving arises and takes root .
If , namely , when perceiving a visual object , a sound , odor , taste , bodily impression , or a mind object , the object is pleasant , one is attracted ; and if unpleasant , one is repelled .
Thus , whatever kind of " Feeling " one experiences , pleasant , unpleasant , or indifferent - one approves of , and cherishes the feeling , and clings to it ; and while doing so , lust springs up ; but lust for feelings , means Clinging ; and on Clinging , depends the " Process of Becoming " ; on the Process of Becoming ( Karma - process ) , depends ( future ) " Birth " ; and dependent on Birth , are Decay and Death , Sorrow , Lamentation , Pain , Grief , and Despair .
Thus arises this whole mass of suffering .
This is called the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering .
HEAPING UP OF PRESENT SUFFERING
Verily , due to sensuous craving , conditioned through sensuous craving , impelled by sensuous craving , entirely moved by sensuous craving , kings fight with kings , princes with princes , priests with priests , citizens with citizens ; the mother quarrels with the son , the son with the mother , the father with the son , the son with the father ; brother quarrels with brother , brother with sister , sister with brother , friend with friend .
Thus , given to dissension , quarreling and fighting , they fall upon one another with fists , sticks , or weapons .
And thereby they suffer death or deadly pain .
And further , due to sensuous craving , conditioned through sensuous craving , impelled by sensuous craving , entirely moved by sensuous craving , people break into houses , rob , plunder , pillage whole houses , commit highway robbery , seduce the wives of others .
Then , the rulers have such people caught , and inflict on them various forms of punishment .
And thereby they incur death or deadly pain .
Now , this is the misery of sensuous craving , the heaping up of suffering in this present life , due to sensuous craving , conditioned through sensuous craving , caused by sensuous craving , entirely dependent on sensuous craving .
HEAPING UP OF FUTURE SUFFERING
And further , people take the evil way in deeds , the evil way in words , the evil way in thoughts ; and by taking the evil way in deeds , words , and thoughts , at the dissolution of the body , after death , they fall into a downward state of existence , a state of suffering , into perdition , and the abyss of hell .
But , this is the misery of sensuous craving , the heaping up of suffering in the future life , due to sensuous craving , conditioned through sensuous craving , caused by sensuous craving , entirely dependent on sensuous craving .
Not in the air , nor ocean - midst , Nor hidden in the mountain clefts , Nowhere is found a place on earth , Where man is freed from evil deeds .
INHERITANCE OF DEEDS ( KARMA )
For , owners of their deeds ( karma ) are the beings , heirs of their deeds ; their deeds are the womb from which they sprang ; with their deeds they are bound up ; their deeds are their refuge .
Whatever deeds they do - good or evil - of such they will be the heirs .
And wherever the beings spring into existence , there their deeds will ripen ; and wherever their deeds ripen , there they will earn the fruits of those deeds , be it in this life , or be it in the next life , or be it in any other future life .
There will come a time , when the mighty ocean will dry up , vanish , and be no more .
There will come a time , when the mighty earth will be devoured by fire , perish , and be no more .
But , yet there will be no end to the suffering of beings , who , obstructed by ignorance , and ensnared by craving , are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths .
THIRD TRUTH THE NOBLE TRUTH OF THE EXTINCTION OF SUFFERING WHAT , now , is the Noble Truth of the Extinction of Suffering ?
It is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving , its forsaking and giving up , the liberation and detachment from it .
But where may this craving vanish , where may it be extinguished ?
Wherever in the world there are delightful and pleasurable things , there this craving may vanish , there it may be extinguished .
Be it in the past , present , or future , whosoever of the monks or priests regards the delightful and pleasurable things in the world as " impermanent , " " miserable , " and " without an Ego , " as a disease and cancer ; it is he who overcomes the craving .
And released from Sensual Craving , released from the Craving for Existence , he does not return , does not enter again into existence .
DEPENDENT EXTINCTION OF ALL PHENOMENA
For , through the total fading away and extinction of Craving , Clinging is extinguished ; through the extinction of clinging , the Process of Becoming is extinguished ; through the extinction of the ( karmic ) process of becoming , Rebirth is extinguished ; and through the extinction of rebirth , Decay and Death , Sorrow , Lamentation , Suffering , Grief , and Despair , are extinguished .
Thus comes about the extinction of this whole mass of suffering .
Hence , the annihilation , cessation , and overcoming of corporeality , feeling , perception , mental formations , and consciousness , this is the extinction of suffering , the end of disease , the overcoming of old age and death .
[ The undulatory motion , which we call wave - which in the spectator creates the illusion of a single mass of water moving over the surface of the lake - is produced and fed by the wind , and maintained by the stored - up energies .
After the wind has ceased , and no fresh wind again whips up the water , the stored - up energies will gradually be consumed , and the whole undulatory motion come to an end .
Similarly , if fire does not get new fuel , it will become extinct .
just so , this Five - Khandha - process - which , in the ignorant worldling , creates the illusion of an Ego - entity - is produced and fed by the life - affirming craving , and maintained for some time by means of the stored - up life - energies .
Now , after the fuel , i.e. , the craving and clinging to life , has ceased , and no new craving impels again this Five - Khandha - process , life will continue as long as there are still life - energies stored up , but at their destruction at death , the Five - Khandha - process will reach final extinction .
Thus , nirvana or " Extinction " ( Sanskrit : to cease blowing , to become extinct ) , may be considered under two aspects : 1 . " Extinction of Impurities , " reached at the attainment of Arahatship , or Holiness , which takes place during the life - time .
2 . " Extinction of the Five - Khandha - process , " which takes place at the death of the Arahat . ]
NIRVANA
This , truly , is the Peace , this is the Highest , namely the end of all formations , the forsaking of every substratum of rebirth , the fading away of craving : detachment , extinction - Nirvana .
Enraptured with lust , enraged with anger , blinded by delusion , overwhelmed , with mind ensnared , man aims at his own ruin , at others ' ruin , at the ruin of both parties , and he experiences mental pain and grief .
But , if lust , anger , and delusion are given up , man aims neither at his own ruin , nor at others ' ruin , nor at the ruin of both parties , and he experiences no mental pain and grief .
Thus is Nirvana immediate , visible in this life , inviting , attractive , and comprehensible to the wise .
The extinction of greed , the extinction of anger , the extinction of delusion : this , indeed , is called Nirvana .
THE ARAHAT , OR HOLY ONE
And for a disciple thus freed , in whose heart dwells peace , there is nothing to be added to what has been done , and naught more remains for him to do .
Just as a rock of one solid mass remains unshaken by the wind , even so , neither forms , nor sounds , nor odors , nor tastes , nor contacts of any kind , neither the desired , nor the undesired , can cause such an one to waver .
Steadfast is his mind , gained is deliverance .
And he who has considered all the contrasts on this earth , and is no more disturbed by anything whatever in the world , the Peaceful One , freed from rage , from sorrow , and from longing , he has passed beyond birth and decay .
THE IMMUTABLE
There is a realm , where there is neither the solid , nor the fluid , neither heat , nor motion , neither this world , nor any other world , neither sun , nor moon .
This I call neither arising , nor passing away , neither standing still nor being born , nor dying .
There is neither foothold , nor development , nor any basis .
This is the end of suffering .
There is an Unborn , Unoriginated , Uncreated , Unformed .
If there were not this Unborn , this Unoriginated , this Uncreated , this Unformed , escape from the world of the born , the originated , the created , the formed , would not be possible .
But since there is an Unborn , Unoriginated , Uncreated , Unformed , therefore is escape possible from the world of the born , the originated , the created , the formed .
FOURTH TRUTH THE NOBLE TRUTH OF THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE EXTINCTION OF SUFFERING THE TWO EXTREMES AND THE MIDDLE PATH TO GIVE oneself up to indulgence in sensual pleasure , the base , common , vulgar , unholy , unprofitable ; and also to give oneself up to self - mortification , the painful , unholy , unprofitable : both these two extremes the Perfect One has avoided , and found out the Middle Path , which makes one both to see and to know , which leads to peace , to discernment , to enlightenment , to Nirvana .
THE EIGHTFOLD PATH
It is the Noble Eightfold Path , the way that leads to the extinction of suffering , namely : 1 . Right Understanding , 2 . Right Mindedness , which together are Wisdom .
3 . Right Speech , 4 . Right Action , 5 . Right Living , which together are Morality .
6 . Right Effort , 7 . Right Attentiveness , 8 . Right Concentration , which together are Concentration .
This is the Middle Path which the Perfect One has found out , which makes one both to see and to know , which leads to peace , to discernment , to enlightenment , to Nirvana .
Free from pain and torture is this path , free from groaning and suffering ; it is the perfect path .
Truly , like this path there is no other path to the purity of insight .
If you follow this path , you will put an end to suffering .
But each one has to struggle for himself , the Perfect Ones have only pointed out the way .
Give ear then , for the Immortal is found .
I reveal , I set forth the Truth .
As I reveal it to you , so act !
And that supreme goal of the holy life , for the sake of which , sons of good families rightly go forth from home to the homeless state : this you will , in no long time , in this very life , make known to yourself , realize , and make your own .
THE EIGHTFOLD PATH FIRST STEP RIGHT UNDERSTANDING WHAT , now , is Right Understanding ?
It is understanding the Four Truths .
To understand suffering ; to understand the origin of suffering ; to understand the extinction of suffering ; to understand the path that leads to the extinction of suffering :
This is called Right Understanding
Or , when the noble disciple understands what is karmically wholesome , and the root of wholesome karma ; what is karmically unwholesome , and the root of unwholesome karma , then he has Right Understanding .
[ " Karmically unwholesome " is every volitional act of body , speech , or mind which is rooted in greed , hatred , or delusion , and produces evil and painful results in this or any future form of existence . ]
What , now , is " karmically unwholesome ? "
In Bodily Action it is destruction of living beings ; stealing ; and unlawful sexual intercourse .
In Verbal Action it is lying ; tale - bearing ; harsh language ; and frivolous talk .
In Mental Action it is covetousness ; ill - will ; and wrong views .
And what is the root of unwholesome karma ?
Greed is a root of unwholesome karma ;
Anger is a root of unwholesome karma ; Delusion is a root of unwholesome karma .
[ The state of greed , as well as that of anger , is always accompanied by delusion ; and delusion , ignorance , is the primary root of all evil . ]
Therefore , I say , these demeritorious actions are of three kinds : either due to greed , or due to anger , or due to delusion .
What , now , is " karmically wholesome ? "
In Bodily Action it is to abstain from killing ; to abstain from stealing ; and to abstain from unlawful sexual intercourse .
In Verbal Action it is to abstain from lying ; to abstain from tale - bearing ; to abstain from harsh language ; and to abstain from frivolous talk .
In Mental Action it is absence of covetousness ; absence of ill - will ; and right understanding .
And what is the root of wholesome karma ?
Absence of greed ( unselfishness ) is a root of wholesome karma ; absence of anger ( benevolence ) is a root of wholesome karma ; absence of delusion ( wisdom ) is a root of wholesome karma .
Or , when one understands that corporeality , feeling , perception , mental formation , and consciousness , are transient [ subject to suffering , and without an Ego ] , also in that case one possesses Right Understanding .
UNPROFITABLE QUESTIONS
Should anyone say that he does not wish to lead the holy life under the Blessed One , unless the Blessed One first tells him , whether the world is eternal or temporal , finite or infinite ; whether the life principle is identical with the body , or something different ; whether the Perfect One continues after death , and so on such a man would die , ere the Perfect One could tell him all this .
It is as if a man were pierced by a poisoned arrow , and his friends , companions , or near relations , should send for a surgeon ; but that man should say : " I will not have this arrow pulled out , until I know who the man is that has wounded me : whether he is a noble , a priest , a citizen , or a servant " ; or : " what his name is , and to what family he belongs " ; or : " whether he is tall , or short , or of medium height . "
Verily , such a man would die , ere he could adequately learn all this .
Therefore , the man who seeks his own welfare , should pull out this arrow - this arrow of lamentation , pain , and sorrow .
For , whether the theory exists , or whether it does not exist , that the world is eternal , or temporal , or finite , or infinite - certainly , there is birth , there is decay , there is death , sorrow , lamentation , pain , grief , and despair , the extinction of which , attainable even in this present life , I make known unto you .
There is , for instance , an unlearned worldling , void of regard for holy men , ignorant of the teaching of holy men , untrained in the noble doctrine .
And his heart is possessed and overcome by Self - Illusion , by Skepticism , by attachment to mere Rule and Ritual , by Sensual Lust , and by will ; and how to free himself from these things , he does not really know .
[ Self - Illusion may reveal itself as " Eternalism " or Eternity - belief " i.e. , the belief that one 's Ego is existing independently of the material body , and continuing even after the dissolution of the latter ; or as " Annihilationism , " or " Annihilation - belief " i.e. , the materialistic belief that this present life constitutes the Ego , and hence that it is annihilated at the death of the material body . ]
Not knowing what is worthy of consideration , and what is unworthy of consideration , he considers the unworthy , and not the worthy .
And unwisely he considers thus : " Have I been in the past ?
Or. have I not been in the past ?
What have I been in the past ?
How have I been in the past ?
From what state into what state did I change in the past ?
- Shall I be in the future ?
Or , shall I not be in the future ?
What shall I be in the future ?
How shall I be in the future ?
From what state into what state shall I change in the future ? "
And the present also fills him with doubt : " Am I ?
Or , am I not ?
What am I ?
How am I ?
This being , whence has it come ?
Whither will it go ? "
And with such unwise considerations , he falls into one or other of the six views , and it becomes his conviction and firm belief : " I have an Ego " ; or : " I have no Ego " ; or : " With the Ego I perceive the Ego " ; or : " With that which is no Ego , I perceive the Ego " ; or : " With the Ego I perceive that which is no Ego .
Or , he falls into the following view : " This my Ego , which can think and feel , and which , now here , now there , experiences the fruit of good and evil deeds ; this my Ego is permanent , stable , eternal , not subject to change , and will thus eternally remain the same . "
If there really existed the Ego , there would be also something which belonged to the Ego .
As , however , in truth and reality , neither the Ego , nor anything belonging to the Ego , can be found , is it not therefore really an utter fool 's doctrine to say : " This is the world , this am I ; after death , I shall be permanent , persisting , and eternal ? "
These are called mere views , a thicket of views , a puppet show of views , a toil of views , a snare of views ; and ensnared in the fetter of views , the ignorant worldling will not be freed from rebirth , from decay , and from death , from sorrow , pain , grief , and despair ; he will not be freed , I say , from suffering .
THE SOTAPAN , OR " STREAM-ENTERER "
The learned and noble disciple , however , who has regard for holy men , knows the teaching of holy men , is well trained in the noble doctrine , he understands what is worthy of consideration , and what is unworthy .
And knowing this , he considers the worthy , and not the unworthy .
What suffering is , he wisely considers .
What the origin of suffering is , he wisely considers ; what the extinction of suffering is , he wisely considers ; what the path is that leads to the extinction of suffering , he wisely considers .
And by thus considering , three fetters vanish , namely : Self - illusion , Skepticism , and Attachment to mere Rule and Ritual .
But those disciples in whom these three fetters have vanished have " entered the Stream , " have forever escaped the states of woe , and are assured of final enlightenment .
More than any earthly power , More than all the joys of heaven , More than rule o'er all the world , Is the Entrance to the Stream .
And , verily , those who are filled with unshaken faith in me , all those have entered the stream .
There are ten " Fetters " by which beings are bound to the wheel of existence .
They are : Self - Illusion , Skepticism , Attachment to mere Rule and Ritual , Sensual Lust , Ill - will , Craving for the World of pure Form , Craving for the Formless World , Conceit , Restlessness , Ignorance .
A Sotapan , or " Stream - Enterer " i.e. " one who has entered the stream leading to Nirvana , " is free from the first three fetters .
A Sakadagamin , or " Once - Returned " - namely to this sensuous sphere - has overcome the 4th and 5th fetters in their grosser form .
An Anagamin , or " Non-Returner , " is wholly freed from the first five fetters , which bind to rebirth in the sensuous sphere ; after death , whilst living in the sphere of pure form , he will reach the goal .
An Arahat , or perfectly " Holy One , " is freed from all fetters . ]
THE TWO UNDERSTANDINGS
Therefore , I say , Right Understanding is of two kinds : 1 . The view that alms and offerings are not useless ; that there is fruit and result , both of good and bad actions ; that there are such things as this life , and the next life ; that father and mother as spontaneously born beings ( in the heavenly worlds ) are no mere words ; that there are monks and priests who are spotless and perfect , who can explain this life and the next life , which they themselves have understood : this is called the " Mundane Right Understanding , " which yields worldly fruits , and brings good results .
2 . But whatsoever there is of wisdom , of penetration , of right understanding , conjoined with the Path - the mind being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being pursued ; - this is called the " Ultramundane Right Understanding , " which is not of the world , but is ultramundane , and conjoined with the Path .
[ Thus , there are two kinds of the Eightfold Path : the " mundane , " practiced by the " worldling " ; and the " ultra - mundane , " practiced by the " Noble Ones . " ]
Now , in understanding wrong understanding as wrong , and right understanding as right , one practices Right Understanding [ 1st step ] ; and in making efforts to overcome wrong understanding , and to arouse right understanding , one practices .
Right Effort [ 6th step ] ; and in overcoming wrong understanding with attentive mind , and dwelling with attentive mind in the possession of right understanding , one practices Right - Attentiveness [ 7th step ] .
Hence , there are three things that accompany and follow upon right understanding , namely : right understanding , right effort , and right attentiveness .
COMPLETE DELIVERANCE
Now , if any one should put the question , whether I admit any view at all , he should be answered thus :
The Perfect One is free from any theory , for the Perfect One has understood what corporeality is , and how it arises , and passes away .
He has understood what feeling is , and how it arises , and passes away .
He has understood what perception is , and how it arises , and passes away .
He has understood what the mental formations are , and how they arise , and pass away .
He has understood what consciousness is , and how it arises , and passes away .
Therefore , I say , the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction , fading - away , disappearance , rejection , and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures , of all inclination to the vainglory of " I " and " mine . "
Whether Perfect Ones [ Buddhas ] appear in the world or whether Perfect Ones do not appear in the world , it still remains a firm condition , an immutable fact and fixed law : that all formations are impermanent " that all formations are " subject to suffering " ; that everything is " without an Ego . "
[ The word sankhara ( formations ) comprises all things which have a beginning and an end , the so - called created , or " formed " things , i.e. , all possible physical and mental constituents of existence . ]
A corporeal phenomenon , a feeling , a perception , a mental formation , a consciousness , that is permanent and persistent , eternal and not subject to change : such a thing the wise men in this world do not recognize ; and I also say , there is no such thing .
And it is impossible that a being possessed of Right Understanding should regard anything as the Ego .
Now , if someone should say that Feeling is his Ego , he should be answered thus : " There are three kinds of feeling : pleasurable , painful , and indifferent feeling .
Which of these three feelings , now , do you consider your Ego ? "
At the moment namely of experiencing one of these feelings one does not experience the other two .
These three kinds of feelings are impermanent , of dependent origin , are subject to decay and dissolution , to fading - away and extinction .
Whosoever , in experiencing one of these feelings , thinks that this is his Ego , will , after the extinction of that feeling , admit that his Ego has become dissolved .
And thus he will consider his Ego already in this present life as impermanent , mixed up with pleasure and pain , subject to rising and passing away .
If any one should say that Feeling is not his Ego , and that his Ego is inaccessible to feeling , he should be asked thus : " Now , where there is no feeling , is it there possible to say : ' This am I ? ' "
Or , someone might say : " Feeling , indeed , is not my Ego , but it also is untrue that my Ego is inaccessible to feeling ; for it is my Ego that feels , for my Ego has the faculty of feeling . "
Such a one should be answered thus : " Suppose , feeling should become altogether totally extinguished ; now , if there , after the extinction of feeling , no feeling whatever exists , it is then possible to say : ' This am I ? ' "
To say that the mind , or the mind - objects , or the mind - consciousness , constitute the Ego ; such an assertion is unfounded .
For an arising and a passing away is seen there ; and seeing this , one should come to the conclusion that one 's Ego arises and passes away .
It would be better for the unlearned worldling to regard this body , built up of the four elements , as his Ego , rather than the mind .
For it is evident that this body may last for a year , for two years , for three years , four , five , or ten years , or even a hundred years and more ; but that which is called thought , or mind , or consciousness , is continuously , during day and night , arising as one thing , and passing away as another thing .
Therefore , whatsoever there is of corporeality , of feeling , of perception , of mental formations , of consciousness , whether one 's own or external , gross or subtle , lofty or low , far or near ; there one should understand according to reality and true wisdom : " This does not belong to me ; this am I not ; this is not my Ego . "
[ To show the Egolessness , utter emptiness of existence , Visuddhi - Magga XVI quotes the following verse :
Mere suffering exists , no sufferer is found ;
The deed is , but no doer of the deed is there ; Nirvana is , but not the man that enters it ;
The Path is , but no traveler on it is seen . ]
PAST , PRESENT , AND FUTURE
If , now , any one should ask : " Have you been in the past , and is it untrue that you have not been ?
Will you be in the future , and is it untrue that you will not be ?
Are you , and is it untrue that you are not ? " - you may say that you have been in the past , and it is untrue that you have not been ; that you will be in the future , and it is untrue that you will not be ; that you are , and it is untrue that you are not .
In the past only the past existence was real , but unreal the future and present existence .
In the future only the future existence will be real , but unreal the past and present existence .
Now only the present existence is real , but unreal the past and future existence .
Verily , he who perceives the Dependent Origination , perceives the truth and he who perceives the truth , perceives the dependent origination .
For , just as from the cow comes milk , from milk curds , from curds butter , from butter ghee , from ghee the scum of ghee ; and when it is milk , it is not counted as curds , or butter , or ghee , or scum of ghee , but only as milk ; and when it is curds , it is only counted as curds - just so was my past existence at that time real , but unreal the future and present existence ; and my future existence will be at one time real , but unreal the past and present existence ; and my present existence is now real , but unreal the past and future existence .
All these are merely popular designations and expressions , mere conventional terms of speaking , mere popular notions .
The Perfect One , indeed , makes use of these , without , however , clinging to them .
Thus , he who does not understand corporeality , feeling , perception , mental formations and consciousness according to reality [ i.e. , as void of a personality , or Ego ] , and not their arising , their extinction , and the way to their extinction , he is liable to believe , either that the Perfect One continues after death , or that he does not continue after death , and so forth .
Verily , if one holds the view that the vital principle [ Ego ] is identical with this body , in that case a holy life is not possible ; or , if one holds the view that the vital principle is something quite different from the body , in that case also a holy life is not possible .
Both these two Extremes the Perfect One has avoided , and shown the Middle Doctrine , saying : DEPENDENT ORIGINATION On Delusion depend the Karma - Formations .
On the karma - formations depends Consciousness [ starting with rebirth - consciousness in the womb of the mother ] .-
On consciousness depends the Mental and Physical Existence .
- On the mental and physical existence depend the Six Sense - Organs .
- On the six sense - organs depends the Sensory Impression .
- On the sensory impression depends Feeling .
- On feeling depends ; Craving .
-On craving depends Clinging .
On clinging depends the Process of Becoming .
- On the process of becoming [ here : karmaprocess ] depends Rebirth .
- On rebirth depend Decay and Death , sorrow , lamentation , pain , grief and despair .
Thus arises this whole mass of suffering .
This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering .
In whom , however , Delusion has disappeared and wisdom arisen , such a disciple heaps up neither meritorious , nor demeritorious , nor imperturbable Karma - formations .
Thus , through the entire fading away and extinction of this Delusion , the Karma - Formations are extinguished .
Through the extinction of the Karma - formations , Consciousness [ rebirth ] is extinguished .
Through the extinction of consciousness , the Mental and Physical Existence is extinguished .
Through the extinction of the mental and physical existence , the six Sense - Organs are extinguished .
Through the extinction of the six sense - organs , the Sensory Impression is extinguished .
Through the extinction of the sensory impression , Feeling is extinguished .
Through the extinction of feeling , Craving is extinguished .
Through the extinction of craving , Clinging is extinguished .
Through the extinction of clinging , the Process of Becoming is extinguished .
Through the extinction of the process of becoming , Rebirth is extinguished .
Through the extinction of rebirth , Decay and Death , sorrow , lamentation , pain , grief and despair are extinguished .
Thus takes place the extinction of this whole mass of suffering .
This is called the Noble Truth of the Extinction of Suffering .
KARMA : REBIRTH - PRODUCING AND BARREN
Verily , because beings , obstructed by Delusion , and ensnared by Craving , now here now there seek ever fresh delight , therefore such action comes to ever fresh Rebirth .
And the action that is done out of greed , anger and delusion , that springs from them , has its source and origin there : this action ripens wherever one is reborn ; and wherever this action ripens , there one experiences the fruits of this action , be it in this life , or the next life , or in some future life .
However , through the fading away of delusion through the arising of wisdom , through the extinction of craving , no future rebirth takes place again For the actions , which are not done out of greed , anger and delusion , which have not sprung from them , which have not their source and origin there - such actions are , through the absence of greed , anger and delusion , abandoned , rooted out , like a palm - tree torn out of the soil , destroyed , and not liable to spring up again .
In this respect one may rightly say of me : that I teach annihilation , that I propound my doctrine for the purpose of annihilation , and that I herein train my disciples ; for , certainly , I do teach annihilation - the annihilation , namely , of greed , anger and delusion , as well as of the manifold evil and unwholesome things .
[ " Dependent Origination " is the teaching of the strict conformity to law of everything that happens , whether in the realm of the physical , or the psychical .
It shows how the totality of phenomena , physical and mental , the entire phenomenal world that depends wholly upon the six senses , together with all its suffering - and this is the vital point of the teaching is not the mere play of blind chance , but has an existence that is dependent upon conditions ; and that , precisely with the removal of these conditions , those things that have arisen in dependence upon them - thus also all suffering - must perforce disappear and cease to be . ]
SECOND STEP RIGHT MINDEDNESS
WHAT , now , is Right Mindedness ?
It is thoughts free from lust ; thoughts free from ill - will ; thoughts free from cruelty .
This is called right mindedness .
Now , Right Mindedness , let me tell you , is of two kinds : 1 . Thoughts free from lust , from ill - will , and from cruelty : - this is called the " Mundane Right Mindedness , " which yields worldly fruits and brings good results .
2 . But , whatsoever there is of thinking , considering , reasoning , thought , ratiocination , application - the mind being holy , being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being pursued - : these " Verbal Operations " of the mind are called the " Ultramundane Right Mindedness which is not of the world , but is ultra mundane , and conjoined with the paths .
Now , in understanding wrong - mindedness as wrong , and right - mindedness as right , one practices Right Understanding [ 1st step ] ; and in making efforts to overcome evil - mindedness , and to arouse right - mindedness , one practices Right Effort [ 6th step ] ; and in overcoming evil - mindedness with attentive mind , and dwelling with attentive mind in possession of right - mindedness , one practices Right Attentiveness [ 7th step ] .
Hence , there are three things that accompany and follow upon right - mindedness , namely : right understanding , right effort , and right attentiveness .
THIRD STEP THIRD STEP RIGHT SPEECH WHAT , now , is Right Speech ?
It is abstaining from lying ; abstaining from tale - bearing ; abstaining from harsh language ; abstaining from vain talk .
There , someone avoids lying , and abstains from it .
He speaks the truth , is devoted to the truth , reliable , worthy of confidence , is not a deceiver of men .
Being at a meeting , or amongst people , or in the midst of his relatives , or in a society , or in the king 's court , and called upon and asked as witness , to tell what he knows , he answers , if he knows nothing : " I know nothing " ; and if he knows , he answers : " I know " ; if he has seen nothing , he answers : " I have seen nothing , " and if he has seen , he answers : " I have seen . "
Thus , he never knowingly speaks a lie , neither for the sake of his own advantage , nor for the sake of another person 's advantage , nor for the sake of any advantage whatsoever .
He avoids tale - bearing , and abstains from it .
What he has heard here , he does not repeat there , so as to cause dissension there ; and what he heard there , he does not repeat here , so as to cause dissension here .
Thus he unites those that are divided ; and those that are united , he encourages .
Concord gladdens him , he delights and rejoices in concord , and it is concord that he spreads by his words .
He avoids harsh language , and abstains from it .
He speaks such words as are gentle , soothing to the ear , loving , going to the heart , courteous and dear , and agreeable to many .
[ In Majjhima - Nikaya , No. 21 , the Buddha says : " Even , O monks , should robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints , whoso gave way to anger thereat , would not be following my advice .
For thus ought you to train yourselves : " ' Undisturbed shall our mind remain , no evil words shall escape our lips ; friendly and full of sympathy shall we remain , with heart full of love , and free from any hidden malice ; and that person shall we penetrate with loving thoughts , wide , deep , boundless , freed from anger and hatred . ' " ]
He avoids vain talk , and abstains from it .
He speaks at the right time , in accordance with facts , speaks what is useful , speaks about the law and the discipline ; his speech is like a treasure , at the right moment accompanied by arguments , moderate and full of sense .
This is called right speech .
Now , right speech , let me tell you , is of two kinds : 1 . Abstaining from lying , from tale - bearing , from harsh language , and from vain talk ; this is called the " Mundane Right Speech , which yields worldly fruits and brings good results .
2 . But the abhorrence of the practice of this four - fold wrong speech , the abstaining , withholding , refraining therefrom - the mind being holy , being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being pursued - : this is called the " Ultramundane Right Speech , which is not of the world , but is ultramundane , and conjoined with the paths .
Now , in understanding wrong speech as wrong , and right speech as right , one practices Right Understanding [ 1st step ) ; and in making efforts to overcome evil speech and to arouse right speech , one practices Right Effort [ 6th step ] ; and in overcoming wrong speech with attentive mind , and dwelling with attentive mind in possession of right speech , one practices Right Attentiveness [ 7th step ] .
Hence , there are three things that accompany and follow upon right attentiveness .
FOURTH STEP RIGHT ACTION WHAT , now , is Right Action ?
It is abstaining from killing ; abstaining from stealing ; abstaining from unlawful sexual intercourse .
There , someone avoids the killing of living beings , and abstains from it .
Without stick or sword , conscientious , full of sympathy , he is anxious for the welfare of all living beings .
He avoids stealing , and abstains from it ; what another person possesses of goods and chattels in the village or in the wood , that he does not take away with thievish intent .
He avoids unlawful sexual intercourse , and abstains from it .
He has no intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection of father , mother , brother , sister or relatives , nor with married women , nor female convicts , nor , lastly , with betrothed girls .
This is called Right Action .
Now , Right Action , let me tell you , is of two kinds : 1 . Abstaining from killing , from stealing , and from unlawful sexual intercourse - this is called the " Mundane Right Action , which yields worldly fruits and brings good results .
But the abhorrence of the practice of this three - fold wrong action , the abstaining , withholding , refraining therefrom - the mind being holy , being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being pursued - : this is called the " Ultramundane Right Action , " which is not of the world , but is ultramundane , and conjoined with the paths .
Now , in understanding wrong action as wrong , and right action as right , one practices Right Understanding [ 1st step ] ; and in making efforts to overcome wrong action , and to arouse right action , one practices Right Effort [ 6th step ] ; and in overcoming wrong action with attentive mind , and dwelling with attentive mind in possession of right action , one practices Right Attentiveness [ 7th step ] .
Hence , there are three things that accompany and follow upon right action , namely : right understanding , right effort , and right attentiveness .
FIFTH STEP RIGHT LIVING WHAT , now , is Right Living ?
When the noble disciple , avoiding a wrong way of living , gets his livelihood by a right way of living , this is called Right Living .
Now , right living , let me tell you , is of two kinds : 1 . When the noble disciple , avoiding wrong living , gets his livelihood by a right way of living - this is called the " Mundane Right Living , " which yields worldly fruits and brings good results .
2 . But the abhorrence of wrong living , the abstaining , withholding , refraining therefrom - the mind being holy , being turned away from the world , and conjoined with the path , the holy path being pursued - : this is called the " Ultramundane Right Living , " which is not of the world , but is ultramundane , and conjoined with the paths .
Now , in understanding wrong living as wrong , and right living as right , one practices Right Understanding [ 1st step ] ; and in making efforts to overcome wrong living , to arouse right living , one practices Right Effort [ 6th step ] ; and in overcoming wrong living with attentive mind , and dwelling with attentive mind in possession of right living , one practices Right Attentiveness [ 7th step ] .
Hence , there are three things that accompany and follow upon right living , namely : right understanding , right effort , and right attentiveness .
SIXTH STEP RIGHT EFFORT WHAT , now , is Right Effort ?
There are Four Great Efforts : the effort to avoid , the effort to overcome , the effort to develop , and the effort to maintain .
What , now , is the effort to avoid ?
There , the disciple incites his mind to avoid the arising of evil , demeritorious things that have not yet arisen ; and he strives , puts forth his energy , strains his mind and struggles .
Thus , when he perceives a form with the eye , a sound with the ear , an odor with the nose , a taste with the tongue , a contact with the body , or an object with the mind , he neither adheres to the whole , nor to its parts .
And he strives to ward off that through which evil and demeritorious things , greed and sorrow , would arise , if he remained with unguarded senses ; and he watches over his senses , restrains his senses .
Possessed of this noble " Control over the Senses , " he experiences inwardly a feeling of joy , into which no evil thing can enter .
This is called the effort to avoid .
What , now , is the effort to Overcome ?
There , the disciple incites his mind to overcome the evil , demeritorious things that have already arisen ; and he strives , puts forth his energy , strains his mind and struggles .
He does not retain any thought of sensual lust , ill - will , or grief , or any other evil and demeritorious states that may have arisen ; he abandons them , dispels them , destroys them , causes them to disappear .
FIVE METHODS OF EXPELLING EVIL THOUGHTS
If , whilst regarding a certain object , there arise in the disciple , on account of it , evil and demeritorious thoughts connected with greed , anger and delusion , then the disciple should , by means of this object , gain another and wholesome object .
Or , he should reflect on the misery of these thoughts : " Unwholesome , truly , are these thoughts !
Blameable are these thoughts !
Of painful result are these thoughts ! "
Or , he should pay no attention to these thoughts .
Or , he should consider the compound nature of these thoughts .
Or , with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the gums , he should , with his mind , restrain , suppress and root out these thoughts ; and in doing so , these evil and demeritorious thoughts of greed , anger and delusion will dissolve and disappear ; and the mind will inwardly become settled and calm , composed and concentrated .
This is called the effort to overcome .
What , now , is the effort to Develop ?
There the disciple incites his will to arouse meritorious conditions that have not yet arisen ; and he strives , puts forth his energy , strains his mind and struggles .
Thus he develops the " Elements of Enlightenment , " bent on solitude , on detachment , on extinction , and ending in deliverance , namely : Attentiveness , Investigation of the Law , Energy , Rapture , Tranquility , Concentration , and Equanimity .
This is called the effort to develop .
What , now , is the effort to Maintain ?
There , the disciple incites his will to maintain the meritorious conditions that have already arisen , and not to let them disappear , but to bring them to growth , to maturity and to the full perfection of development ; and he strives , puts forth his energy , strains his mind and struggles .
Thus , for example , he keeps firmly in his mind a favorable object of concentration that has arisen , as the mental image of a skeleton , of a corpse infested by worms , of a corpse blue - black in color , of a festering corpse , of a corpse riddled with holes , of a corpse swollen up .
This is called the effort to maintain .
Truly , the disciple who is possessed of faith and has penetrated the Teaching of the Master , he is filled with the thought : " May rather skin , sinews and bones wither away , may the flesh and blood of my body dry up : I shall not give up my efforts so long as I have not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance , energy and endeavor ! "
This is called right effort .
The effort of Avoiding , Overcoming , Of Developing and Maintaining :
These four great efforts have been shown
By him , the scion of the sun .
And he who firmly clings to them , May put an end to all the pain .
SEVENTH STEP RIGHT ATTENTIVENESS
WHAT , now , is Right Attentiveness ?
The only way that leads to the attainment of purity , to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation , to the end of pain and grief , to the entering upon the right path and the realization of Nirvana , is the " Four Fundamentals of Attentiveness . "
And which are these four ?
In them , the disciple dwells in contemplation of the Body , in contemplation of Feeling , in contemplation of the Mind , in contemplation of the Mind - objects , ardent , clearly conscious and attentive , after putting away worldly greed and grief .
CONTEMPLATION OF THE BODY
But , how does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the body ?
There , the disciple retires to the forest , to the foot of a tree , or to a solitary place , sits himself down , with legs crossed , body erect , and with attentiveness fixed before him .
With attentive mind he breathes in , with attentive mind he breathes out .
When making a long inhalation , he knows : " I make a long inhalation " ; when making a long exhalation , he knows : " I make a long exhalation . " when making a short inhalation , he knows : " I make a short inhalation " ; when making a short exhalation , he knows : " I make a short exhalation . "
" Clearly perceiving the entire [ breath ] - body , I will breathe in " : thus he trains himself ; " clearly perceiving the entire [ breath ] - body , I will breathe out " : thus he trains himself .
" Calming this bodily function , I will breathe n " : thus he trains himself ; " calming this bodily function , I will breathe out " : thus he trains himself .
Thus he dwells in contemplation of the body , either with regard to his own person , or to other persons , or to both .
He beholds how the body arises ; beholds how it passes away ; beholds the arising and passing away of the body .
" A body is there - " A body is there , but no living being , no individual , no woman , no man , no self , and nothing that belongs to a self ; neither a person , nor anything belonging to a person " - this clear consciousness is present in him , because of his knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives independent , unattached to anything in the world .
Thus does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the body .
And further , whilst going , standing , sitting , or lying down , the disciple understands the expressions : " I go " ; " I stand " ; " I sit " ; " I lie down " ; he understands any position of the body .
[ The disciple understands that it is not a being , a real Ego , that goes , stands , etc. , but that it is by a mere figure of speech that one says : " I go , " " I stand , " and so forth . ]
And further , the disciple is clearly conscious in his going and coming ; clearly conscious in looking forward and backward ; clearly conscious in bending and stretching ; clearly conscious in eating , drinking , chewing , and tasting ; clearly conscious in discharging excrement and urine ; clearly conscious in walking , standing , sitting , falling asleep and awakening ; clearly conscious in speaking and in keeping silent .
" In all the disciple is doing , he is clearly conscious : of his intention , of his advantage , of his duty , of the reality . "
And further , the disciple contemplates this body from the sole of the foot upward , and from the top of the hair downward , with a skin stretched over it , and filled with manifold impurities : " This body consists of hairs , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidneys , heart , liver , diaphragm , spleen , lungs , intestines , bowels , stomach , and excrement ; of bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , lymph , tears , semen , spittle , nasal mucus , oil of the joints , and urine . "
Just as if there were a sack , with openings at both ends , filled with all kinds of grain - with paddy , beans , sesamum and husked rice - and a man not blind opened it and examined its contents , thus : " That is paddy , these are beans , this is sesamum , this is husked rice " : just so does the disciple investigate this body .
And further , the disciple contemplates this body with regard to the elements : " This body consists of the solid element , the liquid element , the heating element and the vibrating element . "
Just as a skilled butcher or butcher 's apprentice , who has slaughtered a cow and divided it into separate portions , should sit down at the junction of four highroads : just so does the disciple contemplate this body with regard to the elements .
And further , just as if the disciple should see a corpse thrown into the burial - ground , one , two , or three days dead , swollen - up , blue - black in color , full of corruption he draws the conclusion as to his own body : " This my body also has this nature , has this destiny , and cannot escape it . "
And further , just as if the disciple should see a corpse thrown into the burial - ground , eaten by crows , hawks or vultures , by dogs or jackals , or gnawed by all kinds of worms - he draws the conclusion as to his own body : " This my body also has this nature , has this destiny , and cannot escape it . "
And further , just as if the disciple should see a corpse thrown into the burial - ground , a framework of bones , flesh hanging from it , bespattered with blood , held together by the sinews ; a framework of bones , stripped of flesh , bespattered with blood , held together by the sinews ; a framework of bones , without flesh and blood , but still held together by the sinews ; bones , disconnected and scattered in all directions , here a bone of the hand , there a bone of the foot , there a shin bone , there a thigh bone , there the pelvis , there the spine , there the skull - he draws the conclusion as to his own body : " This my body also has this nature , has this destiny , and cannot escape it . "
And further , just as if the disciple should see bones lying in the burial ground , bleached and resembling shells ; bones heaped together , after the lapse of years ; bones weathered and crumbled to dust ; - he draws the conclusion as to his own body : " This my body also has this nature , has this destiny , and cannot escape it " Thus he dwells in contemplation of the body , either with regard to his own person , or to other persons , or to both .
He beholds how the body arises ; beholds how it passes away ; beholds the arising and passing of the body .
" A body is there " this clear consciousness is present in him , because of his knowledge and mindfulness ; and he lives independent , unattached to anything in the world .
Thus does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the body .
THE TEN BLESSINGS
Once the contemplation of the body is practiced , developed , often repeated , has become one 's habit , one 's foundation , is firmly established , strengthened and well perfected , one may expect ten blessings : Over Delight and Discontent one has mastery ; one does not allow himself to be overcome by discontent ; one subdues it , as soon as it arises .
One conquers Fear and Anxiety ; one does not allow himself to be overcome by fear and anxiety ; one subdues them , as soon as they arise .
One endures cold and heat , hunger and thirst , wind and sun , attacks by gadflies , mosquitoes and reptiles ; patiently one endures wicked and malicious speech , as well as bodily pains , that befall one , though they be piercing , sharp , bitter , unpleasant , disagreeable and dangerous to life .
The four " Trances , " the mind bestowing happiness even here : these one may enjoy at will , without difficulty , without effort .
One may enjoy the different " Magical Powers . "
With the " Heavenly Ear , " the purified , the super - human , one may hear both kinds of sounds , the heavenly and the earthly , the distant and the near .
With the mind one may obtain " Insight into the Hearts of Other Beings of other persons .
One may obtain " Remembrance of many Previous Births . "
With the " Heavenly Eye , " the purified , the super - human , one may see beings vanish and reappear , the base and the noble , the beautiful and the ugly , the happy and the unfortunate ; one may perceive how beings are reborn according to their deeds .
One may , through the " Cessation of Passions , " come to know for oneself , even in this life , the stainless deliverance of mind , the deliverance through wisdom .
CONTEMPLATION OF THE FEELINGS
But how does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the feelings ?
In experiencing feelings , the disciple knows : " I have an indifferent agreeable feeling , " or " I have a disagreeable feeling , " or " I have an indifferent feeling , " or " I have a worldly agreeable feeling , " or " I have an unworldly agreeable feeling , " or " I have a worldly disagreeable feeling , " or " I have an unworldly disagreeable feeling , " or " I have a worldly indifferent feeling , " or have an unworldly indifferent feeling .
Thus he dwells in contemplation of the feelings , either with regard to his own person , or to other persons , or to both .
He beholds how the feelings arise ; beholds how they pass away ; beholds the arising and passing away of the feelings .
" Feelings are there " : this clear consciousness is present in him , because of his knowledge and mindfulness ; and he lives independent , unattached to anything in the world .
Thus does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the feelings .
[ The disciple understands that the expression " I feel " has no validity except as an expression of common speech ; he understands that , in the absolute sense , there are only feelings , and that there is no Ego , no person , no experience of the feelings . ]
CONTEMPLATION OF THE MIND
But how does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the mind ?
The disciple knows the greedy mind as greedy , and the not greedy mind as not greedy ; knows the angry mind as angry , and the not angry mind as not angry ; knows the deluded mind as deluded , and the undeluded mind as undeluded .
He knows the cramped mind as cramped , and the scattered mind as scattered ; knows the developed mind as developed , and the undeveloped mind as undeveloped ; knows the surpassable mind as surpassable , and the unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable ; knows the concentrated mind as concentrated , and the unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated ; knows the freed mind as freed , and the unfreed mind as unfreed .
[ " Mind " is here used as a collective for the moments of consciousness .
Being identical with consciousness , it should not be translated by " thought . "
" Thought " and " thinking " correspond rather to the so - called " verbal operations of the mind " ; they are not , like consciousness , of primary , but of secondary nature , and are entirely absent in all sensuous consciousness , as well as in the second , third and fourth Trances .
( See eighth step ) . ]
Thus he dwells in contemplation of the mind , either with regard to his own person , or to other persons , or to both .
He beholds how consciousness arises ; beholds how it passes away ; beholds the arising and passing away of consciousness .
" Mind is there " ; this clear consciousness is present in him , because of his knowledge and mindfulness ; and he lives independent , unattached to anything in the world .
Thus does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the mind .
CONTEMPLATION OF PHENOMENA ( Mind - objects )
But how does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the phenomena ?
First , the disciple dwells in contemplation of the phenomen , of the " Five Hindrances . "
He knows when there is " Lust " in him : " In me is lust " ; knows when there is " Anger " in him : " In me is anger " ; knows when there is " Torpor and Drowsiness " in him : " In me is torpor and drowsiness " ; knows when there is " Restlessness and Mental Worry " in him : " In me is restlessness and mental worry " ; knows when there are " Doubts " in him : " In me are doubts . "
He knows when these hindrances are not in him : " In me these hindrances are not . "
He knows how they come to arise ; knows how , once arisen , they are overcome ; knows how , once overcome , they do not rise again in the future .
[ For example , Lust arises through unwise thinking on the agreeable and delightful .
it may be suppressed by the following six methods : fixing the mind upon an idea that arouses disgust ; contemplation of the loathsomeness of the body ; controlling one 's six senses ; moderation in eating ; friendship with wise and good men ; right instruction .
Lust is forever extinguished upon entrance into Anagamiship ; Restlessness is extinguished by reaching Arahatship ; Mental Worry , by reaching Sotapanship . ]
And further : the disciple dwells in contemplation of the phenomena , of the five Groups of Existence .
He knows what Corporeality is , how it arises , how it passes away ; knows what Feeling is , how it arises , how it away ; knows what Perception is , how it arises , how it passes away ; knows what the Mental Formations are , how they arise , how they pass away ; knows what Consciousness is , how it arises , how it passes away .
And further : the disciple dwells in contemplation of the phenomena of the six Subjective - Objective Sense - Bases .
He knows eye and visual objects , ear and sounds , nose and odors , tongue and tastes , body and touches , mind and mind objects ; and the fetter that arises in dependence on them , he also knows .
He knows how the fetter comes to arise , knows how the fetter is overcome , and how the abandoned fetter does not rise again in future .
And further : the disciple dwells in contemplation of the phenomena of the seven Elements of Enlightenment .
The disciple knows when there is Attentiveness in him ; when there is Investigation of the Law in him ; when there is Energy in him ; when there is Enthusiasm in him ; when there is Tranquility in him ; when there is Concentration in him ; when there is Equanimity in him .
He knows when it is not in him , knows how it comes to arise , and how it is fully developed .
And further : the disciple dwells in contemplation of the phenomena of the Four Noble Truths .
He knows according to reality , what Suffering is ; knows according to reality , what the Origin of Suffering is ; knows according to reality , what the Extinction of Suffering is ; knows according to reality , what the Path is that leads to the Extinction of Suffering .
Thus he dwells in contemplation of the phenomena , either with regard to his own person , or to other persons , or to both .
He beholds how the phenomena arise ; beholds how they pass away ; beholds the arising and passing away of the phenomena .
" Phenomena are there this consciousness is present in him because of his knowledge and mindfulness ; and he lives independent , unattached to anything in the world .
Thus does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the phenomena .
The only way that leads to the attainment of purity , to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation , to the end of pain and grief , to the entering upon the right path , and the realization of Nirvana , is these four fundamentals of attentiveness .
NIRVANA THROUGH WATCHING OVER BREATHING " Watching over In - and Out - breathing " practiced and developed , brings the four Fundamentals of Attentiveness to perfection ; the four fundamentals of attentiveness , practiced and developed bring the seven Elements of Enlightenment to perfection ; the seven elements of enlightenment , practiced and developed , bring Wisdom and Deliverance to perfection .
But how does Watching over In - and Out - breathing , practiced and developed , bring the four Fundamentals of Attentiveness to perfection ?
I . Whenever the disciple is conscious in making a long inhalation or exhalation , or in making a short inhalation or exhalation , or is training himself to inhale or exhale whilst feeling the whole [ breath ] - body , or whilst calming down this bodily function - at such a time the disciple is dwelling in " contemplation of the body , " of energy , clearly conscious , attentive , after subduing worldly greed and grief .
For , inhalation and exhalation I call one amongst the corporeal phenomena .
II .
Whenever the disciple is training himself to inhale or exhale whilst feeling rapture , or joy , or the mental functions , or whilst calming down the mental functions - at such a time he is dwelling in " contemplation of the feelings , " full of energy , clearly conscious , attentive , after subduing worldly greed and grief .
For , the full awareness of in - and outbreathing I call one amongst the feelings .
III .
Whenever the disciple is training himself to inhale or exhale whilst feeling the mind , or whilst gladdening the mind or whilst concentrating the mind , or whilst setting the mind free - at such a time he is dwelling in " contemplation of the mind , " full of energy , clearly conscious , attentive , after subduing worldly greed and grief .
For , without attentiveness and clear consciousness , I say , there is no Watching over in - and Out - breathing .
IV .
Whenever the disciple is training himself to inhale or exhale whilst contemplating impermanence , or the fading away of passion , or extinction , or detachment at such a time he is dwelling in " contemplation of the phenomena , " full of energy , clearly conscious , attentive , after subduing worldly greed and grief .
Watching over In - and Out - breathing , thus practiced and developed , brings the four Fundamentals of Attentiveness to perfection .
But how do the four Fundamentals of Attentiveness , practiced and developed , bring the seven Elements of Enlightenment to full perfection ?
Whenever the disciple is dwelling in contemplation of body , feeling , mind and phenomena , strenuous , clearly conscious , attentive , after subduing worldly greed and grief - at such a time his attentiveness is undisturbed ; and whenever his attentiveness is present and undisturbed , at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Attentiveness " ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever , whilst dwelling with attentive mind , he wisely investigates , examines and thinks over the Law - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Investigation of the Law " ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever , whilst wisely investigating , examining and thinking over the law , his energy is firm and unshaken - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Energy " ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever in him , whilst firm in energy , arises supersensuous rapture - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Rapture " ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever , whilst enraptured in mind , his spiritual frame and his mind become tranquil - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Tranquility " ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever , whilst being tranquilized in his spiritual frame and happy , his mind becomes concentrated - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Concentration ; and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection .
And whenever he thoroughly looks with indifference on his mind thus concentrated - at such a time he has gained and is developing the Element of Enlightenment " Equanimity . "
The four fundamentals of attentiveness , thus practiced and developed , bring the seven elements of enlightenment to full perfection .
But how do the seven elements of enlightenment , practiced and developed , bring Wisdom and Deliverance to full perfection ?
There , the disciple is developing the elements of enlightenment : Attentiveness , Investigation of the Law , Energy , Rapture , Tranquility , Concentration and Equanimity , bent on detachment , on absence of desire , on extinction and renunciation .
Thus practiced and developed , do the seven elements of enlightenment bring wisdom and deliverance to full perfection .
Just as the elephant hunter drives a huge stake into the ground and chains the wild elephant to it by the neck , in order to drive out of him his wonted forest ways and wishes , his forest unruliness , obstinacy and violence , and to accustom him to the environment of the village , and to teach him such good behavior as is required amongst men : in like manner also has the noble disciple to fix his mind firmly to these four fundamentals of attentiveness , so that he may drive out of himself his wonted worldly ways and wishes , his wonted worldly unruliness , obstinacy and violence , and win to the True , and realize Nirvana .
EIGHTH STEP RIGHT CONCENTRATION WHAT , now , is Right Concentration ?
Fixing the mind to a single object ( " One-pointedness of mind " ) : this is concentration .
The four Fundamentals of Attentiveness ( seventh step ) : these are the objects of concentration .
The four Great Efforts ( sixth step ) : these are the requisites for concentration .
The practicing , developing and cultivating of these things : this is the " Development " of concentration .
[ Right Concentration has two degrees of development : 1 . " Neighborhood - Concentration , " which approaches the first trance , without however attaining it ; 2 . " Attainment Concentration , " which is the concentration present in the four trances .
The attainment of the trances , however , is not a requisite for the realization of the Four Ultramundane Paths of Holiness ; and neither Neighborhood - Concentration nor Attainment - Concentration , as such , in any way possesses the power of conferring entry into the Four Ultramundane Paths ; hence , in them is really no power to free oneself permanently from evil things .
The realization of the Four Ultramundane Paths is possible only at the moment of insight into the impermanency , miserable nature , and impersonality of phenomenal process of existence .
This insight is attainable only during Neighborhood - Concentration , not during Attainment - Concentration .
He who has realized one or other of the Four Ultramundane Paths without ever having attained the Trances , is called a " Dry- visioned One , " or one whose passions are " dried up by Insight . "
He , however , who after cultivating the Trances has reached one of the Ultramundane Paths , is called " one who has taken tranquility as his vehicle . " ]
THE FOUR TRANCES
Detached from sensual objects , detached from unwholesome things , the disciple enters into the first trance , which is accompanied by " Verbal Though , " and " Rumination , " is born of " Detachment , " and filled with " Rapture , " and " Happiness . "
This first trance is free from five things , and five things are present .
When the disciple enters the first trance , there have vanished [ the 5 Hindrances ] : Lust , Ill - will , Torpor and Dullness , Restlessness and Mental Worry , Doubts ; and there are present : Verbal Thought , Rumination , Rapture , Happiness , and Concentration .
And further : after the subsiding of verbal thought and rumination , and by the gaining of inward tranquility and oneness of mind , he enters into a state free from verbal thought and rumination , the second trance , which is born of Concentration , and filled with Rapture and Happiness .
And further : after the fading away of rapture , he dwells in equanimity , attentive , clearly conscious ; and he experiences in his person that feeling , of which the Noble Ones say : " Happy lives the man of equanimity and attentive mind " - thus he enters the third trance .
And further : after the giving up of pleasure and pain , and through the disappearance of previous joy and grief , he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain , into the fourth trance , which is purified by equanimity and attentiveness .
[ The four Trances may be obtained by means of Watching over In - and Out - breathing , as well as through the fourth sublime meditation , the " Meditation of Equanimity , " and others .
The three other Sublime Meditations of " Loving Kindness , " " Compassion " , and " Sympathetic Joy " may lead to the attainment of the first three Trances .
The " Cemetery Meditations , " as well as the meditation " On Loathsomeness , " will produce only the First Trance .
The " Analysis of the Body , " and the Contemplation on the Buddha , the Law , the Holy Brotherhood , Morality , etc. , will only produce Neighborhood - Concentration . ]
Develop your concentration : for he who has concentration understands things according to their reality .
And what are these things ?
The arising and passing away of corporeality , of feeling , perception , mental formations and consciousness .
Thus , these five Groups of Existence must be wisely penetrated ; Delusion and Craving must be wisely abandoned ; Tranquility and Insight must be wisely developed .
This is the Middle Path which the Perfect One has discovered , which makes one both to see and to know , and which leads to peace , to discernment , to enlightenment , to Nirvana .
And following upon this path , you will put an end to suffering .
DEVELOPMENT OF THE EIGHTFOLD PATH IN THE DISCIPLE CONFIDENCE AND RIGHT-MINDEDNESS
( 2nd Step ) SUPPOSE a householder , or his son , or someone reborn in any family , hears the law ; and after hearing the law he is filled with confidence in the Perfect One .
And filled with this confidence , he thinks : " Full of hindrances is household life , a refuse heap ; but pilgrim life is like the open air .
Not easy is it , when one lives at home , to fulfill in all points the rules of the holy life .
How , if now I were to cut off hair and beard , put on the yellow robe and go forth from home to the homeless life ? "
And in a short time , having given up his more or less extensive possessions , having forsaken a smaller or larger circle of relations , he cuts off hair and beard , puts on the yellow robe , and goes forth from home to the homeless life .
MORALITY ( 3rd , 4th , 5th Step )
Having thus left the world , he fulfills the rules of the monks .
He avoids the killing of living beings and abstains from it .
Without stick or sword , conscientious , full of sympathy , he is anxious for the welfare of all living beings .
- He avoids stealing , and abstains from taking what is not given to him .
Only what is given to him he takes , waiting till it is given ; and he lives with a heart honest and pure .
- He avoids unchastity , living chaste , resigned , and keeping aloof from sexual intercourse , the vulgar way .
- He avoids lying and abstains from it .
He speaks the truth , is devoted to the truth , reliable , worthy of confidence , is not a deceiver of men .
- He avoids tale - bearing and abstains from it .
What he has heard here , he does not repeat there , so as to cause dissension there ; and what he has heard there , he does not repeat here , so as to cause dissension here .
Thus he unites those that are divided , and those that are united he encourages ; concord gladdens him , he delights and rejoices in concord , and it is concord that he spreads by his words .
- He avoids harsh language and abstains from it .
He speaks such words as are gentle , soothing to the ear , loving , going to the heart , courteous and dear , and agreeable to many . -
He avoids vain talk and abstains from it .
He speaks at the right time , in accordance with facts , speaks what is useful , speaks about the law and the disciple ; his speech is like a treasure , at the right moment accompanied by arguments , moderate , and full of sense .
He keeps aloof from dance , song , music and the visiting of shows ; rejects flowers , perfumes , ointments , as well as every kind of adornment and embellishment .
High and gorgeous beds he does not use .
Gold and silver he does not accept .
Raw corn and meat he does not accept .
Women and girls he does not accept .
He owns no male and female slaves , owns no goats , sheep , fowls , pigs , elephants , cows or horses , no land and goods .
He does not go on errands and do the duties of a messenger .
He keeps aloof from buying and selling things .
He has nothing to do with false measures , metals and weights .
He avoids the crooked ways of bribery , deception and fraud .
He keeps aloof from stabbing , beating , chaining , attacking , plundering and oppressing .
He contents himself with the robe that protects his body , and with the alms with which he keeps himself alive .
Wherever he goes , he is provided with these two things ; just as a winged bird , in flying , carries his wings along with him .
By fulfilling this noble Domain of Morality he feels in his heart an irreproachable happiness .
CONTROL OF THE SENSES ( 6th Step )
Now , in perceiving a form with the eye- a sound with the ear - an odor with the nose - a taste with the tongue - a touch with the body - an object with his mind , he sticks neither to the whole , nor to its details .
And he tries to ward off that which , by being unguarded in his senses , might give rise to evil and unwholesome states , to greed and sorrow ; he watches over his senses , keep his senses under control .
By practicing this noble " Control of the Senses " he feels in his heart an unblemished happiness .
ATTENTIVENESS AND CLEAR CONSCIOUSNESS
( 7th Step )
Clearly conscious is he in his going and coming ; clearly conscious in looking forward and backward ; clearly conscious in bending and stretching his body ; clearly conscious in eating , drinking , chewing and tasting ; dearly conscious in discharging excrement and urine ; clearly conscious in walking , standing , sitting , falling asleep and awakening ; clearly conscious in speaking and keeping silent .
Now , being equipped with this lofty Morality , equipped with this noble Control of the Senses , and filled with this noble " Attentiveness and Clear Consciousness , he chooses a secluded dwelling in the forest , at the foot of a tree , on a mountain , in a cleft , in a rock cave , on a burial ground , on a woody table - land , in the open air , or on a heap of straw .
Having returned from his alms - round , after the meal , he sits himself down with legs crossed , body erect , with attentiveness fixed before him .
ABSENCE OF THE FIVE HINDRANCES
He has cast away Lust ; he dwells with a heart free from lust ; from lust he cleanses his heart .
He has cast away Ill - will ; he dwells with a heart free from ill - will ; cherishing love and compassion toward all living beings , he cleanses his heart from ill - will .
He has cast away Torpor and Dullness ; he dwells free from torpor and dullness ; loving the light , with watchful mind , with clear consciousness , he cleanses his mind from torpor and dullness .
He has cast away Restlessness and Mental Worry ; dwelling with mind undisturbed , with heart full of peace , he cleanses his mind from restlessness and mental worry .
He has cast away Doubt ; dwelling free from doubt , full of confidence in the good , he cleanses his heart from doubt .
THE TRANCES ( 8th Step )
He has put aside these five Hindrances and come to know the paralyzing corruptions of the mind .
And far from sensual impressions , far from unwholesome things , he enters into the Four Trances .
INSIGHT ( 1st Step )
But whatsoever there is of feeling , perception , mental formation , or consciousness - all these phenomena he regards as " impermanent , " " subject to pain , " as infirm , as an ulcer , a thorn , a misery , a burden , an enemy , a disturbance , as empty and " void of an Ego " ; and turning away from these things , he directs his mind towards the abiding , thus : " This , verily , is the Peace , this is the Highest , namely the end of all formations , the forsaking of every substratum of rebirth , the fading away of craving ; detachment , extinction : Nirvana . "
And in this state he reaches the " Cessation of Passions . "
NIRVANA
And his heart becomes free from sensual passion , free from the passion for existence , free from the passion of ignorance .
" Freed am I ! " : this knowledge arises in the liberated one ; and he knows : " Exhausted is rebirth , fulfilled the Holy Life ; what was to be done , has been done ; naught remains more for this world to do . "
Forever am I liberated ,
This is the last time that I 'm born , No new existence waits for me .
This , verily , is the highest , holiest wisdom : to know that all suffering has passed away .
This , verily , is the highest , holiest peace : appeasement of greed , hatred and delusion .
THE SILENT THINKER " I am " is a vain thought ; " I am not " a vain thought ; " I shall be " is a vain thought ; " I shall not be " is a vain thought .
Vain thoughts are a sickness , an ulcer , a thorn .
But after overcoming all vain thoughts , one is called silent thinker . "
And the thinker , the Silent One , does no more arise , no more pass away , no more tremble , no more desire .
For there is nothing in him that he should arise again .
And as he arises no more , how should he grow old again ?
And as he grows no more old , how should he die again ?
And as he dies no more , how should he tremble ?
And as he trembles no more , how should he have desire ?
THE TRUE GOAL
Hence , the purpose of the Holy Life does not consist in acquiring alms , honor , or fame , nor in gaining morality , concentration , or the eye of knowledge .
That unshakable deliverance of the heart : that , verily , is the object of the Holy Life , that is its essence , that is its goal .
And those , who formerly , in the past , were Holy and Enlightened Ones , those Blessed Ones also have pointed out to their disciples this self - same goal , as has been pointed out by me to my disciples .
And those , who afterwards , in the future , will be Holy and Enlightened Ones , those Blessed Ones also will point out to their disciples this self - same goal , as has been pointed out by me to my disciples .
However , Disciples , it may be that ( after my passing away ) you might think : " Gone is the doctrine of our Master .
We have no Master more . "
But you should not think ; for the Law and the Discipline , which I have taught you , Will , after my death , be your master .
The Law be your light , The Law be your refuge !
Do not look for any other refuge !
Disciples , the doctrines , which I advised you to penetrate , you should well preserve , well guard , so that this Holy Life may take its course and continue for ages , for the weal and welfare of the many , as a consolation to the world , for the happiness , weal and welfare of heavenly beings and men .
THE END
I AM about to take your breath away .
How do I know this ?
Because I felt as if the wind had been knocked out of me when I realized that in the middle of a deep recession I am recommending a beer that costs $ 35 a bottle .
What ?
Am I insane ?
Probably .
It would take a rare occasion for me to pay $ 35 for a bottle , but I ’ll tell you about this extraordinary beer anyway .
It is the 2006 vintage  for a beer this expensive must have a vintage  of the Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien , an unfiltered , unpasteurized , limited - edition ale brewed by Brasserie des Franches - Montagnes in Switzerland .
In its favor , the beer comes in a 25.4 - ounce bottle , rather than the more typical 12 ounces .
More important , it is superb : brown in color yet bright in the mouth , with a bracing , spicy , tart , almost woolly complexity reminiscent of a Belgian lambic .
About the only thing against it is the price .
Aside from that , what makes this beer so unusual ?
The Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien is one of a growing number of beers that spend some time aging in oak barrels , which may be typical for wine and whiskey but is a rare thing indeed for beer .
In a way , the brewers of these barrel - aged beers have reached backward into the future .
Centuries ago , barrels were the only vessels in which to brew and store beers .
Most brewers strove to eliminate any flavorings that wood might impart to the beers , soaking and scrubbing the wood to make the barrels as neutral as possible .
In industrialized times , of course , steel and aluminum serve a brewer ’s purpose with far less effort and wear than wood .

While going through the back and forth of GOP Senators blaming everyone else for the collapse of the Senate bailout legislation , Schuster presented two rather " Bad Facts " for the GOP ’s stated " Not our fault that everyone is being so unreasonable " position .
Even though the photo op GOP Senators were shown standing at the podium saying it ’s all those money grubbing union folks fault , there was more to the death of the Auto bailout ( like Kossacks ever expected anything different , eh ? ) .
First - UAW President Gettelfinger made a statement to the press that GOP Senator Corker admitted in talks with the UAW negotiators that the issue of [ union ] wages was " largely about politics within the GOP Caucus " – implying that the economics of the wage issue had no real impact on the problem on the table but they had to go after the wages for political reasons ( nice of Corker to admit that ) .
Ok , legacy media types might think that ’s just the expected " He said , she said " of two parties that could n’t agree on an issue .
But then Schuster pulls out an internal GOP caucus document , an " Action Alert " as he called it on the broadcast , which was circulated to GOP Senators on Wednesday morning - even before the House Bill was passed .
The excerpted document shown on Countdown offered ...
" This is the Democrats first opportunity to payoff organized labor after the election ....
Republicans should stand firm and take their first shot against organized labor .....
If we can hold the Republicans we can beat this . "
WOW !
I mean is n’t this the note from Benedict Arnold to the enemy ?
The GOP Senators do n’t care about the economy during the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression - and put it in writing so everyone can " get on board " .
In this great National crisis they continue to put Party First - Country be damned .
McCain 's Election logo is starting to make more and more sense .
They say in war there are no atheists in foxholes .
Our soldiers in the field better hope they never have to occupy a foxhole with a GOP Senator – he ’d ask your political registration and move you to the part of the battlefield where you ’re more likely to get shot .
Just a word so beyond Hypocrisy that yet needs to be created in Websters for these dirtbags .
In this past August ’s post “ On Desecration “ , concerning the infamous PZ Myers wafer affair , I mocked the ignorance of a group calling itself the Confraternity of Catholic Clergy :
We find the actions of University of Minnesota ( Morris ) Professor Paul Myers reprehensible , inexcusable , and unconstitutional .
At the time , I did n’t think this was anything other than the raving of a few right - wing Catholic wackaloons , even if they were priests .
But I may have to change that assessment .
To judge by some recent news articles , the Catholic church , which at least used to stand for good education , has become infected with the same anti-intellectual disease that pervades so many sects of evangelical Protestantism .
Let ’s lead with the most glaring example : the Bishop of Lancaster says that “ educated Catholics ” are giving rise to dissent and disloyalty in the church .
He argues that mass education has led to “ sickness in the Church ” , and that education has a “ dark side ” due to – what else ?
– original sin .
Although the good bishop stops just short of calling for the abolition of higher education , he does say that Catholics attending university need to be “ better - equipped to challenge the erroneous thinking of their contemporaries ” .
The only way I can interpret this is as a wish that Catholics would be more dogmatic in their faith so that they are impervious to changing their minds as a result of contrary information .
Next up , we have a cardinal – not a priest , not just a bishop , but a cardinal – saying that President - elect Barack Obama is “ apocalyptic ” ( HT : Andrew Sullivan ) .
Apocalyptic , Cardinal Stafford ?
Really ?
I had assumed the equation of Obama with the Antichrist was one bit of hysteria confined to the snake - handlers and tongue - speakers , but if you want to jump in , be my guest .
The election of Barack Obama seems to have driven many Catholic leaders around the bend , not just this one .
( Consider the infamous South Carolina priest who told his parishioners not to receive Communion if they voted for Obama .
He ’s not the first one , either . )
This is almost certainly because bishops across the nation instructed their parishioners not to vote for Obama , only to have their demand largely ignored .
The Catholic flock , it seems , is more progressive than their benighted shepherds , and the increasingly frantic assertions of empty authority from the pulpit are more and more often met with a shrug .
In “ The Fading of the Church “ , I speculated about one possible reason for Catholicism ’s ongoing decline in the First World :
… young Catholics feel increasingly disconnected from a church that continues to bash gays , exclude women from the priesthood , and preach against contraception .
As society becomes increasingly liberal and tolerant , the Catholic church continues to cling obstinately to its irrational rules , and is accordingly being left in the dust .
A New York Times article , Catholics and Choice ( in the Voting Booth ) , makes a similar argument :
After a presidential campaign in which it was widely perceived that the dominant message from the bishops was that Catholics were morally obliged not to vote for a candidate supporting abortion rights , exit polls show that Catholics voted 52 percent to 45 percent for Senator Barack Obama .
… If the bishops sweat a little over these figures next week , the reason wo n’t be worry about their political prowess but about their pastoral and moral effectiveness .
By appearing to tie their moral stance on abortion so closely to a particular political choice , have they in fact undermined their moral persuasiveness on that issue as well as their pastoral effectiveness generally ?
That the Catholic hierarchy has undermined itself by being so resolutely out of step with its own flock is difficult to doubt , but I think the problem goes deeper than that .
As lay Catholics , like society as a whole , become more progressive , the church hierarchy remains stuck where it is , clinging to the prejudices of the past .
Their stance on choice is just one symptom of that deeper underlying problem .
Even today , the Catholic church still bars women from all positions of power .
It still opposes equal rights for gays , compassionate euthanasia for the dying , and the responsible use of contraception .
A church with so many manifestly immoral and irrational positions , which so plainly elevates its own dogmas over human equality and well - being , should not delude itself into believing it can speak with any moral authority to the rest of us .
Where do aged action stars go ?
Steven Seagal is still using his sword skills to defeat vampires in this Against the Dark trailer , and it 's nice to see him up and about again .
Packs of vampires are attacking the city , and it's up to Steven Seagal and a group of kids to end the slaughter before it spreads too far .

Seagal plays Commander Tao — no , I did not make that up — a master swordsman whose job it is to wave around objects and make blanketed statements , and I 'm assuming , say , philosophical things as well with that name .
As a fan of the man , I must say Seagal is brandishing a lot of weaponry in this , perhaps due to his inability to do anything agile anymore ?
We 'll have to wait to find out , as Against The Dark is n't released until 10 February 2009 .
This comes from an e-mail titled , “ It ’s worse than I thought , ” from a reader with a good deal of inside - the - Beltway experience :
It ’s Christmas … This has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT .
In fact very little has really been changed with respect to the original Paulson plan…
The new PIG has everything to do with Senate Finance .
There are 300 pages of tax breaks .
McCain and Obama are out on the campaign trail … What are they saying ???
Washington back the bill !
Yet this thing is nothing but “ earmarks , ” which McCain said he would veto … and “ business as ususal ” which is the entire basis of Obama ’s Change campaign .
And I ’ve been watching CNBC all day … the finance talking heads can’t even begin to understand what ’s happened here .
This is a stunning power grab by a small group of US Senators … one assumes with the backing of Bush .
Pelosi had her chance … Paulson got down on one knee .
When she could n’t deliver , it became a Senate issue and they have overwhelmed everyone …
Incredible …hey added hundreds of billions to this with all the crap …..
And from another reader from his ( no doubt in vain ) communiques to elected officials :
Overall during the 1990s , Japan tried 10 fiscal stimulus packages totaling more than 100 trillion yen , and each failed to cure the recession .
What the spending programs have done , however , is put Japan ’s government in poor fiscal shape .
The “ on - budget ” government spending has caused public debt to exceed 100 percent of GDP ( highest in the G7 ) , and even more debt is apparent when the “ off - budget ” sector is included .
Japan tried changing the rules , they took assets , they tried to prevent them from going down .
Look at the Japan Stock market ever since .
Despite all that money the market continued to go down , as will ours .
The scare tactic being used in washington would lead you to believe otherwise .
Of course Jean Claude Trichet wants you to approve this .
Deutche Bank , UBS , etc.. are all knee - deep in these credit derivatives
…
He wants us to bail out them , meanwhile he refused to cut interest rates this entire time which would have been favorable to the dollar .
Now we are facing a real threat of hyperinflation if congress allows this plan to proceed .
No amount of jiggering this bill is going to make it right .
However , Doing Something is clearly taking precedence over Doing Something That Might Actually Work .
McDonalds now has less of a chance of defaulting on his debt than the United States .
That ’s correct , we are now facing the very real possibility of having our own national debt downgraded .
Lastly , PLEASE do yourself a favor and look at your own economic data .
Personal Savings Rate , Household Debut and Foregin ownership of our debt : Just look at these 3 graphs then ask yourself a few questions about this bailout http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PSAVERT
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CMDEBT
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FDHBFI
Like the monolines , the US will be seen as a less than stellar credit long before any debt downgrade were to occur .
Japan ’s yen debt rating was single A before recent upgrades .
And from another reader who worked in the financial markets and now has a ringside seat :
While Roosevelt refused to get involved in prescribing economic medicine between his election in 1932 and his inauguration , advisers said Mr. Obama had concluded that he could not follow that example and remain silent until he was sworn in .
At the same time , they said , Mr. Obama understands he should not overstep his bounds and wants his inauguration to mark a clean break from the past .
“ Those who say wait and let the process unfold for two months before the inauguration are sorely mistaken , ” said Jack Quinn , a former top official in the Clinton administration .
“ We are in such turmoil that his clearly and firmly putting his hand on the tiller is absolutely critical .
He needs to do this .
He needs to be in the middle of this . ”
Mr. Obama has been conferring with Congressional leaders about a possible package of $ 100 billion for public works , unemployment benefits , winter heating assistance , food stamps and aid to cities and states that could be passed during a lame - duck session the week of Nov. 17 .
He has also been talking regularly with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. about the economic environment and hopes to work closely with him during this interim period as Mr. Paulson makes decisions about how to invest the $ 700 billion given him by Congress to shore up the financial system .
But there are limits to Mr. Obama ’s capacity to act in the short term .
The politics of assembling a stimulus package in this netherworld between administrations could be difficult to overcome as he tries to balance pent - up demand from now - victorious Democrats eager to use their power of the purse with the reality that Mr. Bush still holds the veto pen for 77 more days .
In the end , Democrats said , Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders would pare their spending plans if they could not get Mr. Bush and Senate Republicans to agree , then come back in January when they have unfettered control .
“ If he gets out there too much and gets too enmeshed in policy disputes before he ’s inaugurated , when he does n’t have control of the federal bureaucracy , that could really backfire on him , ” said Elaine C. Kamarck , who was Vice President Al Gore ’s domestic policy adviser in the 1990s .
“ It ’s a really delicate balance he has to strike . ”
Whatever collaboration there may be in the short term , Mr. Obama represents the end of the Bush era in the long term .
Yet he will find himself dealing with the Bush legacy for years to come .
He promised on the campaign trail to close the detention facility at the United States naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , but analysts in both parties expect that to be more difficult than he imagines .
He will inherit a deficit that could approach $ 1 trillion next year , which could curtail his ambitions , like expanding health care coverage .
Reports suggest that Manchester City overspent on new signing Nigel de Jong by as much as £ 17 m .

It is believed that the midfielder had a release clause inserted into his Hamburg contract , allowing him to leave in the summer for a cut - price fee .

Black Canary Barbie Controversy
Black Canary Barbie
Black Canary Barbie Doll " kicks " into action , wearing a costume of faux leather blakc jacket , signature fishnet stockings , and striking faux leather boots with " metallic " accents .
A mane of blond hair and deep crimson lips give the doll a dramatic look , as do the dark brows framing azure blue eyes , outlined by vivid ebony lashes .
Mattel Inc. has come full circle with it 's DC Comics super heroine line of Barbie dolls , including , known for her high - powered sonic scream - the " Canary Cry .
"
The original Barbie , launched in March 1959 , was inspired by a German fashion doll called Bild Lilli , based on the comic - strip character Lilli , a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it .
Barbie , a popular Christmas gift for little girls worldwide for nearly 50 years , has not been without her critics , and some people are not thrilled with Black Canary Barbie 's S&M look .
“ Barbie has always been on the tarty side and this is taking it too far , says religious group Christian Voice .
" A children ’s doll in sexually suggestive clothing is irresponsible – it ’s filth . ”
Well , that sonic scream does have the ability to shatter objects and incapacitate villains .

Obama Halts New or Pending Bush Regulations
By Ed O'Keefe
Acting only hours after his inauguration , President Barack Obama has ordered a freeze on new or proposed regulations at all government agencies and departments .
In a memo issued by new White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , the president tells agency and department heads that :
" ... no proposed or final regulation should be sent to the Office of Federal Register for publication unless and until it has been reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20 , 2009 , or in the case of the Department of Defense , the Secretary of Defense . "
The memo also orders the withdrawal of all final or proposed regulations not yet published by the Federal Register .
Department and agency heads have also been asked to " consider extending for 60 days the effective date of regulations that have been published in the Federal Register but not yet taken effect " unless they impact health , safety , environmental , financial , or national security matters -- obviously now subject to the interpretation of Obama 's appointees .
The Eye will keep ... an Eye ... on the various regulations kept , canned or reconsidered .
( Read the full memo here . )
Illustration by Peter Schrank
EUROPE'S leaders began 2009 in a spooked frame of mind , and not just because of wars over Gaza and gas .
The street riots in Greece before Christmas left several fretting that conditions may be ripe for wider unrest , even a “ European May 1968 ” .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , was so alarmed by his chats with fellow European Union summiteers in December that he went home and postponed a school reform that was sparking protests .
As unemployment rises , governments are sure to face calls to shield their voters with protectionist barriers to trade .
Most EU leaders are sensible folk who know that such policies may look attractive to individuals but would harm the wider public .
Whether they are brave enough to explain this to their voters is another matter .
Even if they are , voters in some countries may refuse to believe them , taking the view that their rulers are liars , interested only in looking after themselves .
Without a crystal ball , it is impossible to predict where political trouble might strike .
So Charlemagne has a suggestion .
There has been much recent research into a public - health problem that shares some surprisingly similar features : the overuse of antibiotics .
Consumption of these drugs varies strikingly across Europe , with Greeks , the heaviest users , taking three times as many as the Dutch , who use the fewest .
Rather like trade protection , the popping of an antibiotic offers false comfort to individuals .
In an anonymous 2008 survey , Greek paediatricians said that 85 % of parents demanded antibiotics for children with the common cold virus .
As with political debates over free trade , some people appear to suffer from a corrosive lack of trust when the authorities tell them that they are demanding the wrong thing .
Even when told that antibiotics cannot fight viruses , 65 % of Greek parents in the survey insisted they did until their doctors gave in .
Scientists talk of a broad north - south divide in Europe , with the Dutch , Germans , Scandinavians and Baltics consuming few antibiotics , but lots being guzzled in the Mediterranean .
The main users are Greece , Cyprus , France and Italy , with Spain almost as high once illicit sales without a prescription are counted .
Just as with trade barriers , pill - popping has bad side - effects .
For example , in most north European countries , penicillin can deal with a common nasty , streptococcus pneumonia in all but 5 % of cases .
But in high antibiotic consumers like Cyprus , France and Spain , more than a quarter of cases do not respond to penicillin .
The antibiotic divide has been leapt on by some north Europeans as a stick for bashing feckless Latins .
Flemish nationalists from the Dutch - speaking north of Belgium note that Europe 's antibiotic frontier runs right through their country , with French - speakers in the south consuming far more than Flemings .
Belgians as a whole consume twice as many as their Dutch neighbours .
Questions have even been asked in the Belgian parliament about how the kingdom ended up on the wrong side of a “ Latin v Calvinist ” divide .
Herman Goossens , a Flemish doctor who has also worked in the Netherlands , sees a cultural element to antibiotic use , but is wary of politically charged talk about pill - munching Francophones .
He notes that southern Belgium is also home to lots of former coalminers with chronic ailments .
He prefers to talk of different attitudes to risk .
In the Netherlands , if somebody has a nasty cold and their doctor gives them antibiotics , they will say “ my doctor is a coward , he goes straight for the strong drugs , ” says Mr Goossens .
“ That is very different in Flanders . ”
Dominique Monnet , at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , an EU agency , sees a link between drug use and a population 's tolerance of uncertainty .
But he adds caveats .
Germany 's low use of antibiotics , for example , must take into account the popularity of alternative medicine , he says .
One study found that 40 % of Germans disliked antibiotics , fearing they weaken the body 's natural immunities .
And economic and structural factors cannot be ignored .
Some countries require a doctor 's certificate for people off work with flu — and , while at the doctor , why not ask for a prescription ?
Some impose drug budgets on family doctors , which they may not exceed .
Expensive modern antibiotics are less often prescribed in ex-communist countries .
Places like Belgium and France allow patients to shop around among doctors , so that those who refuse to prescribe may lose income .
In Greece , Italy and Spain , it is shockingly easy to buy antibiotics without a prescription , and self - medication is popular .
An undercover survey in Athens in 2008 secured antibiotics without a prescription in almost all the pharmacies visited .
The protectionist drug
But above all , many experts come back to levels of anxiety , and intolerance for uncertainty , as a key driver of antibiotic demand .
And this may explain one final correlation .
A Eurobarometer poll last year asked Europeans whether globalisation offered an opportunity for economic growth .
The map of the results is remarkably similar to the map of antibiotic consumption .
Compare countries that use the most antibiotics with those most sceptical of the benefits of globalisation .
Four of the top five match ; and , at the other end of the scale , six of the bottom ten match .
( America , a place addicted to interventionist medicine , would be near the top of an EU chart for antibiotic use : it is also a country currently wrestling with strong protectionist instincts . )
Yet this correlation also gives grounds for hope .
Education and transparency work wonders in reducing antibiotic use : public information campaigns in France and Belgium have been notably successful .
Cultural differences cannot be erased altogether : some societies will always be more trusting or anxious than others .
But trust can be built .
Many forms of protection are illusory , and may harm your family and neighbours .
Those in authority should explain this , whether it is a popular message or not .
Power is on its way — but so is heat and humidity Power is on its way — but so is heat
CenterPoint says big fixes done ; forecasters say cool front leaving
On Day 6 of the largest blackout in Texas history , CenterPoint Energy 's power restorations approached a million but that still leaves more than half its customers without power nearly a week after Hurricane Ike shredded the local electricity network .
The transmission company that serves most of the Houston area said its army of 11,000 workers from its own ranks and from cooperating companies outside the region have completed all major fixes — from high - voltage transmission lines to neighborhood substations — except for those on devastated Galveston Island .
Those still without power are about to lose one natural blessing that followed the storm — a cool front that dried the air and made houses without power for air conditioning more tolerable .
The National Weather Service predicts higher temperatures , more humidity and a chance of rain today .
" No more 50s at night , " said meteorologist Josh Lichter .
" At least not for a while . "
Beginning Saturday and continuing through at least Tuesday , high temperatures will be in the upper 80s , forecasters say .
CenterPoint spokesman Floyd LeBlanc characterized the next stage of repairs as a " sweeping strategy " focused on repairing line fuses that serve 100 to 300 customers .
A customer can translate to several people , such as a household .
This morning , CenterPoint said it had restored power to 1.05 million of its 2.26 million customers , 46 percent .
Entergy reported that 197,000 , just about half its Texas customers , had power this morning .
Texas - New Mexico Power had restored 73 percent of 115,000 customers as of Thursday night .
' Everybody can't be first '
With all major fixes complete and still only about half of service restored , CenterPoint is getting a better grasp of how seriously the storm damaged its system , LeBlanc said .
" This line fuse restoration stage we 've progressed to is really a massive tree removal effort , " he said .
" We put groups into isolated territories .
First the linemen ground the wires to make it secure , then tree crews go in there like gangbusters and as soon as they 're done the linemen are back in putting poles back up and hanging the wire . "
The result is a patchwork that can restore power to many people in a neighborhood while others right across the street or next door stay in the dark .
" In a situation where everyone wants their power on now it 's tough .
Everybody can't be first and everybody can't be next .
We have to take care of the most acute situations and work to get the most customers back at one time , " LeBlanc said .
At this point , that usually wo n't include fixing transformers that may serve just 10 customers .
One acute need , he said , is restoring electricity to nursing homes and assisted living facilities .
Breathing machines that run on electricity and diabetes medicine that requires refrigeration put some people who need those things in a bind .
And it 's becoming a chore to find fresh food for residents in large care facilities since everything in industrial - sized freezers and refrigerators spoiled days ago .
Meanwhile , some residents who have power found it 's enough to operate lights , televisions and some appliances , but not enough juice to power central air - conditioning units .
CenterPoint said usually that problem is on the customer 's side of the system , starting with the weatherhead — the capped metal pipe where the power enters the house .
A damaged weatherhead can prevent any restoration of power , or limit power .
The customer will need to call a licensed electrician for those repairs , the company said , as well as for damage to meters and internal house wiring .
Such repairs typically require a city permit , although that rule may be waived during an emergency .
Transformers still failing
The city of Houston is waiving the requirement for Ike - related damage to outside power components , said Gary Bridges , senior assistant director for code enforcement with the city 's Public Works Department
As customers try to determine when their lights will be back , CenterPoint 's online map showing power outages by ZIP code has proved so popular it has cratered the company 's Web site several times .
And some residents say information provided for their area does not jibe with their experience .
LeBlanc said keeping the report current is more complicated than it may sound , " and as soon as it's issued it 's old . "
He cited two main reasons for discrepancies .
Weakened trees continue to fall on power lines , causing new outages or undoing repairs .
And surges can knock out transformers as circuits are restored .
Dana Gordon contemplated the return of heat and possibility of rain Thursday as he sat outside his home in Riverside off Texas 288 .
" That first night after the electricity went out , it was just terrible .
You 're trying to sleep , you 're sweating and swatting away mosquitoes .
It 's going to be awful , " Gordon said .
He said he worries how the heat will affect his wife , Donna , since it can worsen her symptoms from multiple sclerosis .
Lichter , the meteorologist , said a 10 percent chance of rain is projected each day this weekend and Friday 's high is expected to reach 86 degrees , while highs in days to come could hit 87 or 88 .
" But this is not going to be anything like August heat — we 're not going to get close to that , " he said .

Via StumbleUpon , I came across this short text page which lists three mathematical ‘ proofs ’ which seem to violate common sense , listed below .
The first is :
The second one is :
The third one is :
Each of these proofs is ( intentionally ) wrong !
They highlight classic fallacies in mathematical thinking .
See if you can figure out where , in each of them , the proof goes wrong , and then look for the answers below the fold …
( Note : the third proof involves the ‘ imaginary number ’ .
If you ’re not familiar with it , you can safely skip that problem , as it is closely related to one of the others . )
The mistake in the first proof is highlighted in red below :
The mistake lies in the assumption that we can divide by .
Why is this a problem ?
Because , according to the equation we started with , !
We are not allowed to divide by zero , and therefore the result highlighted in red is invalid .
The algebra ‘ muddies the waters ’ significantly , and it can be helpful to see the same proof , but with .
The first two steps suggest that .
The third step suggests that .
The fourth step suggests that .
We run into problems in the next step , in trying to divide both sides of this equation by zero !
The next ‘ proof ’ is a little more subtle .
Again , we highlight the problem step in red :
The problem here is that , in order to get to the step in red , there is an implicit square root taken of both sides of the equation .
However , there are potentially two roots to any square ; e.g. has possible solutions or .
The ‘ proof ’ above assumes that the positive root is correct , which leads to the erroneous answer .
If one looks at the negative root , one finds that , which leads right back to the starting equation .
This proof , incidentally , might have been helpful to legislators in Indiana back in the late 1900s 1800s .
The third ‘ proof ’ suffers from essentially the same problem as the second , except that complex numbers are involved :
The step highlighted in red assumes that we break up the square roots as , and then take individually the positive root of each term .
It is wrong , however , to assume that the positive roots are always the correct ones when dealing with the square root of an equation .
If we have an equation of the form
,
we can at best say that , and not necessarily both are true .
Nothing changes if we take the square root of an equation of the form
,
in which case we can at best conclude that
.
For our ‘ proof ’ above , we find that the statement in red should be replaced with “ or , but not necessarily both . ”
There ’s a nice classic book that covers such mathematical errors , and other more important mathematical paradoxes : Bryan Bunch , Mathematical Fallacies and Paradoxes ( Dover , New York , 1997 ) .
If you really want to be certain that you understand such mistakes , try writing your own ‘ proof ’ for !
Feel free to post yours in the comments .
I ’ll add my own ‘ proof ’ at a later date !
They have discovered that a larger bottom can help to protect against diabetes . [>
Researchers believe the type of fat that accumulates around the hips and bottom may offer some protection against developing the condition . [>
Fat found commonly around the lower areas , known as subcutaneous fat , or fat that collects under the skin , helps to improve the sensitivity of the hormone insulin . [ >
Insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar and therefore a big bottom might offer some protection against diabetes . [>
Scientists at Harvard Medical School in America said that fat which collects around the stomach can raise a person ’s risk of diabetes and heart disease . [>
However , people with pear - shaped bodies , with fat deposits in the buttocks and hips , are less prone to these disorders . [>
Dr Ronald Kahn , who led the study , said that the research on mice had shown that not all fat was bad and could help to prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes . [>

Dr Iain Frame , director of research at health charity Diabetes UK , said : “ It has long been known that the distribution of fat may be a determining factor in increasing risk to developing Type 2 diabetes . [>

“ It would certainly take away from our key message based on hard scientific evidence rather than the extrapolation of preliminary findings from experiments in mice , that maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet low in fat , salt and sugar and with plenty of fruit and vegetables is by far the best way for most people in Britain to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes . ” [ >
Microsoft will push out an emergency security patch for Internet Explorer on Wednesday , addressing a critical security hole currently being exploited in the wild .
Redmond issued advanced notice for tomorrow 's fix , describing the out - of - cycle patch as protection from " remote code execution . "
Unscheduled updates are pretty rare for Microsoft , stressing the potentially serious nature of the flaw .
Although the last time Microsoft broke it 's update cycle was in late October – it was the first time it had done so in about 18 months .
The latest zero - day vulnerability stems from data binding bugs that allows hackers access to a computer 's memory space , allowing attackers to remotely execute malicious code as IE crashes , Microsoft has said .
Although the exploit was at first contained to warez and porn sites hosted on a variety of Chinese domains , the malicious JavaScript code has since spread to more trusted sites though SQL injection .
The flaw is primarily being used to steal video game passwords at present , but could potentially be used to retrieve more critical sensitive data from users as well .
The vulnerability is specifically targeted at surfers running IE 7 , but it's also known to affect versions 5 , 6 , and 8 of the browser as well .
All IE users are advised to install the update .
Microsoft 's emergency patch will become available Wednesday at 1 PM EST from auto-update and the Microsoft Download Center .
A separate patch will be made available for those running IE8 Beta 2 . ®
Michigan man , 93 , freezes to death after city cuts off electricity
By Tom Eley and Jerry White
28 January 2009
Bay City home where Marvin E. Schur froze to death
On January 17 , the frozen body of 93 - year - old Marvin E. Schur was found by neighbors at his home in Bay City , Michigan , several days after the municipal power company had restricted his access to electricity due to outstanding bills .
The death has provoked outrage among residents in this working class city of 36,000 , located where the Saginaw River flows into Lake Huron , about 100 miles north of Detroit .
On January 13 , the city ordered the installation of a device known as a “ limiter ” that restricts the amount of electricity a household can use .
Between the time the limiter was placed and January 17 , a bitter Arctic cold front settled over Michigan , with overnight temperatures in the Bay City area reaching minus 10 degrees below zero ( Fahrenheit ) .
It is not clear when Schur died , but an obituary from the local newspaper placed the death on January 15 .
Robert Belleman , Bay City ’s city manager , said that Schur had accrued over $ 1,000 in unpaid electricity bills over the preceding months .
No effort was made to visit Schur prior to the suspension .
Neighbors became alarmed when they noticed that Schur ’s windows had become covered with ice .
When neighbors found Schur ’s body , temperatures in his house were below freezing , and water in his sink was frozen .
The oven door was propped open , which suggests that Schur made a futile attempt to heat his home using the appliance .
Kanu Virani , a medical examiner who performed the autopsy , said that Schur died of hypothermia , which she described as a “ slow , painful death . ”
“ He was wearing a double layer of clothes , trying to stay warm , ” Virani said .
Schur had no children and was a widower , but a neighbor named Jim , a retired city worker , told the World Socialist Web Site that he was well liked , frequently waving to passersby from his picture window that faces east onto Chilson Street , the working class residential lane where he had lived for years .
Marvin Schur , or “ Mutts ” as he was known , was a retired worker , having labored as a pattern cutter for years at Baker - Perkins , a Saginaw factory that makes specialized machinery for the food industry .
He was born April 30 , 1915 , and was a life - long resident of the area , serving as a medic with the US Army during WW II .
The " limiter " placed on Shur 's electric meter
The “ limiter ” is a punitive device designed to compel homeowners to pay their bills .
It is equipped with a switch - like circuit breaker that completely shuts off the power supply should the household surpass the established voltage level .
This is what happened to Schur .
City officials say homeowners can go outside and reset the devices to allow limited electricity to flow again .
But they acknowledged that there was no personal contact with Schur to instruct him how to reset the device .
Neighbors also noted that Schur was hard of hearing and suffered from some form of dementia .
Nevertheless , if after 10 days a household has still not paid its electricity bills , Bay City cuts off the electric supply completely .
The city ’s electric department director , Phil Newston , told the Bay City Times that the city currently has 60 to 70 limiters installed across the city , about three times the number in use last year , and that the city sends out about 50 shutoff notices per week .
He attributed the increase to the economic crisis .
“ It ’s been terrible .
We ’ve seen it for over a year now , ” he said .
“ We actually have almost two full - time people just dedicated to going around and turning people on and off and putting on limiters .
It ’s just really bad . ”
The municipal power company has been steadily raising rates due to the increasing cost of procuring electricity from the major suppliers in Michigan .
Last summer , electricity rates were raised by 9 percent .
These rate increases present serious challenges to low - income families , families with children , the unemployed and retired workers such as Schur , who live on a fixed income .
On Monday evening , the Bay City Commission met , just as news of the freezing death of Schur had made national news , for a previously scheduled meeting to vote on another electricity rate increase , this one of 3 percent .
“ But what voters wanted to talk about was how a 93 - year - old man froze to death in his home after the city limited his electric use , ” the Bay City Times reported .
The new increase was nonetheless approved , by a vote of five to three .
“ We ’ve gotten very creative in the ways we purchase power , but it ’s a very complicated market and it ’s an expensive market , ” Mayor Charles Brunner said .
“ We have to pass the costs on . ”
The costs are passed on to a population that can ill afford them .
Like much of Michigan , the economy of Bay City is tied to the auto industry .
At its peak General Motors ’ Bay City Powertrain employed 4,500 people .
As late as 2006 it had 1,000 workers .
It now employs 300 - 400 workers .
GM ’s nearby Saginaw Metal Castings plant had 1,700 hourly workers as recently as 2004 .
It employs around 800 workers today .
Local residents expressed outrage over the death .
Michelle , a local worker who lives several blocks north of Schur ’s residence on Chilson Street , said that everyone she knew was angry over the death .
She became tearful as she described residents ’ reaction .
“ Everyone is outraged .
Everyone is calling each other .
I thought there was some sort of law against power shutoffs in the winter , ” she said .
“ I guess I was wrong .
It makes me think of my 87 - year - old grandmother , and what would happen to her . ”
“ Our heating bill is outrageous .
I have small children , and we spend between $ 400 and $ 500 to heat our home . ”
The town has declined , she said .
“ My Dad worked for Dow Chemical , ” which is located in nearby Midland .
“ We were n’t rich , but were n’t concerned about losing our utilities either .
It ’s a tight - knit community . ”
Those visiting web articles covering the death have left comments , including hundreds of messages on a discussion thread after a Bay City Times article .
One reader wrote , “ I ca n’t believe people and businesses these days .
To let a 93 - year - old freeze to death because of a bill .
I do n’t care how big the bill is .
A man is dead because of money … ”
A former resident of Bay City wrote , “ I am so happy I no longer live there .
At my age , I would fear for my life …
Remember , folks , you may be old some day — if your city fathers do n’t kill you first . ”
Dee Mitrowski , of Moriarty , New Mexico wrote , “ Bay City ’s old motto : ‘ A beautiful view ... of life . ’
Bay City ’s new motto :
‘ We value every life ... according to your utility bill . ’
Local officials have reacted with callousness .
The electricity commissioner and the mayor attempted to pin the blame on Schur .
“ I ’m certain if there had been some communication we could have solved this without the tragedy that occurred , ” Newston said .
“ It ’s just unfortunate that this gentleman did n’t reach out , ” Mayor Charles Brunner said .
“ We would have been there .
We would have pointed him in the right direction or put him on some sort of payment plan . ”
Brunner is among the Michigan mayors who lobbied Congress for a bailout of the auto industry , and was recently in attendance at the inauguration of President Barack Obama , who in his inaugural address said American people were to blame for the economic crisis because they had failed “ to make hard choices . ”
For his part , City Manager Robert Belleman has provoked particular outrage among residents by suggesting that Schur ’s neighbors bear responsibility for failing to look after the elderly man .
Rick Luszek , retired utility worker
Rick Luszek , a retired utility worker who lives in the neighborhood said , “ This is absurd .
Shutting somebody ’s electricity off in the dead of winter is criminal .
These politicians sit at their desks pushing pencils and say we ’re going to cut off electricity today .
How can the city manager claim that the neighbors had a civic responsibility to look after this man ?
What about the city ’s civic responsibility to look after him ?
I say damn Belleman for blaming the neighbors for this man ’s death . ”
Local residents are right to be outraged by the political leadership of their city and state , which is dominated from the local level up by the Democratic Party .
Politicians of both parties have overseen the ruination of Michigan .
In moments like the freezing death of Schur , they can scarcely conceal their contempt for the working class people they nominally represent .
But the freezing death of Schur is not strictly a local issue .
What killed Schur is not just the indifference of local officials , but the form of social organization — capitalism — that places the profit drive of the financial aristocracy above basic human needs .
Other Skyscraper Fires
Fires Have Never Caused Skyscrapers to Collapse
The One Meridian Plaza fire
Excepting the three 9 - 11 collapses , no fire , however severe , has ever caused a steel - framed high - rise building to collapse .
Following are examples of high - rise fires that were far more severe than those in WTC 1 and 2 , and Building 7 .
In these precedents , the fires consumed multiple floors , produced extensive window breakage , exhibited large areas of emergent flames , and went on for several hours .
The fires in the WTC towers did none of these things .

The One Meridian Plaza Fire
One Meridian Plaza is a 38 - floor skyscraper in Philadelphia that suffered a severe fire on February 23 , 1991 .
The fire started on the 22nd floor and raged for 18 hours , gutting eight floors and causing an estimated $ 100 million in direct property loss .
1 2 3 It was later described by Philadelphia officials as " the most significant fire in this century " .
The fire caused window breakage , cracking of granite , and failures of spandrel panel connections .

Despite the severity and duration of the fire , as evidenced by the damage the building sustained , no part of the building collapsed .

The First Interstate Bank Fire
The First Interstate Bank Building is a 62 - story skyscraper in Los Angeles that suffered the worst high - rise fire in the city 's history .
From the late evening of May 4 , 1988 through the early morning of the next day , 64 fire companies battled the blaze , which lasted for 3 1/2 hours .
The fire caused extensive window breakage , which complicated firefighting efforts .
Large flames jutted out of the building during the blaze .
Firefighting efforts resulted in massive water damage to floors below the fire , and the fire gutted offices from the 12th to the 16th floor , and caused extensive smoke damage to floors above .
The fire caused an estimated $ 200 million in direct property loss .

A report by Iklim Ltd. describes the structural damage from the fire :
6 In spite of the total burnout of four and a half floors , there was no damage to the main structural members and only minor damage to one secondary beam and a small number of floor pans .

Caracas Tower Fire
The tallest skyscraper in Caracas , Venezuela experienced a severe fire on October 17 , 2004 .
The blaze began before midnight on the 34th floor , spread to more than 26 floors , and burned for more than 17 hours .
Heat from the fires prevented firefighters from reaching the upper floors , and smoke injured 40 firefighters .
Lax enforcement of fire codes in Venezuela was blamed for the malfunctioning of water pumps and a lack of fire extinguishers inside of the building .
Because the building was empty when the fire broke out , no civilians were killed or injured .

The Windsor Building Fire
The Windsor Building fire
A more recent case of a severe high - rise fire is the one that destroyed the Windsor Building in Madrid , Spain on February 12 , 2005 .
The Windsor fire was more severe than any of the fires described above , and the incident has been widely publicized , with comparisons to the fires in the three World Trade Center skyscrapers on 9/11/01 .
However , the Windsor Building , unlike all the buildings mentioned above , was framed in steel - reinforced concrete rather than steel .
Hence it is described on a separate page , which notes differences between the response of these different types of structures to fires .

The Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel Fire
The Hotel Mandarin Oriental blazes
The most recent example of a spectacular skyscraper fire was the burning of the Hotel Mandarin Oriental starting on February 9 , 2009 .
The nearly completed 520 - foot - tall skyscraper in Beijing caught fire around 8:00 pm , was engulfed within 20 minutes , and burned for at least 3 hours until midnight .
Despite the fact that the fire extended across all of the floors for a period of time and burned out of control for hours , no large portion of the structure collapsed .
It is tempting to draw parallels between this spectacle and the destruction of WTC 1 , 2 , and 7 because of the stark opposites : on 9/11/01 , three skyscrapers were transformed into piles of rubble primarily as a consequence , supposedly , of fires -- fires spanning small fractions of each building ; and on 2/09 / 09 , a skyscraper remained intact after burning like a torch for hours .
However such parallels may be limited by major structural differences between the buildings in the two cases -- one being that the Hotel Mandarin Oriental , designed by the famous Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas , had a full - height interior atrium , and thus had the hollowness that the 9 - 11 Commission deceptively attempted to attribute to the Twin Towers .

Perhaps the relevance of the Mandarin fire to the events of 9/11/2001 is more symbolic than forensic .
The Mandarin fire is examined more fully here .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to drop interest rates close to zero on Tuesday , but anticipated remarks on unconventional methods to dispel a year - old recession are what will really matter .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke listens to opening statements before testifying before the House Financial Services Committee in a hearing on " Oversight of Implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and Government Lending and Insurance Facilities ; Impact on Economy and Credit Availability " on Capitol Hill in Washington November 18 , 2008 .

Economists forecast a clear statement that the U.S. central bank will aggressively deploy so - called quantitative easing measures to shelter the economy from a steepening downturn , but do not expect details of what steps it will actually take .
Those words would accompany a decision by the Fed to lower its target for overnight rates by at least a half - percentage point , economists believe .
A half - point cut would take the bellwether federal funds rate to just 0.5 percent , the lowest on records dating to July 1954 , as the central bank battles a recession many think will stretch well into next year .
The announcement is expected around 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday at the end of a two - day meeting .
The gathering had initially been scheduled for a single day , but was extended so policy - makers could study options for unusual steps to spur the economy with little room left to lower borrowing costs .
“ From here on out , monetary policy has to rely primarily on non-traditional tools , tools other than the funds rate , to try to stimulate the economy , ” said former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley , who expects the Fed to spell this out .
“ They are certainly going to have to acknowledge that non-traditional methods are going to be employed aggressively to try to provide assistance to the economy , ” he said .
A U.S. housing collapse panicked credit markets and has hammered the rest of the economy since the failure of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September .
Many economists predict economic activity will shrink by an annualized 6 percent or more in the fourth quarter as unemployment climbs .
Quantitative easing , which the Bank of Japan used to end a decade of deflationary stagnation in the 1990s by pumping money into the banking system , was foreshadowed by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in a speech on December 1 .
He emphasized the Fed would use all the weapons in its arsenal to protect the economy , and identified direct purchases of government and mortgage - related debt as possible options .
TARGET SPREADS
With yields on U.S. government debt already very low and private borrowing rates high because loss - scarred banks are too scared to lend , economists think it more likely the Fed will target private - sector mortgages to drive down home loan costs .
Buying such bonds should narrow the spread between their yields and yields on debt issued by the U.S.
Treasury , and allow banks to offer home loans at lower rates .
Lower mortgage rates should raise demand for houses and stem the slide in home prices , which would help staunch massive bank losses that have touched off a global credit crisis .
“ My one - word advice to the Fed now is ‘ spreads . ’
Fortunately , I do n’t think Ben Bernanke needs this advice .
He gets it , ” said Alan Blinder , a former Fed vice chairman and professor of economics at Princeton University .
The Fed has already embarked on quasi- quantitative easing by allowing its balance sheet to more than double in size after pumping over $ 1 trillion into financial markets to prevent them from seizing up completely in the face of mounting losses .
Such liquidity measures are traditionally “ sterilized ” so they do not expand the money supply and stoke inflation .
But the Fed has abandoned this practice in an effort to reduce private borrowing costs that have so - far remained elevated despite dramatic official interest rate cuts .
In addition , inflation fears have been replaced by worry that prices may fall too far and inflict deflation , similar to the Japanese economic conditions of the 1990s .
“ The focus will be on purchasing assets to affect spreads .
All of their policies are aimed at driving down borrowing costs to consumers and businesses , ” said Dean Maki , co-chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York .
“ We do n’t think that the best use of the Fed ’s balance sheet is to further reduce the risk - free rate , ” he said .
U.S. Treasury bonds are said to offer a risk - free rate of return because the U.S. government , with the ability to print dollars via the Federal Reserve , would never default on dollar debts .
The widow of crazed journalist and drug aficionado Hunter S. Thompson , who killed himself in his kitchen in 2005 , says she could conceive of having a Hunter Jr. toddling around the cabin shooting toy guns and betting on the NFL .
And that actually might be possible , because before his suicide , Thompson had some of his sperm frozen .
“ Hunter and I were always trying to have children , ” Anita Thompson told a newspaper , “ but we just never did . ”
She broke down in tears recently while reading a New York Times article on home birthing , the memories flooding back of the couple ’s incomplete family unit .
“ Hunter was such a loving person that it would have been a joy to have a family with him .
But I could still have his child if I want to .
He left that possibility for me but it ’s a long series of ethical questions for me whether I would want to have his child now . ”
We knew that one day , because of our age difference , Hunter would die and I would still be alive , ” Anita , 36 , said .
“ We had hoped that I would have children and that they would be older by the time Hunter passed away , but we were n’t blind to the fact that Hunter was 35 years older than me .
It was n’t a constant discussion but it was something that we had considered . ”
And so what are the ethical issues surrounding a possible heir to the Gonzo throne ?
“ Children do better with a father .
I believe it ’s something Hunter would want but at this point in my life I ’m a little fearful of making that kind of decision .
I would n’t want to do it as a way of replicating Hunter , of prolonging Hunter , or as a way of filling the void .
It ’s something I have n’t decided on yet . ”
Bowling balls
Solving the nice puzzle below , I found it easier to define a stream coinductively than to define a function from natural numbers inductively .
You ’re standing in front of a 100 story building with two identical bowling balls .
You ’ve been tasked with testing the bowling balls ’ resilience .
The building has a stairwell with a window at each story from which you can ( conveniently ) drop bowling balls .
To test the bowling balls you need to find the first floor at which they break .
It might be the 100th floor or it might be the 50th floor , but if it breaks somewhere in the middle you know it will break at every floor above .
Devise an algorithm which guarantees you ’ll find the first floor at which one of your bowling balls will break .
You ’re graded on your algorithm ’s worst - case running time .
“ Running time ” here means the number of times we drop a ball .
Before testing begins , all we know is that the answer is somewhere between the bottom of the building and the top .
There are 101 possibilities in all , because maybe the balls are so strong that even dropping them from the 100th floor does n’t break them , or maybe the balls are so weak that even dropping them from the first floor breaks them .
At any time during testing , the set of possible answers remaining a contiguous set of floors : the lower bound is established by a drop that did not break the ball , and the upper bound by a drop that did break the ball .
Let c( n ) denote the minimum worst −case running time , starting with 2 balls and n possible answers ( so we want to calculate c( 101 ) ) .
We can stop once we know the answer , so c ( 1 ) =
0 . If n > 1 , suppose that we next drop a ball from the i-th possible floor from the top .
( It only makes sense for i to be between 2 and n , inclusive , because if i < 2 then we already know the ball would break , and if i > n then we already know the ball would not break . )
If the ball does n’t break , then we have narrowed the answer down to i − 1 possibilities , so we have only c( i − 1 ) drops to go .
If the ball does break , then we have narrowed the answer down to n − i + 1 possibilities , but we have only 1 ball left , so we ’d better be careful and test the remaining floors from bottom to top , which takes n − i drops .
To sum up , we have
c (1 ) = 0
c(n ) = 1 + min 2 ≤i≤n max { c( i − 1 ) , n − i } if n > 1 .
A nice way to calculate c( 101 ) in Haskell is to define a stream of numbers count , such that count !!
n - 1 is c( n ) .
count :: [ Int ] count = 0 : [ 1 + minimum ( zipWith max counts [ 0.. ] ) | counts <- inits ' count ]
Look ma , no indices !
The list [ 0 ..] above enumerates all possible values of n − i .
This definition uses an auxiliary function inits ' , which is equivalent to map reverse .

inits ' :: [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] inits ' = f [ ] where f accum [ ] = [ ] f accum ( x:xs ) = accum ' : f accum ' xs where accum ' = x:accum
( The first clause defining f is not really necessary for our purpose , because the list count never ends . )
Let ’s try it out .

So the best we can do is indeed 14 drops .
What about general n ?
Note that 1 appears once , 2 appears twice , 3 appears thrice , and so on in the list above .
It ’s not hard to see ( and to prove by induction on n ) that the pattern continues , so c(n ) is the least such that 1 + … + c( n ) ≥ n − 1 .
* Main > and $ take 10000 $ zipWith ( == ) count $ [ ceiling ( ( - 1 + sqrt ( 8 * n - 7 ) ) / 2 ) | n <- [ 1.. ] ]
True
Thus , indeed
c(n ) = ⌈ ( −1 + √ ( 8n−7 ) ) /2⌉ .
But can we prove the pattern by equational reasoning on streams , ideally more concisely than by induction on n ?

The Birth of the Zombie Genre
Of all the horror characters zombies are undoubtedly my favourite .
There 's something about a slow shambling zombie hungry for human brains that brings a smile to my face .
There have been some great zombie films over the years and they are a unique threat in horror films .
They remind us of the creeping inevitably of death and zombie films are often about the struggle for survival in the face of ever increasing odds .
George A. Romero created the modern zombie genre with Night of the Living Dead .
Although he had obviously borrowed elements from films like The Last Man on Earth the zombies he created , staggering cadavers in various states of decay all driven by a desire to eat human flesh , captured the public imagination and led to the birth of a whole genre of horror .
Before Romero zombies were linked to Voodoo and supposed to be brought back from the dead and controlled by sorcerers .
Romero modernised the idea , leaving it a mystery as to why the dead re-animated and allowing any corpse to return to life regardless of how long they had been dead .
The first zombies struggled to move , their limbs stiff from rigor mortis and parts of their bodies rotted away .
They were also relatively easy to deal with if encountered alone , apart from the odd sneaky zombie who would hide in a cupboard or tip toe up on an unsuspecting victim .
In numbers zombies became an overwhelming and inevitable tide of death .
There were loads of releases in the years after Night of the Living Dead , including Romero 's own sequels , which adopted his creations and remained faithful to the basic idea .
Some films chose to make the zombies thirst for brains rather than any human flesh , like the Return of the Living Dead series and over time zombies became faster and more visceral in their film depictions .
Usually people point to 28 Days Later as responsible for the fast zombie phenomenon , though it was n't the first film to do it and strictly speaking they are infected rather than zombies , but commercially speaking it was obviously the success of that film that led more recent zombie flicks to plump for speedy undead .
While there have been various types of zombie portrayed on screen with various levels of intelligence and ability one thing that has stuck as a hard and fast rule is the way you kill a zombie .
Destroy the brain , shoot them in the head , bash it in with a hammer , however you do it the only way to stop a zombie is to destroy the brain and they are generally impervious to other types of damage .
The birth of the zombie genre was an important development in the horror world , not only because it introduced our favourite moronically shuffling corpses but also because it heralded a new age for gore .
Night of the Living Dead was one of the first films to dispense with the tried and tested cut away technique where violence was portrayed as a shadow on the wall or a camera cut and a scream .
Horror films were now entering the age of the special effect with spectacular visceral blood and guts galore .
Here was a new way to make audiences scream in terror .
The advent of the zombie also signalled a death knell for the old stalwarts of horror .
Finally film makers could break free of the classic horror characters .
Dracula , Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman had dominated for long enough the genre needed a fresh threat and it was to dig its way out of the grave in style .

Barack Obama ’s economic team is quickly taking shape , said Sebastian Mallaby in The Washington Post , and “ not a moment too soon . ”
Led by experienced “ pragmatists who excel at imaginative improvisation ” — New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary and Larry Summers as the top White House economist — the team has a lot of work to do .
Well , the choice of Geithner “ guarantees the smoothest transition from the current Treasury team , ” said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
He knows all the major players , “ knows as well as anyone which banks are vulnerable , ” and has spent much of his career negotiating bailouts and soothing financial panics .
But many of his views — on taxes , say — are “ something of a mystery . ”
The markets do n’t seem to mind , said Daniel Gross in Slate .
They “ shot up nearly 7 percent ” Friday afternoon , after Geithner ’s name was leaked .
What we do know about Geithner is that he has “ a great deal in common with Obama ” — age , number of children , experience living abroad .
Also , Geithner , a 20 - year “ meritocratic bureaucrat , ” is “ a sort of community organizer for the financial world . ”
So no “ knock on Hank Paulson , ” but ca n’t President Bush appoint Geithner now ? said Thomas Friedman in The New York Times .
We ’re in a financial “ Code Red , ” and it ’s obvious that “ Bush ca n’t mobilize the tools to defuse ” it .
We need a new economic team , new ideas , and a shot of new confidence .
The arrival of Obama ’s team would n’t be “ a magic wand , but it would help . ”

In MS Windows , if you hold down the rAlt key while typing 0164 on your keyboard ’s number pad , then release the rAlt key , you ’ll get the ¤ character .
People sometimes miss that capability on Unix - like systems ( read : Linux or * BSD ) .
There ’s a solution to the problem , however : the compose key .
The keyboard section in my xorg .
conf file looks something like this :
Section " InputDevice " Identifier " Keyboard0 " Driver " kbd " Option " XkbOptions " " compose : ralt " EndSection
That line that starts Option sets the rAlt key as my compose key .
With that I can produce any of a dizzying array of digraphs and other special characters that do n’t actually appear on my keyboard in just about any application in my X session .
For instance , to produce that ¤ character , I would use the following key combination :
<rAlt>x o
In other words , I would hold down the Alt key to the right of my spacebar , press the x key , then release the Alt key , and finally press the o key .
Thus , holding down the compose key ( set to rAlt ) for the first character of a combination of characters like xo produces a non-keyboard character like ¤ .
Similarly , I can use " A for Ä , " o for ö , ~n for ñ , oo for ° , and ss for ß .
This , to me , seems like an improvement over the MS Windows way of doing it .
The key combinations used are more mnemonically effective than simply trying to remember hundreds of numeric values .
They ’re also more “ discoverable ” , in that after learning a few one might begin to recognize patterns that allow one to accurately guess at combinations one does n’t yet have memorized .
( edit :
The following notes about setxkbmap and .xinitrc were added on Thursday , 7 October , 2010 . )
If you are using a more recent version of X.org , it is entirely possible your system is working fine without any xorg .
conf file at all .
You can use the setxkbmap command to specify a compose key instead :
setxkbmap - option compose: ralt
If you use startx to start your X session , you can use the .xinitrc file in your user account ’s home directory to automatically execute this every time X is started .
To do so , just add that command to the file before the line that specifies which window manager to fire up .
You just need to add an ampersand at the end of the line .
The following is an example of the contents of an .xinitrc file — actually , the contents of my .xinitrc file at present :
xbattbar - at 1 top & setxkbmap - option compose : ralt & exec ahwm
The first line gives me a nifty line across the top of my screen that tells me how the laptop ’s battery is doing .
The last line tells X to use a window manager called AHWM .
A complete listing of default compose key sequences can be found in a file called Compose somewhere on most Unix - like systems .
On FreeBSD , it should be located in a subdirectory of :
/usr/local/lib/X11/locale/
The subdirectory corresponds to the character set used in your user environment .
On my laptop , I ’m using the US English UTF - 8 character set ; that information is stored in the LANG variable :
> printenv LANG UTF -8
Thus , my default compose key sequences are defined in :
/usr/local/lib/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
Your mileage may vary .

( Adds background on Saab , Volvo losses )
DETROIT , Jan 12 ( Reuters ) - The Swedish government will not take stakes in either Saab or Volvo from General Motors Corp GM.N or Ford Motor Co F.N nor does it plan more aid for either Swedish automaker , a senior official said on Monday .
“ I made it clear to General Motors and Ford that under no circumstances will there be a way that the Swedish government , the Swedish state , will become an owner of either Volvo or Saab , ” Joran Hagglund , state secretary of the Swedish Industry Ministry , told reporters at the Detroit auto show .
“ They ( GM and Ford ) have to take the full responsibility for the actions that have to be taken to secure good futures for the brands of Saab and Volvo , ” Hagglund said .
He stressed that aid for both Swedish car makers would be contingent on the money being spent in Sweden and would be based on ensuring their future viability and profitability .
In December , the center - right Swedish government said it would provide up to 25 billion crowns ( $ 3.1 billion ) in credit guarantees and emergency loans to its ailing auto industry .
Both Volvo and Saab have been losing money .
GM vice chairman Bob Lutz said on Sunday that Saab had not been profitable in the nearly two decades GM has owned the company .
“ Frankly they ’ve been on GM life support , ” Lutz said .
When the aid program was unveiled in December , the Swedish government said it had no plans to buy stakes in Volvo -- owned by Ford -- or Saab -- owned by GM .
Hagglund said there were “ no discussions ” on any further aid for the Swedish car makers .
The state secretary was in Detroit to talk GM and Ford about the Swedish government ’s aid program for Saab and Volvo find out more about the U.S. automakers ’ plans for the units .
‘ NO POLITICAL , IDEOLOGICAL ’ AGENDA
Hagglund said he was “ aware of the different discussions ” GM and Ford were holding to sell Volvo and Saab , but said the government had no political agenda concerning the new owners .
“ We do n’t have any political or ideological point of view of who will be the new owners , ” Hagglund said .
“ We are certainly interested in whether the owners have a knowledge of the industrial sector , manufacturing , do they have a long - term commitment to these brands , questions like that . ”
“ It will be rather stupid of the Swedish government to start all these processes by stating that under no circumstances can we accept that buyer or that buyer , ” he added .
Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Sunday the No. 2 U.S. automaker had been approached by several potential bidders for Volvo , while GM ’s European head , Carl - Peter Foster , said the automaker had been approached two or three months ago by an investor looking to acquire Saab .
U.S. auto sales dropped by 18 percent in 2008 , pushing both GM and Chrysler -- owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP [ CBS.UL ] -- to the brink of collapse .
Both have received aid from the U.S. government through a $ 17.4 billion bailout in the form of emergency loans .
Ford has not sought federal loans , but is asking for a $ 9 billion credit line it could tap if conditions worsen .
Hagglund said one condition of the Swedish aid to GM is that it ‘ carve out ’ the Saab unit as a separate entity for a possible sale to a new owner .
“ I believe that General Motors ( has ) to in one way or another carve out Saab as a stand - alone entity that will be salable , ” Hagglund said .
“ That ’s the first step . ”
Hagglund also said his government ’s main interest was that Saab and Volvo projects receiving aid “ will be run in Sweden .
“ We have discussions together with them ( Volvo and Saab ) where they have presented us proposals for different projects , also up to different limits of money , but it ’s too early for me to stand here and say what that will be , ” Hagglund said .
One of the conditions for received aid is that Saab and Volvo must also become profitable .
Ford bought Volvo in 1999 for $ 6.45 billion .
Volvo lost $ 484 million , before taxes , in the third quarter of 2008 , according to a regulatory filing .
GM shared ownership of Saab with the Swedish holding company Investor AB since 1990 , bought the 48 percent it did not already own in 2000 for an undisclosed sum .

It was raining on the interstate a week ago , and even the five - foot snowpiles lining the median were melting into greasy , gunpowder - colored sludge .
Every few miles the snowmelt revealed a secret : a dead deer emerging from the melt like a tundra - bound mastodon , released to rot in the 60 degree weather .
I never give much thought to dead deer on the side of the road ; maybe a brief lament for the animal 's awkward death or perhaps a thought to the human lives inconvenienced by it .
But these deer were different , sitting as they were in the worsening gloop of winter , their once - brown hides now mottled gray yet still perfectly preserved as if they all had been killed that very day .
More than once I 've walked into an abandoned building only to find the rotting carcass of a dead dog not far from the door .
The feral animals , seeking some dignity at the end of lives that afforded little of it , seem to prefer to die indoors .
I have also found dead dogs in vacant lots , and even the most dessicated of these corpses reveals some hint of a breed ( such as a tuft of Rottweiler hair ) .
The breeds of dogs whose bodies you find in fields or alleys usually tell you they were dumped there after losing an organized fight .
Life in this town is n't easy for its people .
You can imagine how hard it is on dogs .
Last night I was out walking our own former Detroit street dog ( saved one day before his date with the needle ) , when we happened on a stray .
Pinch - faced and skinny , the wild dog was only - slightly skittish .
I ordered Wendell to sit by a tree while I approached : calming and petting it while looking for any sign of ownership .
I brought it back to our porch where I fed it and then told it to get lost .
I glanced out the window twenty minutes later and the stray was still sitting there , looking at me .
The temperature dove into the low twenties last night .
I begged my wife to close the blinds .
" If it 's still out there in the morning , I 'll bring it to the shelter . "
But this morning it was gone .
On one of my first house scouting trips to Detroit , a friend gave me a tour of Belle Isle , the massive island park in the river between the city and Canada .
He drove me past a barbed - wire fence enclosing overgrown foliage with a dozen albino deer huddled together .
" European fallow deer , " he said .
" They 've lived here for generations .
They used to run wild on the island but now they 're penned off in the abandoned zoo . "
" Abandoned zoo ? " I was intrigued .
Detroit does still have an operating zoo .
A good one , in fact , built on an island of city - owned land two miles north of the city border , within wealthy Oakland County .
But for over a century the city operated a separate facility first known as the Belle Isle Zoo ( which opened in 1895 --- the same year the European deer were introduced to the island ) and then the Children 's Zoo ( starting in 1947 ) .
In 2002 , disgraced former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick closed the Belle Isle Children 's Zoo despite opposition from the City Council , claiming the pressure of the city 's $ 75 million budget deficit .
City council overrode his veto and freed up $ 700,000 to reopen the zoo .
In that year 's November election 88 percent of Detroit voters approved a nonbinding ballot initiative to reopen it .
Kilpatrick ignored both and shuttered the zoo , shipping off the animals and calling the move temporary .
" We need to really figure out what we want there , " Kilpatrick said .
Of course the " temporary " closure became permanent .
Kilpatrick used money appropriated for the reopening of the zoo to fund a " Nature Center " on the most remote and unvisited part of the 982 - acre island , including $ 1 million for a brand new enclosure for the island 's dwindling herd of 20 fallow deer .
Seven companies submitted bids to build it , and the city building authority ( run by the mayor 's cousin ) , selected a company that had never before built an animal enclosure against the bids of several experienced zoo contractors .
The first act of the winning bidder was to subcontract the construction to a company owned by the former mayor 's longtime best friend ( and fellow convicted felon ) Bobby Ferguson [ source ] , a man who has benefited from an untold number of similar schemes over the years ( to the tune of hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars ) .
That is how business is done in the city of Detroit .
And these are some of the results :
Miles and miles of perfectly adequate chain link animal enclosures abandoned so the former mayor 's friend could pocket $ 1 million to build one on the opposite side of the island for 20 inbred European deer .
The Belle Isle Zoo has been closed now for over six years .
Many people from this area have fond memories of visiting it as children .
There were elephants here .
Bears .
Monkeys .
Tigers .
Some of the zoo's big cats were rumored to have been rescued from lives guarding Detroit crackhouses .
In 1980 , the zoo was completely rebuilt to adhere to more modern ideas of natural habitats with a lengthy elevated boardwalk and African - style architectural elements throughout .
22 years later it would all be left to rot :
Kilpatrick lied about this zoo as effortlessly as he lied about nearly everything during his tenure .
He once put forth some cockamamie idea about turning the zoo into an X - Games style park with skateboarding and " zip lines . "
But that will never happen .
It will sit like this until the scrappers find their way in , followed by the graffiti artists and the drunks and vandals , though the place is a block from the island 's main police station and not easy to enter ( it 's a maze of 10 - foot barbed - wire fencing ) .
I did not go there with any intention to trespass .
I often take the dog for hikes in the woods on Belle Isle .
Inside of him a wild hunter sits dormant , and it is necessary to occasionally make him feel useful .
Earlier this year a pack of wild dogs were harassing us , keeping their distance .
They were smaller dogs than the ones that attacked us at the playground years ago , and once we started chasing them they led us right into the abandoned zoo .
Inside the zoo , we followed their tracks through a maze of fences and walls .
I could see that everything remained much as it had been left .
The felid cages still had trees nailed to the walls for the scratching of giant claws .
The monkey house sat silent , still smelling slightly of its occupation .
The dog loved the smells of the old zoo , rooting around every corner of the cages or the big cat enclosure .
He was the Teddy Roosevelt of German Shorthaired Pointers , the Hemingway of birddogs : a big game hunter , sniffing at ghosts .
It was strange to stand inside the enclosures and look up to where countless people would have watched whatever animal dwelt there .
Even stranger were the plants growing inside each enclosure , non-native species probably chosen carefully long ago to resemble the flora of wherever the animal was from but not to tempt them into nibbling .
Even a simulacrum of wildness , abandoned , will become truly wild given enough time .
Every building and every enclosure chokes with overgrown plants in the summer .
Dead trees have fallen to crush the boardwalk in places .
The buildings are mostly intact , filled with snake and spider exhibits , educational displays .
Scrapping damage seems light , though I do think the copper is gone .
Signs inside the once - heated felid cages still warn KEEPER IN THE YARD .
A brush in a big cat cage sits next to an empty 40oz .
An animal transport trailer slowly rots into the ground .
From their earliest days , we teach our children about wild things .
Even as more and more of them grow up in cities or suburbs , seemingly isolated from anything truly wild , we tell them stories and read them books about elephants and bears , monkeys and tigers .
When you 're a kid , almost all the good books are about these wild things , most anthropomorphized and friendly .
To those of us reading these stories , this obsession with the wild might seem pointless or silly .
But to a kid these pages are an introduction to our world and its amazing capacity for strangeness and beauty .
We take our kids to the zoo --- even ignore the unnerving vacant glaze in the eyes of penned polar bears --- because we know there is nothing quite so magical to those tiny minds as seeing what was fiction become suddenly so real .
But in time , of course , every child will see a zoo for what it is : a place where nothing is real , a place where wild animals cannot be wild , where every instinct is curbed by confinement or scheduled feedings .
This place will never be a zoo again .
It is home to a pack of wild dogs now .
A reclusive badger or two .
Red foxes and red squirrels .
A bluejay and a cardinal .
A mile away , the fallow deer sit in their million - dollar home , but within the zoo I still find a broad - tined antler shed by a buck during his temporary stay .
Half buried in the ground , it is already starting to rot .
We take our kids to the zoo and think we 're teaching them about wildness , but really we 're teaching them about dominion .
A lesson in the power of fences .
While all the time , along our highways , outside our very windows , wild things are there .
Waiting .

GAZA CITY - " Oh , God !
I have never seen such a terrible scene , " cried Kayed Abu Aukal .
The emergency doctor could not believe himself seeing the remains of what was days back Shahd , a full - fleshed 4 - year - old Palestinian girl .
She died when an Israeli shell was fired at the backyard of her home in the Jabalya refugee camp northern Gaza strip , where she was playing .
When her parents attempted to rush to the rescue of their kid , who fell to the ground amid a pool of her blood , rains of Israeli bullets kept them a distance .
For the next five days
Shahd 's which was left lying in the open left for dogs to tear out .
" The dogs did leave one single part of the poor baby 's body intact , " said a tearful Abu Aukal .
" We have seen heart - breaking scenes over the past 18 days .
We picked up children whose bodies were torn or burnt , but nothing like this . "
For five days Shahd 's brother , Matar , and cousin , Mohamed , tried in vain to reach her body .
They were fired at by the Israeli occupation forces every time .
Seeing the body of the little angel torn to piece by the assaulting dogs , the two made one final attempt , and it was their last .
They were showered by Israeli bullets before they could reach Shahd 's body , joining a long list of more than 920 Palestinians killed by Israel since December 27 .
Deliberate
Omran Zayda , a young neighbor , said the Israelis knew very well what they were doing .
" They chased her family and prevented them from reaching to her body , knowing that the dogs would eat it , " he said .
" They are not just killing our children , they are intentionally doing so in the most heinous and inhuman ways . "
Zayda said words , and even cameras , can not describe the horrific scene .
" You can never imagine what the dogs have done to her innocent body , " he said , fighting back his tears .
Many Palestinians insist Shahd was not the first or only such case .
In Jabalya , when Abd Rabu 's family was trying to bury three of its dead , the Israeli forces started firing at them , witnesses said .
They then released their dogs at the bodies , deserted by mourners who sought shelter from the Israeli gunfire , they added .
" What happened was awful and unthinkable , " Saad Abd Rabu , the deceased uncle , told IOL .
" Our sons died before our eyes and we were even prevented from burying them , " he cried .
" The Israelis just released their dogs at their bodies , as even they have not done enough . "

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - India demanded Pakistan take decisive action over deadly attacks in Mumbai it said were carried out by militants from its nuclear - armed rival , while the West urged cooperation to ease tension .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa both were due in New Delhi , with the militant attacks that killed 183 people in India ’s financial capital threatening to reverse improving ties with Pakistan .
India ’s foreign ministry said on Monday it called in Pakistan ’s envoy to New Delhi and told him attackers , who investigators said had months of commando training in Pakistan , had come from there .
“ It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan ’s actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India , ” a foreign ministry statement said .
Pakistan , in a report by its official Associated Press of Pakistan , said its high commissioner had gone to the Indian foreign ministry “ as per routine ” and had not been summoned for a meeting or been issued with any official demarche .
Investigators said the militants were trained by the Lashkar - e - Taiba group , blamed for a 2001 attack on India ’s parliament .
That event nearly set off the fourth war between the two countries since Pakistan was carved from India in 1947 .
The attacks have prompted the resignation of the interior minister and offers to step down from other top politicians from the ruling Congress party coalition .
Facing an election by May , analysts say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must walk a delicate line not to upset regional stability but act forcefully enough to counter opposition accusations Congress is weak on security .
Many Indians have expressed anger at apparent intelligence lapses , including what a senior coast guard official said was a warning militants would attack Mumbai from the sea days before it happened , and a slow reaction by security forces to the rampage .
The attacks against Mumbai ’s two best - known luxury hotels and other landmarks in the city of 18 million are a major setback for improving ties between the nuclear - armed neighbors .
Rice was due to visit India on Wednesday , underscoring the gravity with which Washington saw the regional implications .
She met British Foreign Secretary David Miliband in London on Monday .
“ I do n’t want to jump to any conclusions myself on this , but I do think that this is a time for complete , absolute , total transparency and cooperation and that is what we expect ( from Pakistan ) , ” Rice told reporters .
Officials in Islamabad have warned any escalation of tensions would force it to divert troops to the Indian border and away from a U.S. - led anti-militant campaign on the Afghan frontier .

Miliband , after meeting Rice , said joint action would “ make the difference between stability and instability . ”
The Arab League ’s Moussa was due in New Delhi on Tuesday .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Monday called foreign ministers from both countries and urged Pakistan to make good on its promise to cooperate in the investigation .
Slideshow ( 38 images )
Solana ’s office said that in his call to Pakistan ’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , Solana had “ encouraged the Pakistani government to pursue the fight against extremism and terrorism and to support the Indian authorities in the investigation on the terrorist attacks . ”
Pakistan has vowed to cooperate with India in investigating the militant assault , but on Monday rejected what it called unsubstantiated allegations of complicity in the attacks .
It also backtracked on a decision to send the chief of its main Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) security agency .
A French judge , Marc Trevidic , who focuses on Islamist militants , downplayed any possible link between the attacks and the Pakistani leadership .
“ The Pakistan intelligence services , ISI , can be infiltrated but also manipulated by Islamist groups , ” he told Reuters .

Teacher gets owned by a 12 year old
Unfortunately the teacher was me .
A couple of years back I was teaching in a rather deprived area to say the least .
Most of the kids had unemployed , junkie parents who spent a lot of time in court .
Funny enough , they were nice kids at heart , but rough as fuck , stoned in class , breaking windows , nicking stuff etc .
Most of them , if they came to class , had no books or paper and were spazzed out hyper .
You can imagine my delight when over the course of the year , I get them to settle down and actually take interest in the lessons .
They were even doing work that was n't assigned , craptastic but nonetheless it brought a tear to my eye .
I had spent a week teaching them about verbs , " action words , something you can do " , I explained this in very simple terms and I was pretty confident that they had it nailed down .
I decided it was time to see my shining scholars demonstrate their new found knowledge , perhaps followed by standing on their desks and declaring " O captain , my captain . "
Sorry if this goes on a bit , but feel free to skip all of the poem after the first stanza .
( I just thought you might like the poem )
Me : Ok , read the following poem and underline the verbs .
Digging
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests ; as snug as a gun .
Under my window a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground :
My father , digging .
I look down
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low , comes up twenty years away
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills
Where he was digging .
The coarse boot nestled on the lug , the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly .
He rooted out tall tops , buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands .
By God , the old man could handle a spade ,
Just like his old man .
My grandfather could cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner 's bog .
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper .
He straightened up
To drink it , then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly , heaving sods
Over his shoulder , digging down and down
For the good turf .
Digging .
The cold smell of potato mold , the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat , the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head .
But I 've no spade to follow men like them .
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests .
I 'll dig with it .
Looking around the classroom , the little unchins were really making an effort , a whole generation of underacheivers sticking it to the man and rising above the shit .
The head hyper nutter was buried in the poem , tongue hanging out the side of his mouth , eyes focussed , smiling like a mong , hands grubby with ink , even his lice were behaving .
Suddenly he sits upright , looks straight at me and beams " finished sir ! ask me . "
Me : Alright Sean , what 's the first verb ?
Sean : " Finger " sir .
Now you can see where this is going , but I had put blood sweat and tears into teaching these chavs verbs , and by fuck , verbs they will learn .
The blood pressure went through the roof .
Me ( eyes popping out of my head , veins in my neck ) : Sean , what in the blazes is a verb ?
Sean :
An ackchun word sir , summit ' you do sir .
Me :
Then how is " finger " a verb ?
Have you ever seen somebody fingering ?
Sean : Yeah , I saw me cousin fingering that slapper Jenny from number 27
You can imagine the uproar .
I cut the insides of my mouth trying not to laugh .
It broke my heart to give him detention , genius .
( , Fri 13 Jun 2008 , 4:44 , Unfortunately the teacher was me .
A couple of years back I was teaching in a rather deprived area to say the least .
Most of the kids had unemployed , junkie parents who spent a lot of time in court .
Funny enough , they were nice kids at heart , but rough as fuck , stoned in class , breaking windows , nicking stuff etc .
Most of them , if they came to class , had no books or paper and were spazzed out hyper .
You can imagine my delight when over the course of the year , I get them to settle down and actually take interest in the lessons .
They were even doing work that was n't assigned , craptastic but nonetheless it brought a tear to my eye .
I had spent a week teaching them about verbs , " action words , something you can do " , I explained this in very simple terms and I was pretty confident that they had it nailed down .
I decided it was time to see my shining scholars demonstrate their new found knowledge , perhaps followed by standing on their desks and declaring " O captain , my captain . "
Sorry if this goes on a bit , but feel free to skip all of the poem after the first stanza .
( I just thought you might like the poem ) Me : Ok , read the following poem and underline the verbs .
DiggingBetween my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests ; as snug as a gun .
Under my window a clean rasping soundWhen the spade sinks into gravelly ground :

Countryside frolics
OK .
I ’m the first to admit that I like nothing more than a good double - entendre .
Thus , I never pass up the opportunity to get one in .
In fact , I regularly go off on one , and often have to take a moment to get a hold of myself .
I frequently have to take myself off in a little room in order to calm down .
Tourette ’s is also a serial innuendo - er – it ’s one of the reasons I love her .
Well , there are a couple of other reasons as well .
But anyway .
There can be no greater love demonstrated , I think , than when a man is prepared to administer medical treatment in an intimate area .
A few years back , myself and Tourettes took ourselves and our lunatic dog off to the countryside ( Warkworth , to be precise ) .
We took a picnic in a rucksack , a couple of bottles beer , and had a walk along the river .
Spotting an overgrown bushy area , we decided to divert from the path and wander through the long , hairy grass and find a spot where I could unload my bulging sack .
Tourette ’s could n't wait , and started helping herself to the contents with relish .
We were both quite thirsty by this time , and the bottles of beer were an inviting prospect .
The bottles , naturally , required the use of a bottle opener because they were sealed by those crimped metal bottle caps .
I reached down and cracked one off with ease , but somehow the second took a little longer .
However , with a flick of the wrist and a sharp tug , it soon came away in my hand .
We lay there for a bit , having the odd munch , and finished our beer .
This being the countryside of course , public toilets were short in supply .
As a bloke , it does n’t usually present a problem – it ’s no great hardship to have to take yourself off behind a tree , but for the ladies it ’s a bit more of a complex exercise .
So I was sorted quite quickly , but it took a bit longer to locate the right spot for Tourette’s .
Anyway , I was lying there , half dozing , when I heard a piercing cry .
I looked up to see Tourette ’s struggling a bit and jerking up and down slightly .
She managed to find her composure , and came stomping through the grass .
I asked her if anything was up , and she explained to me that she ’d managed to lose her balance , and ended up sat in a bunch of stinging nettles .
Obviously I was sympathetic to her plight , but we did n’t have anything medical to hand .
“ I ’ve got some sting relief at home , that should sort it ” she said , “ but I ca n’t reach where it stings myself ” .
“ OK ” , said I , ever the gallant gent .
“ Let ’s head home , and I ’ll spray your arse with cream ” .
Happy days .

They all want to be in my gang ...
I can be quite eloquent when I try .
Despite the northern accent and propensity to curse like a navvy , I ’ve been told that one of my strengths is my ability to explain scientific concepts in a clear , concise manner and to convey instructions to students in such a way that they feel confident that they understand what it is that I want them to do .
I ’ve also been working on my “ dealing with people ” skills ( yes , I ’m applying for jobs ) as we ’ve been having a few issues at work with postdocs treating undergraduate students like slaves .
I was asked to step in and mediate in one instance to try to resolve the issue .
I gathered together some of the undergraduates and we talked through what they felt the issues were and what we could do as a group to resolve them .
I used the occasion to canvas their opinion on what they thought my strengths and weaknesses were in terms of supervision so that I could work on these .
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the students found me easy to work with .
They were n’t shy about telling me where I needed help ( “ not panicking ” was one of the things they suggested I could try harder at ) .
Now I said I can be quite eloquent .
This , unfortunately only comes as part of an iterative process , where I work out what it is that I ’d like to say and carefully hone it so that the words eventually leave my mouth in the right order , minus the “ ums ” , “ erms ” and “ fucks ” .
I ’m not good if put on the spot .
I was asked by a colleague about the outcome of my meeting with the students and how they had rated me .
One of the things we had discussed was motivation and that they felt that I was good at motivating them to carry out experiments that they were nervous about or that they had been putting off .
Unfortunately when I tried to convey this to my colleague , I told them that , “ the students say I make them do stuff with me .
You know , unpleasant things .
Things they do n’t want to do … ”
The silence that followed has been hitherto unmatched in duration or awkwardness .

PJM 's guide to safe mountain biking .
When taking part in any extreme sport , it 's advisable to inspect your equipment and ensure that it's in tip top condition to minimise the risk of breakage and injury whilst on the trails .
A negligent rider experiencing a mechanical failure will tell you that there 's nothing worse than coming off suddenly and ruining an otherwise excellent ride .
Here 's a list of things to look out for on your mountain bike before you take to those gnarly trails .
Gussets and frame damage
A bicycle frame is manufactured from either aluminium , steel or carbon fibre .
The weak points of the frame are usually the areas where one tube has been welded to another and is usually the point where fatigue is likely to manifest itself by cracking .
Some frames feature small reinforcing gussets to strengthen the joints .
Because they 're under stress , it 's absolutely essential that you make sure that your gusset area is carefully checked for signs of an obvious crack .
The gusset helps reinforce the head tube area of your frame and because this particular part of the frame is subject to frequent stress , cracked metal here may be a sign of imminent frame breakage , sudden gusset failure can have extremely messy consequences if you are thrown head first over the handlebars without warning .
Any hint of gusset damage should be taken very seriously before you attempt to swing a leg over the saddle .
Suspension Settings
Suspension forks are usually filled with damping oil which dampens out impacts which would otherwise be felt by the rider .
it stands to reason that a buttery smooth stroke action will reward with less strain on the wrists , so careful maintenance will pay dividends .
Likewise , making sure that the rebound is controlled will prevent the fork from bouncing repeatedly into your face during a strenuous ride .
Forks themselves are generally robust , depending on the manufacturer but inadequate sealing can mean that oily fork fluid is forced past the fork seals themselves .
The tops of the legs should always be checked for signs of dampness before mounting the bike .
If fitted , rear suspension needs attention too .
The rear shock is responsible for keeping the wheel in contact with the ground and maintaining traction / braking .
The diligent mountain biker will therefore carefully inspect the shaft of the shock before weighting the saddle and pounding it firmly a few times .
Although a small amount of fluid leakage at the end of the shaft is perfectly normal if the oil seepage is excessive then your shock may require a rebuild .
Like the forks , the rear shock features rebound adjustment to ensure that the bike does not buck and writhe underneath you too much whilst riding vigorously .
You should ensure that your suspension is adjusted so that the saddle is n't pummelling you from behind and throwing you off balance .
Brakes
Your brakes are the most important component of your bike and should be in tip top condition at all times .
With hydraulic brakes , fluid forced along a tube is responsible for pressing the brake pads against the rotor and slowing your down .
If your bike has stood unused for a length of time , it 's worth buying a brake bleeding kit which works by sucking the fluid out of the end of the hose until not a drop is left of the old brake fluid .
The brake is then refilled with new brake fluid , pumped a few times until it becomes firmer in your fingers and you 're ready to go again .
Wheels
Spoked wheels maintain their strength by virtue of the fact that the wheel is under considerable tension .
A tired wheel may well feel disappointingly floppy when you grasp it with both hands and twist it from side to side .
A loose wheel is going to buckle sooner or later , but there are remedial actions you can take .
The spoke is joined to the rim by small metal nipple .
Extreme caution should be exercised if you should happen across a buckled rim , make sure that you use a high quality nipple tensioner and gently tweak the nipple quarter of a turn at a time .
Take it slowly and you 'll last the distance with a stronger and more responsive wheel .
Lubrication
Selfishly grinding away without ensuring everything is carefully lubed first is a no - no .
The cassette in particular should be oiled so that each of the gears spins smoothly .
Check for lubrication by running your finger along the length of the chain .
If the residue is dark and gritty , then you 'll need to clean the drivetrain and relube everything .
Likewise , too much oil attracts dirt and can quickly damage a chain .
Tell tale flecks of oil on the frame itself can be a giveaway that you 've been overdoing the oiling .
Many a time I 've seen a considerable amount of lube dripping from the flange between the chainstay and the bottom bracket .
Final preparation
Your clothing should be up to the task too .
Always wear a cycle helmet and make sure that your helmet is never dropped or subject to weakening impacts .
Some riders use an old pillowcase to cover the helmet with a protective sheath while not in use .
That 's the important points covered .
Your trusty steed is now ready for the outing so mount her quickly and enjoy an exhilarating ride before you go off the boil .
Enjoy the ride , but try not to take too many risks out there .
Only last week I fell off balance and almost forced it into a nearby crevice unexpectedly .
It gave me a fright I can tell you !
However , I yanked back hard and avoided ending up in the dirt track which headed in the wrong direction .

Badly handled innuendo
I work part - time in the local old - mans boozer .
One night I was in my usual position ( sat on my bum on a bar stool awaiting instruction ) when a middle aged gent entered the pub and approached the bar .
Surveying our large range of draught bitters , he ummed and erred for a while before asking for :
' One of your handjobs please '
whilst making a pulling motion with his arm .
I know what he meant , but ended up wheezing with silent laughter , shoulders a - shaking , while having to deliver said ' handjob ' ie .
pint of bitter for those unfamiliar with the good ole British pub .
That should have been it , and I wish to god it had been , but when the hysteria began to subside I replied ;
' I'm afraid I do n't do those '
and then , for why I do not know , said ;
' Oh , well , I do , just not in here '
When I saw the look of horror on his face , I realised I 'd just told a respectable - looking , pillar of the community - type complete stranger , that I wank people off in my spare time .
Horrors .

On the bus
When I was about 3 ( I do n't remember this , but my dad insists on telling it frequently ) we used to live in London .
One day my dad took me to Oxleas Wood on the bus .
In those days I did n't always wipe my arse properly ( come on , I was three ) and as such used to get ' nappy - rash ' .
So there we are , sat on the top deck of a double - decker bus with a big rasta guy sat behind us , when I pipe up with :
" DADDY , I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE WOODS , MY BOTTOM HURTS ! "
Everyone stared at him .
( , Thu 12 Jun 2008 , 17:23 , When I was about 3 ( I do n't remember this , but my dad insists on telling it frequently ) we used to live in London .
One day my dad took me to Oxleas Wood on the bus .
In those days I did n't always wipe my arse properly ( come on , I was three ) and as such used to get ' nappy - rash ' .
So there we are , sat on the top deck of a double - decker bus with a big rasta guy sat behind us , when I pipe up with : " DADDY , I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE WOODS , MY BOTTOM HURTS !
" Everyone stared at him . ( , Thu 12 Jun 2008 , 17:23 , Reply
" Did you say Foxhunting ? "
Back , early on when I was first dating Ms Weasel ( who posts here under a different name ) I delivered a totally accidental innuendo ( through her mishearing ) .
We had met online , had had phone conversations but had never met in person .
So the day to meet face to face came and we headed off to the Ritzy bar in Brixton .
It was September and the low Autumn sun was dazzling us through the high windows in the upstairs bar and I was messing around with the chairs in an attempt for us to be able to see each other and talk .
I looked like a dick probably and she was saying * nothing * ( for the first and last time ) .
I could n't think of much to say either , so I was thinking " topical , topical , what 's topical ? " - then I hit on what I naively thought was neutral territory - bloodsports !
That same day outside my workplace the pro-bloodsports Countryside Alliance had been noisily demonstrating so I hit upon the idea of asking her what she thought about that .
" What do you think about foxhunting ? " I asked ( assuming this is a gimme ) .
She looked a bit startled , looked at her shoes , paused then said " Erm .
It 's not my favourite thing or anything ....um... but it has been known .. yeah , I do it . "
I 'm a bit shocked , there 's previously been no mention of vulpine extermination in her social CV , no mention that at weekends she is one of the ' unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable ' .
So I paused , somewhat taken aback .
She paused too .
Then said " Did you say Foxhunting ? "
" Yes "
" Oh , I thought you said cocksucking " .

Laughed himself hoarse
Exiled
Youth 's post made me remember a case which appeared in court locally , attended by a solicitor I know .
The accused was up for interfering with a farm animal , namely a horse .
And by interfering , I mean , y'know , " fiddling " .
He had admitted the charge , and the defence were trying to get him a lenient sentence , telling the court how he was a God - fearing lad who attended church , never done anything like this before , moment of madness , blah blah .
All well and good , until he mentioned that the man came " from a stable background " .
Pfffft . Court dissolves laughing .
Conditional discharge .

My First Visit To The Doctor In Cologne
So , off I went to the Doctor to register .
Bear in mind I had been resident in Germany for about a year and a half , and had been having language lessons .
" Herr Dix " says the Doctor , going through his little checklist , " Haben Sie Verkehr ? " -
He 's just asked me " do you have traffic ? "
Somewhat puzzled , I reply " Ja , Jeden Morgen mit dem Bus " , only to have the doctor explode into hysterical laughter .
Not only does Verkehr mean traffic , it is short for geschlechtsverkehr - sexual traffic ie a sex life .
I had just told the Doctor that every morning I have sex with a bus .
Length ?
Well I burnt my balls on the exhaust pipe .

" I 've never been so proud of my wife "
Mrs Spankengine and I have some very dear friends who are a gay couple .
One day over dinner the conversation drifts round to the whole ' opposites attract ' issue .
One illustration of this phenomenon is - according to Mrs Spankengine - her observation that in every happy couple there is always an organised and tidy one ( her ) and a more spontaneous , less organised one ( me ) .
It helps if one partner is more obsessed with tidiness than the other , right ?
Nods of recognition all round from me and the gay chaps .
" So " she asks brightly .
" Which one of you two is the anal one ? " .
I froze , nearly choked , excused myself , grabbed my Blackberry and emailed this delightful and innocent innuendo to everyone I could possibly find , using the same header as this post .
Amazingly , nobody else at dinner had even registered this gem .

Shamelessly Stolen from anther site
My octogenarian mother loves to feed the birds - her garden is always full of bird food and has an unbelievable number of birds living there .
She particularly likes watching the blue tits attacking the balls of fat that you can buy and she hangs these immediately outside her kitchen window .
Whilst I visited her recently , she asked me if I would take her to the local farm supply shop so she could stock up on bird food .
When we got there , the owner , probably 70 years old himself , was working behind the counter .
I gather up all the stuff she wanted but the balls of fat were nowhere to be seen .
Nonplussed , Mother hobbles over to the counter ( she walks with the aid of crutches ) and says hello to the owner , who obviously knows her as she is a regular .
Then she drops her bombshell .
" Have you got Fat Balls ? "
I stood behind her and bit my lip to stop from laughing .
The poor owner could only clench his teeth to prevent doing the same - and waved his arm in the direction of where they were now sited .
As I watched Mums neck I could see the colour slowly rising up and with remarkable speed she rushed off to the Fat Ball counter .
I laughed all the way home while she sat there muttering " I cant believe I said that " .........

Chinese bakeries
A couple of years ago , I went on a business trip to Taiyuan , China , where I was hoping to secure a very lucrative deal with a company called Yuen Bakeries .
Everything seemed to be going extremely well , until we were invited to inspect the impressive machinery .
As I was leaning over to peer into one of their large mixing machines , I lost my balance and toppled right in .
No harm was done , as the machinery was switched off , but it was very embarrassing being an Occidental in Yuen dough .

You want to do WHAT ??
Not so long back I was working on a production where the load - in had been crap , the venue was shit , we were under - staffed , it was turning into the job from Hell .
We worked through the night and as the appointed show - time neared , everyone was mucking in , taping cables down and tidying up .
I was on hands and knees picking up rubbish and debris from the stage , dumping it into a large cardboard box , when the agitated client decided to show some solidarity and piled in with a dustpan and brush .
After a couple of minutes , she had filled the dustpan , and came over to where I was , head down and arse in the air :
" Can I put this in your dirtbox ? " she trilled .
Bearing in mind we were literally minutes from the show call , and the client was extremely snooty , I bit my lip .
Hard .
In slo - mo , I could see my boss ' face pop up over her shoulder with a look of horror , he knew I would n't be able to resist that one .
However , difficult though it was , I was in control , by a hair 's breadth .
Then I heard from behind me a loud rasping from a colleague who had also realised the folly of laughing at the client , and was so clenched up he had farted .
The floodgates opened , both of us collapsed , and the boss had to whisk the bewildered client away .
He told her we were delirious from lack of sleep !

Could someone get me a cushion ?
In 1998 I was in a pretty bad car accident and , as some would say , I got mashed up pretty good .
After spending a couple of weeks enduring the hospitality of the National Health Service , I was nearly good as new .
OK , I had a few stitches , walking was still a bit of a problem and I looked like I ’d gone 10 rounds with Mike Tyson , but I was getting there .
Add to that the fact that I was so pumped full of pain killers that I could have been hit by a bus and not felt it , and you kind of understand how I was feeling .
Two weeks further still , and I ’m back at work .
I ’m still not in great shape , but getting by .
Reaching up for wine glasses hurt , and pulling the real ale was a bit of a chore , but the punters are glad to see me back and I ’m getting a lot of sympathy from the girls .
Double trouble .
One night , I got chatting to a couple of the locals .
I knew that they were lawyers , and they had n’t seen me around for a while .
When they found out that I ’d been in this accident , they started advising me on what I should do .
Well , I say advising .
They pretty well pushed me in to going down the compensation route .
Please bear in mind that I was 18 , desperate for cash , and the person who crashed in to us really was at fault .
And so began a long round of meetings with lawyers and applications for legal aid .
Part of this process was meeting with a doctor .
Very nice gent he was , quite old school : tweed jacket , pipe and monocle .
The works .
We spoke for about 2 hours , and he asked me various questions :
“ Tell me about your injuries . ”
“ How do your injuries affect your ability to work or study ? ”
“ Have you had any further pain ? ”
And :
“ Have you experienced any pain in social situations ? ”
To this , I answered “ well , sometimes when I ’m out with my friends , at a club , say , my back can start to really hurt . ”
Well over a year passes , and I get my grubby hands on a cheque for three grand .
I also get a copy of the doctor ’s report , which was made all the better by the immortal line :
“ Sometimes experiences a little stiffness at the discotheque . ”

What a brill QOTW .
Childish and silly .
So am I , therefore I feel I should contribute .
These are all 100 % true and if they were said to someone with a maturity level higher than mine , they 'd would have prob been instantly forgotten .
Translations first , then the unfortunate innuendos that resulted in conversation .
1. Elizabeth has skills that are of great use to this company in the accounting department .
2. Mid-morning , my co-workers and I enjoy a healthy snack on site , sitting next to the large transistor .
3 . I asked the motorist for a light for my cigarette .
He did n't smoke and it was a new car so he did n't know if the lighter worked , he tried it and fortunately , it did !.
4 . I 'd be glad to show you around the theatre - land area of London in which I work .
5 . Behave or I shall attack you with this corkscrew I am holding .
6 . Due to the dimensions of this removal van , and the contents within , only one of us three chaps will be able to fit at the back of this washing machine and lift , giving the required leverage to move it .
7. Ladies are obviously attracted to the element of risk and excitement offered by a man who rides a motorcycle .
I enjoy stolling about town with my protective clothing and headwear .
8 . I displayed the symbol of our engagement to my proud parent .
Unfortunately , it was too small for her .
OK , read them ?
Make sense ?
All innocent enough , right ?
WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID :
1 . " Liz is great at double entry "
2. " About 11 am , me and the fellas sit around the Big Tranny and have a fruit break "
3 . " I leant through his car window and when he sat back it popped out all red and hot . "
4 . " I 'll take you up the Shaftesbury "
( Actually said by my brother , possibly intentionally )
5 . " Stop it or I 'll come over there and screw your brains out "
( Said by my maths teacher whilst holding a corkscrew , for some reason .
Being quite attractive I just looked at her trying to do my best , suave Roger - Moore - like single raised eyebrow of promise in reply .
Being a 14yr old gangly spacker , it did n't work . )
6 . " I do n't mind taking it from behind ... "
( Nearly died .
Fell in the road laughing and nearly had my head run over . )
7 . " I love the image .
All the girls check me out when I walk down the High Street wearing my leather and holding my helmet .
8 . " My mum tried to get her finger in my ring , but it was too tight . "

The other day
I was doing some gardening and I ended up
running over the debris from the recent re-carpetting of the living room , which had been put on the lawn .
Because of the heat generated from the friction with said debris ,
the blades had become very soft and flexible .
" Ah drat ! " I cried
" What is it dear ? " asked Wife
" Chopper 's gone limp " I replied .
" Oh no ! "
She said " What happened ? "
" Well I got it out but just ended up eating carpet ! "
Well , off I popped to the DIY store to buy a new one .
" Hello ! " chirped the sales assistant .
" Hello .... Connie " said I , spotting her name badge .
" That 's Miss Lingus to you sir ! " she said reproachfully .
" Terrible sorry .
Could you direct me to the lawnmowers ? "
Well , on the way to the lawnmowers I accidentally knocked into this burly chap .
I apologised immediately of course .
" That 's Dave , " explained Miss Lingus " he 's a member of our store rugby team . "
" Hmm . A good strong member I daresay ! "
We continued until arriving at the lawnmower aisle .
It was here I noticed some shears .
" Ooh , these would be perfect ! " I exclaimed .
" For what ? " asked a , frankly belligerent , Connie .
" Why my wifes unruly bush of course !
Just the other day I noticed a pair of pine martens making a nest in there ! "
Having acquired a lawnmower , I became curious as to what other items I could purchase , so asked Connie to lead me to the bicycles .
There was arranged a beautiful shelf of bicycling paraphernalia , and I saw just the item I wanted .
I reached out and picked it up .
" I 'll buy this ! "
I said
" Should I polish it for you sir ? " asked Connie
" Polish what ? "
" Your bell of course sir !
I 'd very much like to polish your big purple bell ! "
The colourful bicycle bell I 'd picked up was indeed a bit grubby , and could perhaps do with a nice clean .
" Ooh yes please ! " I shouted .
" I only need a new one because a religious figurehead robbed my last one ! "
" Indeed sir ? "
" Ooh yes I punished him accordingly of course . "
" How so sir ? "
" Well I flogged the bishop you fool ! " I yelled , cursing the child 's ignorance . "
I got to the checkout with my items and was very pleased with how the shop had gone .
" What brand of lawnmower is it , sir ? " asked the knave at the counter .
" Erm , let me just put my glasses on , " I said .
" Ah here we are .
It is a ' Tightly Puckered Anus 3000 "
" Very good , sir . "

Innuendo at it 's best ...
Few years back my folks were helping me and mrs tinpixel decorate our new flat .
My mum being my mum had brought a selection of about 300 meat sandwiches , so taking a lunch break we chatted about the new place .
Mrs tinpixel was busy moaning about the lack of blinds or drapes covering the huge living room window and how the neighbours can see in at night .
As she spoke , the sandwich fell open and some of the meat went on the floor .
Carrying on talking , she casually picked it up and threw it out the window ... only it missed and stuck to the glass .
To which which my Dad pipes up ...
" Oh my !
What lovely beef curtains you have ! "

PE teacher
There is a set up here , all true , which explaings the note ...
When messing about with me sister , we decided to see how many stairs we could jump down .
i regularly did n't use the bottom 4 stairs on the way down and decide that 6 steps ( out of 13 ) was pretty decent .
So did it a few times until i landed with al the skill of Les Dennis on the Games .
Flat footed and really badly bruised both feet .
i could n't walk without walking on the bruises .
Come PE day , there was no way i could play rugby ( called that but really was lots of cross country running in the rain ) .
At last , a legit reason for a note .
Mum dutifully writes one and puts in an envelope .
I hand in the note .
He moans and walks off and i set about the 1 hour 20 minutes of double PE and the skiving in the warm with applomb .
About half hour in he comes over to me pissing himself laughing and asking if i was lying ?
I said no my feet really hurt .
He then probed deeper , and enquired exactly how i did such damage to myself ?
i explained i jumped down the stairs , and he just said " well how the f*ck did you hurt your testicles then ? "
I was confused .
Really confused and started to get a bit scared .
I stated again i jumped down the stairs and landed heavy .
I then thought to ask to see the note .
Well done mum .
" Dear Mr Davies .
Barry cannot do PE today as he has jumped down the stairs and hurt his balls and heels of his feet . "

There is significant portion of customers which are still using MyISAM when they come to us , so one of the big questions is when it is feasible to move to Innodb and when staying on MyISAM is preferred ?
I generally prefer to see Innodb as the main storage engine because it makes life much simpler in the end for most users – you do not get to deal with recovering tables on the crash or partially executed statements .
Table locks is no more problem , hot backups are easy , though there are some important things which we have to consider on case by case basics before recommending the move .
Is MyISAM used as default or as a choice ?
This is the most important question to ask upfront .
Sometimes MyISAM is there just because it is default , in other cases this is deliberate choice with system being optimized to deal with MyISAM limits , for example there is a dedicated slave available for all long reporting queries .
In case MyISAM was chosen not just happened to be it is important to build the good argument to suggest Innodb .
Application Readiness Application should be ready to work with Innodb , for example be ready to deal with deadlocks which can happen with Innodb even if you do not use transactions , but which are not existent with MyISAM .
QA has to be performed as part of the move .
Performance Innodb has a lot to offer in terms of performance – Performance benefits and drawbacks .
On the benefits side we usually see clustering by primary key , caching data , higher concurrency , background flushes while on the drawbacks side we see significantly large table size ( especially if data size is close to memory size ) , generally slower writes , slower blob handling , concurrency issues , problems dealing with very large number of tables , slow data load and ALTER TABLE and others .
Another big one is COUNT (*) without where clause which is often the show stopper for them move until it is worked around .
Operations
What is good for MyISAM kills Innodb , such as copying binary tables between the servers .
It is important the team understands Innodb and knows how to handle it , or be able to learn it .
It is also important to adjust processes as required to work with Innodb .
For example binary copy of one of the databases from the Slave to the dev envinronment works great for MyISAM but does not work with Innodb .
Backup tools like “ mysqlhotcopy ” does not work etc .
Note Performance also affects
Operations aspects a lot – for example using mysqldump as a backup may well work for MyISAM but will start taking way too much time to do restore for Innodb .
On large scale installations mysqldump does not work anyway but it may still work for you when you ’re running MyISAM but instantly break upon upgrading to Innodb .
Features
The MyISAM features which forbid moving to Innodb are typically Full Text Search and RTREE indexes / GIS with Full Text being much more common .
There are workarounds for both of them , including dedicated MyISAM slave or shadow table but it is important to consider them .
How about Mixing Storage Engines ?
Sure you can mix storage engines but I suggest you doing is wisely .
It complicates operations tasks ( backups , balancing , performance analyzes ) as well as it exercises not so common paths in the MySQL server – in particular Optimizer may have harder time because costs between storage engines may not be well balanced or replication of mixed table types which is quite complicated .
I prefer to pick one storage engine ( typically Innodb ) and when use other tables when it really gives substantial gains .
I would not switch table to MyISAM because it gives 5 % performance improvement but I can perfectly use MyISAM ( or Archive ) for logging .
Innodb Needs Tuning
As a final note about MyISAM to Innodb migration I should mention about Innodb tuning .
Innodb needs tuning .
Really .
MyISAM for many applications can work well with defaults .
I ’ve seen hundreds of GB databases ran with MyISAM with default settings and it worked reasonably .
Innodb needs resources and it will not work well with defaults a lot .
Tuning MyISAM from defaults rarely gives more than 2 - 3 times gain while it can be as much as 10 - 50 times for Innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads .
Check here for details .
Note : As Few people questioned me , I indeed forgot to clarify the scope here – I ’m mainly speaking about OLTP / Traditional web applications .
for Analytics things are a lot different .
Steve Haworth holds up a rare earth magnet with his magnetic implant .
View Slideshow
What if , seconds before your laptop began stalling , you could feel the hard drive spin up under the load ?
Or you could tell if an electrical cord was live before you touched it ?
For the few people who have rare earth magnets implanted in their fingers , these are among the reported effects – a finger that feels electromagnetic fields along with the normal sense of touch .
It 's been described as a buzzing sensation , a tingling , an oscillation , movement , pure stimulation and , in the case of body - modification expert Shannon Larrett 's encounter with a too - powerful antitheft gateway at a retail store , " Like sticking your hand in an ultrasonic cleaner . "
Body - mod artists Jesse Jarrell and Steve Haworth 's original idea was to implant a magnet to carry metal gadgets .
It turns out that does n't work :
If you try to carry something magnetic on your implant regularly , the pinched skin between the magnets dies and your body rejects the implant .
But they came up with a new application when a mutual friend suffered an accident that left a shard of iron in his finger .
He worked with audio equipment , and found that he could tell which speakers were magnetized from the sensation that passed through his finger at close range .
That gave Jarrell and Haworth a new direction : Could they obtain that effect deliberately , extending the sense of touch into a sense of magnetism ?
Todd Huffman , a graduate student at Arizona State University with a background in neuroscience , joined the project and brainstormed with Jarrell and Haworth about how , and where , to best implant a powerful magnet .
He helped come up with the most effective design for an implant , and eventually became the first recipient .
" The fingertip was chosen because of the high nerve density , and because the hands are constantly interacting with the environment , increasing the chances of sensing electromagnetism in the world , " Huffman says .
" We chose the ring finger primarily because of its size and relatively low importance in gripping action , so there was plenty of room for the implant and a lower chance of physically damaging the implant , " Huffman explains .
Jarrell puts it more bluntly , writing about the procedure in a BMEZine article from March : " ' If you had to lose or seriously damage one of your fingers , which would it be ? '
This was our answer . "
But nobody 's finger fell off , and Huffman 's results were better than they 'd imagined .
According to Huffman , the magnet works by moving very slightly , or with a noticeable oscillation , in response to EM fields .
This stimulates the somatosensory receptors in the fingertip , the same nerves that are responsible for perceiving pressure , temperature and pain .
Huffman and other recipients found they could locate electric stovetops and motors , and pick out live electrical cables .
Appliance cords in the United States give off a 60 - Hz field , a sensation with which Huffman has become intimately familiar .
" It is a light , rapid buzz , " he says .
I took a trip to Phoenix to have Haworth implant a magnet in me last September .
Because body - mod artists are not medical practitioners , ice was the only anesthetic available .
My finger was soaked in ice water until it began to hurt .
After that , Haworth acted quickly to get as much of the implant done as possible while my hand was still numb from the cold .
The initial cut did hurt , but not unbearably .
He sliced open my finger with a standard scalpel , inserted a tool to make a gap for the magnet , and tried to insert the magnet in one nonstop motion .
The insertion did n't work , and he widened the cut and tried again .
This time it worked , and he closed the cut with a single suture .
The suture was the most painful step – an indicator that the cold " anesthetic " had worn off .
The process took less than 10 minutes .
My finger was slightly swollen and sported a blue , knotted plastic thread .
When we were done we sat in Haworth 's living room .
He brought out a magnet and handed it to me .
I brought it near my finger and felt the magnet move for the first time up against the raw inside of my finger .
I startled visibly , and Haworth grinned .
" Welcome to your new sense , " he said .
At first there was no discerning between the throbbing of the injury and the sense of magnetic fields .
Consequently , some early encounters with industrial refrigerators remain mysterious – was the display case at Citizen Cake really giving off that much EM , or was I just having blood rush to my healing finger ?
Other sensations were unmistakable from the start .
I would circle my finger with a strong magnet and feel the one in my finger spin .
In time , bits of my laptop became familiar as tingles and buzzes .
Every so often I would pass near something and get an unexpected vibration .
Live phone pairs on the sides of houses sometimes startled me .
I become slightly phobic of magnetic resonance imaging machines .
The superpowerful electromagnets used in medical imaging can make metal fly across a room and stick , often for the hours it takes to power down the magnets .
A person with an embedded magnet runs the risk of having their implant ripped out of their body .
People with magnetic implants can't erase hard drives or credit cards .
They do n't set off airport metal detectors or get stuck to refrigerators .
The magnets are small , and once encased in skin , all they do is react next to nerves , conveying the presence of sufficiently strong electromagnetic fields .
" The magnetic implant is not the most sophisticated or rich sensation , it was just the easiest to implement with our available technology , " says Huffman .
Implant work is n't ready for prime time .
While Huffman loves his implant , he discourages others from getting it .
" Most people do n't understand the risks , and implant work is n't appropriate for most people . "
Those risks include infection and breach of the magnet 's silicone sheath .
The procedure itself is painful , and the results vary from person to person for unknown and unstudied reasons .
Huffman does n't see it as a candidate for study .
" The science of sensation is something very much studied by neuroscientists and psychologists , but no one has done what we did , " Huffman says .
" The regulation would be onerous , even if someone wanted to . "
Zack Lynch , managing director of neurotechnology consulting firm NeuroInsights , is skeptical of the practice altogether .
" I 'm not sure if it 's efficacious , intelligent or therapeutic ....
I 'd worry about long - term problems , including corrosion . "
Several months after having the procedure , some people begin to have problems .
Some magnets begin to turn dark under the skin , suggesting the bio-neutral silicone sheath is failing .
Exposure to the body starts breaking down the magnets .
Two months after my own magnet was inserted , and long after the cut itself had healed , I experienced one of these problems firsthand .
My shielding breached and the implant area became infected .
The infection resolved , but the region turned black and my sixth sense evaporated .
My family doctor tried to remove the magnet and failed .
Instead , the implant shattered into pieces , and I could no longer pick up other magnets with my finger .
After months of ESP , all I had left was a sore digit with a dark spot .
I figured that was the end , but it was n't .
Four months after I lost all effect , the spot darkened and the magnetism returned .
The magnet – being a magnet – had reassembled itself in my finger .
While it 's nowhere near as sensitive as it once was , I can once again pick up other magnets .
Haworth plans to try a new generation of magnets with a 70 - durometer liquid silicone rubber coating , up from the previous 30 to 40 durometers .
That 's going from the hardness of a pencil eraser to the hardness of a car tire .
No one knows if that will do the trick , but in the body - modification community , there 's only one way to find out .
