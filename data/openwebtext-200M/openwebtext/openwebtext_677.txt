AIG needs even more money .
Bloomberg is reporting that the company that once was the largest insurer in the world plans to use the new commercial paper subsidy program to borrow $ 10 billion .
Keep in mind that AIG has already borrowed $ 80 billion or so of the $ 122.8 billion credit facility from the Fed .
From Bloomberg :
AIG would probably tap less than $ 10 billion through the new commercial paper program , said the person , who declined to be identified because no agreement had been reached .
AIG , once the world 's largest insurer , may seek the additional funding after the Federal Reserve expanded its $ 85 billion lifeline to the company last week by making another $ 37.8 billion available .
Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy is selling units including U.S. life insurance , plane leasing and consumer finance to repay the government loan .
New York - based AIG has already tapped two - thirds of the $ 122.8 billion made available through the two credit lines .
`` We 've got a plan that will allow us to repay the Fed loan and emerge as a strong international property - casualty insurer with a presence in international life insurance , '' said AIG spokesman Nicholas Ashooh .
The Fed said last week it will create a special fund to buy commercial paper , seeking to unblock the financing that drives everyday commerce for American businesses .
A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment on individual companies that may seek cash through the fund .
2004 DHS Program Used Racial And Ethnic Profiling
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 ; media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON – A report in today ’s New York Times revealed details of a 2004 Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) anti-terrorism program that , despite government claims to the contrary , used racial profiling .
More than 2,000 Muslim immigrants were investigated in the lead up to the 2004 elections , and many were interrogated right before the November election .
Despite the investment of considerable resources , “ Operation Front Line ” produced minimal results .
Most of those investigated were found to have done nothing wrong .
In 2001 , President Bush declared that racial profiling was “ wrong ” and that he would “ end it in America .
” In 2002 , Attorney General John Ashcroft said , “ Using race … as a proxy for potential criminal behavior is unconstitutional , and it undermines law enforcement by undermining the confidence that people can have in law enforcement , ” and his Justice Department banned racial profiling by federal law enforcement in 2003 .
That ban , however , came with an exemption for national security investigations .
Today ’s New York Times article shows how DHS drove a truck through that loophole just one year later .
“ Despite President Bush ’s vow to end racial profiling , his administration embraced it , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ This program confirms that racial and ethnic profiling are not only wrong , but they do n’t work .
The time and resources spent by DHS rounding up , interrogating and investigating innocent American immigrants could have been spent dealing with actual threats to our country . ”
The Times story comes on the heels of a debate regarding the overhaul of guidelines that govern FBI investigations .
The ACLU is vigorously opposed to the new guidelines that will be implemented on December 1 .
Among granting other expanded powers , the guidelines allow racial profiling , which the ACLU believes will lead to more misguided efforts like the one revealed in this DHS program .
“ After questioning and investigating over 2,000 people , DHS came up empty handed .
How much more evidence do we need that racial profiling is a waste of time and resources ? ” said Fredrickson .
“ Preserving an ineffective and counterproductive technique for our most important national security investigations makes no sense .
The national security loophole in the DOJ ’s racial profiling ban must be closed . ”
Keep your coincidence caps handy , folks .

Especially those in Ohio ( 4 of the 7 ) and Georgia ( 2 of the 7 ) .

One night , in a bar in Zanzibar , I saw two sex workers chatting up a couple of Germans .
The men were in their 50s , paunchy and balding - the women were young and pretty .
It was a painful sight , the Germans plying the women with drinks and single entendre ; the women laughing as though their lives depended on it , which in a way they did .
But after a while the true pathos became apparent : the men actually thought that these young women were interested in them because of who they were rather than what they had - money .
That their dazzling personalities and dashing good looks had magically transformed them into irresistible specimens of manhood .
Mistaking the possibility of a commercial transaction for the unlikelihood of sexual attraction , their eyes lingered on the mirror behind the bar as they started preening themselves , as though their looks mattered .
Power , whether you wield it or not , has a way of shading our sense of selves and others .
In The Audacity of Hope , Barack Obama recalls a businessman seeing Al Gore shortly after the 2000 election .
" During the campaign I would take his calls any time of day , " the executive said .
" But suddenly , after the election , I could n't help feeling that the meeting was a chore .
At some level he was n't Al Gore , former vice - president .
He was just one of the hundred guys a day who are coming to me looking for money .
It made me realise what a big steep cliff you guys are on . "
The US may be perched on the edge of a similar precipice .
The degree to which it commands its hegemony through wealth and might ( hard power ) as opposed to culture and democratic example ( soft power ) has long been an open question .
The personal aspiration , individual liberty and social meritocracy that are central to its national brand has an almost universal appeal .
But how much that ethos makes sense without wealth and power is another matter .
People need a social ladder worth climbing and something to do with their freedoms when they get to the top .
Have Caribbean kids been ditching cricket for basketball because it is faster and slicker , or because it offers the possibility of university scholarships , riches and fame ?
Was Obama 's victory any more miraculous than Evo Morales 's - he was the first indigenous Bolivian to rule his country - or do we just know and care more about it because of America 's impact on our lives ?
What is Sex and the City without the shopping and the skyline ?
By almost any count Sweden has greater gender equality and liberated sexual mores than the US .
Yet would the escapades of four single women in Stockholm stand a chance of becoming an international blockbuster , even if it were in English ?
Unlikely .
The truth is that American economic and cultural power are so inextricably woven that to separate them would be to see the whole thing unravel before your eyes .
Both are fundamental to how the rest of the world views the US and how Americans view themselves .
And yet , with the simultaneous transition of Obama 's ascent to the White House and the national economy 's descent into long - term decline , countervailing pressures are pushing those two factors in contradictory directions .
Abroad , American political leadership has never been so popular or so impotent .
At home , Americans have never felt so excited about what their country might become or so apprehensive about where it might be heading .
The next few months are shaping up to be truly Dickensian : the best of times , and the worst of times .
On the one hand , almost three weeks after the election , Obama still peers out from posters and badges .
The warm glow of his victory still radiates and few seem keen to snuff out the flame .
On the subway in New York last weekend an African - American woman in her 50s asked me what I thought of " our new president " .
We talked politics until my stop , exchanged a handshake and a hug .
I dare say I 'll never see her again .
The disappointing composition of his transition team ( if he was going to appoint half the Clinton cabinet , why not just let Hillary have the nomination ? ) has done nothing to blunt the enthusiasm .
Two months before he takes office Obama enjoys a 61 % approval rating .
If the rest of the world were polled , it would be even higher .
As his triumph was announced , public celebrations erupted in almost every time zone .
It is difficult to think of a moment when there has been more global goodwill towards an American leader , let alone such a dramatic reversal of attitude towards US leadership .
On the other hand , it is difficult to think of a moment when Americans felt more depressed about the state of their country or were less able to enforce their will on the world .
Just one in six believe that the country is heading in the right direction , and consumer confidence is at a historic low .
A country wedded to the notion that every year will be better than the last , and every generation more prosperous , has seen social mobility stall and the past look more promising than the future .
Meanwhile , thanks to Iraq and Afghanistan , the nation 's military is hopelessly overstretched and its reputation for invincibility lies shattered .
Diplomatically , it is out of moral capital .
Economically , it is out of plain old capital .
While these two trends coincide , they are not moving in lockstep .
The presidential transition is hostage to a definite time period - Obama will not take the oath for another 57 days .
Meanwhile , the scale and pace of the economic decline is indefinite .
Less than two months ago , Citigroup was one vulture swooping in to feed from the carcass of the failed Wachovia bank .
With its shares now in freefall and its chief executive in peril , Citigroup now looks set to become carrion itself .
Obama wants to try and save the big three car manufacturers ; it remains to be seen how many will be left by his inauguration .
So Obama 's win may have been a lesson for the rest of the world , as claimed by the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
" Electing a black president says around the world that you can overcome old wounds , " she told the New York Times last weekend .
" I 've said in our case , we have a birth defect , but it can be overcome . "
The trouble is the rest of the world no longer needs to attend the lectures .
" Owing to the relative decline of its economic and , to a lesser extent , military power , the US will no longer have the same flexibility in choosing among as many policy options , " concluded the National Intelligence Council ( which coordinates analysis from all US intelligence agencies ) last week .
The report acknowledged that , while the US would remain the single most powerful force in the world , its relative strength and potential leverage are in decline .
It does n't take a genius to work this out .
Which is just as well , since there are clearly few geniuses in the NIC .
Its last forecast , in December 2004 , predicted " continued US dominance " , and oil and gas supplies " sufficient to meet global demand " .
It can take time for perception to catch up with reality .
By the time those Germans figured out their true aesthetic value , they may well have been broke .

The Hewitt strategy of trying to bring the LDS church - especially LDS money - into a Christianist popular front began with the Romney candidacy .
Then it morphed into Prop 8 , funded by $ 20 million of Mormon money .
The leadership of the LDS church has every right to do this ; but equally gay people and their families now have every right to highlight the Mormon church as an enemy of civil rights and of gay people everywhere .
This will be decried as bigotry .
But gays are not fighting to remove the civil rights of Mormons ; while Mormons have successfully campaigned to remove the civil rights of gays .
Tolerant and inclusive Mormons should not be forgotten ; the Mormon tradition of church - state separation should not be ignored either .
But toleration goes both ways .
Gay people have every right to regard the Mormon church hierarchy as a mortal enemy .
If they knock on my door any time soon , they will get an earful .

Issues with Intel 's integrated graphics touched off a cascade of complications affecting Microsoft 's Vista rollout , prompting the creation of the " Vista Capable " designation that eventually angered Microsoft customers Hewlett - Packard and Sony .
Issues with Intel 's integrated graphics touched off a cascade of complications affecting Microsoft 's Vista rollout , prompting the creation of the " Vista Capable " designation that eventually angered Microsoft customers Hewlett - Packard and Sony .
Emails unsealed last week by a district court judge reveal the at - times heated back - and - forth discussions between Microsoft and its partners .
The case , filed by two consumers , was brought against Microsoft in a Washington state court earlier this year , and later given class - action status .
A new batch of email , released Thursday , point to a even more problems between HP and Microsoft , as HP chief executive Mark Hurd complained to Ballmer that the company was " being overrun " with support calls .
Covering a period from roughly April 2005 through Feb.
2007 , the emails show that Intel was initially unable to supply an integrated graphics chipset that would meet the needs of the " Aero Glass " interface that Microsoft had so highly touted in Vista .
However , the company had a stockpile of older , less capable chips .
At Intel 's request , Microsoft created a " good / better / best " product rollout strategy  ranging from " Windows Capable " to the Basic and Premium Vista logo programs  allowing PC makers to manufacture low - end PCs using the Intel 945 " Calistoga " chipset and thus participate in the Vista launch .
Those chipsets lacked a Windows Display Driver Model ( WDDM ) ( also referred to as the Longhorn Display Driver Model ) driver , one of the keys to the Aero Glass interface .
Hewlett - Packard , meanwhile , had invested heavily in leading - edge Intel chipsets , even designing two motherboards around them .
The inclusion of the " Vista Capable " designation angered HP , worried Sony , and even frustrated some of Microsoft 's marketing and technical executives .
While the emails further detail the level of frustration felt by Microsoft 's partners , the initial motivation for the Vista Capable logo was explained in February , when another passel of email was released describing more of the relationship between Microsoft and Intel , and the integrated chipsets .
The smoking gun there was the astounding lack of driver support that accompanied Vista 's launch , a consequence of Microsoft 's apparent lack of credibility with independent hardware vendors .
In those emails , both Microsoft senior executives as well as board member and former Microsoft president Jon Shirley complained about the lack of drivers and the overall poor user experience on Vista machines .
The reason ?
Microsoft 's partners did n't trust the company to ship Vista on time .
Sony weakens " Vista Ready " requirements
In late 2005 , Microsoft was worrying about how its PC OEM partners would prepare for the launch .
Vista - optimized PCs would go out on launch day , but there was a concern about whether or not existing PCs could run Vista .
A " Vista Ready " list of requirements had been passed along to OEMs for about a year , and Microsoft executives were reluctant to change them  which they eventually did .
The problem Microsoft faced was how to prepare the market for Vista without cannibalizing Windows XP sales .
Windows manager Rajesh Srinivasan sent an email to several managers on Oct. 11 , 2005 , noting that it was " impractical " for OEMs to design systems without something to test against .
" The primary goal of Ready PC program is to limit stall of XP sales as we continue to build Vista buzz , " he wrote .
" You can not go out and ' reset ' Ready PC requirements with OEMs , " wrote Mark Croft , a Microsoft marketing director , on Nov. 1 , 2005 .
" This is a very highly charged topic with OEMs . "
But Srinivasan also worried about " customer dis- sat[ isfaction ] " with PCs that were marketed as Vista Ready , but would not be able to run the premium Aero Glass graphics interface .
After a conversation with Sony executives and its own graphics team , however , Microsoft punched several holes in its logo programs where ultramobile ( UMPCs ) and ultraportable ( UPPCs ) were concerned .
On Dec.15 , 2005 , Windows manager Rajesh Srinivasan sent former corporate vice president for Windows Product Marketing Mike Sievert a lengthy email , waiving the premium graphics requirements for ultraportable PCs ( UPPCs ) , and the Vista logo requirements for ultramobile PCs ( UMPCs ) .
The rationale Srinivasan gave was to " close the issue and protect [ Sievert 's ] credibility with Sony " .
" This gives Sony the ability to market UPPCs and UMPCs as Premium , despite not meeting the graphics logo criteria , " Srinivasan wrote .
" Mike promised that ' Sony UPPCs will qualify for the Vista logo , ' " Srinivasan added .
" What Mike meant was that Sony UPPCs can get the Vista premium logo without meeting all the criteria for Aero Glass , as long as they meet their criteria for premium logo .
We are waiving Aero ( DWM ) requirement for UPPC to support Mike 's commitment to Sony . "
In part , Microsoft made its choice because Sony was transitioning its UPPCs to the Intel 945 GM chipset , specifically designed for the category .
Fujitsu also made a request to have two of its UPPCs that would use the 945GMS ( identified in the emails as the 915GMS ) exempted from the WDDM requirement , but Microsoft refused .
Intel issues arise
In order to successfully launch Vista , coordination between both halves of " Wintel " was necessary to bring the proper message to the two companies ' partners , Microsoft believed .
Between the two companies , the tone was cordial .
Privately , however , Microsoft 's evaluation was much harsher .
One of the earliest emails made public by the court was in July of 2005 , where Chris Jones , then the corporate vice president of Windows Client Core Development , complained about the quality of the Intel 945 " Calistoga " chipset .
" When we set out to do LDDM we knew that we needed a high performance graphics part , " Jones wrote .
" We told Intel that their part would need work and would be a constant risk .
I am amazed we are even getting it close to working on Calistoga .
I know this causes friction with Intel but you can't just do the stuff we want to do on their part  it is crappy for graphics . "
But on July 6 , Windows Client chief Will Poole responded to Jones , noting prophetically that " LDDM does not make much difference in the marketplace if we do n't get across the line with the chipsets that do / will account for 80 percent of the market . "
Intel apparently understood this , too .
In August , Intel began messaging OEMs that the Intel 915 chipset would provide " an optimal Windows Vista experience , " according to the unsealed emails .
Srinivasan expressed concern , noting that " OEMs are locking in their spring refresh with Intel 915 , and Intel / OEMs do not want us to message to customers in the unmanaged space till June 06 that these systems would not provide the full Windows Vista experience . "
This worried Microsoft .
That same month , however , Microsoft posted an article on its TechNet developer Web site , authored by a third - party employee .
In it , the author recommended to Microsoft developers and OEMs that they buy a PC with a graphics connector , and not rely solely on integrated graphics .
The upshot ?
Intel 's integrated graphics chipsets could n't cut it .
The article was quickly pulled , but not before Russian Web site Xbit Labs posted a summary .
On Jan. 25 , 2006 , Poole emailed Renee James , a senior vice president at Intel .
Poole said he saw " two issues converging " : the timing of when Vista Capable machines could be stocked and marketed , and how the marketing program would affect the demand for the PCs .
Poole also highlighted an issue with Intel 's newest 945 " Lakeport " chipset , which hid a bug involved in playback of ATSC - encoded HD data in Windows Video .
Poole wrote that there was " no way " either company could permit Intel 945 systems not to carry a Vista logo .
But the key issue was one of supply , and here Poole said Microsoft 's path was clear .
" The decision is obvious for us , " Poole wrote .
" We 've got to start the marketing plan in June which means we are going to allow OEMs to start stocking and shipping in to channel Vista Capable logo 's PCs in April . "
But that was a problem .
On Jan. 27 , James emailed Poole , asking Poole for a meeting with Otellini , and complaining that the April 1 marketing date felt arbitrary .
" Our parts are not tested , not validated , " James wrote .
" [ Otellini ] thinks you really do n't understand that almost all of our mobile SKUs for the next 5 months [ sic ] are with Centrino with Alviso and therefore NEVER Vista ready  and Mobile is a huge part of retail and growing , " James added .
On January 30 , Microsoft capitulated .
Poole sent an email to Ballmer advising him that Microsoft had revised its branding program , making Intel 's 915 chipset fall under the " Vista Capable " branding in April 2006 .
" This change completely resolves their problem , " Poole wrote .
" Renee [ James ] is very pleased and will report as much to Paul [ Otellini ] .
But even Ballmer was n't convinced .
" I thought they had other issues certainly paul described other ( non graphics issues ) is this really resolved check with her thanks , " he wrote .
Microsoft manager Mike Ybarra also spoke up .
" This kind of shit drives me crazy , Chris , " Ybarra wrote .
" We have pushed the UI so hard the last 18 months and we get our OEMs to go with higher - end chipsets and graphics parts on existing PCs to really drive the experience for consumers and at the last minute we cave and give 915 and other chipsets a backdoor into the programs .
" I hate the idea of a consumer upgrading a PC that we have marked as " Vista Capable " and not getting the great UI experience .
I know this is a marketing call here but at some point we have to stick to our guns  we had the partner momentum to be successful here .
Serious plans were put in pace by OEMs , which were " wasted , " Ybarra wrote .
On the same day , Ybarra notified Will Poole , who said that he was " worried " about the machine requirements , and said that he had " no idea what a ' modern CPU means " .
" I am worried about the memory number below , " Poole wrote .
" We should be encouraging more memory .
Min [ Minimum ] 512 K is still ok , but it is min . "
Poole also noted that the Intel 945 chipset , with a dual - channel memory controller , would run the Aero Glass interface well , but there was only a limited supply .
And then all hell broke loose with one of Microsoft 's biggest hardware partners , HP .
The HP debacle
Rajesh Srinivasan reported on Jan. 31 that Greg Taylor , an HP systems engineer , knew that Microsoft is changing the requirements for Vista Capable .
" HP is not going to be happy with this change , " Srinivasan writes .
He was right ; the strategy shift made its way quickly up the HP corporate ladder .
On Feb .
1 , Poole reported that someone had leaked Microsoft 's change to HP .
Ballmer replied : " Great by me but Jim [ Allchin , co-president of Microsoft 's Platforms & Services Division ] is apoplectic I know nothing of the details please advise . "
Allchin was n't the only one who was upset .
Richard Walker , who had been appointed to run the PC business at Hewlett - Packard , wrote Kevin Johnson and Allchin just before 9 AM , referencing a " rumor " that Microsoft had reneged on an Aug.
2005 agreement to require a WDDM driver , which the Intel 910 and 915 platforms did not have .
The rumor was indeed true , as Walker said he had discovered .
" I can't be more clear than to say you not only let us down by reneging on your commitment to stand behind the WDDM requirement , you have demonstrated a complete lack of commitment to HP as a strategic partner and cost us a lot of money in the process , " Walker wrote .
" Your credibility is severely damaged in my organization , I have engineers who have worked their tails off to qualify new platforms to support WDDM who are wondering why they put so much effort in when Microsoft changed the rules at the last minute and did n't even consult us before the announcement . "
" If I were to be completely cynical about the course of events leading up to this , I 'd suggest that my friends in Santa Clara slept well last night knowing that they did n't have to worry that part of their line up , non compliant as it would have been on WDDM requirement for 1/4 , will be exposed to public scrutiny , " Walker added .
" I 'm three months into this new role and I hope this incident is not a foretaste of the relationship I will have with Microsoft going forward , but I can tell you it 's left a very bad taste with me and my team . "
At 9:01 AM , Allchin emailed Ballmer and Kevin Johnson .
" I am beyond being upset here , " Allchin wrote .
" This was totally mismanaged by Intel and Microsoft .
What a mess .
" Now we have an upset partner , Microsoft destroyed credibility , my credibility shot , " Allchin continued .
" I was away and I get back to see this mess .
I was told this all started with a call between you and Paul [ presumably Otellini , the chief executive of Intel ] .
I will have to get to the bottom of this and understand how we could be so insensitive in handling the situation . "
Allchin left Microsoft the day of Vista 's launch .
Later that day , Ballmer replied : " I had nothing to do with this .
Will handled everything . "
Ballmer said in his message " I had not even had a chance to report his issues when Will told me he had solved them ( it did not sound like he had ) .
I am not even in the detail of those issues .
" You better get Will under control thanks , " Ballmer concluded .
On Feb. 13 , Ken Goetsch emailed Will Poole and Kevin Eagan to propose a $ 7 million " marketing fund , " basically payback for the $ 6.8 million HP internally estimated that they had spent on " parts , " or the motherboard development .
HP 's problems continued , although they were n't specifically tied to Microsoft .
In a new packet of emails reported by TechFlash on Thursday , HP experienced a higher than expected number of support calls in conjunction with a fulfillment partner , ModusLink , and a " Express Upgrade to Windows Vista " program that was offered to OEMs and managed by Microsoft .
The project suffered from poor Web design which drove customers to phone support lines .
HP complained , and escalated the problem up to chief executive Mark Hurd , who sent a note to Ballmer : " Steve , I 'm sure you 're aware of this .
Our call lines are being overrun . "
" I am going to continue to elevate these issues , our customers and HP 's reputation is getting hurt by poor execution and we need more aggressive action on your part , " Todd Bradley , then executive vice president of HP 's Personal System Group , wrote on Feb. 5 , 2007 .
The latest emails also provide Ballmer with briefing background details on several reporters , as well as a long back - and - forth with analyst and columnist Rob Enderle , who offered Microsoft executives advice on how to message Vista and its graphics capabilities .

Advertisement Carrying extra fat around your middle dramatically increases your risk of early death , even if your overall weight is normal , say researchers .
A study of almost 360,000 people from nine European countries found waist size a " powerful indicator " of risk .
Each extra 2ins ( 5 cm ) raised the chance of early death by between 13 % and 17 % .
The New England Journal of Medicine study stressed GPs should regularly measure patients ' waists as a cheap and easy way to assess health .
It costs virtually nothing to measure your hip and waist size
Professor Elio Riboli
Imperial College London
The link between waist fat and health problems has been established for some time , but the sheer size of the study gives scientists a far more accurate picture .
The researchers , including some from Imperial College London , followed the volunteers , who were an average of 51 years old at the start of the study , for the next 10 years , during which time 14,723 of them died .
The standard measure of obesity , body mass index ( BMI ) remained a reasonable predictor of health problems , with those with a high reading more likely to die from cardiovascular disease or cancer .
However , the ' hip / waist ratio ' , a number produced by dividing the waist size by the hip measurement , and just the waist measurement on its own , were both good ways of sorting out those at highest risk .
A thickening girth can be a sign of type 2 diabetes
Some people who had a completely normal BMI score , but a larger than average waist , were at significantly higher risk of early death .
At the extremes , men with waists exceeding 47ins ( 119 cm ) had a doubled rate of death compared with those with waists under 31.5ins ( 80 cm ) , and a similar statistic was found when women with waists over 39ins ( 99 cm ) were compared to those under 25.5ins ( 64.7 cm ) .
An increase in risk of death could be plotted every time the belt was let out by another two inches - for two people with the same BMI , every additional 2ins ( 5 cm ) on their waistband added up to a 17 % increase in risk for men , and 13 % for women .
Professor Elio Riboli , from Imperial College London , said : " We were surprised to see the waist size having such a powerful effect on people 's health and premature death .
" There are n't many simple individual characteristics that can increase a person 's risk of premature death to this extent , independently from smoking and drinking . "
He added : " The good news is that you do n't need to take an expensive test and wait ages for the result to assess this aspect of your health - it costs virtually nothing to measure your hip and waist size . "
Fat message
The reason for the link is not entirely clear , but another researcher , Dr Tobias Pischon , from the German Institute of Human Nutrition at Potsdam - Rehbrucke , said that abdominal fat was not like other fat reserves , but could directly influence the development of chronic disease by releasing " messenger substances " .
BODY MASS INDEX Calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared Normal : 18.5 - 24.9 Overweight : 25 - 29.9 Obese : Above 30 A British Heart Foundation spokesman welcomed the findings , saying they supported previous research which found the risk of heart disease to be higher when fat was concentrated around the waist area .
" It is important a variety of measurements are used to assess body weight and shape .
- as well as BMI ( Body Mass Index ) , waist circumference and waist - hip ratio can help to provide a better assessment of health risk .
" If you tend to gather weight around your middle , increasing the amount of activity you do and watching what you eat will help to reduce your risk of heart disease and of dying early . "
For 98 % of those studied , hip ratio ranged between 0.78 and 1.10 in men and between 0.66 and 0.98 in women .
Within these ranges , each extra 0.1 waist / hip ration meant a third extra risk of death for men , and a quarter extra for women .

WHEN Christine Huang graduated from college in 2005 , the last way she wanted to look for a job was by attending a networking cocktail hour where she would feel pressured to ask strangers for job leads and contacts .
“ The idea of having to schmooze with people I did n’t know was unappealing , ” Ms. Huang said .
“ But then I realized the idea of networking was about reconnecting with people you know from elementary school , high school and college .
It was just like asking your friends for favors . ”
And that ’s exactly how Ms. Huang landed a position as an arts and culture writer at SH Magazine in Shanghai .
When she moved to China in 2006 , a friend from high school invited her out with a group of his friends , one of whom was an editor at SH Magazine .
Ms. Huang could be seen as a poster child for how some people in her generation look for  and land  jobs .
The old guard way to find gainful employment might have included reading the want ads , joining an industry - specific networking group or applying through the company or a second party ’s Web site .
Today , some young people say they are eschewing those practices and making the lateral network  their circle of friends and friends of those friends  the first stop on their job search .
Senator calls for blank check to be cancelled , says passage of legislation was predicated on lies
Paul Joseph Watson

Monday , November 17 , 2008
Senator Jim Inhofe has slammed the continued secrecy behind where the bailout money has gone , saying that Hank Paulson could have given it to his friends and that the “ blank check ” must be cancelled now .
The Federal Reserve has failed to comply with congressional demands for transparency and disclose the destination of at least $ 2 trillion dollars in bailout funds , underscoring once again the failure of top down socialism and the folly of trusting the foxes to guard the henhouse .
Speaking with Tulsa World , the Oklahoma Republican said , “ It is just outrageous that the American people do n’t know that Congress does n’t know how much money he ( Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ) has given away to anyone , ” adding , “ It could be to his friends .
It could be to anybody else .
We do n’t know .
There is no way of knowing . ”
Inhofe chastised Paulson for carrying out a bait and switch in which he abandoned the central promise to buy out bad mortgage debt after passage of the bill by Congress .

A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ He was able to get this authority from Congress predicated on what he was going to do , and then he did n’t do it , ” Inhofe said .
Inhofe also highlighted the urgency with which the bailout bill was pushed and said this was a tell - tale sign that its advocates were lying about the problem in order to ram through the legislation .
“ I have learned a long time ago .
When they come up and say this has to be done and has to be done immediately , there is no other way of doing it , you have to sit back and take a deep breath and nine times out of 10 they are not telling the truth , ” he said .
“ And this is one of those nine times . ”
As we reported at the time , some members of Congress were threatened with martial law in America if they failed to vote for the bill .
Inhofe is now trying to rally support for a freeze on what ’s left of the initial $ 350 billion of bailout money with his “ roll back the bailout ” proposal , which will also require an affirmative vote on the part of Congress to approve Treasury ’s plan for the remaining $ 350 billion .
“ It is imperative that we not allow that amount of money to be added to a deficit approaching $ 1 trillion this year without any input from the legislative branch , ” stated Inhofe on his website .
“ Congress abdicated its constitutional responsibility by signing a truly blank check over to the Treasury Secretary , ” he wrote .
“ However , the lame duck session of Congress offers us a tremendous opportunity to change course .
We should take it . ”
Inhofe dismissed the premise of the bailout , affirming that giving away money does not stimulate the economy .
“ If we keep on nursing a broken system , then we ca n’t expect to have a different result come later on , ” he said .
“ I just think we have to draw the line someplace , and the time is here . ”

Playful , mischievous and much - beloved , Mac was just two years old when he became the latest Asian elephant to succumb to the herpes virus at the Houston Zoo last month .
For animal welfare advocates , every early death is another piece of evidence that these 8,000 - pound ( 3,625 - kilogram ) proboscideans do n't belong behind bars , where they can become obese , diseased and stressed out .
A new study published today in Science provides the strongest evidence to date that zoo life is harmful to an elephant 's health .
Researchers led by Ros Clubb , an animal behavior expert at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) in West Sussex , England , compiled data on over 4,500 African and Asian elephants over 45 years in European zoos and compared their life spans with the median life expectancy of elephants in preserves in their home countries .
( The median , rather than the average , is used to reduce the effects of extreme values at either end of the age spectrum that would skew the results . )
African elephants , they say , can expect to live 36 years in Kenya 's sprawling Amboseli National Park , more than double the 17 - year life span of zoo elephants .
It is not unusual for Asian elephants like Mac to make it to the ripe old age of 42 after having toiled in timber camps in Burma , but they can expect to live just 19 years in a zoo , according to the new study .
Overall , infant mortality in Asian elephants is as much as three times higher in zoos than in native protected areas .
The new results show that captive - born Asian elephants fare worse than wild - born elephants in zoos , suggesting that problems arise in gestation and early infancy .
The scientists say these endangered animals are compromised further by breeding programs that transfer animals between zoos .
Consequently , zoos are far from their long - promised goal of producing self - sustaining captive populations — and they clearly do not send animals back into the wild to bolster diminishing populations there .
" It 's hard for a female to produce lots of babies if she comes in at 10 and is dead by 25 , " says senior study author Georgia Mason , an animal behaviorist at the University of Guelph in Ontario .
The RSPCA has long called for phasing out zoo elephants by ending importation and breeding programs .
Mason , however , says she believes that importation could resume once zoos solve their alleged problems , although she notes her co-authors may disagree .
Despite the findings , zoo scientists deny their elephants fare poorly .
" The problem is the topic is very emotionally driven , " says conservation biologist Peter Leimgruber , an expert on wild Asian elephants at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington , D.C. " You can play numbers different ways just to make your point . "
Population biologist Robert Wiese , director of collections at the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park , who has criticized earlier RSPCA work on elephant life expectancy in zoos , said he had seen the findings but was reticent to comment on them .
" I can't say without really having the data sets they have , " he says .
Wiese says that the study , at best , is a reflection of the way zoos once were run and does not take into account animal - friendly changes that have been made , such as leaving offspring with their mothers longer periods of time .
" Most of the things zoo critics bring up about elephants were discovered by zoo people , " he says .
" Right now , we can assess how animals were cared for in the 1960s and 1970s .
It 's going to be a long period before we can tell how we 're doing today . "
The seven Asian elephants at the San Diego Zoo are all in their late 40s and 50s — well past their life expectancy of about 42 .
He says seven of the zoo 's eight adult African elephants were imported from the Mkhaya Game Reserve and Hlane Royal National Park in Swaziland in 2003 , where burgeoning elephant populations were set to be culled .
They are all about 17 years old today .
An additional African female elephant , Tembo , who previously appeared in the TV series Born Free , has been at the zoo for 20 years and is now probably 36 years old , according to a zoo spokesperson .
Wiese argues that zoos are important to provide visitors who may not otherwise have the opportunity to see wild animals up close and personal .
By doing so , he contends , they make a personal connection with , say , elephants , encouraging them to donate time and money to conservation projects in their home countries designed to protect them .
And life in the wild is not particularly idyllic compared with captivity :
Of 1,089 elephants in the Amboseli sample , 142 were killed by ritual spearing , gunshot wounds , or other mishaps .
Besides ,
Wiese notes , survivorship is not the only gauge of an animal 's quality of life , a point even Mason concedes .
" It 's not the case that life span is a clear - cut indicator , " she says .
" Maybe being overweight is absolutely wonderful .
You 're just living your life like Homer Simpson . "

An inquiry was under way today after a memory stick with user names and passwords for a key government computer system was discovered in a pub car park .
The Mail on Sunday said ministers had ordered the emergency shutdown of the Gateway website - which covers anything from tax returns to parking tickets - while experts checked to ensure people 's private details were not compromised .
The revelation came as the work and pensions secretary , James Purnell , apologised for accidentally leaving confidential government correspondence on a train .
The documents from Purnell 's ministerial " red box " were lost during a journey from Macclesfield to London 's Euston Station on October 4 , the Sunday Mirror reported .
The incidents were the latest embarrassment for the government in a long series of data mishandling mishaps , which began with the loss of the entire child benefit database .
Members of the public can register on Gateway to access hundreds of government services including self - assessment tax returns , pension entitlements and child benefits .
A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the memory stick contained data for " only a handful " of people , and all their passwords were encrypted .
" We are taking this issue extremely seriously and a full and urgent investigation is under way , " she said .
The spokeswoman added : " Our absolute priority is the security of data .
While there was a question mark over the data on the memory stick it was absolutely right to temporarily suspend the government Gateway .
" Having looked in detail at the stick we are satisfied neither the Gateway nor members of the public have seen their security compromised and the Gateway is online again . "
The memory stick was lost by employee of Atos Origin , which manages the Gateway system for the government .
It was found in the car park of the Orbital Pub in Cannock , Staffordshire , where the firm is based .
Atos said in a statement that it was clear that the employee had removed the memory stick from the company 's premises in " direct breach " of its operating procedures .
" The company takes the loss of this device very seriously and we are currently carrying out a full investigation of both the circumstances surrounding its loss and the data content of the stick , " the statement said .
" Atos Origin is working very closely with the government and the police .
The company takes full responsibility for this loss and will discipline the individual involved . "
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , said the loss of the data stick was " unacceptable behaviour " and indicated that companies which made such errors would miss out on future contracts .
" They will have to take responsibility , and there will have to be changes in the way these contracts are issued to companies that make mistakes like this , " he said during a visit to the Middle East .
A spokesman for Purnell , meanwhile , said the minister was " very sorry for the mistake " in leaving his documents on the train .
The papers - correspondence from MP Sir Gerald Kaufman relating to the case of one of his constituents - were returned three days later after fellow passengers picked them up .
The Federal Government has appointed men's health ambassadors to help develop Australia 's first men's health policy .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's partner , Tim Matheson , is one of the men taking on the role .
Health Minister Nicola Roxon says Australian men face serious health problems but many are reluctant to talk about them .
She says the health ambassadors will play an important role in bringing some of the problems out in the open .
" This is n't an appointment of a group of men who are health experts , with some notable exceptions , this is a group of men who are prepared and interested in leading their community , talking and engaging with men and making sure they are encouraging people to take care of their own health , " he said .
Mr Matheson says his old profession gives him a good background for the role .
" That space in a hairdressing salon for women and for men , they open up way better than if they 're in a psychologist 's or a psychiatrist 's or in a doctor 's or a GP's , " he said .
" It 's good , but we talk about the wrong things too often and we should be talking more about our health , and I think that 's starting . "
Why are there so few female Einsteins ?
Many people share a belief that while women can do science , there are far fewer women than men at the very top of the science hierarchy because women just are n’t as innately good at science as men .
Others feel this view is wrong but cannot easily put their finger on why .
They should be able to now .
There are few women at the top of science because there are so few women in science .
It ’s simple statistics .
The absence of women at the top in scientific endeavour is real .
There is not one woman in New Scientist ‘s list of scientific heroes for 2008 , for example .
And in chess , which is arguably as intellectually rigorous , there has never been a female champion , and fewer than 1 % of grandmasters are women .
But chess has something science does n’t : a clear ranking system based on performance in competitions from school age up .
Using the records of the German chess federation , Merim Bilalic of the University of Oxford and colleagues found that statistics can explain the absence of women at the top .
“ More extreme values are found in larger populations , ” she says .

Those rare exceptions
Individuals at the top are , by definition , rare .
In two groups with the same average performance and variability , the larger group is simply more likely to have more of these rare individuals , just because it is larger .
The greater the difference in group size , the greater the chance the bigger group will have more exceptional individuals .
To test this idea , Bilalic ’s team checked the records of the German chess federation – in which males outnumbered females 16 to one .
They found that the statistical effect of this difference in numbers accounted for 96 % of the observed difference in performance between the sexes .
“ There is little left for biological differences to explain , ” says Bilalic .
While statistics may explains the absence of females at the top , they do n’t explain why there are fewer females in the first place .
If this is due to any innate differences in chess ability between the sexes it would have to influence whether children start to play the game at all , because the dropout rates for girls and boys once they do start are similar .
Many other factors might keep girls from ever getting into chess , such as cultural expectations , the difficulty of breaking into an activity dominated by boys , or just having been told they ’re less good at it .
“ But you can no longer cite the greater number of men among the most successful people as evidence of innate differences until the effects of participation rates have been allowed for , ” says Bilalic .
In short , it ’s hardly surprising that there are so few women Einsteins when there are so few male ones – and so many more men are trying .

TOWN OF RIETBROCK , Wis. —
Two teenage girls have been cited for driving the same car after drinking while one of them sent a text message .
Marathon County sheriff ’s officials say the girls , 16 - and 17 - years - old , crashed the Pontiac Grand Am they were both driving in the Town of Rietbrock Saturday .
Deputies say the 16 - year - old driver was sending a text message while the 17 - year - old passenger steered the car .
They say both girls had been drinking alcohol .
The 17 - year - old Colby girl suffered a shoulder injury after the car rolled over .
The 16 - year - old Athens girl was not injured .
Hen harriers are being driven to extinction in England by illegal persecution on grouse moors , according to the Government 's wildlife watchdog .
The long - winged , long - tailed birds of prey are among the country 's rarest species .
Natural England says moorland owners and shooting managers are threatening the survival of the birds by illegally removing their eggs and burning their nests .
In one 12 - month period , six birds fitted with satellite transmitters were tracked as they flew from one of the hen harrier 's strongholds on Bowland Fells , Lancashire , into parts of the north Pennines managed as grouse moors .
They disappeared off the map .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The authors of Natural England 's study , A Future for the Hen Harrier in England ? , said that on several occasions , they have seen " masked and / or armed individuals " disturbing nest sites .
The study outlines six years of monitoring , largely in the Pennines , and provides " compelling evidence " of illegal hen harrier persecution in England .
The bird has become an " emblem of man 's callous disregard " for wildlife , according to Sir Martin Doughty , Natural England 's chairman .
" Hen harriers are being persecuted while they attempt to nest and birds are not returning to their breeding areas the following spring , " he said .
The only grouse moorland or game rearing area seeing rising hen harrier numbers is Bowland , where sympathetic landowners and gamekeepers work with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds .
In the past six years , the comparatively tiny area has accounted for more than two - thirds of all the 127 hen harrier breeding attempts recorded by Natural England .
" Throughout the rest of England , only 19 breeding attempts were recorded on grouse moors , in spite of the suitability of the habitat , " the agency reported .
" Persecution is the reason for the systematic disruption of hen harrier breeding attempts in areas that provide extensive and very suitable habitat . "
The hen harrier became extinct in the Victorian era but recolonised Scotland in the interwar years .
They began returning to England in the 1970s .
there are now about 800 breeding pairs in the UK and Isle of Man , with 630 of those in Scotland .
Natural England is considering re-introducing hen harriers to the lowland part of its former range to see if the birds have better breeding success .
Edward Bromet , chairman of the Moorland Association , which represents grouse moor owners in England and Wales , said his organisation would not support anyone who persecutes the birds .
He said : " We are working very hard with them [ Natural England ] to find a solution to the conservation status of hen harriers . "
A North Brunswick man remained in critical condition today after the hot - air balloon he was piloting burst into flames , forcing him and another man to jump 65 feet to the ground during Albuquerque , N.M. 's annual balloon fiesta on Friday .
Keith Sproul , 49 , is being treated at the University of New Mexico Hospital , according to Sam Giammo , spokesman for the hospital .
His passenger , Stephen Lachendro of Butler , Pa. was killed in the leap .
The accident happened in Bernalillo , N.M. , after Sproul was apparently trying to slow down as winds picked up .
But the balloon hit a power line and erupted into a blaze , said Howard Freeman , executive producer of the annual Quick Chek New Jersey Festival of Ballooning in Readington , who has been in contact with pilots at the festival .
They have reported to Freeman that Sproul suffered multiple broken bones and burns .
Lachendro 's body had extensive burns as well .
Sproul 's balloon , in the shape of a tetrahedron -- an upside down pyramid , was among hundreds participating in Friday 's events at the balloon fiesta , which ends today .
Sproul , a longtime balloon enthusiast , designed and made the balloon , according to his website .
Watch the videos from the Albuquerque Journal and KRQE television in New Mexico
Sproul , who works at Rutgers University 's Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences , had a very technical mind , Freeman said .
He was into computers , gadgets , ham radios , and the technical aspects of ballooning .
" He 's a very interesting person .
A fascinating person , " said Freeman , who knows Sproul through his activities on behalf of the Quick Chek New Jersey Festival .
For the annual summer gathering in Hunterdon County , Sproul provided computerized weather readings for fellow pilots , Freeman said .
He is so well - liked , that the tailgate area for pilots is called Sproul - ville .
A woman who described herself as Sproul 's mother - in - law declined to comment on the incident .
Efforts to reach other family members were unsuccessful .
Sproul 's passenger , Lachendro , was the father of three children .
He worked in Ohio's Youngstown - Warren Air Reserve Station in the medical division .
Kathie Leyendecker , a spokeswoman for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta , could not be reached for comment yesterday .
The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Traditional retailers are facing the same problem , of course , and discounts are proliferating from suburban malls to Fifth Avenue .
But the price - cutting is fiercest on the Web , where customers can easily shop for the best price with a quick search on Google or on specialized shopping engines like Shopping.com .
Online , the competition is only a click away .
For many
Web sites , the discounts and price cuts are the only way to hold on to customers as online buying unexpectedly plummets .
The research firm comScore reported Tuesday that sales growth on e-commerce sites slowed to a meager 1 percent in October compared with the previous year  the lowest rate ever for online retail and well down from the industry ’s typical 20 percent gains .
Sales of music , movies , books , computer software , flowers and gifts have been hit the hardest , with double - digit declines , comScore said .
“ A lot of these retailers are n’t running on big margins to begin with , so it ’s pretty challenging , ” said Gian Fulgoni , chairman of comScore .
“ But it ’s a Catch - 22 situation :
They have to run these deals because that ’s what consumers are looking for this season . ”
To preserve the sanctity of their brands and some level of pricing control , some Web companies are promoting discount sites separately from their main brands .
Zappos.com , a shoe retailer based in Henderson , Nev. , never runs promotions on its site .
Instead , it quietly moves shoes that do not sell in six months to 6 pm.com , a clearance site it acquired last year , but runs separately .
This month , the company is buying more search ads for 6 pm.com , where a pair of colorful slip - on Keds sneakers is on sale for $ 12.73  74 percent off the original price on Zappos.com .
Even when these extreme discounts mean selling shoes for less than Zappos.com paid for them , it is better to recoup some cash than none , said Tony Hsieh , the company ’s chief executive .
The discounting is not just drastic , but is also occurring unusually early in the season .
Kmart , a division of Sears Holding , initiated Black Friday prices on electronics  40 to 50 percent off  on Nov. 2 , nearly four weeks before the real Black Friday , the busy shopping day just after Thanksgiving that usually marks the beginning of the holiday buying season .

The limits imposed by walls and trenches are recognized by special brain cells .
Rats have neurons devoted to sensing the physical limits of their surroundings .
R. Skjerpeng
A newly discovered class of neurons allows rats to identify the borders of their surroundings and helps them to build mental maps .
These neurons , called border cells , join three other known classes of neurons that help us to find our way through space : place cells fire when we pass through fixed locations , letting us know where we are ; head - direction cells fire when we face particular directions , acting as a compass ; and grid cells fire when we 're at specific points on a hexagonal grid that the brain superimposes on our surroundings .
Neuroscientist Edvard Moser from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim and his colleagues first came across border cells in the entorhinal cortex of rat brains1 .
While recording the activity from single neurons , the team kept finding neurons that were linked to mental maps but that did n't act like any of the three known classes of mapping neurons .
" We ignored them in the beginning , " says Moser .
Later , however , the researchers realized that they might have found border cells , a theoretically predicted2 class of neurons .
Thinking inside the box
Moser and his colleagues refocused their attention on how these neurons reacted as rats ran around small rooms .
They found that the border cells would fire when rats approached walls — generally , each border cell was linked with a single wall , but some cells responded to several borders .
When the team extended the walls of the room , the neurons associated with a particular wall fired as the rat approached any point along it , showing that the cells were responding to the whole border , rather than to a localized area .
And when the walls were replaced with vertical drops , the neurons reacted in the same way , showing that it was borders , rather than walls , that triggered neuronal activity .
" They really respond to borders , and apparently nothing other than that , " says Moser .
" These border cells give you some sense of the structure of [ your surroundings ] — how big that space is , " says Jeffrey Taube , a neuroscientist at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire .
Modelling mental maps
Neil Burgess of University College London , one of the scientists who originally proposed that border cells should exist , is happy to see his predictions proven correct .
" I think most people ignored my model , " he says .
The next step , Burgess and Moser agree , is to determine how the four classes of neurons work together to create the mental maps that let animals know where they are .
Moser suspects , for instance , that the border cells somehow align the grid cells to the appropriate borders of the environment .
And , he suggests that border cells are particularly important for helping rats to plan routes .
Crucially , findings about the neurons involved in mental mapping are not limited to rats .
Researchers have found place cells in humans , grid cells in mice and head - direction cells in mice , chinchillas and monkeys .
" I am completely convinced that [ border ] cells also exist in higher mammals , including humans , " Moser says .
Luck and location
Just a few years ago , Moser surprised members of the cognitive - mapping field with his unanticipated discovery and description of grid cells .

Moser puts his success down to luck and to looking in the right place — the entorhinal cortex .
This part of the brain provides the main input into the brain 's hippocampus and , as we now know , plays host to head - direction , grid and border cells .
" It is an area that has really been under - explored , " he says .
Others are now taking note , however .
" He 's come up with some pretty interesting findings , " says Taube .
" My first impression [ when I read this paper ] was ' What will this group find next ? ' " .
[ darcs-users ] darcs roadmap proposal
Hi everybody ,
We are now mostly caught up with the sprint work in the darcs unstable branch ( Reinier and Benedikt 's work still need to be reviewed and sent respectively ) , so I think it would be a good idea for us to set our priorities straight for the next year .
* 2009 -11-15 GHC 6.10 support darcs 2.1.1 * 2009 - 11-30 build systems , libdarcs darcs 2.1.2 * 2009 -01-15 performance and Windows darcs 2.2 * 2009 -07-15 performance and transplant darcs 2.3 darcs 2.1.1 ( 2009 - 11 - 15 ) the GHC 6.10.1 release
----------------------------------------------
I would like to see darcs released that compiles on GHC 6.10.1 very soon now .
The safest bet would just be to tweak the current Makefile and configure scripts accordingly .
I will continue acting as the Release Manager for this short - term release .
We will going with a very short release cycle , one release candidate and the formal release , as we expect to have no changes to the actual code .
darcs 2.1.2 ( 2009 - 11-30 ) , Cabal , libdarcs 0.0.1
-----------------------------------------------
I propose that we continue the 2.1 series with two more superficial changes .
The first is to make the Cabal - oriented build system as a supported build system alongside the current makefile ( * ) .
Without David at the helm , it becomes more urgent for us to enter into a tighter orbit with the Haskell community .
The message we want to send is " we need your help , and we will trust you to make the right decision on things which we are not experts on . "
This means adopting a lot of new standard Haskell practices and making more use of external libraries where it is safe to do so .
Note that the technical differences between franchise and Cabal are not the main emphasis of this switch -- more on this in a later message .
Both franchise and Cabal are meant to achieve the goal of making darcs easier to build on Windows ( and elsewhere ) , both us have good ways of doing this ( with pros and cons , which I shall detail later ) ; but one of the approaches has strong community support , and it is the one we will be going with .
The second change is to make a very volatile and provisional libdarcs 0.0.1 available .
This consists simply of rewriting a few fields in the Cabal file ( and possibly creating a lightweight Cabal file for just the darcs executable ) .
The purpose of this action is ( 1 ) to make a formal commitment to working towards a proper libdarcs ( 2 ) to begin supporting third party tools and encourage their developers to work more closely with us .
The caveat is that because we have not worked out a reasonable API to libdarcs , it should be considered both highly unsafe -- it eats kittens -- and highly volatile -- it shall be eating kittens with potentially a radically different API upon each release .
I think this is acceptable as long as we make great pains to know what they are getting into .
(*)
It may be wise for us to keep the makefile and configure around for at least one more major release ; we can revisit this in a later thread .
darcs 2.2 ( 2009 -01 - 15 ) performance and Windows support
------------------------------------------------------
This will be the first darcs to be released under our time - based schedule and with Jason Dagit taking over as release manager .
It will include some of the work we have done during the darcs hacking sprint , basically some low - level optimisations and tuning of our data structures to improve performance .
I also hope to see Benedikt 's filecache to make darcs annotate more usable in largish repositories , and Petr 's continued improvements to kill the darcs repair performance regression that darcs 2.1 introduced .
There are also a couple of important conflict - handling bugs that we uncovered during the hacking sprint , notably * http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1198 * http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1204
Both of these are cases of darcs crashing in the presence of a complicated conflict ( it 's a good thing darcs 2 has fully atomic operations ! ) .
I suspect that these are " just " bugs and are relatively easy to solve .
So I think we should aim to have these fixes in along with our Windows and performance work .
darcs 2.3 ( 2009 -07 - 15 ) performance and darcs transplant
-------------------------------------------------------
I'm sure we will continue to hack on performance after darcs 2.2 is out , but I think it may be wise for us to shift the focus away from it a little and get back to our core darcs work .
One major command that we should start thinking about is darcs transplant .
We do n't yet have a very clear picture exactly what this command should do , but we do have an idea that it should help people to ( a ) revise long feature branches ( b ) recover from sins past or previous darcs corruption .
Basically , if you have been longing for a way to amend or regroup a set of patches that are dependeded on by other patches , darcs transplant may be what you are looking for .
* http://bugs.darcs.net/issue938
The idea is that while darcs commutation is most excellent , there are times when it does not do everything we want The future ----------
There are some other long terms tasks I think we should undertake .
I 'll just list them here * the DarcsLibraries project - spinning off as much of darcs code as possible into standalone libraries ( pre-existing or otherwise ) * patch theory improvements - Ian is working on further refinements to patch theory ... these may become darcs 3 in the far future * improved conflict marking -
This is something I , and many darcs users are longing for , though it will probably have to wait until Ian 's work is complete * stable libdarcs
That 's all !
-----------
Keep in mind that these are just my personal objectives .

The Fed said it wanted to be more transparent .
Okaaaay , then what the heck is going on ?
Go Bloomberg News !
ABC News : Bloomberg News today filed a lawsuit to force the U.S. government -- specifically the Federal Reserve -- to disclosure which securities it is accepting as collateral for $ 1.5 trillion of loans to banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
( This does n’t include the $ 700 billion bailout package ) .
The document Bloomberg LP vs. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System can be perused HERE .
On May 21 , Bloomberg asked the Fed to disclose the collateral .
As Bloomberg News reports , the Fed said " on June 19 that it needed until July 3 to search out the documents and determine whether it would make them public .
Bloomberg never received a formal response that would enable it to file an appeal .
On Oct. 25 , Bloomberg filed another request and has yet to receive a reply .
" The American taxpayer is entitled to know the risks , costs and methodology associated with the unprecedented government bailout of the U.S. financial industry , '' said Matthew Winkler , the editor - in - chief of Bloomberg News .
In this New York Times commentary by Peter Goodman , you get a couple more metaphors for the ongoing economic crisis and the stimulative responses by government - one good , one bad - along with about as good a rationalization as you are likely to hear for why contemporary economics is unique in the world in that , to borrow a phrase from the world of medicine , the cause and the cure for an illness are one - and - the - same .
many economists have concluded that the appropriate medicine is a fresh dose of the very course that delivered the disarray : Spend without limit .
“ We got into this mess to a considerable extent by overborrowing , ” said Martin N. Baily , a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ Now , we ’re saying , ‘ Well , O.K. , let ’s just borrow a bunch more , and that will help us get out of this mess . ’
It ’s like a drunk who says , ‘ Give me a bottle of Scotch , and then I ’ll be O.K. and I wo n’t have to drink anymore . ’
Eventually , we have to get off this binge of borrowing . ”
Some argue that the moment for sobriety is long overdue , and postponing it further only increases the ultimate costs .
“ Our government does n’t have enough spare cash to bail out a lemonade stand , ” declared Peter Schiff president of Euro Pacific Capital , a Connecticut - based trading house .
“ Our standard of living must decline to reflect years of reckless consumption and the disintegration of our industrial base .
Only by swallowing this tough medicine now will our sick economy ever recover . ”
always
But most economists cast such thinking as recklessly extreme , akin to putting an obese person on a painful diet in the name of long - term health just as they are fighting off a potentially lethal infection .
In the dominant view , now is no time for austerity — not with paychecks disappearing from the economy and gyrating markets wiping out retirement savings .
Not with the financial system in virtual lockdown , and much of the world in a similar state of retrenchment , shrinking demand for American goods and services .
Since the Great Depression , the conventional prescription for such times is to have the government step in and create demand by cycling its dollars through the economy , generating jobs and business opportunities .
That such dollars must be borrowed is hardly ideal , adding to the long - term strains on the nation .
But the immediate risks of not spending them could be grave .
really is
“ This is a dangerous situation , ” says Mr. Baily , essentially arguing that the drunk must be kept in Scotch a while longer , lest he burn down the neighborhood in the midst of a crisis .
“ The risks of things actually getting worse and us going into a really severe recession are high .
We need to get more money out there now . ”
really do
How can more easy money be the solution to the problems caused by too much easy money ?
That question must have been asked a hundred times here over the last year .
On to the metaphors - first the good one :
Oh , there 's Peter again - he 's everywhere these days ... A lower standard of living is a pretty tough to sell for politicians - at least for those who are seeking another term in office , which , as I understand it , is job one for most elected officials .
That would be quite remarkable though , would n't it ?
If , at his inauguration , Barack Obama calls for a collective acceptance of our declining standard of living as part of our new role in the global economy .
Nah .
Change like that would be a bit much .
' Tis better to stick with what hasworked in the past - the bad metaphor - the economy as a sick patient rather than someone with a serious drinking problem .
Ultimately , the drunk metaphor is much more convincing , but even Mr. Baily comes around to the view that maybe more alcoholthe best course of action :
Yes , weneed more money out there now .
We 'll set about fixing things the next time around - after the current crisis has passed , when the drunk is back on his feet again .

The Raw Story , by Roger McLemore
This story is a horrifying example of out of control police officers …
As the girl , Dymond Milburn [ age 12 ] , walked in her front yard , three men jumped out of a van and beat her about the face and throat , one of them telling her , “ You ’re a prostitute .
You ’re coming with me . ”
What would any 12 year old girl do when three men jump out of a van and try to drag her away ?
That ’s right — she ’d fight with all her might !
Three weeks after Milburn was hospitalized for her injuries , police went to her school and arrested her for assaulting an officer during the incident .
Yes , this little girl fights to defend herself from three men trying to grab her and stuff her into a van , and she winds up being arrested for it .
Dymond now suffers with nightmares , behavior problems , and post - traumatic stress disorder .
Milburn ’s father had also been arrested for attacking the officers after his daughter called for him when the police attacked her .
[ The officers ’ attorney , William ]
Helfand said both would face consequences for their actions .
Give me a fucking break .
Dymond Milburn , a 12 year old girl , mightily fights off what surely must have seemed to be a kidnapping attempt , and her father comes to her rescue — and THEY are the ones facing criminal charges !?
“ It ’s unfortunate that sometimes police officers have to use force against people who are using force against them .
And the evidence will show that both these folks violated the law and forcefully resisted arrest , ” Helfand said .
What kind of world are we living in ?
I hope the Milburn family gets every dime they ’re asking for in their lawsuit against the city of Galveston , Texas .

The OpenCL working group , formed under the auspices of the Khronos Group to implement Apple 's proposed Open Computing Language , has nailed down a complete specification for OpenCL in just six months .
The announcement of the completion of the spec came at this year 's Supercomputing Conference in Austin , Texas , this past Monday .
OpenCL was proposed so that programmers could write software in a way that would allow computing tasks to be best handled by whatever hardware resources are available to a given machine .
In many of today 's computers , that means multiple multicore processors , as well as multicore graphics processors , and sometimes specialized DSPs or other processors .
" Highly - accelerated parallel computation across GPUs and CPUs is essential to many emerging rich consumer applications that will transform the computing experience of diverse users , " said Khronos Group president Neil Trevett at the time the working group was formed .
In addition to Trevett , who also works for NVIDIA , Intel 's Tim Mattson and AMD 's Ben Gaster where on hand to present details of the group 's work .
But it was n't easy to meet the tight deadline Apple set to include the technology in the next release of Mac OS X , which may ship as early as the first quarter next year .
" If you go to some other larger standards bodies , it 's quite normal for a standard to take five years or more , " Trevett told Macworld .
" You actually have to really push to get it down to 18 months .
Our record was 12 months up to now ; we 've done this one in six . "
" [ W]e have , you know , divorced our families , we 've had two phone meetings a week , face - to - face meetings and I can't count how many hours I 've spent , " said Mattson .
" I 'm just almost dead , I 'm so exhausted .
So , I 'm really proud of what we pulled off . "
But the work is n't done just yet .
Though OpenCL has been defined from a technical standpoint , the spec still has to be vetted by all 20 of the companies involved in the working group , ensuring there are no problems with trademarks , copyrights , patents , or other issues .
Until that time , the working group cannot release the specs publicly or give any demos .
However , Mac users may be the first to get to see the effects of OpenCL with the release of Snow Leopard .
" If Apple ends up following through on the plans they stated on building this specification into Snow Leopard , I think you could see opportunity for imaging applications vendors , video application vendors to tap into the goodness of GPU hardware , " Trevett told Macworld .
" Everyone has a supercomputer locked away in their Mac , but it 's hard to get at it .
And OpenCL will unlock the potential of that supercomputer . "
" The whole point of OpenCL is that it really does n't matter what the underlying hardware is , " Trevett said .
" If it 's programmable , OpenCL will let you tap into it . "
Als donor voor een kitcar is de 2CV onovertroffen ..
Wim van den Bergh | Citroën 2CV
Opgesteld op 11-11-2008 | Wijziging op 27-02-2014 20:36
Als donor voor een kitcar is de 2CV onovertroffen vanwege zijn platform - chassis , waaraan motor , versnellingbak en assen zijn bevestigd .
Je kunt volledig zonder koetswerk rondrijden .
Dus is de opbouw eigenlijk slechts " Aufschmuck " , zoals de oosterburen zeggen .
Er zijn in Nederland een aantal leveranciers van koetswerken die op het 2CV chassis passen onder de merknamen Le Patron , Cygnus , Lomax , Burton , Voglietta en Deauville .
Mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar een Le Patron , omdat dit model met klassieke boattail ook als driewieler leverbaar is .
Een zeldzame verschijning op de Nederlandse wegen die geleverd wordt met RDW typegoedgekeurde driewieler achterarm constructie .
De overige kits worden als vierwielige modellen verkocht .
De meeste mensen kennen alleen de mr .
Bean driewieler die steeds omvalt in de bocht .
Een Le Patron 3 ligt als een blok op de weg met voorwielaandrijving , alle gewicht voorin en een laag zwaartepunt .
De ombouw van mijn vierwielige Patron naar een driewielig model is gereed .
Hij is dan na 8 jaar als " normale " auto rond te hebben gereden eindelijk weer de perfecte hobbywagen voor mij .
Inmiddels hebben we samen Westelijk Europa weer behoorlijk verkend .
De driewieler is in de UK vreselijk populair omdat ie daar in het gunstigste belasting tarief valt .
In Nederland is ie mateloos onpopulair en daarom in mijn ogen veel unieker dan het gros van de kitcars alhier .
Zo'n Patron driewieler rijdt als een motorfiets : waar je voorwiel langskan volgt je achterkant moeiteloos .
Strak te sturen dus .
Stoepranden pakken met je achterwieltje in een bocht is er echt niet bij .
Een optimale kruising tussen Citroen 2CV ( vering , techniek , onderhoudskosten ) , klassieke sportwagen ( tweezits en geen dak ) en motorfiets ( strak sturen en prima wegligging ) .
Reports that portray Clinton as willing to accept the job – once the Obama transition team vets the Clintons – are inaccurate , one Clinton insider told Politico .
Hillary might reject State offer
Hillary Rodham Clinton is n’t certain she would accept the Secretary of State post even if Barack Obama offers it to her , several people close to the former first lady say .
Press reports that portray Clinton as willing to accept the job – once the Obama transition team vets Bill Clinton ’s philanthropic and business ventures – are inaccurate , one Clinton insider told Politico .
Advertisement
“ A lot of the speculation and reporting is out ahead of the facts here , ” said the person , who requested anonymity .
“ She is still weighing this , independent of President Clinton 's work . ”
Clinton , the person said , remains deeply “ torn ” between the possibility of serving in Obama ’s cabinet and remaining in the Senate to “ help pass health care and work on a broad range of domestic issues . ”
That comment jibes with what others close to Clinton have been saying since the Secretary of State chatter began last week : that Clinton is conflicted and the deal far from done , despite screaming headlines in outlets including the U.K. ’s Guardian newspaper claiming the offer was made and accepted .
Most of the speculation about Clinton ’s frame of mind in the last few days has been off - base , sources say , because she ’s played her cards close to the vest , consulting only her husband and two or three kitchen cabinet advisers .
“ We ’ve gotten rid of all the other idiots , ” joked one Clinton confidant , a reference to the Clinton campaign ’s propensity for leaks .
The Clinton camp ’s effort to downplay her interest in the post might simply reflect her need to create an alternative storyline if the deal falls apart for other reasons , including the possibility that insurmountable problems arise during the vetting process , Democrats not connected with Clinton cautioned .
Another possible motivation : Pushing back against the perception that she ’s at the mercy of Obama ’s team .
“ Everybody wants to be perceived as being in the driver ’s seat , ” said a top Democratic official .
“ She ’s no different . ”
Obama is n’t likely to make a formal offer of the post to Clinton unless he ’s given assurances that Bill Clinton ’s global charitable foundation wo n’t create future conflicts of interest with foreign governments .
The Clinton Foundation has earned praise for its efforts to eradicate AIDS , malaria and poverty in Africa .
But it could prove problematic if the former president continues to arrange donations from foreign countries at the same time that his wife serves as secretary of state .
Obama ’s vetting team expressed similar concerns about Bill Clinton ’s overseas fundraising when Hillary Clinton was briefly considered for the vice - presidency .

When my roommate found her on the streets , she was malnourished and skittish and had heart worms .
You know , I 've read more and more stories about pets being abandoned lately because of the economy .
I recently got back from a gay wedding in California where one of the grooms had just rescued a Papillon he found starving in a ditch .
He was neurotic and defensive for like the first few days , but now a week later he has settled in , and is doing great .
And the Papillon 's doing well , too .
But this pendulously mammaried cur - Elzora , my roommate calls her , though you might as well be meowing at her , because she does n't know the difference - she is not like that .
Not. Like .
That .
At. All .
This is not the precious , precocious Papillon someone rescues from a ditch .
This is the miserable , ugly bitch ( I use the term technically ) that you make a little scrunchy - face at while glancing at it askance ... before calling fricking Animal Control .
Roomie , who seriously must have a heart the size of the state , felt sorry for her and took her in and he fed her and took her to the vet .
Roomie and I are poor , but he treated her heart worms , got her shots , etc. , all with the idea that eventually he was going to put her up for adoption here or take her to a no- kill shelter .
( Roomie is also , evidently , a dreamer . )
But then she 's got behavior problems ( which I 'm getting to ... ) , and is as ugly as a dead frog squashed by a semi ( which I 'm also getting to ... ) , and has health issues likely stemming from past abuse ( which oh boy , I 'm getting to ... ) .
Elzora , or " Mama Dog , " as she is more frequently called , is supposedly an Australian Kelpie ( according to the vet ) though she looks to me like she 's got some Doberman in her .
But ironically , Kelpies are renown for their agility .
Mama
Dog is supposedly around 2 years old , but is as agile as a drunk granny on crack .
( UPDATE :
The hive mind consensus is that she is more Dobie than Kelpie . )
If you want to know what she looks like , she 's a dead ringer for the Capitoline Wolf .
Look it up on Wikipedia while the article is still accurate .
So Elzora would be great if you had two infants , for example , that you wanted to abandon in the woods only to have them found Western Civilization .
Without the two little baby statues beneath her , though , I have to say that the first thing you notice about Mama Dog is : nipples .
Obscenely large nipples .
We think she was probably used for breeding or something because there 's really no other explanation .
I 'm not being cruel , I 'm just saying .
Because there 's one nipple in particular that is really disturbing .
The rest you could maybe overlook .
But she has this one nipple that hangs really low , and it's fat , but then it gets really skinny , and then it gets fat again .
It 's like it 's just barely hanging on , though it 's not , and evidently there 's nothing ' wrong ' with it except how it looks .
But man , that nipple is unsettling .
Having been used for breeding might also explain the issue with her hind legs .
When she lies down , it 's normally with her legs fully extended , off to the side .
And she walks funny , like her back legs do n't bend that well .
The vet did n't say anything about it and she does n't appear to be in any pain , so it may have come from being raised cramped up in a cage , or from always being lying down , nursing puppies , or maybe from giving birth so many times : who knows .
She does n't really run unless she sees a squirrel , but even then it 's kind of limpy - gimpy .
She loves to play with tennis balls , but because of the past abuse to her rear legs , she just kind of lamely bats them around in front of herself with her front paws .
It 's endearing in a sad way .
I do n't know : maybe she 'd make a good pet for someone who wanted to teach their children that life is cruel and unfair and that people sometimes mistreat animals .
That 's not what I 'd want to teach my kids , but who 's to judge ?
Anyhow ... Kelpie , yes ... but the whole Agile Kelpie thing : Just Not Happening .
Finally , there 's her temperament .
She 's loving and protective of her humans .
Maybe a little too protective , as she can growl at strangers .
But put her with a dog that 's slightly larger than her and she goes nuts .
Like , foaming at the frickin ' mouth nuts .
She probably would not be a good Dog Park dog , though we 've never tried it .
On the other hand , she would likely provide excellent protection from zombies .
One of my dogs , Chloe , is slightly larger than Elzora and Elzora hounds her constantly .
She stares her down , incessantly circles her - she seriously will not leave Chloe alone .
Again , maybe due to past abuse or her previous environment , I think Elzora feels like she has to establish herself as alpha dog for reasons of survival .
But she 's hindered because due to her hips she cannot engage in typical dominance behavior ( mounting - yes , even females do it ) .
So she growls and will attempt to corral the dog that intimidates her .
If you try to stop her or get her to leave the other dog alone , she will start foaming at the mouth .
Seriously .
Eventually , Elzora goads the other dog enough that they will fight .
She can't win because she 's disabled , but she 100 % will not listen and will not back down .
She does n't seem to be threatened by smaller dogs ... but she would probably be best in a one - dog household .
On the positive side , she does appear to be house trained and gets along well with cats .
And again , there 's the thing with zombies .
But okay , seriously , if somebody does n't take her off of Craigslist , then she 's going to the pound , where it 's guaranteed euthanasia .
My roommate wanted to write a " nice " ad for her , but he 's out of town , and frankly , he kept putting it off and putting it off because he probably could n't think of anything nice to say about her either .
He gave me the go - ahead to post an ad and if nobody responds , to drop her off at the pound .
PLEASE do n't write any sanctimonious responses about all the things we really should do for this dog .
My roommate 's on disability and I 've just moved to town and have yet to find a steady job - I 'm doing landscape work currently , and the damn dog 's not mine to begin with .
But neither of us has the time or money for aggression training or cosmetic nipple surgery or anything else .
Simply put , her time here is done and her only hope for a solution now is you .
Do n't write me with suggestions .
Come get her and implement them yourself .

Dina said she first dreamed of starting a band three years ago .
In September , she and her sister Dareen , 19 , who plays bass , teamed up with Lamia and Amjad , the keyboardist .
They were already iconoclasts : Dina and Dareen wear their hair teased into thick manes and have pierced eyebrows .
During an interview at a Starbucks here , they wore black abayas  the flowing gown that is standard attire for women  but the gowns were open , showing their jeans and T - shirts , and their hair and faces were uncovered .
Women are more apt to go uncovered in Jidda than in most other parts of the country , though it is still uncommon .
“ People always stare at us , ” Dareen said , giggling .
She and her sister are also avid ice skaters , another unusual habit in Saudi Arabia ’s desert .
The band gets together to practice every weekend at the sisters ’ house , where their younger brother sometimes fills in on drums .
In early November , Dina , who studies art at King Abdulaziz University , began writing a song based on one of her favorite paintings , “ The Accolade , ” by the English pre-Raphaelite painter Edmund Blair Leighton .
The painting depicts a long - haired noblewoman knighting a young warrior with a sword .
“ I liked the painting because it shows a woman who is satisfied with a man , ” Dina said .
She had thought of writing a song based on “ Last Supper ” by Leonardo da Vinci but decided that doing so would be taking controversy too far .
In Saudi Arabia , churches are not allowed , and Muslims who convert to Christianity can be executed .
Dina held out her cellphone to show a video of the band practicing at home .
It looked like a garage - band jam session anywhere in the world , with the sisters hunching over their instruments , their brother blasting away at the drums and Lamia clutching a microphone .
“ We ’re looking for a drummer , ” Lamia said .
“ Five guys have offered , but we really want the band to be all female . ”
On Thursday evening , Dana Perino , deputy White House press secretary , said : " Since immediately following 9/11 , the American government has taken every legal measure to prevent another attack on our country .
One of the most important tools in the fight against terror is our ability to choke off funds for the terrorists . "
She added : " We know the terrorists pay attention to our strategy to fight them , and now have another piece of the puzzle of how we are fighting them .
We also know they adapt their methods , which increases the challenge to our intelligence and law enforcement officials . "
Referring to the disclosure by The New York Times last December of the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program , she said , " The president is concerned that once again The New York Times has chosen to expose a classified program that is working to protect our citizens . "
Swift declined to discuss details of the program but defended its role in written responses to questions .
" Swift has fully complied with all applicable laws , " the consortium said .
The organization said it insisted that the data be used only for terrorism investigations and had narrowed the scope of the information provided to American officials over time .
A Crucial Gatekeeper
Swift 's database provides a rich hunting ground for government investigators .
Swift is a crucial gatekeeper , providing electronic instructions on how to transfer money among 7,800 financial institutions worldwide .
The cooperative is owned by more than 2,200 organizations , and virtually every major commercial bank , as well as brokerage houses , fund managers and stock exchanges , uses its services .
Swift routes more than 11 million transactions each day , most of them across borders .
The cooperative 's message traffic allows investigators , for example , to track money from the Saudi bank account of a suspected terrorist to a mosque in New York .
Starting with tips from intelligence reports about specific targets , agents search the database in what one official described as a " 24 - 7 " operation .
Customers ' names , bank account numbers and other identifying information can be retrieved , the officials said .
Image Data provided by the program helped identify Uzair Paracha , a Brooklyn man who was convicted on terrorism - related charges in 2005 , officials said .
The data does not allow the government to track routine financial activity , like A.T.M. withdrawals , confined to this country , or to see bank balances , Treasury officials said .
And the information is not provided in real time —
Swift generally turns it over several weeks later .
Because of privacy concerns and the potential for abuse , the government sought the data only for terrorism investigations and prohibited its use for tax fraud , drug trafficking or other inquiries , the officials said .

Fox Fur , a Unicorn , and a Christmas Tree
Credit & Copyright : R Jay Gabany
Explanation : Clouds of glowing hydrogen gas fill this colorful skyscape in the faint but fanciful constellation Monoceros , the Unicorn .
A star forming region cataloged as NGC 2264 , the complex jumble of cosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light - years distant and mixes reddish emission nebulae excited by energetic light from newborn stars with dark interstellar dust clouds .
Where the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie close to the hot , young stars they also reflect starlight , forming blue reflection nebulae .
The wide mosaic spans about 3 / 4 degree or nearly 1.5 full moons , covering 40 light - years at the distance of NGC 2264 .
Its cast of cosmic characters includes the the Fox Fur Nebula , whose convoluted pelt lies at the upper left , bright variable star S Mon immersed in the blue - tinted haze just below the Fox Fur , and the Cone Nebula at the far right .
Of course , the stars of NGC 2264 are also known as the Christmas Tree star cluster .
The triangular tree shape traced by the stars appears sideways here , with its apex at the Cone Nebula and its broader base centered near S Mon .

StopTheMormons.com today issued a statement to lend its support to the LDS church in its efforts to establish its religion in the Kyrgyz Republic .
Darin Weeks , founder of StopTheMormons.com said , “ While the Lesbian and Gay community is outraged that the Mormon church played such a significant role in singling out our community for different treatment under California law , we feel that all laws or regulations that unfairly single out any group for different treatment are wrong .
As such , we urge the Kyrgyz Republic to put fear aside and allow the Mormon church to establish itself in their country . ”
Weeks was raised in the Mormon church and was born in Logan , UT .
He resigned his membership in the church following the passage of Proposition 8 in California , and founded StopTheMormons.com to protest the massive involvement of the LDS church in the initiative .
The account of his resignation can be found on his site .
“ We are not anti-Mormon , we are pro-liberty , ” said Weeks , alluding to LDS Elder Clayton Whitney ’s frequent statement during the Proposition 8 campaign that the church was not anti-gay , but rather pro-marriage .
“ This includes the liberty of worshiping the religion of ones choosing . ”
Weeks feels that government and law should not favor any group over another without compelling reasons .
“ Fear alone of the LDS church or the establishment of peaceful religions should not guide the nation of Kyrgyzstan on this matter , nor should the fact that the Mormon religion has not played a part in the nations traditional definition of religion . ”
“ We hope that the LDS church and its members can understand that we respect their right to their opinions and moral views , ” said Weeks , “ however we strongly oppose any laws that unfairly deny to some the rights or privileges enjoyed by others . ”

5 million $ 10,000 deposits on electric cars = $ 50 billion
As the age of oil ends we have stopped buying the cars that Detroit makes ; so now they do n’t have the money to adapt to build the more fuel efficient vehicles that we do need .
[ social_buttons ]
Production of near - term solutions , such as the Chevy Volt ; which had been on track for 2010 and which could have driven us out of the age of oil –is endangered .
So – an interesting solution that CalCars founder Felix Kramer has proposed would be a way to generate $ 50 billion for the auto industry and just get us the low carbon driving options America needs , despite the footdragging ;
Put together 5 million deposits on EVs and PHEV orders at $ 10,000 each .
Give the $ 50 billion that that would generate to automakers to build the orders .
Refund $ 7,500 to the buyers within a year via the EV tax credits passed in October .
Allow orders placed up till next April to count towards the 2008 tax year for tax credits .
Between public and private organisations ; fleet buyers could account for nearly a million orders alone .
Private fleet orders would come from car share and taxi companies and universities .
Some construction companies are already paying to convert truck fleets to electric .
The Federal government alone buys 750,000 cars a year .
There is pent - up demand for the post oil age vehicles .
The genius of the CalCars plan is that it addresses that demand , and utilizes its force in a judo – like move .
WHY ARE CAR SALES FALLING ?
Not just because of the economic crisis .
The more Americans hear that better cars are on the way , the more individuals and fleets will be reluctant to commit to inefficient vehicles whose resale value may fall quickly because they run only on price - volatile , polluting fossil fuels .
We can harness these impulses .
As taxpayers , we have already invested in all the R&D that created these vehicles ; last year ’s Energy bill had $ 25 billion for EV development under Section 136 of the 2007 Energy bill –almost $ 800 million of that went into the Volt alone .
However , getting from the design room to the factory floor has been like pulling teeth .
Ford , for example , has now successfully test - driven its PHEV for over a year with Southern California Edison .
Yet , despite a year of real - world driving success , Ford has no plans to produce their PHEV before 2015 .
But $ 10,000 deposits on particular models would enforce specific action , and not waste autocompanies precious financial resources making more of what customers do not want .
For small companies , deposits help focus precious resources where they can generate a certain return .
Big companies need to have the same focus , not just beg for or outright steal our continued support .
The automakers would not be able to start collecting deposits on the orders till they issue a maximum price estimate and specs .
They would be given till Dec. 31 , 2012 to fill the orders .
It is a novel idea but not untried .
SmartForTwo and Tesla both took deposits to help them fund their production and gage the level of customer interest .
But are there five million customers in the country who care enough ?
I think so .
The extraordinary number of people who were willing to donate their hard - earned money this election season to ensure that the country gets safely out of the Bush Error might suggest that there are more of these idealistic and altruistic people willing to put down hard money on a better future for the planet than the economic news would suggest .
WHY NOT ENLIST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC’S BUYING POWER ?
We ’re inspired by how Americans rose to past challenges :
We raised $ 17 billion Liberty Bonds in two years in World War I .
And 85 million Americans bought $ 185 billion in War Bonds during World War II .
Especially since dollars back then were worth over ten times more than now , our proposal is small in comparison .
Here ’s the kicker .
Any automaker that wants to receive federal loan guarantees beginning in January 2009 would have to commit by the end of this month to have at least one eligible plug - in vehicle for sale by the end of 2010 in volumes greater than 10,000 .

Lets Pay Detroit to Bring Their Gas Sipping Cars Home To the USA
Tesla Says Money Should n’t Be Diverted To Bailout Car Makers
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the automotive crisis is not so much the specter of impending financial doom , overcrowded bread lines , or the end of Automotive Life As We Know It .
No , it ’s the up - close and too - personal look at the men and women who run our country , and , by extension , at some members of the mainstream media who report stories now and ask questions later , if at all .
Public - spirited citizens that we are , let us detail for you 10 lies that pinhead legislators — and , by extension , the mainstream media — believe about the car industry .
Lie 1 : American companies do n’t sell fuel - efficient cars .
Truth : Really ?
Really ?
Of course they do .
The Detroit Three currently offer , among others , the Ford Focus , the Chevrolet Aveo and Cobalt , and the Dodge Caliber , and for decades before that , consumers were offered everything from the Ford Falcon to the Plymouth Valiant .
The U.S. automakers have always made fuel - efficient cars , and they still make them .
For years , that ’s all Saturn made .
But the American manufacturers have always used the shotgun approach ; if you throw enough pellets at the target , a few are bound to hit the bulls - eye .
Early imports used the rifle method : just one bullet .
But companies like Toyota have adopted the U.S. model .
There are 15 Toyota models , eight of which are trucks or SUVs .
And Toyota ’s overall sales in November were down 33.9 percent , while Ford ’s dropped 31.6 percent .
Explain that , Mr. Congressman and Mrs. Congresswoman .
Lie 2 : American consumers will only buy fuel - efficient vehicles .
Truth :
Then why is the only Toyota to show a major gain in November the Sequoia SUV ?
And why do some Toyota dealers currently have to discount the Prius as much as $ 1500 to move them ?
Lie 3 : Detroit is dragging its feet in making trucks , SUVs , and large cars more fuel - efficient .
Truth : Domestic - brand trucks and SUVs get the same lousy mileage as trucks and SUVs built everywhere else .
Why ?
Because they are trucks and SUVs !
As for large cars , many European brands are able to achieve excellent overall mileage for them , in large part thanks to diesel power .
With seven states , notably California and New York , subscribing to pollution standards that are stricter than federal standards , though , it did not make much sense for U.S. manufacturers to develop diesel cars when they ca n’t sell them in two of the largest states .
Lie 4 : Detroit forced people to buy gas guzzlers .
Truth :
We ’ve heard some interesting dealer stories over the years , but none involved putting guns to customers ’ heads to require them to buy a Ford Excursion or Chevrolet Suburban , when what they really wanted was a Ford Escort or a Chevy Cavalier .
Plenty of people ( such as , for instance , President - elect Obama , who used to own a Chrysler 300C ) like big , powerful , safe vehicles .
Lie 5 : Auto executives flying on private jets is a slap in the face to the American consumer .
Truth : Apparently the no-private - jet rule applies only to automotive executives .
If you are an executive of , say , AIG or Citigroup , it ’s fine .
Of course , the financial companies did n’t have to travel to Washington , D.C. to grovel for their bailouts — they were simply handed out like party favors — so the opportunity to publicly flog their executives for their method of long - distance transportation never presented itself .
Lie 6 : People are n’t buying domestic - brand vehicles because they are of inferior quality .
Truth :
That perception lingers , but it ’s no longer the case .
They are n’t buying domestic - brand vehicles because people are n’t buying anything .
According to major independent research , GM and Ford cars are virtually identical in quality to Japanese cars .
GM has won numerous awards for its current crop of cars , including two straight North American Car of the Year awards and top accolades from Motor Trend , Consumer Reports , and , most important , Car and Driver .
Lie 7 : It ’s easy and cost - effective to close brands .
Truth :
It costs billions to close the dealers , and you lose customers .
Is that the best use for the bailout money , to pay dealers not to sell cars ?
How well has that worked with farm subsidies ?
Lie 8 : Only the American companies were so stupid to not see this coming and prepare .
Truth : Everyone is losing sales and money , but only the U.S. companies do n’t have a cash cushion .
One big reason : Foreign - based companies do n’t have U.S. - size legacy costs , which include things like retirees ’ pensions and health care , because of things such as nationalized health care .
Lie 9 : The average consumer is too savvy for the market .
Truth :
The day gas prices dropped , people went back to buying trucks and SUVs , and Priuses started piling up on dealers ’ lots .
Because gas prices wo n’t go back up , right ?
Are our memories really that short ?
Lie 10 : Thomas Friedman can fix everything .
Truth : The New York Times columnist is certainly entertaining , in the same way that Ross Perot as a presidential candidate was entertaining .
But do you really want to take him seriously ?
Friedman wants the U.S. manufacturers to build nothing but hybrids , and he gives them just 36 months to make that happen .
Three years to completely overhaul the vehicle lineups of three major manufacturers ?
Do foreign automakers have to stop building their gas - swillers , too ?

Abstract
Torus pair modeled and rendered in FieldTrip
FieldTrip is a library for functional 3D graphics , intended for building static , animated , and interactive 3D geometry , efficient enough for real - time synthesis and display .
Our first renderer uses OpenGL , with the usual visual limitations .
Since FieldTrip is functional , it is about being rather than doing .
One describes what models are , not how to render them .
FieldTrip is work - in - progress .
It 's being released to show what 's going on and see who 's interested in collaborating on developing it further .
Besides this wiki page , here are more ways to find out about and get involved with FieldTrip :
Join the FieldTrip mailing list .
Visit the Hackage page for library documentation and to download & install .
Or install with cabal install FieldTrip .

Report bugs and request features on the tracker .
Basic types
The basic purpose of the core FieldTrip library is to allow a user build 3D geometry , from individual simple shapes to full 3D scenes .
The principal types are as follows .
Geometry3 3D geometry .
These values can be spatially transformed in space ( affinely : scale , rotate , translate ) and combined ( union ) .
Surf a = ( a , a ) -> ( a , a , a ) Parametric surfaces , i.e. , mappings from 2D to 3D .
Normals are constructed automatically and exactly via derivatives , thanks to the vector - space library .
These normals are used for shading .
For simplicity and composability , surfaces are curved , not faceted .
Surface rendering tessellates adaptively , caching tessellations in an efficient , infinite data structure for reuse .
The mechanism for choosing tessellation is a very primitive placeholder .
FieldTrip provides some basic shapes of surfaces ( spheres , torus , cubes , etc ) and many functions for manipulating surfaces , colors , etc .
Geometry2 2D geometry .
There 's a function ( flatG ) to embed 2D into 3D .
Image o = ( R , R ) -> o
A primitive placeholder for functional imagery in the spirit of Pan .
The intention is to use this type or
something like it for texture mapping .
Much design and implementation work to be done .
Example
The code for the static torus pair shown above :
torusPair :: Geometry3 torusPair = f red ( 1 / 2 ) ` mappend ` pivot3X ( f green ( - 1 / 2 ) ) where tor = torus 1 ( 2 / 5 ) f :: Col -> R ->
Geometry3 f col dx = materialG ( plastic col ) ( move3X dx tor )
where pivot3X and move3X are simple helper short - hands for 3D transformation .
The torus function used here is a simple wrapper around a parametric surface defined as follows :
-- | Torus , given radius of sweep circle and cross section torus :: ( Floating s , VectorSpace s , Scalar s ~ s ) => s -> s ->
Surf s torus sr cr = revolve ( const ( sr , 0 ) ^+^ cr *^ circle )
where revolve and circle are defined in Graphics .
FieldTrip .
ParamSurf , along with other tools for shape generation .
The trick to turning this polymorphic torus function into a Geometry3 is to use a derivative tower ( from vector - space ) for the type parameter s .
surfG :: Surf ( Vector2 R :> R ) -> Geometry3 torus :: R -> R ->
Geometry3 torus sr cr = surfG ( P . torus ( pureD sr ) ( pureD cr ) )

FieldTrip meets Reactive
FieldTrip contains no support for animation , because we intend it to be used with the Reactive functional reactive programming ( FRP ) library ( and possibly other animation frameworks ) .
By design , FieldTrip is completely orthogonal to any formulation or implementation of FRP .
The reactive - fieldtrip project connects Reactive and FieldTrip .
The picture above comes from an animation in reactive - fieldtrip .
Load src / Test.hs , as follows :

Problems and solutions
Installation dependencies
Haskell packages
You 'll need the OpenGL and GLUT packages .
If you are using synaptics / apt - get , those are called libghc6 - opengl - dev and libghc6 - glut - dev .
If you 're using cabal - install , it will take care of the dependencies for you ( see " Non-Haskell libraries " below though ) .
Non-Haskell libraries
Make sure that you have the opengl - dev and glut - dev libraries installed .
If you do n't have them , there are two ways to fail : Either on the installation of the corresponding Haskell libraries , like this :
configure : error : no GLUT header found , so this package cannot be built See `config.log ' for more details .
cabal : Error : some packages failed to install : GLUT - 2.1.1.2 failed during the configure step .
The exception was : exit : ExitFailure 1
Or , if you do have the Haskell packages and C libraries , but accidentally removed the opengl - dev and glut - dev libraries , you can end up with FieldTrip just producing black windows .
Linking problems on Debian Lenny
You may experience linker problems on Debian Lenny .
Running :
> ghc -- make - main - is Test Test.hs
can give you :
Linking Test ...
/home/ghc/.cabal/lib/reactive-glut-0.1.6/ghc-6.10.1/libHSreactive-glut-0.1.6.a( SimpleGL.o ) :

In function `s5SW_info ' : ( .text+0x1668 ) : undefined reference to `glutInitWindowSize ' ...
This is a HOpenGL problem and has already been reported here and a solution here .
To make a long story short , you need to explicitly link with glut when compiling :
> ghc -- make - lglut - main - is Test Test.hs

The Washington Post , the BBC , Cnet , and other outlets are pointing out that Apple is , for the first time ever , " quietly " recommending anti-virus software for Mac OS X .
A little research shows that this is completely false .

Here 's the Apple note they point at , postulating the old theory that Apple is feeling the heat of the increased market share and , therefore , an increasing risk of virus attacks :

The BBC labels this as the result of a " fresh threat " .
The Washington Post wonders if they will stop showing their Mac and PC " Virus " TV Commercial .
Cnet goes as far as saying that " Apple changes its tune by advising Mac users to install antivirus software in nod that even Mac users are n't immune to rising malware threats . " ( they have edited their story after it was demonstrated false by some internet users ) .
The reality is that the note above is just an update to this support article from 2007 :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The new tech support note , which even shows the reference from the old article , only lists new anti-virus software versions .
This is normal in tech notes .
In fact , the old tech note itself is actually nothing new either : Apple offered anti-virus software as part of their .
Mac subscription .
In fact , the company has been recommending virus software since the pre-Unix years .

In other words :
No conspiracy theories , no " quietly published " technical notes .
Just the same old recommendation they have been doing forever .
U.S. gov't . taps Facebook , Google , MTV to ' fight terrorism '
Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The US State Department announced plans on Monday to promote online youth groups as a new and powerful way to fight crime , political oppression and terrorism .
Drawing inspiration from a movement against FARC rebels in Colombia , the State Department is joining forces with Facebook , Google , MTV , Howcast and others in New York City next week to get the " ball rolling . "
It said 17 groups from South Africa , Britain and the Middle East which have an online presence like the " Million Voices Against the FARC " will attend a conference at Columbia University Law School from December 3 - 5 .
Observers from seven organizations that do not have an online presence -- such as groups from Iraq and Afghanistan -- will attend .
There will also be remote participants from Cuba .
They will forge an " Alliance of Youth Movement , " said James Glassman , under secretary of state for public diplomacy .
" The idea is put all these people together , share best practices , produce a manual that will be accessible online and in print to any group that wants to build a youth empowerment organization to push back against violence and oppression around the world , " he told reporters .
The conference will be streamed by MTV and Howcast , he said .
The list of organizations due to attend include the Burma Global Action Network , a human rights movement spurred into action by the ruling junta 's crackdown on monks and other pro-democracy protesters last year .
There is also Shabab 6 of April , which has emerged as Egypt 's largest pro-democracy youth group , and Invisible Children , which spotlights atrocities committed by the Lord 's Resistance Army in Uganda , Glassman said .
Others include Fight Back , which fights domestic violence in India , the Save Darfur Coalition , as well as One Million Voices Against Crime in South Africa , said Jared Cohen , from the secretary 's policy planning staff .
Also attending will be People 's March Against Knife Crime from Britain and Young Civilians from Turkey .
Cohen said Young Civilians is a human rights and pro-democracy organization which works online but has brought thousands of protesters into the streets of Turkey .
Glassman said the State Department is providing about 50,000 dollars in order to help bring delegates from the groups to the United States .
Among the speakers will be actress Whoopi Goldberg and a co-founder of Facebook .
Not many people are buying cars built 60 years ago .
No one is watching TV on a set manufactured in the 1940s .
Patients are not lining up to see a doctor who has n't cracked a book since before the polio vaccine was discovered .
Why , then , do millions of Americans get their health care through an employer - based system from the 1940s ?
Employers did n't start offering health benefits roughly 60 years ago because they were experts in medical decisions .
It was a way of circumventing the World War II wage - and - price controls .
Barred from offering higher salaries to attract workers , employers offered health insurance instead .
Aided by an Internal Revenue Service ruling that said workers who received health benefits did not have to pay income taxes on them , and by the fact that employers could write off the cost of the health benefits as a business - related expense , this accidental arrangement became the primary way most Americans access health care .
The system worked at first , but a lot has changed in 60 years .
Back then , the average soldier returning from World War II took a job with a local company , where he would work for decades until he got a gold watch at a retirement party .
Today , lifetime employment is dead .
By 42 , the average American will change jobs 11 times .
Sixty years ago , most American companies competed only against neighboring companies for lucrative contracts .
Today , most businesses are up against foreign companies that do n't foot the bill for their employees ' health - care costs .
Today , health - care costs are increasing at twice the rate of inflation .
To stay in the black , companies are forced to raise their employees ' premiums and deductibles , opt for cheaper insurance plans , or worse yet , drop health benefits altogether .
Since 2000 , the percentage of employers providing health insurance has declined by nearly 10 percent .
For too many , the employer - based system is inefficient .
Each employer purchases health insurance separately .
According to a recent estimate by the McKinsey Global Institute , this adds more than $ 75 billion in underwriting , marketing , sales , billing and other administrative costs that offer no health benefits .
More than half of all American employers who offer health - care benefits do n't offer their employees a choice .
Consequently , most Americans do n't have the option of giving their business to insurance companies that treat them well and only cover what they need .
This prevents the usual market forces from holding down costs .
Workers are the ones paying for this waste .
The money that employers are spending to buy health care for their employees could otherwise go to workers in the form of higher wages , empowering individuals to make their own health - care choices .
The available alternative to this employer - based system is even more horrifying .
Individuals buying insurance do n't have the same purchasing power as large businesses and end up paying much higher prices to cover administrative costs and risks .
They also do n't get the tax breaks that employers get for buying health insurance .
In most states , insurance companies have the right to discriminate against individuals by denying coverage or charging astronomical prices to anyone with a pre-existing condition .
It is no surprise that , when given the choice between the employer - based system and buying health insurance on their own , the vast majority of Americans reject the latter .
( A Kaiser Health Tracking Poll this summer , for example , found that only 17 percent of Americans said they would prefer to buy insurance on their own . )
But this is a false choice .
It assumes that the current system is the only option .
Why ca n't Americans have the best of both worlds ?
Americans need some of the benefits of the employer - based system : the security of being part of a large group , of not being denied coverage because of age and pre-existing conditions , and the convenience of having experts screen qualified plans and manage enrollment .
But Americans also need portable insurance -- coverage that follows them when they change jobs , lose jobs , start a business or whatever else may come .
Americans need more choices and the market power to buy the health coverage that works best for them and their families and , in turn , to make insurance companies compete for their business .
Such a system could be implemented today by creating state or regional insurance exchanges that pool individuals and small groups to pay the same lower prices charged to larger employers ; that certify that all insurance benefit packages meet minimum consumer protection standards ; that manage the enrollment process ; that collect premiums ; and that require insurance companies to issue and renew coverage for anyone who applies , protecting the insurers by paying them a risk - adjusted premium that pays them more when they enroll sicker , more costly , patients .
Fundamentally , this means that insurance companies would have to change their business model to compete on the basis of quality , price and benefits , rather than by " cherry picking " the healthiest people to cover .
It means spending less money on administrative costs and more money on keeping patients healthy .
And it means letting everyone keep the health insurance they have if that 's what they want , but giving all employers and employees more choices for their health care .
In the coming year , there will be no shortage of suggestions for fixing the nation 's health - care system .
But what Americans and the president - elect need to ask is whether the health - care system that was founded in the 1940s is the best health - care system for the 21st century .
We believe that Americans deserve better .
By now , everyone has probably heard of Justin Tuck ’s sack on Brooks Bollinger , which he endured a $ 7,500 fine due to a roughing the passer penalty .
The fine was voided after a few days in the end .
Roger Goodell stated the he was unable to see the play when it happened , and when he did , he immediately told Ray Anderson , who handles the NFL 's discipline violations that Justin Tuck 's fine was " too harsh " .
Although it ’s understandable for the NFL to have a mindset of safety - first , the penalty should have never been called in the first place , especially on a clean tackle like Justin Tuck’s .
A fine that has not had much buzz involved safety Ryan Clark of the Pittsburgh Steelers .
Ryan Clark wore a No. 21 sticker on his helmet in honor of former Washington Redskins ’ free safety Sean Taylor ( 1983-2007 ) .
Ryan Clark was fined $ 5,000 because his mourning was not apart of the agreement in the NFL rule book which states “ no personal interests ” involved with team uniforms .
Situations like these are ridiculous and make the NFL look like they have no compassion for their fallen players .
Roger Goodell was reported to say in a Dan Steinberg report that “ We ( The NFL ) mourn collectively , personal messages are n’t allowed ” and that the 2007 season was “ the NFL ’s collective mourning period for Sean Taylor . ”
The league is also looking to fine and suspend players who took a diuretic called “ StarCaps . "
Although this is n’t news to most sports fans , this is a case were the supplement was not on a list of banned products given to the NFL players in the league .
StarCaps host an active ingredient called Bumetanide ( bu.met.a.nide. ) that the NFL considers a masking agent for steroids .
I personally believe that the players who took this supplement did not know about the active ingredient .
The supplement was clearly not listed as a banned product , and I think the NFL should assess a small fine to the individual players , but not suspend players due to a faulty listing they could not control .
Another incident involved the Vikings RB Adrian Peterson .
A.P. scored a touchdown , took off his helmet , and revealed a white skull cap this past weekend .
The rules state that players must wear black skull caps during game day .
He was fined $ 5,000 for wearing a white skull cap in last week ’s game against the Packers .
How ridiculous is that ?
A player wo n’t get penalized for taking his helmet off while he is not in the restricted bench area ( which A.P. did about four times during that game ) , but he will get fined for wearing a white skull cap ?
Titans RB Chris Johnson was also fined $ 10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct due to him playing the bongos in the Chief ’s band during a celebration and was quoted to say :
“ I knew I was going to get a fine , but I am totally upset about how much .
I am going to appeal .
There ’s no fun in this league .
I was trying to have fun and they want to penalize us for having fun . ” – Chris Johnson
The NFL is definitely going down a slum road when it comes to that “ extra ” something the players want to bring to the field on game day .
Players are getting fined for entertaining the fans and having fun on a regular basis now week in and week out due to the leagues ridiculous policies .
At this rate , it seems like the NFL will have taken the entertainment value out of the game by the 2011 season .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Domestic automakers over the weekend were putting the finishing touches on turnaround plans that they will present to Congress in hopes of securing $ 25 billion in emergency loans to help them survive the current economic crisis .
But unlike during their first visit to Washington , top executives from General Motors Corp.
GM , - 2.37 % , Ford Motor Co. F , - 1.34 % and Chrysler on Tuesday will each hand in separate blueprints for what they are looking to do with the money .
After that , the CEOs will meet with Congress for two sessions on Thursday and Friday before a vote is likely held next week that will determine whether the automakers ' pitches hit their marks .
An industry official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the plans could be disclosed after the market closes Tuesday .
GM is expected to propose sharp cuts in its North American operations , which could include closing still more manufacturing plants and even shedding some of its brands as the automaker struggles to cope with its dwindling cash pile .
The United Auto Workers could also be called to cooperate and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger told CNN on Sunday that his union is willing to go back to the bargaining table .
Ford , in a better liquidity position than rival GM , probably wo n't resort to more significant cutbacks but could consider some symbolic gestures , such as reducing CEO Alan Mulally 's compensation .
For his part , Mulally will reportedly drive the 10 - hour trek to Washington from Detroit after all three CEOs rankled congressmen by arriving on corporate jets for their first visit .
The Wall Street Journal also reported that Ford plans to tell Congress it will step up efforts to retool its product line toward smaller , more fuel - efficient cars , accelerating its move away from the beefy pick - ups and sport utility vehicles that dominated its sales over the past decade .
Ford is also likely to offer U.S. motorists the thriftier cars it already produces for overseas markets to help speed the transition , the Journal said .
Privately - held Chrysler , also hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate , may tell Congress that it needs to hammer out a merger or some other kind of partnership , like the one previously in the works with GM , to ensure its survival .
Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez challenged all three Detroit automakers to come up with " a path to viability " and suggested the federal aid could hinge on whether they trim their " bloated " dealer networks , the Journal reported .
The automakers will head to Washington armed with the added sense of urgency that Tuesday 's slew of November U.S. sales reports will likely bring .
The industry is expected to hand in double - digit drops across the board , with GM seen leading declines .
See full story .
GM and Ford saw their shares open the week solidly in the green but they both turned south late Monday as the broader - market selling intensified .
GM closed down 12.4 % at $ 4.59 and Ford lost 5.2 % to finish at $ 2.55 .
Ronald Reagan said , “ Government 's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases :
If it moves , tax it .
If it keeps moving , regulate it .
And if it stops moving , subsidize it ” .
Even before Bush 's Big Bank Bailout Bill was passed by Congress we were in the “ subsidize it ” phase of the cycle .
We have been told by our “ leaders ” that more subsidizing through the bailout legislation is in the best interest of the millions of Americans in the middle class .
It was done to preserve our savings accounts , education and retirement funds and to help small business in securing the necessary loans they need to survive .
It was done to rescue us from economic calamity .
In fact , the $ 700 billion bailout ( ignoring the pork and tax breaks which make the legislation worth more than $ 800 billion ) will only do harm to the middle class .
First of all , this $ 700 billion dollars is in addition to nearly $ 1 trillion that the Federal Reserve has already pumped into the economy in just the last month .
Secondly , where will the Treasury get the money called for in the bailout package ?
Answer : it will borrow the money from the banks .
But , I thought the banks had no money , hence the need for the bailout .
They do n't , so they will create the money through a system called fractional reserve .
In addition , because the banks are a cartel headed by the Federal Reserve they can also fire up the printing press to produce dollars .
The banks will loan these new dollars to us , with interest , so we can then give the money back to them .
The nearly $ 1 trillion already pumped into the economy by the Fed and the new funds called for by the bailout package are an artificial increase in dollars .
Of course , the banks will get to use the new money first before inflation sets in and then the rest of us can borrow the money back ( again ) from banks at higher rates because of the inflation .
The banks can't lose .
If you think this is a good deal for middle class Americans then you probably own one of the subprime mortgages that got us into this mess in the first place .
In addition to the government using our money to get us into an insane financial arrangement with the banking industry , the bailout will not solve our economic problems and indeed make them worst .
How does throwing borrowed money at bad assets make any sense ?
It is equivalent to borrowing money and then flushing it down the toilet .
If the bad loans that the bailout is going to purchase had any value they would have been bought on the open market at some price .
They have not been bought so it is safe to assume that they lack any value .
Consequently , the bailout will simply relieve the banks of the ramifications of their bad behavior and leave taxpayers holding a bag of worthless assets .
When the Treasury writes off these assets , the loss to the federal treasury will be well over a trillion dollars ( this includes bureaucratic costs , opportunity costs and interest costs on the $ 700 billion ) .
Folks , Uncle Sam already owes over $ 9 trillion dollars with at least another $ 50 trillion of future obligations through entitlements .
It is only a matter of time before these debt obligations have to be met .
Because foreigners will be unwilling to lend us any more money and the Federal Reserve will be unable to print more because of hyperinflation , the politicians will have to raise taxes .
High taxes in recessionary times will be the death knell for our economy .
And do n't think that future misallocations of resources wo n't be encouraged by this federal largess .
It has already begun to happen .
Bank of America probably bought Merrill Lynch with its bad assets to ensure that it was “ too big to fail ” .
Citigroup and Wells Fargo will fight to the death for the right to buy Wachovia and its $ 74 billion of bad assets because they both know that the Treasury will now offload those bad assets onto the taxpayer .
Once these bad assets are removed from the balance sheets of the banks what guarantees are there that they wo n't turn around and make more high risk , bad loans ?
Are n't the banks still under the federal mandate through the Community Reinvestment
Act to make loans to high risk debtors ?
By passing the bailout package has n't Congress shown that it will be there for the banks when they fail ?
The bailout package will prove to be harmful for the middle class .
It will cause inflation , burden taxpayers with hundreds of billions of dollars in bad assets , and encourage irresponsible economic decisions .
Someone also once said , “ the more you subsidize something , you more you get of it ” .
By subsidizing the bad decisions of Wall Street we can only expect more of the same bad decisions .
The ensuing furor among Afghans , including an angry protest by President Karzai , prompted the top American commander in the country , Gen. David D. McKiernan , to order a second investigation , which raised the civilian death toll to 33 .
General McKiernan also ordered a tightening of procedures for launching airstrikes and reporting promptly and accurately on civilian casualties .
He has said that minimizing civilian casualties is crucial to turning the worsening tide of the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Zalmay Ayoby , a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar , said the strike on Monday took place when Taliban and American - led forces were engaged in a firefight near the village of Wegh Bakhtu .
He said that an airstrike was called in after the Taliban opened fire on a coalition unit , and that a missile struck a compound where a wedding party was being held .

“ Unfortunately we should say that an airstrike on a wedding party had killed and injured a huge number of people in Shah Wali Kot , ” he said .
Ahmed Wali Karzai , a brother of the Afghan president and leader of the provincial council in Kandahar , said that there were civilian casualties , but that it was unclear how many people had died .
He said he had spoken with some people wounded in the attack who had been admitted to Kandahar ’s main hospital .
They told him that as many as 32 civilians had been admitted , including women and children from the wedding party , he said .
Dr. Qudratullah Hakimi of the Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar said by telephone that the hospital admitted 22 women and 6 children after the attack .
The children ’s ages were 1 to 11 , he said .
He said the bride had had an operation and was stable .
He said that his patients had reported that up to 90 people were killed or wounded , and that some were buried under the rubble , although this could not be independently confirmed .
Scientists are expanding the search for extraterrestrial life -- and they 've set their sights on some very unearthly planets .
Cold " Super - Earths " -- giant , " snowball " planets that astronomers have spied on the outskirts of faraway solar systems -- could potentially support some kind of life , they have found .
Such planets are plentiful ; experts estimate that one - third of all solar systems contain super - Earths .
" We know there are a lot of super - Earths out there , and the next generation of telescopes will be even better at spotting them , " said Scott Gaudi , assistant professor of astronomy at Ohio State University .
Despite the name , a super - Earth has little in common with the Earth that we know -- other than the fact it is has a solid surface .
A super - Earth is covered with ice , and may have a substantial atmosphere – perhaps much thicker than the Earth’s .
Yet Gaudi joined with Eric Gaidos of the University of Hawaii and Sara Seager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to model whether such planets might harbor a liquid ocean that could support life , and whether they might be detectable from Earth .
Gaidos reported the team 's early results at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco .

" It turns out that if super - Earths are young enough , massive enough , or have a thick atmosphere , they could have liquid water under the ice or even on the surface , " Gaudi said .
" And we will almost certainly be able to detect these habitable planets if they exist . "
The most promising technique for finding super - Earths is the one Gaudi prefers : gravitational microlensing .
When one star happens to cross in front of another as seen from Earth , it magnifies the light from the more distant star like a lens .
If planets are orbiting the lens star , they boost the magnification briefly as they pass by .
Gaudi and his colleagues first discussed the project this summer at an Aspen Center for Physics workshop .
The workshops are sponsored by the National Science Foundation , and they offer an informal atmosphere for scientists to propose new ideas .
There , the three talked about using microlensing to search for life in a new way .
Most such efforts focus on finding planets in another solar system 's " habitable zone " -- the distance from a star where temperatures are just right for supporting liquid water on the surface and thus life as we know it .

But water is much more plentiful beyond the habitable zone , in the outer reaches of a solar system , Gaudi explained .
It 's most often found as ice -- at the heart of gas planets such as Jupiter , on frozen moons such as Europa , and on super - Earths .
In fact , Earth 's water probably originated elsewhere , and found its way here on comets or asteroids .
So rather than looking for warm planets like Earth that happened to acquire water , Gaudi and his colleagues decided to look at cold super - Earths that formed with water already in place .
They examined the likelihood that some internal heat source might enable liquid water to form under the ice .
As Gaidos and Seager modeled scenarios for heating the interior of super - Earths , Gaudi modeled whether the planets they hypothesized would be detectable .
Gaidos and Seager found that very big super - Earths , ones around 10 times the mass of Earth , could retain enough heat from their formation to form a liquid ocean beneath the ice -- even though those planets would be located some five times farther from their star than the Earth is from its sun .
Gaudi determined that such planets would be detectable .
In fact , microlensing is best at detecting planets that far out in a solar system , he said .
As to what type of life might be found there , it 's too early to speculate .
" A more worrisome question is , if these planets have life on them , how would we know it ?
We have a hard enough time trying to figure out where there 's life on Europa , let alone something that 's hundreds of light years away , " he added .
Now is OpenID finally mainstream ?
Microsoft announced today that it will be enabling all Windows Live ID accounts — of which there are some 420 million plus users — with the ability to log in to OpenID web sites .
Microsoft announced the availability of a Community Technology Preview ( their word for beta ) of the Windows Live ID OpenID Provider .
Microsft sang high praises for OpenID in a blogged announcement .
Said Microsoft ’s Jorgen Thelin , “ OpenID is an emerging , de facto standard Web protocol for user authentication . ”
Microsoft expects to roll out full OpenID support sometime in 2009 .
Like Yahoo ! , who announced support for OpenID last January , Microsoft will be an OpenID provider , but it does n’t appear that it will be a “ relying party ” — in other words , it seems likely that you wo n’t be able to sign in to Microsoft properties using an OpenID obtained elsewhere .
That ’s kind of a bummer , because OpenID only works completely if providers that also offer user services become relying parties as well .
Everything needs to be two - way .
OpenID is Getting Big , But Still Is n’t Mainstream
With support from Microsoft and Yahoo !
there are now likely north of three quarters of a billion OpenID enabled logins out there .
There is definitely overlap ( I have both a Windows Live ID and a Yahoo !
ID , for example , and I am sure that many people do ) , but even so , Microsoft and Yahoo !
are two of the largest online ID providers on the web , so these are big wins for OpenID .
But OpenID still is n’t mainstream .
As a Yahoo !
user experience study revealed a couple of weeks ago , OpenID just has n’t been sold well to the public .
Adding 420 million new OpenID enabled accounts does n’t fix the marketing problem .
Take , for example , Microsoft ’s instructions to test out the current technology preview of the OpenID Provider program for Live ID :
Go to https://login.live-int.com/
and use the sign - up button to set up a Windows Live ID test account in the INT environment .
Go to https://login.live-int.com/beta/ManageOpenID.srf to set up your OpenID test alias .
At any Web site that supports OpenID 2.0 , type openid.live -INT.com in the OpenID login box to sign in to that site by means of your Windows Live ID OpenID alias .
Certainly , turning on OpenID will be easier once Microsoft ’s support goes into production sometime next year , but even so , the conventions for using OpenID on the user end are just too alien for many users .
Most OpenID login boxes look like the one depicted below :
That ’s not the type of sign on form that most people are used to .
The two field “ username ” and “ password ” approach is so ingrained in the minds of users , that a lot of people are confused when presented with an OpenID login form and do n’t know how to proceed .
Users in Yahoo !’s test confirmed this , and many reported being confused when they were n’t presented with the password box they ’re used to .
“ The key takeaway [ from Yahoo ! ’s study ] is probably that even if OpenID is ready for the mainstream , the mainstream does n’t seem to be ready for OpenID , ” we wrote earlier this month .
“ It could definitely benefit from being simplified ( in terms of both signing up and signing in ) , but the main thing that needs to happen for average users to begin to adopt OpenID is that it needs to be pitched in a completely different way . ”
David Recordon , who is on the OpenID Foundation board , noted in the comments of our post that OpenID is still in the early adopter phase of the traditional adoption curve .
So looking at the pure numbers of OpenID enabled accounts is misleading — the mainstream is n’t yet using OpenID .
As we wrote a couple of weeks ago , OpenID is fundamentally a sound idea , but for many users the implementation has been far from ideal , and the sales pitch has been terrible .
Further , without large OpenID providers like Microsoft and Yahoo !
also becoming relying parties , the key benefit for users — that you can use your single OpenID to log into all the sites you use — is lost .
Yahoo !
advised that publishers “ promote the utility , not the technology ” of OpenID .
When the utility is lost , the pitch to the mainstream becomes impossible , however .
He said : " It 's all the fault of tourists , especially the Brits .
They misuse alcohol at home and come over here to do the same with hash and the so called ' magic mushrooms ' . "

Judging by the spring 2009 shoes we ’ve seen on the runway so far , one might think designers had it in for us ladies .
Because these heels are so high they ’re scary .
Nay — dangerous .
They ’ve already caused models to fall at Rodarte , Prada , and Pucci .
And still more models reported stumbling at Dolce & Gabbana , BCBG , and Peter Som .
Models survived the Basso & Brooke , Marni , and Christian Dior shows unscathed , but that does n’t mean the catwalkers were n’t scared walking in them .
Next spring ’s hottest accessory just may be a pair of crutches .
You can imagine the internal contortions when an old friend was once memorably described as a 60s liberal with Catholic guilt .
I got the same impression of grinding gears while reading the International Energy Agency 's latest long - term forecast , the World Energy Outlook 2008 , published last month .
In many respects , the IEA 's analysis of threats to the oil supply is bloodcurdling , and yet the agency maintains that global production can keep rising for at least two decades .
The rich nations ' energy watchdog is clearly alarmed , but seems afraid of its own bark .
The IEA 's annual forecast has become steadily darker in recent years , but this time the deterioration in its outlook is dramatic .
Only a year ago , the agency was predicting that global oil production in 2030 would reach 116 m barrels per day , up from around 84 mb / d , but now it has slashed that to 106 mb / d .
At the same time , the agency has also doubled its oil price forecast .
Last year , it said the cost of crude would fall in the long term , but now it predicts an average of $ 100 per barrel until 2015 , despite the deepening recession , and rising to $ 120 in real terms by 2030 .
It concludes that the era of cheap oil is over and that the recent extreme price volatility will continue .
Temperature rise
If that sounds like good news for global warming at least - as the UN climate talks take place in Poland - the IEA warns that its new " reference scenario " would still mean a devastating 6C rise in global temperatures .
One reason for the deeper pessimism about oil is a new analysis of the rate at which output of existing fields declines due to falling reservoir pressures - an inevitable feature of oil production .
This number has always been difficult to estimate , but now the IEA has done a detailed study and has concluded that the global average decline rate for fields that have already peaked is 6.7 % per year , much higher than previous estimates and in spite of billions of dollars of remedial investment .
That means that , to satisfy the IEA 's predicted demand growth of 10 mb / d day by 2015 , the industry must build 30 mb/d of additional capacity .
It is as if the oil industry is struggling up a sand dune , constantly slipping back , forced to scramble three steps to make the distance of one .
The IEA says the challenge of raising oil production is made even harder by the recent collapse in the oil price - from a record high in July of $ 147 per barrel to around $ 55 - because many planned oil investments are now uneconomic .
News of projects being delayed comes almost daily , creating the conditions for an even bigger price spike whenever the economy recovers .
The report warns that " there remains a real risk that underinvestment will cause an oil supply crunch [ by 2015 ] " .
This would pitch the world back into recession , with all the economic and social misery that implies .
But as alarming as it sounds , the IEA view is almost certainly far too sanguine .
The agency maintains its feared " supply crunch " could be avoided if the industry would invest enough , and if Opec countries , with three - quarters of the world 's reserves , would only be reasonable .
It insists that there is no geological shortage of oil in view ( " peak oil " ) , and that output should continue to grow to 106 mb/ d in 2030 , even though that would mean building new production capacity equivalent to six times that of Saudi Arabia today .
Yet all this depends on a series of highly optimistic assumptions that fundamentally undermine the IEA 's conclusions .
The first is that there is even the remotest chance the necessary investment will happen in time , now that projects are being delayed from the US to the Middle East .
The IEA 's " real risk " of a supply crunch is more like a racing certainty .
The second assumption is that steep declines in non-Opec oil fields will be offset by increases in " non-conventional " oil production , such as the Canadian oil sands .
This also looks unlikely .
Oil sands projects are uneconomic at less than $ 80 per barrel , and several have recently been shelved .
More importantly , they require vast amounts of water , and this is likely to limit output to about 3 mb/d , whereas the IEA is counting on twice that much by 2030 .
The third is that Opec will ramp up its production , which the IEA says is crucial to satisfying demand " in the face of dwindling resources in most parts of the world and accelerating decline rates everywhere " .
But if the rest of the world is running out , it makes perfect sense that Opec members should want to husband their resources .
Upward revisions
More specifically , the agency assumes that Iraq will triple its output to 6.4 mb/d .
The country almost certainly has the geological potential , but what it will actually be producing in 2030 is anybody 's guess .
Fourth is the assumption that Opec 's oil reserves are anything like as big as its member countries claim : 935bn barrels .
There have been severe doubts about this ever since the 1980s , when many members made huge upward revisions , which most observers regard as largely bogus .
The IEA has gone some way to addressing this by employing independent estimates , which are somewhat lower than Opec 's claims , but their numbers could still be some 250 bn barrels too high .
PFC Energy , a Washington - based consultancy , has concluded that , on a more prudent estimate of Opec reserves , its output could peak by the middle of the next decade .
With so much apparently unjustified optimism , the danger is that the IEA 's supply crunch turns out to be something even worse : peak oil , or as near as makes no difference .
If the IEA were to moderate its assumptions , its outlook would come into line with the view of several major oil companies .
Oil and gas company Total has said the global output will never exceed 95 mb/d , for a mixture of geological and geopolitical reasons , while Shell forecasts a plateau from the middle of the next decade .
The distinction may seem subtle , but the difference is crucial .
One view allows for the resumption of economic growth , while the other admits some kind of hard production ceiling that condemns us to alternating oil price spikes and recessions until we liberate ourselves from oil dependency .
The question remains as to why the IEA persists in its view .
Perhaps it is just the innate conservatism of an international bureaucracy funded by western governments , or maybe the agency fears a diplomatic rift with Opec , or possibly it wants to avoid panic .
Or maybe it hopes policymakers will read between the lines .

SSD 's grow up
Who wants big SSD's ?
We do !
We do !
Toshiba has announced the first 512GB SSD - bringing SSD 's into the large capacity drive space .
The new drives will be based on NAND flash built on a 43nm process , and will come in 64/128/256/512 GB capacities , and will be packaged as both SSD modules and in 1.8 " and 2.5 " drive formats .
The drives are supposed to run at up to 240MB / sec reads , 200 MB / sec writes , which means they will be in the same performance ballpark as Intel 's high speed SSD's .
Neural Plasticity And The Self - Repairing Brain
Researchers at The University of British Columbia have discovered why the brain loses its capacity to re-grow connections and repair itself , knowledge that could lead to therapeutics that “ rejuvenate ” the brain .
The study , published today in The EMBO Journal , identified a set of proteins - calpain and cortactin - which regulate and control the sprouting of neurons , a mechanism known as neural plasticity .
Neurons , or nerve cells , process and transmit information by electrochemical signalling and are the core components of the brain and spinal cord .
During development , growing neurons are relatively plastic and can sprout new connections , however their plasticity levels drop rapidly as they mature and become integrated into neuronal networks .
This process is the mechanism by which the brain regulates these networks from uncontrolled growth , however ; as a consequence , the central nervous system is unable to reorganize itself in response to injury or disease .
“ This discovery is exciting because we now know that neurons have n’t lost their capacity to re-grow connections , but instead are under constant repression by the protein calpain , ” says Ana Mingorance - Le Meur , postdoctoral fellow in UBC ’s Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences , who has led the investigation along with UBC Professor Timothy O’Connor .
“ If we can target therapies that block this mechanism , then neurons should be able to sprout new connections , therefore stimulating the brain ’s ability to repair its wiring network . ”
The research reveals that the loss of plasticity is due to the protein calpain actively blocking the protein cortactin , which is responsible for the sprouting of new connections .
The researchers reduced calpain activity in animal models to unlock the sprouting potential of neurons and found that when calpain activity is reduced neural plasticity is enhanced .
“ The maintenance of neuronal connections is an active process that requires constant repression of the formation of nerve sprouts by the protein calpain to avoid uncontrolled growth , ” says Mingorance - Le Meur , who is also a member of the Brain Research Centre at UBC and VCH Research Institute .
“ But a consequence of this role is that calpain limits neural plasticity and the brain ’s ability to repair itself .
The next step is to find a way to enhance neural plasticity without interfering with the good connections that are already in place .
The next step is to find a way to enhance neural plasticity without interfering with the good connections that are already in place . ”
According to Mingorance - Le Meur , who is also a member of International Collaboration on Repair and Discovery ( ICORD ) , the results are very promising because they help us understand how neural plasticity is regulated .
Drugs that could promote neural plasticity could potentially treat a wide range of neurological disorders , as well as boost the effects of other treatments under investigation .
I can be a bit sensitive when it comes to language and how concepts are conveyed .

OpenOffice.org : Play StarWars Galaxy ( Easter Egg )

If you ’re running the recent version of OpenOffice and feel like taking a break and playing then you ’re in luck .
There ’s an Easter Egg that let ’s you play a simple version of Space Invaders , titled StarWars Galaxy .
1. Run OpenOffice and start the Spreadsheet application .

3. Press Return on your keyboard .

[ digg- reddit- me ] Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr. – or Lew Rockwell – has decided that this election calls for non-participation .
“ [ T ] here is no lesser of two evils , ” he says .
“ There is socialism or fascism . ”
We will – by boycotting the vote – instill fear in our leaders that they are “ ruling us without our consent . ”
I expect little better from Lew Rockwell , a man who saw fit to promote racism in the service of a libertarian ideology .
( I do not blame libertarianism for it ’s promoters , but I can fault the individuals who used explicit race - baiting as Rockwell did . )
What disturbs me about this opinion piece is in part it ’s resonance – as demonstrated by it ’s support on reddit .
But what bothers me more is that it seems rooted in the same tendency to demonize opponents , the same desire to re-make the world in the service of ideology , the same rejection of pragmatism , the same denigration of “ the masses , ” as other ideologies from Communism to neoconservatism .
For the sake of clarity , Rockwell , rejects any truths too subtle to fit into a propagandist slogan – and so – Obama becomes a socialist , and McCain a fascist .
There are real problems with voting and our financial system and the centralization of power that Rockwell touches on – and for a libertarian citizen , neither candidate offers a clear libertarian policy vision .
Each seems to offer government encroachment in different areas of life .
But a libertarian philosophy does not necessarily lead to this theology of dueling evils that Rockwell invokes – in which we presume only our own innocence and purity while we attack anyone with power or who might gain power as inherently corrupt .
There is a healthy skepticism needed about power and the powerful – but Rockwell goes beyond this .
He is one of those who is certain , full of passionate intensity .
Which is why he can see Obama and McCain as two competing evils – and why he must simplify their pragmatic politics into two ideologies of certainty : fascism and socialism .
But his appeal here is insidious – it is not just to those who share his certainties but to the uncertain .
He calls on us to reject all alternatives in favor of … nothing – justifying this with the flimsy excuse that by shunning the political process we may have a psychological effect on the politicians .
My duty as a citizen , my duty as a political being , is to inform myself and to vote and then to participate in governance .
It is an abdication of this duty to throw up my hands , moved by an old man ’s bitterness at repeated defeat and disappointment , and to despair .
To be a grown - up in this world , to be a citizen , means to act even when the alternatives are only dimly understood – for we can only dimly understand our world .
We live in a complex environment where every action has unintended consequences – and the right path is rarely clear .
By failing to act , we enable those whose secular or religious theology leads them to certainty to monopolize power and drag us from one extreme to another , as we have often seen in the past thirty years in America .
Which is why I will vote on November 4th .

The banner was said to have been the Navy 's idea US President George W Bush has said he regrets some of the blunter statements he made over the last eight years .
As his presidency draws to an end , he told CNN that some remarks on Osama Bin Laden and the Iraqi insurgency would have been better left unsaid .
Mr Bush also said he regretted speaking in front of a " mission accomplished " banner only a month after troops were deployed in Iraq .
Separately he said President - elect Barack Obama would be good for the US .
Mr Bush said he regretted using phrases like " dead or alive " or " bring 'em on " .
Shortly after the 11 September attacks in 2001 , he said of Osama bin Laden : " I want justice .
There 's an old poster out West that said : ' Wanted , dead or alive . ' "
' Wrong message '
Mr Bush was criticised in 2003 for comments he made about the insurgency in Iraq .
" There are some who feel like the conditions are such that they can attack us there .
My answer is , bring 'em on , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The US president also referred to a speech in 2003 aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln .
" They had a sign that said ' Mission Accomplished ' , " he said .
" It was a sign aimed at the sailors on the ship , but it conveyed a broader knowledge .
To some it said , well , Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over , when I did n't think that .
But nonetheless , it conveyed the wrong message . "
Mr Bush went on to talk about his meeting with Mr Obama and described it as relaxed and said he thought he would " bring a sense of family to the White House " .
He said that Barack Obama 's victory was " good for our country " but expressed disappointment that Republican nominee John McCain did not win the election .
Mr Bush talked about his future plans and said he was heading home to Texas after he leaves office and might write a book .

Scottish and Southern Energy has sold a 50 % stake in the Greater Gabbard offshore windfarm to a subsidiary of the German utility RWE for £ 308m .
SSE acquired a 50 % stake in the project , which will be the world 's largest offshore windfarm , when it bought Airtricity this year .
It took its stake to 100 % when it bought out Airtricity 's then partner , Fluor International , after the latter won the contract to build the 500 - megawatt development .
SSE said then that it intended to sell 50 % of the project , which will cost £ 1.3 bn to develop , and yesterday announced it had tied up a £ 308 m deal with npower renewables , a subsidiary of RWE Innogy .
Under the terms of the deal SSE will be the operator of the windfarm in its development and operational stages .
Ian Marchant , chief executive of SSE , said local renewable - energy projects were increasingly important to Britain 's security of supply .
" This year has been characterised by high and volatile prices for fossil fuels and by political uncertainty in key oil - and gas - producing regions . "
SSE paid £ 40 m for the Fluor stake but said the higher sale price to npower reflected costs incurred in developing the project .
Greater Gabbard , which is 15 miles ( 25 km ) off the Suffolk coast , will have 140 turbines and the power generated will be brought ashore through three undersea cables to a substation to be built near Sizewell .
SSE and npower will share equally the electricity provided .
Onshore work has already begun and work on the offshore elements is expected to start next year .
The partners expect development to be finished by 2011 , with the first electricity available in 2010 .
RWE operates a 60 MW offshore windfarm at North Hoyle off the north Wales coast .
It is building a 90MW windfarm offshore at Rhyl Flats to come on stream next year , and awaits the go - ahead for a 750 MW installation at Gwynt y Môr .

Bush officials might want to double - think that European vacation :
... it seems that Pinochet 's case caused concerns at the highest levels of the Bush administration , as described in a revealing account by a former lawyer in the Bush administration , Jack Goldsmith .
He describes how , during 2002 , Henry Kissinger found himself on the sharp end of the Pinochet case .
Reportedly livid , a rattled Kissinger complained to his old chum Donald Rumsfeld , who was already worrying about " lawfare " ( the use of law to achieve operational objectives ) .
Rumsfeld instructed the chief lawyer at the Pentagon , Jim Haynes , to address the problems posed by this " judicialisation of international politics " .
Haynes passed the assignment on to Goldsmith , whose memo reached the National Security Council , which also worried about the threat of foreign judges .
According to Goldsmith , the NSC could n't work out what to do about the problem .
We now know that while this was going on , Rumsfeld and Haynes and others at the Pentagon were secretly circumventing international laws like the Geneva conventions and the torture convention and removing international constraints on the interrogation of detainees at Guantánamo and in Iraq .
Torture and other international crimes followed .
So did the Abu Ghraib photos .
Amid the welter of legal opinions received by the administration none , it seems , bothered to examine the consequences of the House of Lords judgment for senior US officials .
The legacy of the arrest warrant signed in Hampstead 10 years today , is the Pinochet principle , that no one is above the law .
It may one day come to haunt the very people who sought to set it aside .
If , that is , they ever dare to set foot outside the United States .

Daniel Ginnes carried a banner declaring : " No More Mr Nice Gay . "
Brian Lindsey held up a sign billing Joseph Smith , founder of the Church of the Latter Day Saints , as a " prophet , polygamist , paedophile . "
Hundreds of others simply chanted : " Mormon scum . "
More than 2,000 gay rights protesters marched on a Mormon temple in Los Angeles on Thursday , throwing the church and its followers on to the front line of the battle over California 's decision to ban same - sex marriage .
Earlier this week , 52.5 per cent of voters in the supposedly liberal state decided to back Proposition 8 , a ballot measure that adds 15 words to the constitution , saying that : " Only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognised in California . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The development marked a massive setback for gay rights and left 18,000 couples , who had married in the five months since California legalised same - sex weddings , in legal limbo .
In the large and traditionally laid - back gay community , it also left a sense of injustice .
Proposition 8 passed with the assistance of a $ 70 m ( £ 44 m ) campaign largely funded by out - of - state donations from Mormons .
" It 's taken something like this to make us realise the need to be more aggressive and angry and active , " said Mr Ginnes , a graphic designer from West Hollywood .
" People did n't think they were going to lose the vote , so they did n't realise it was worth fighting for .
" Now we have lost a fundamental right .
That 's a shame , but it 's certainly galvanised a community that was apathetic .
What you are seeing today is the birth of a movement . "
In the coming days , a string of protests are planned across California , as campaigners mount a robust PR war against the Utah - based church .
Many will picket services tomorrow .
" We should have got nasty a long time ago , " said Mr Lindsey , who is originally from a Mormon family .
" I 'm not going to be polite any more , I 'm not going to step around my belief that this is a nasty church with disgusting views which managed to buy an election .
I do n't care if it 's people 's religion .
I 'm going to stand up and fight it . "
Thursday 's protest , which gridlocked traffic in Hollywood for the second consecutive day , was mostly disciplined , with police reporting two arrests .
Seven people were detained at a demonstration on Wednesday .
For the Mormon Church , it threatens a PR nightmare .
The gay rights lobby boasts scores of prominent celebrity supporters who have already pledged vociferous support to the campaign to overturn Proposition 8 .
The country music singer Melissa Etheridge , a prominent lesbian , announced yesterday that she will refuse to pay income tax until she 's " allowed the same rights " as other taxpayers .
Instead , she pledged to donate money to legal challenges arguing that the way Proposition 8 was put to the voters was unconstitutional .
Behind the scenes , the mood is turning increasingly ugly .
" If they 're going to vote away my rights based on fear and ignorance and prejudice , I 'm going to give them something to be fucking scared of , " read a message posted on the online bulletin board Queerty .
The Mormon Church is in damage limitation mode .
" No one on either side of the question should be vilified , harassed or subject to erroneous information , " it said in a statement .
The Mormons A snapshot
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was founded by Joseph Smith Jr in New York state in 1830 and developed by Brigham Young who migrated with the new Mormons to Salt Lake Valley , Utah , in 1847 .
* There are 12 million membersworldwide who believe their church is a restoration of the Church asconceived by Jesus and that other Christian churches have gone astray .
* It is said to be the fourth largest Christian denomination in the whole of the United States .
* Mormons oppose homosexuality , abortion , sex outside of marriage , alcohol , drugs , pornography , gambling , tobacco , tea and coffee .
* Mormons hold that we all have an eternal life stretching either side of our life on earth .
They believe that humans can become like gods in the afterlife , although subordinate to God .
* The Church of the Latter Day Saints tolerated " plural marriage " before the American Civil War .
The practice was discontinued more than a century ago , but several thousand renegade Mormons in the western states still practise polygamy and the issue is one of the main obstacles to the religion being accepted as a mainstream branch of Christianity .
If you thought those McCain - Palin crowds were feral inside the auditoriums , they ’ve even more rancid waiting in line to get in …
The traditions we associate with Christmas have evolved over the centuries .
Here are answers to five questions about these traditions , from the date we choose to celebrate to the origin of Santa .
1 . Why do we celebrate on December 25th ?
The Bible makes no mention of Jesus being born on December 25th and , as more than one historian has pointed out , why would shepherds be tending to their flock in the middle of winter ?
So why is that the day we celebrate ?
Well , either Christian holidays miraculously fall on the same days as pagan ones or the Christians have been crafty in converting pagan populations to religion by placing important Christian holidays on the same days as pagan ones .
And people had been celebrating on December 25th ( and the surrounding weeks ) for centuries by the time Jesus showed up .
The Winter Solstice , falling on or around December 21st , was and is celebrated around the world as the beginning of the end of winter .
It is the shortest day and longest night and its passing signifies that spring is on the way .
In Scandinavian countries , they celebrated the solstice with a holiday called Yule last from the 21st until January and burned a Yule log the whole time .
In Rome , Saturnalia — a celebration of Saturn , the God of agriculture — lasted the entire end of the year and was marked by mass intoxication ( a tradition your uncle still upholds to this day ) .
In the middle of this , the Romans celebrated the birth of another God , Mithra ( a child God ) , whose holiday celebrated the children of Rome .
When the Christianity became the official religion of Rome , there was no Christmas .
It was not until the 4th century that Pope Julius I declared the birth of Jesus to be a holiday and picked December 25th as the celebration day .
By the middle ages , most people celebrated the holiday we know as Christmas .
2. How did Americans come to love the holiday ?
The American Christmas is , like most American holidays , a mishmash of Old World customs mixed with American inventions .
While Christmas was celebrated in America from the time of the Jamestown settlement , our modern idea of the holiday did n't take root until the 19th century .
The History Channel credits Washington Irving with getting the ball rolling .
In 1819 he published The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon , gent. , an account of a Christmas celebration in which a rich family invites poor folk into their house to celebrate the holiday .
The problem ( if you 're so inclined to call it such ) was that many of the activities described in Irving 's work , such as crowning a Lord of Misrule , were entirely fictional .
Nonetheless , Irving began to steer Christmas celebrations away from drunken debauchery and towards wholesome , charitable fun .
Throughout the rest of the 19th century , Christmas gained popularity and Americans adopted old customs or invented new ones , such as Christmas tress , greeting cards , giving gifts and eating a whole roasted pig ( or is that just my family ? ) .
3 . Who popularized Christmas trees ?
Since time immortal , humans have been fascinated with the color green and plants that stay green through winter .
Many ancient societies — from Romans to Vikings — would decorate their homes and temples with evergreens in the winter as a symbol of the returning growing season .
But the Christmas tree did n't get going until some intrepid German dragged home and decorated a tree in the 16th century .
Legend has it that Martin Luther himself added lighted candles to his family 's tree , starting the trend ( and leading to countless fires through the years ) .
In America , the Christmas tree did n't catch on until 1846 when the British royals , Queen Victoria and the German Prince Albert , were shown with a Christmas tree in a newspaper .
Fashionable people in America mimicked the Royals and the tree thing spread outside of German enclaves in America .
Ornaments , courtesy of Germany , and electric lights , courtesy of Thomas Edison 's assistants , were added over the years and we have n't changed much since .
4 . What 's the deal with Santa Claus ?
The jolly , red - suited man who sneaks into your home every year to leave you gifts has n't always been so jolly .
The real Saint Nick was a Turkish monk who lived in the 3rd century .
He was known for being charitable and selfless , eventually becoming the patron saint of sailors and children .
According to legend , he was a rich man thanks to an inheritance from his parents , but he gave it all away in the form of gifts to the less - fortunate .
He eventually became the most popular saint in Europe and , through his alter ego , Santa Claus , remains so to this day .
But how did a long - dead Turkish monk become a big , fat , reindeer - riding pole dweller ?
The Dutch got the ball rolling be celebrating the saint — called Sinter Klaas — in New York in the late - 18th century .
Our old friend , Washington Irving , included the legend of Saint Nick in his seminal History of New - York as well , but at the turn of the 18th century , Saint Nick was still a rather obscure figure in America .
On December 23 , 1823 , though , a man named Clement Clarke Moore published a poem he had written for his daughters called " An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas , "  better known now as " T'was the Night Before Christmas . " 
Nobody knows how much of the poem Moore invented , but we do know that it was the spark that eventually lit the Santa fire ( just hopefully not in the same fireplace he slips down on Christmas Eve ) .
Many of the things we associate with Santa — a sleigh , reindeer , Christmas Eve visits — came from Moore 's poem .
From 1863 - 1886 , Thomas Nast 's illustrations of Santa Claus appeared in Harper 's Weekly — including a scene with Santa giving gifts to Union soldiers .
Not much has changed since the second half of the 19th century : Santa still gets pulled in a sleigh by flying reindeer , he still wears the big red suit and he still sneaks down chimneys to drop off presents .
Contrary to popular belief , the Coca - Cola company did not invent the modern Santa .
They did , however , learn how to use his image to get parents to buy soda during winter .
5 . Who invented Rudolph ?
Santa did get one more friend in 1939 .
Robert May , a copywriter for the Montgomery Ward department store chain , wrote a little story about a 9th reindeer with a disturbing red nose for a booklet to give customers during the holiday season .
Ten years later , May 's brother would put the story to music , writing the lyrics and melody .

Ken Gregg recommends four free online books online may be of interest to you :
Carl Watner 's excellent collection of antipolitical essays by various authors , " I Must Speak Out : The Best of The Voluntaryist 1982 - 1999 " ( San Francisco : Fox & Wilkes , 1999 . 499 pp. ) is now available .
This collection contains some of the finest essays from the nonpolitical ( or social ) libertarian standpoint available .
For those who are only familiar with the political libertarian thinking will find many of these essays an eye - opener .
John A. Pugsley 's The Alpha Strategy ( Common Sense Press , 1980 . 194 pp. ) is also available at his Bio-Rational Institute ( which I recommend ) .
This was the work that brought John Pugsley on the NYT best - seller list for 9 weeks .
Richard D. Fuerle has two books online : The Pure Logic of Choice ( Grand Island NY : Spooner Press , 1986 ) and Natural Rights : A New Theory ( 2003 ) .
The first work I read when it was published and was quite impressed with it .
It still holds up quite well as an independent work on Austrian economic theory and freedom .
The second work I 've only cursorily read and find his theory of rights coherent and his elaborations worth reading more carefully .
The carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo will take off for the first time before Christmas ( Image : Virgin Galactic )
The carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo will loft SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of about 15 km , where it will launch to the edge of space ( Image : Virgin Galactic )
Virgin Galactic ’s WhiteKnightTwo is set to take is maiden flight in the next two weeks .
The flight will be the first of dozens planned for the high - altitude craft , which could become the first privately owned vehicle to help carry tourists to the edge of space .

The high - altitude plane is designed to loft an eight - passenger craft called SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of 15 kilometres .
There , the spaceship will detach from WhiteKnightTwo and fire a rocket to take passengers some 100 km above the Earth , where they will experience several minutes of zero gravity ( see illustration ) .
The pair are scaled - up versions of a carrier plane and spaceship that won the $ 10 million Ansari X prize for private spaceflight in 2004 .
Since WhiteKnightTwo ’s unveiling in July , the plane has passed engine and runway tests and taken small hops off the ground .
The vehicle , which was developed at Scaled Composites in Mojave , California , is now ready to take off , says Virgin Galactic president Will Whitehorn .
“ The first flight test will happen very quietly , as these things tend to do , but it will be before Christmas , ” Whitehorn told New Scientist .
Piloting WhiteKnightTwo may take some finesse .
The plane is comparable in size to Boeing ’s B - 29 Superfortress , a heavy , long - range bomber that flew during World War II .
Twisting effect
The craft has two fuselages , each with a cabin , that are connected by a 42 - metre - long wing capable of holding 17 tonnes of weight .
“ The configuration makes a lot of sense ” for carrying heavy payloads , says MIT aeronautical engineer John Hansman .
But as WhiteKnightTwo begins to fly at higher altitudes , pilots might have to watch for effects such as “ flutter , ” where aerodynamic effects exacerbate natural twisting in the wings .
“ In very severe cases , you get into an oscillation that actually builds and blows the airplane apart , ” Hansman told New Scientist .
WhiteKnightTwo might be less susceptible to this effect , since it is made of fairly stiff carbon composite , Hansman says .
Glide tests
If WhiteKnightTwo ’s test flights go well , the firm plans to begin carrying SpaceShipTwo into the air in mid-2009 .
In its first solo flights , SpaceShipTwo will gently glide back to Earth without firing its rockets , slowly exploring its ability to reach suborbital space .
To ensure safety , WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo may require 100 to 200 test flights before the pair are ready to accept passengers , Whitehorn says .
This testing regime should still put the firm on track to take its first passengers to the edge of space as early as 2010 , Whitehorn says .
Virgin Galactic has accumulated some $ 40 million in deposits from almost 300 interested space farers since the company began selling tickets in 2005 .
Climate studies
But the firm will have competition in the suborbital space tourism market .
On 2 December , XCOR Aerospace announced it would sell rides on its two - seat spacecraft Lynx for less than half of Virgin ’s $ 200,000 ticket .
If WhiteKnightTwo ’s initial flights go well , the plane will carry atmospheric testing equipment on the rest of its test flights , Whitehorn says .
The equipment , part of a collaboration with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , will test the air at high altitudes , which are understudied because they are difficult for most aircraft to reach .
The data collected could also help calibrate NASA ’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory , which will launch in 2009 to measure carbon dioxide levels in Earth ’s atmosphere , Whitehorn says .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Telescopes on land have caught the first real visual images of multiple planets orbiting another star .
An image taken aboard the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope in 2006 shows the newly discovered planet , Fomalhaut b , orbiting its parent star , Fomalhaut .
The small white box at lower right pinpoints the planet 's location .

The orbiting Hubble Space Telescope has found its own planet , the first so - called exoplanet to be found purely visually .
One set of images shows three giant planets orbiting a star named HR8799 in the constellation Pegasus , about 130 light - years away from the Earth .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , or 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion km ) .
The planets are several times the mass of Jupiter .
“ We finally have an actual image of an entire system , ” said Bruce Macintosh , an astrophysicist from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and a member of the team of scientists who made the observations .
“ This is a milestone in the search and characterization of planetary systems around stars . ”
About 300 planets have been found orbiting other stars besides the Earth ’s sun , but they have been found using indirect measurements , mostly looking at their effects on the gravitational fields of their suns .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ Every extrasolar planet detected so far has been a wobble on a graph , ” Macintosh said in a statement .
“ We ’ve been trying to image planets for eight years with no luck and now we have pictures of three planets at once . ”
Writing in Friday 's issue of the journal Science , the astronomers said they used the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii to get the pictures , which can be seen on the Internet at www.gemini.edu.
The images show blurred smudges that the astronomers are sure are the planets .
In the second study , University of California , Berkeley , astronomer Paul Kalas and colleagues used the Hubble Space Telescope to image a planet they call Fomalhaut b , orbiting the star Fomalhaut , which is 25 light years from Earth in the constellation Piscis Australis ( the Southern Fish ) .
Kalas has two photographs of the planet , taken in 2004 and 2006 , that show that its movement over the 21 months fits what would be expected from a planet orbiting Fomalhaut every 872 years at a distance of 11 billion miles .
“ I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star , ” Kalas said in a statement .
“ It ’s a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen . ”
None of the giant planets would be candidates to host life -- they are large and hot , like Jupiter , and orbit far away from their suns .
But if large planets are there , astronomers believe at least some of the solar systems would have smaller , rocky planets like Mars or Earth that are much harder to spot .
Studying these other solar systems also could help in understanding how our own evolved .
“ Fomalhaut b may actually show us what Jupiter and Saturn resembled when the solar system was about a hundred million years old , ” Kalas said .
The Gemini team reported in September that they had snapped the first photographs of an extrasolar planet , orbiting a star about 500 light - years from Earth .
Nearly half of the population in England and Wales now live in areas of " water stress " where supply might not keep up with demand - a problem usually associated with parched regions such as north Africa and the Middle East .
The huge pressure on water supplies from large and wealthy populations in areas with relatively low rainfall is detailed in the most comprehensive report yet on the state of water resources by the Environment Agency .
The report , which will be published in the new year , warns that many rivers , lakes , estuaries and aquifers are already being drained so low that there is a danger to wildlife and a risk to public supplies in dry years , especially as climate change brings drier summers while the population is increasing .
People are also using far too much water .
The study says average water use is 148 litres per person per day , and as high as 170 litres in the south - east of England - compared to a government target of 130 .
The agency will use the report to argue for aggressive increases in the number of homes with water meters to reduce demand , and will support proposals by water companies to spend billions of pounds on infrastructure projects such as reservoirs and desalination plants to improve supplies and protect the environment .
It is also expected to argue for a new system of regulation under which companies would be allowed to earn more profit if they reduced demand , a system pioneered in California and already being considered for UK energy companies .
" We 're seeing a shift from how we ran things over the last 100 years , " said Trevor Bishop , the agency 's head of water resource policy .
" The Victorians gave us a legacy of infrastructure ... they predicted what the future needed and provided for it .
We can't carry on doing that ad infinitum .
" We [ will ] have 10 - 20 million extra people , we have got climate change ; all the things we have done in the past will get less and less certain and more vulnerable , so what we 're doing is trying to manage demands down . "
The report brings together for the first time new and published data about the availability and use of water for 21 water companies , 24.3 m households and a population of 54.4 m .
Scotland is covered by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , and Northern Ireland by the devolved administration .
On average , water demand is 10 % of " effective rainfall " - what is left over after evaporation to recharge rivers , lakes and aquifers .
But because rainfall , population density and water use vary widely , a large area from Kent , north to the Humber estuary and west beyond Oxford is internationally classified as " water stressed " because abstraction is normally more than 20 % of effective rainfall .
By this definition , 10.5 m households and 24.1 m people have less water available per person than Morocco and Egypt , says the report .
Though hotter , these drier countries have lower populations .
" We do n't look like [ Morocco ] because we have got a very , very sophisticated public water supply system [ and ] a different environmental situation , " said Bishop .
" What [ water stress ] means for us is the risk of extreme drought and the infrastructure we rely on to supply our water resources would come under stress . "
Other statistics show :
• 30 % of homes have a water meter , and on average they use 13 % less water than unmetered households ;
• In a third of the 119 catchment areas into which water bodies are divided , legal limits on abstraction were ( or could be if fully used ) exceeding safe levels for habitats , including chalk rivers and wetlands ;
• Measured against European standards due in 2015 , more than 90 % of sites were or were probably at risk of failing because of pollution from " point sources " like factories and / or run -off from farms and roads - though many of these by only one of up to 37 measures ;
• Under expected climate change , river flows would rise in winter but would fall on average by half in summer and autumn , and some by as much as 80 % .
Water resources were " in many respects far better " than in the past , but rising demand , lower supplies and tougher standards meant a raft of policies were needed to keep taps flowing and the environment protected , said Bishop .
Water companies have submitted plans to invest £ 27bn in maintaining and improving infrastructure for water supplies and sewage treatment in the five years between 2010 - 15 , up from nearly £ 20bn in the previous five years .
The total , and the impact on customer bills , will be decided by the industry regulator , Ofwat , in 2009 .
There were " pros and cons " to plans put forward , including desalination and new reservoirs , said Bishop .
The agency also wants companies in the south - east to speed up plans to increase water metering to 80 % of homes by 2030 .
President - elect Obama and McCain meet for the first time since the election Zogby wo n’t duplicate Obama poll
Pollster John Zogby has rejected a conservative commentator ’s offer to sponsor a poll to test the knowledge of people who voted for John McCain .
The commentator was proposing to mirror a poll of Obama voters that caused a political uproar when it suggested that Obama supporters did n’t know what they were voting for .

John Ziegler , a Burbank - based documentary filmmaker , had commissioned the poll of 512 Obama voters .
The results delighted the right and inflamed the left , drawing widespread coverage on the Web , cable news and radio .
Zogby International said in its summary of the results : “ Just 2 percent of voters who supported Barack Obama on Election Day obtained perfect or near - perfect scores on a post-election test which gauged their knowledge of statements and scandals associated with the presidential tickets during the campaign , a new Zogby International telephone poll shows . ”
Ziegler posted the results and a video of Obama voter interviews at HowObamaGotElected.com .
John Zogby said in a statement defending the poll : “ We reject the notion that this was a push poll because it very simply was n't . …
In this case , the respondents were given a full range of responses and were not pressured or influenced to respond in one way or another .
This poll was not designed to hurt anyone , which is obvious as it was conducted after the election . ”
Zogby told Politico in a telephone interview that the volume of reaction was in the top 10 percent he had received to his 24 years of polling .
This week , Ziegler proposed to pay for a similar poll of McCain voters .
But Zogby told Politico he will not do the poll the same way .
“ I am happy to do a poll of both Obama voters and McCain voters , with questions that I formulated and sponsored either by an objective third party or by someone on the left , in tandem with a John Ziegler on the right — but poll questions that have my signature , ” Zogby said .
“ I believe there was value in the poll we did , ” Zogby added .
“ I also believe it was not our finest hour .
This slipped through the cracks .
It came out critical only of Obama voters . ”
Ziegler responded : " I am shocked by John 's statement that he would do another poll but not an exact duplication .
What is the point of that ?
Not their finest hour ?
This a was great poll .
This did n't fall through any ' cracks , ' they just got scared .
...
The point of the poll was for my documentary on the media 's impact on voter knowledge . "
Ziegler had e-mailed Karen Scott , managing editor of Zogby International : “ I am writing because there is great interest in commissioning the same poll of McCain voters , and I have obtained the money to do so .
If done right I think this can be a win / win for everyone .
Please advise me as to the company 's thinking on this . ”
Scott e-mailed Ziegler in response : “ Thank you for being in touch with us ; I am sorry no one got back to you yesterday .
Your request has been reviewed here at all levels , and we are not interested in this project at this time . ”
Ziegler told Politico : “ I ’m outraged .
I find this amazing .
There was nothing wrong with the original poll .
I ’m the exact same person I was last week .
The left - wing blogosphere basically demanded this . ”
Nate Silver , the founder of FiveThirtyEight.com , who has closely followed the controversy , said he saw " significant problems with this poll that would not have been resolved merely by interviewing McCain supporters in addition to Obama supporters . "
" Many of the questions included items that were misleading , taken out of context , or arguably untrue , but which were represented as factual to the respondent , " Silver wrote in an e-mailed statement .
" The only reason that Mr. Ziegler 's original survey got stupid answers from Obama 's supporters is because he asked stupid questions . "
A Blackberry containing sensitive information belonging to the now - defunct presidential campaign of John McCain has made its way into the hands of a Fox 5 reporter , who was able to purchase the unwiped device for a mere $ 20 .
The Blackberry , which was sold this week during a liquidation sale , contained some 50 phone numbers of people connected to the campaign and hundreds of emails that spanned from September until a few days following the November 4 election .
" Given the way the campaign was run , this is not a surprise , " a staffer contacted by Fox 5 said .
There 's another reason it does n't come as a shock that the electronic device was sold without first being purged of its digital secrets :
After all , McCain in July confessed he was still " learning to get online " and " becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need . "
We only wonder what 's still stored on the laptops that sold for $ 600 . ®
( CNNMoney.com ) --
In speech after speech , presidential candidate John McCain hammers on the claim that his rival Barack Obama will raise taxes on many small businesses .
At the debate on Wednesday night , McCain said , " The small businesses that we 're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now . "
More typically he has said : " What [ Obama ] has n't told you is that he would tax half of the income of small businesses in America , " a line used in La Crosse , Wisc. , last week .
Should small business owners fear for their wallets if Obama is elected ?
Not the vast majority , business and tax experts say .
To make its claim , according to a McCain spokesman , the campaign counts as a small - business owner any taxpayer who files a Schedule C , E or F - the forms used to report gains and losses from business ventures and farms .
Using that definition and citing IRS data , the campaign notes that " 56.8 % of total small business income is earned by businesses in the top two rates , which Barack Obama has pledged to raise . "
It 's true that Obama has proposed raising taxes on the top two income rates .
But there are three main problems with McCain 's charge .
What is a small business ?
First , it relies on a broad definition of what counts as a small business , including everyone who files a Schedule C , E and F .
But most people who file those forms do n't run a business for a living :
Those forms are also used to report income from freelance and consulting work , real - estate rentals , and most other non-salary sources .
For example , McCain and Obama both file Schedule C returns , thanks to their book royalties - but they hardly should be considered small business owners .
In 2005 , there were 21.5 million Schedule C returns filed , according to the IRS .
A more realistic definition of small businesses turns up far fewer firms .
The Small Business Administration estimates that there were 6 million small businesses in 2005 , as measured by those with fewer than 500 employees and with staff on the payroll other than the owner .
Who pays ?
Second , even using the broad definition of small business that McCain likes , very few owners would see their own taxes rise .
That 's because the lion 's share of taxable income comes from a small number of wealthy businesses .
Out of 34.7 million filers with business income on Schedules C , E or F , 479,000 filers fall into the top two brackets , according to an analysis of projected 2009 filings by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
The other 34.3 million - or 98.6 % - would be unaffected by Obama 's proposed rate hike .
That includes Joe " The Plumber " Wurzelbacher , whom McCain invoked nearly two dozen times at the debate Wednesday night to illustrate the plight of the average worker and small business owner .
" Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years ... he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes , " McCain said .
In an interview afterward with WTOL , Wurzelbacher acknowledged that he'd still like to eventually buy the plumbing company he works for but that he would n't yet be hit by higher taxes .
" I want to set the record straight : Currently I would not fall into Barack Obama 's $ 250,000 - plus , " he said .
" But if I 'm lucky in business and taxes do n't go up then maybe I can grow the business and be in that tax bracket - well , let me rephrase it .
Hopefully , that tax wo n't be there . "
Few owners are that lucky in business .
In a member survey conducted late last year , the National Federation of Independent Business ( NFIB ) found that only 14 % of respondents said they had $ 200,000 or more in annual income .
As Tax Policy Center fellow Len Berman recently told Fortune Small Business : " Most owners of small businesses have small incomes . "
What gets taxed ?
Third , even if you 're one of the rare business owners making enough money to be affected by Obama 's proposed tax increases , you still wo n't see a big hike in your tax bill .
McCain 's claim that Obama " will increase taxes on 50 % of small business revenue " - the line he used in the second presidential debate - is incorrect because of how income is taxed .
If a business owner falls into the top bracket , that does n't mean that all of his or her income is taxed at the highest level .
For example :
If a small - business owner makes $ 210,000 in taxable income , he edges into the 33 % bracket , one of the two top tax rates that Obama would like to raise .
But he would pay the higher tax only on the amount that exceeds the cutoff - in 2007 , the two top tax rates applied to single filers with income of $ 160,850 or more and joint filers with income of at least $ 195,850 .
As a single filer , this business owner would see his federal taxes increase $ 1,475 under Obama 's plan , which calls for raising the 33 % tax rate to 36 % .
" While Obama does favor raising the top two rates , the quote is not true because not all the small business income of those in the top two rates is taxed at the 33 % and 35 % rates , " said Gerald Prante , a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation .
The bottom line : McCain 's claim only works by using an overly broad definition of what counts as a " small business " - and even with that definition , fewer than 2 % of business owners would be hit by Obama 's proposed rate increase .
For those who are affected , the increase would be levied only on a part of their earnings , not all of them .

This one , to borrow from the President - elect on the infinitely vexing question of when precisely human life begins , is above my pay grade .
So I call on our revered professors of journalism to settle the matter as only they , in all their sonorous wisdom , can .
It concerns our friends at Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox News and a conundrum they faced .
Now available on YouTube is a post-election chat between Fox anchor Shepard Smith and chief political correspondent Carl Cameron , in which the latter relates how a McCain staffer told him that , when she joined the ticket , Sarah Palin was labouring under the belief that Africa was a country rather than a continent .
We need not spell out the impact this revelation would have had on an electorate already tending towards the dubious over the Alaskan Governor ’s credentials to lead the free world should McCain die ( that oft - quoted actuarial 7 - 2 shot ) during his first term .
It would have indisputably ended any lingering chance Fox ’s preferred candidate had of winning the White House .
Mr Cameron peremptorily explained that he had n’t seen fit to share this with the public because it “ was off the record until after the election ” .

It ’s worth noting here how taken Mr Murdoch was with Mrs Palin , patting her on the back and whispering “ thank you very much ” as they emerged from a charity gala in late September .
A little earlier , meanwhile , the New York Post ( as much the mouthpiece of his world view in the US as The Sun is here ) had described her in a leader as “ charming ” and , with wonted prescience , “ rock solid ” .
So the question is as follows .
Was Carl Cameron ’s startling reticence a stirring expression of the highest journalistic ethics regarding the respecting of a confidence ?
Or was this in fact the most irresponsible , cowardly and despicable instance of partisan self - censorship in broadcast media history ?
Professors , it ’s over to you .
A missed target
If the mild temptation with this one is to sneer and tease , the overpowering emotion is pity .
For the editors of our newspapers , daily beset by a range of insoluble problems into which it is too depressing to go , here was a gift from God .
After an election that established with brutal clarity how in America the internet has already relegated the printed word to the status of aged uncle sitting bemusedly in the corner , here was a blessed chance to put a stamp of sorts on an event of historical significance .
And to its credit , with near unanimity , our editors accepted the gift with glee with a series of uplifting front pages .
And so to Peter Hill of the Daily Express .
Charged with capturing the mood on Thursday , “ Target Obama ” was Peter ’s headline for a splash dwelling on the bullet - proof screen behind which Obama made his acceptance speech .
As if the obvious needed spelling out in a two - paragraph brief on page 29 .
Gifted an opportunity to offer that fabled first take on history , this was the best Peter could manage .
Win for stats supremo
Our award for Website of the Year goes to fivethirtyeight.com , on which Nate Silver analysed the staggering weight of polling data with an insightful brilliance unwitnessed in this field even from the golden pen of Times number cruncher Peter Riddell .
Many polling firms had spectacular elections , but Silver ’s final popular - vote projection came within two tenths of a percentage of the reality , and a media superstar was born .
Pure parody
A joy to note the spreading influence of sportswriter Simon Barnes – who once assured us that Roger Federer “ is as myriad - minded as Shakespeare ever was ” – on his colleagues at the Times .
“ Arsenal ’s football was pure parody for much of the first half , ” declared the genuinely excellent Matt Hughes of a scoreless Champions League effort last week , “ a work of art beautifully constructed but ultimately worthless .
Were they mocking the notion of art itself ? ”
Were they ?
Was that what Cesc Fabregas , Gaël Clichy and Robin van Persie were up to at the Emirates ?
I think , on balance , it certainly was .
Half measures
It would be a crime against humanity to allow this diary to pass without mentioning my favourite columnist ’s take on Obama ’s victory .
Jon Gaunt tells
Sun readers that he ’s irked by talk of Obama being black when half of him is white .
“ Surely the fact that he is mixed - race is a more potent symbol of how far America has progressed … ”
Or might it have been even more potent had the US elected a jet - black descendant of slaves with no reassuringly middle - American genetic heritage ?
As so often with his musings , we could spend months pondering the question and be not one inch closer to the answer .
Play nicely , children
Elsewhere in another flawless column , Gaunty rebukes the comedian Kevin Day , “ who squared up to me this week and accused me of slagging him off ” .
Gaunty had accused Kevin of being a faux - football supporter .
“ Grow up , you pathetic specimen – you must be nearly 50 years old , not 15 , ” he thunders .
“ ‘ Oohmummy , Gaunty says I ’m not a real football fan ! ’ ”
The infantile preciousness of these media types , eh ?
It is three weeks today since Gaunty rang me in the highest of umbrage ( “ I ’m not having you making out I ’m thick , you twat ” ) over the perceived suggestion that he included Rolf Harris among his Top 10 Brits – shame on Daunt ’s in London ’s latte - sipping Holland Park , by the way , for not stocking the new book – in ignorance of Rolf ’s nationality .
Jon Gaunt is 47 ¾ .
At a time when retailers are slashing prices to attract last - minute Christmas shoppers , many stores are n't marking down certain popular gift items at all .
That 's because of little - known manufacturer agreements that require retailers to refrain from discounting , especially in any advertising .
If retailers do n't comply , manufacturers sometimes stop subsidizing ads or cut off supplies altogether .
This season 's products affected by pricing agreements include Guitar Hero World Tour Band Kit from Activision Blizzard Inc. , documents show .
The video musical game has been priced at $ 189 at Best Buy Inc. , Circuit City Corp . and Toys " R " Us Inc. since its October release .
A new rival product , Electronic Arts Inc. 's Rock Band 2 Special Edition , also has been retailing for that price at all three outlets .
" Activision Publishing Inc. would like to inform you of its Minimum Advertised ( ' MAP ' ) program , " the game maker wrote to retailers in a letter dated Sept. 24 .
The letter , which says it wo n't subsidize any advertisements that violate the policy , goes on to list 19 products and their minimum prices , including Guitar Hero and the James Bond : Quantum of Solace videogame .
Activision Blizzard did n't respond to requests for comment .
Sharp elbows are already flying in the Obama camp .
With Barack Obama the first avid basketball player to be elected president , political appointees , college coaches and NBA officials are all angling to get in on the game .
Mr. Obama -- whose jump shot earned him the nickname Barry O'Bomber at Hawaii's Punahou School -- has hired a team of cabinet members and aides with serious basketball backgrounds .
Many of them are planning for regular court time with the president , according to Mr. Obama 's transition press team .

" While the world knew him as a great story teller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us - and entertained us all while doing so - his wife Sherri , daughter Taylor , family and friends knew Michael Crichton as a devoted husband , loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes , " his family said in a statement on the website .
" He did this with a wry sense of humor that those who were privileged to know him personally will never forget . "
The Crichton family asked for privacy and said a private funeral service would be held for the author .
Crichton was born in Chicago on October 23 , 1942 and wrote his first novels under pen names while attending Harvard Medical School .
" The Andromeda Strain , " which was published in 1969 , became his first best - seller .
In addition to " Jurassic Park " and its sequel , " The Lost World , " which became blockbuster Hollywood films , Crichton wrote " Congo , " " The Terminal Man , " " Prey " and " State of Fear " among others .
More than a dozen of his novels have been made into films and in 1996 he won an Emmy for " ER . "

The famous Robinson Crusoe story was inspired by real events
Archaeologists have unearthed evidence of the campsite of a marooned sailor who is said to have inspired the fictional castaway Robinson Crusoe .
The findings , carried in the journal Post - Medieval Archaeology , follow digs on a Pacific island west of Chile .
Daniel Defoe is believed to have based Crusoe on Alexander Selkirk , a Scotsman rescued from the island in 1709 .
Evidence suggests the sailor built two shelters near a stream , with a look - out point to watch for approaching ships .
The island used to be known as Aguas Buenas , but has been renamed Robinson Crusoe Island after the character created by Defoe in his 18th Century classic .
The team also unearthed a pair of navigational dividers from the period , which they believe belonged to Selkirk .
The captain of the ship which found Selkirk referred to a number of mathematical instruments in his possession .
He also spoke of Selkirk shooting wild goats to help his survival on the Pacific island , although there were no relics of that activity .
David Caldwell , from National Museums Scotland , said : " The evidence uncovered at Aguas Buenas corroborates the stories of Alexander Selkirk 's stay on the island and provides a fascinating insight into his existence there .
" We hope that Aguas Buenas , with careful management , may be a site enjoyed by the increasing number of tourists searching for the inspiration behind Defoe 's masterpiece . "

Debate upshot : Obama was the cooler hand

No one had to look at the latest polls to know that Sen. Barack Obama was taking command of the presidential election .
The expressions on Sen. John McCain 's face , and the irritation in his voice , said it all .
Tuesday night 's debate in Nashville , in a town hall format , did not break any significant new ground .
Anyone who has followed this campaign through the long primary season and the conventions would have recognized variations of lines that have become familiar by now .
Obama punctuated his points about the folly of deregulation and the Bush tax cuts and the costly distraction of the invasion of Iraq .
McCain hammered at his themes of experience , oil drilling and the importance of prevailing in Iraq .
At one point , when the discussion turned to the appropriate use of military force , McCain spoke of the need to have a " cool hand at the tiller . "
On this night , in a venue that put a premium on interpersonal dynamics , Obama was the cool hand at the tiller .
When McCain attacked , as he did more frequently than his opponent , Obama just smiled .
McCain 's body language in the cutaway shots was a portrait of frustration .
He smirked , grimaced and grabbed the microphone tightly .
He had no major gaffes , though he did have moments of awkwardness , such as when he pointed to Obama and referred to him as " that one . "
McCain could barely conceal his contempt for the Illinois senator .
Obama attacked less , and when he did , his delivery carried less edge .
He exuded the confidence of a candidate whose message of change was clearly benefiting from Americans ' anxiety about one of the worst economic crises in U.S. history .
John McCain always talked about town halls as his format , but this was Barack Obama 's night .
An Indonesian prosecutor has demanded that four Australians each be jailed for three years for violating immigration laws in Papua .
Queenslanders Vera Scott - Bloxam , 54 , Hubert Hufer , 57 , Karen Burke , 51 , and Keith Ronald Morimter , 60 , are facing trial in Merauke District Court .

Video Report From the Occupied Town of Xoxocotla , Morelos : Eyewitnesses Talk of Indiscriminate Attacks From Helicopters Using Weaponry Supplied by the United States
“ Take a Look for Yourselves and Size Up the Absurd Amount of Firepower Sent to Squash a Public Protest ”
By Gregory Berger
Special to The Narco News Bulletin
Three days ago I reported in these pages on the attack on the indigenous town of Xoxocotla , Morelos , in which the Mexican army participated , in blatant violation of the Mexican constitution .
Reporters and videographers faced harassment by armed soldiers and police while trying to do their work .
At least one reporter I spoke with was attacked by police and forced to surrender the video tape of what he had recorded .
We were able to shoot an hour ’s worth of video footage and get it out of Xoxocotla without being accosted by police or military personnel .
This past weekend , I was scheduled to give a video editing workshop from various local universities .
We took advantage of the activity to collectively edit this video report assembled from the material I shot .
Viewers should pay close attention to the close - up of the gas bomb dropped on an unsuspecting housewife by cowards in a helicopter :
The “ warning label ” is in English and the bomb itself was presumably manufactured in the United States .
As I reported in my previous article , the use of the military in Xoxocotla is very distressing and would never have been allowed to happen had the Calderon regime not gradually desensitized the public to the presence of the army on the streets as part of its so - called “ war on drugs . ”
Thanks to the “ Merida Initiative , ” approved by the U.S. Congress this year , such attacks are now paid for by U.S. tax dollars .
Take a look for yourselves and size up the absurd amount of firepower sent to squash a public protest .

I just loves me some Paul Krugman .
In a just world , a man of his credentials ( hello ?!?!
Nobel Prize in Economics ? ) would have far more weight than the bozos on the business channels still touting Friedman economics as the iceberg crashes into the bow and the water rises to their necks .
But sadly , the media still gives equal weight to the failed policies that got us in this predicament as if the recession occurred in some vacuum , devoid of any consequences of the Republicans hard - on for " free " market de-regulation .
Guest host Chip Reid asks Krugman if the recession is actually a blessing in disguise , because it opens the door for a 21st Century New Deal .
Krugman agrees , but only if we let go of the myth of " bipartisan agreement " :
He ’s [..] not going to get bipartisan consensus .
He may be able to get some moderate Republicans votes .
He may be able to get the moderate Republicans in the Senate – both of them -- to go…vote with the Democrats .
The point is , you look at what John Boehner is doing in the House right now , the House Republican Leader .
He ’s dead set against doing anything constructive right now .
He ’s actually soliciting on his website , saying if there are any credentialed economists who are willing to you know , say negative things about stimulus plans , please contact me .
So no , it ’s not going to be bipartisan , in the sense that leaders of both parties are going to get together .
Reaching out across the aisle , trying to find some sensible people on the Republican side is not the same thing .
I find it hilarious that after all of the petty partisanship of the last eight years that somehow it 's incumbent upon the Democrats to be the grown - ups in Washington and reach across the aisle .
Where was all the talk in the media circles of bipartisanship for the last eight years ?
Is it that the media knows that Republicans are n't mature enough to do so ?
And where , in all their history , have the Republicans shown themselves to be able to do anything for the good of the country instead of their party , as Krugman so aptly describes ?
Krugman is dead on right .
There will be no bipartisan consensus .
The Republicans ' agenda will be to obstruct and hobble as much of the Obama plans as possible to regain the majority in 2010 with the argument that the Democrats could n't do anything .
Boehner has all but admitted it .
So let 's let go of the notion of " bipartisanship " and get the majorities necessary to get things done .
Transcripts below the fold
REID : How do you see this recession and the response to it changing this country ?
I know you ’ve been arguing for a more progressive government for a long time and obviously , difficult times like this , I do n’t want to suggest that a recession is a good thing , but if looking back at this , five years or some number of years from now , can you envision a country that is better off because of how it responded to this recession ?
KRUGMAN : Well , if you believe , as I do , that we need a stronger social safety net , that we need Universal Health Care , than the revelation of just how vulnerable we are when things go wrong , is going to help .
If you believe that we ’ve gone way too far in this belief that the market is always right , that regulation is always wrong , than this is one heckuva lesson in what happens when you do n’t adequately regulate the financial markets .
So I think we may be seeing a swing of the political pendulum as a result of this crisis that will hopefully leave us a better nation in the long run .
We came out of the New Deal , we came out of the 1930s as a better country , a middle class country where we had been in the Gilded Age .
We came out as a country that took better care of its citizens .
That does n’t mean that you hope for a depression , right ?
So we hope that this thing is relatively short , shorter than I expect it to be , and it ’s not as bad as I expect it to be .
But yeah , we ’re learning something , and hopefully , we ’ll make some use of those lessons .
REID : Barack Obama has talked a lot about the need to reach across the aisle…on everything .
On all of his policies , foreign policy and this .
And clearly in the Senate , you ca n’t get anything done with … anything with less than 60 votes .
You need Republicans …
KRUGMAN : Right …
REID : … And in fact , I ’ve been told , on Capitol Hill , they want a lot more than 60 votes .
They want this to be genuinely bipartisan , which brings me to your book , which I was actually reading last night , and on page 272 — I ’m not playing ‘ gotcha ’ , but I just wanted to see — you talk about the fact that the Republican Party is controlled by ‘ movement Conservatives . ’
You then say , quote ‘… the notion , beloved of political pundits , that we can make progress through bipartisan consensus is simply foolish . ’
Are you suggesting that the kind of bipartisan consensus Barack Obama is looking for is foolish ?
KRUGMAN : He ’s …you know … that … he ’s not going to get bipartisan consensus .
He may be able to get some moderate Republicans votes .
He may be able to get the moderate Republicans in the Senate – both of them -- to go…vote with the Democrats .
The point is , you look at what John Boehner is doing in the House right now , the House Republican Leader .
He ’s dead set against doing anything constructive right now .
He ’s actually soliciting on his website , saying if there are any credentialed economists who are willing to you know , say negative things about stimulus plans , please contact me .
So no , it ’s not going to be bipartisan , in the sense that leaders of both parties are going to get together .
Reaching out across the aisle , trying to find some sensible people on the Republican side is not the same thing .

I do n't remember seeing Bradblog report this , but in October , the War Crimes Commission at the Hague issued six sealed indictments ( sealed until he leaves office ) against the Bushole himself .
Talk was they were about to do the same with Cheney and Rumsfeld .

Brad writes , ... accountability for international War Crimes requires an untiring , responsible , focused media to inspire the mobilization of a nation .
I totally agree .
I might add that accountability also requires that our so - called elected representatives behave in an untiring , responsible , focused , mobilizing sort of way as well .
Remember what happened when Kucinich read --- for hours -- his articles of impeachment against our so - called leader ?
Nada . Zip. Zilch .
Zero .
That 's from the media AND from our so - called elected representatives .
It 's shameful and intolerable .
Blaming the citizens is reminiscent of blaming the victim .
It is not our ( the citizens ' ) fault .
But , Turley is ultimately right .
Even though it is not our fault , the solution will be up to us .

Could someone on TV please ask these simple questions ?
1 ) What should happen to someone who tortures an innocent person ?
i.e. ,
If the person being tortured turns out to be innocent , what should be the punishment for the person (s ) doing the torturing , ordering the torture , and legalizing the torture ?
( as in most US cases in Iraq , Afghanistan and Gitmo ) 2 ) Torture should NEVER be legalized , because in extreme " ticking time - bomb " cases , the jury can always side with the torturer if they see a genuine necessity for it . .
Please spread the word on the film that will put BUSH BEHIND BARS !!!

Another weird phenomena I have noticed is that the general public does n't really want to know the whole truth either , they only want what fits into their tiny world view ... and somehow that is exactly what the MSM gives them ... due to mental conditioning I 'd guess .

a few coorperations with their own agenda ... if the msm wo n't tell the truth then it MUST fall to us .
the actions of a few can make a difference , but we are taking on the task of informing the entire herd .
sounds tuff , but only recently in our national history have we had the internet & cell phones , etc. our powers of communication are going 2 b our greatest asset & resource available in this & every new national injustice .
( on purpose ) the masses are often kept in the dark & then cursed for their blindness ( by the powers that b ) .
" for man is a social animal - only in the herd is he happy .
it is all one to him whether it is the profoundest nonsense or the greatest villainy - he feels completely at ease with it , so long as it is the view of the herd , or the action of the herd , & he is able to join the herd . "

I would argue , that the tools necessary for the public to provide oversight of government are already gone .
The corporate media has clealy left a trail of their stance on uncomfortable topics .
( As we have all learned here electronic vote tabulation devices , e.g. election fraud )
But their spin , propaganda and blacklists do not end there by far .
Yet on the other hand , corporate media does not have tools necessary to hold government accountable either .
What 's happened is our representatives no longer represent us .
How many letters have you written , and hours wasted only to the representative 's reply come from an automailer ?
Why should there be any difference between email , snail mail , fax , calling , or face to face ?
They fully know we want them to cut the crap , yet they continue on despite us .
Some of their replys do not even make sense .
They are living in a bubble world .
That may eventually work to our advantage , when the Bond Market implodes from ZIRP .
If the government has no more money , it 's no longer a government .
That 's how screwed up I see the situation .
Now we have laws saying if you steal over $ 5000 it's a felony .
( Somewhere on the Bradblog I talked about how OP Scanners cost slightly more , and therefore if you smash three with a hammer three times you could potentially get life in prison -- three strike law - - By Design ? --- Anyway ..)
So we have these banks , and people , stealing trillions now .
What 's up ?
Why ain't they in jail ?
Why not take the loss , clear the crap , reset ?
Why do we have ACTIVE DUTY Troops doing local law enforcement work ?
Why has the US Constitution not been defended by our own military ?
ANSWER : We no longer can control our own government .
They control us .
They can wipe the value of the dollar and make us slaves overnight .
Think ...
If your dollar is worth Zero then what do you call the work you did for the last 50 years ?
I 'll help you , it 's called " slave labor . "
I live in California , So I will pose an example .
We are not getting our budget passed right now .
Because we are literally BANKRUPT !
So why did we just have propositions on OUR LAST ballot for trillions of dollars for high - speed trains , schools , roads , infrastructure , law enforcement , healthcare , and my worst worry _LEVIE AND DAM REPAIRS_ !
These officials are completely wacked living in a bubble world .
So which Senate Majority are the people supposed to contact ?
What email address ?
What fax number ?
What are we supposed to say in legal speak ?
We are all too busy now trying to survive to know this .
And yeah corporate media is controlled by government as well .
Otherwise there would be no censorship of any word , or investigation .
But back in the 1800's we did n't have TV .
Somehow citizens had control of government .
On the other hand citizens walked around with guns back then too .
Think about it .
Incrementally over time , more tax , less in return , less rights , and now fear dictates our laws .
We have been completely pussy whiped .
And now we are about to get but fucked .
You wonder why the government bought a bunch of body bags and fema has built concentration camps ?
Now you know .
Your just one spirit reading this and in the big picture your life and my life do n't mean a damn thing to what they have planned .
After your dead it wo n't matter .
They have a whole generation of fuckups that do n't know what the US Constitution was .
Do n't care .
While those in the know use it against us SYMBOLICALLY , saying over and over that we have rights , yet when you get down to it , those rights have been removed .
It 's why they can lock up a poll - watcher .
It 's why they torture , it 's why they wo n't count votes , it 's why they stole all our money .
The sooner we get out of fantasy land and come to grips with the reality , the sooner we can take the pain and make this shit go away .
Sadly , it probably wo n't happen in my lifetime .
Who do you trust anymore ?
Your computer tech ?
Your Banker ?
Your Senator ?
Your local Cop ? FBI ?
CIA ?
NSA ?
Pentagon ?
Give me a fucking break .

Here is where the problem is .
The military swore an oath to protect the president and the US Constitution .
The President ( not as dumb as he looks ) has figured out that he can break his OWN OATH to the SAME .
This puts the US Military in a catch 22 .
They can't stop bush , because they must protect him , they can't protect the US Constitution cause Bush has fucked it up .
Add in the corrupt Senate .
And we have destroyed the Constitutional Republic we were given !
Okay ?
Do you fucking get it ?
No more US Constitution .
No more LAWS , except to control citizens .

The ONLY way these treasonous war criminals are going to see justice is if 10s of millions of angry citizens demand it by putting the proverbial boot heel on the necks of the entire mass media and forces them to tell the truth .
Then involve the global community .

Bugliosi says it will be up to either a State AG to prosecute for their own citizens ' murder , or a Federal AG on behalf of all murdered US soldiers as a result of the illegality of the Iraq conflict and occupation .
And it can only be done when Bush leaves office .
Which is why I 'm so nervous about the next 30 odd days .
For years I have contended that this group of thugs , thieves , and miscreants will not go quietly into that dark night - they will , in fact , rage .
They ARE raging .
If they leave office without the protections it affords , they know they are going down one way or another .
There has always been a strong international consciousness about the Bush administration , but how likely is it that there will be any bite to the bark this time ?
What 's the betting on a " Peaceful Transition of Power ? " 50/50 at best , and I 'm thinking 2:1 against is reasonable .
That Kierkegaard quote was brilliant .

Phil , breathe darling .. we won in the last election .
Have a friend with a masters in sociology .
Recently , she was going door to door trying to inform her local citizenry about a federal bio terroism lab which was due to locate in there ( against the law ) .
She felt because of hercommunit 's lack of interest in their own welfare that a big part was schock fatigue .

How DARE you , Mr. Turley ?
How DARE you put the blame on citizens ?
" this gigantic yawn " ?
Obama actually prevailing despite EVERYTHING THEY DID to try & steal THIS election too ... that looked like a " yawn " to you ?
Oh , but maybe you subscribe to the fiction that our elections being crooked is one of those lame , ludicrous tin - foil - hat conspiracy theories , who knows ?
" It is equally immoral to stand silent in the face of a war crime and do nothing , and that is what the citizens are doing "
Have you talked to Congress , Mr. Turley ?
To prosecutors ?
People who are actually in positions of power ?
Oh but , no .
It 's OUR fault .
We 're " SILENT " .
How DARE you stand there smug , well fed , securely housed and handsomely paid and tell US --- out here in bankruptcy & foreclosure land , with vaporized pensions , with dead - soldier - loved - ones , watching our country raped , robbed & beaten like a sex - trafficking - victim - whore --- that WE do not care .

What is the citizenry supposed to do ?
Millions have complained , blogged , marched , demonstrated , demanded accountability .
Unless he 's suggesting citizens do something very radical , which I do n't think he is , I 'm not entirely sure what " the people " can do aside from voice their displeasure and call for them to be prosecuted ?
What does he do ?
If all it takes is a few people to stop them why does n't he ?
Is n't he a citizen ?
You can't blame your citizens when you are one .
Tell me what to do to prosecute and I 'll do it .

Right on , Joan and Matt !
Mr. Turdley should look in the mirror to find at least one of the true culprits .
We 've gone to great lengths to try to enlighten our " leaders " - but all in vain , since they 're all sold , signed , sealed , and delivered .
The gallows and the Guillotine seem immediately appropriate ( I 'll stand by watching , smoking a Gauloise ) , but I 'm sure this gang of miscreants who have stolen civilization has some " enhanced " methods we could more efficiently apply .
I dare those sociopaths to try to get American soldiers to train their weapons on their fellow citizens ( true , the bad guys have gutted our education system to ensure an endless supply of ignorant cannon fodder , but ignorance is a natural condition , while stupidity is far rarer , and our soldiers are far from stupid ) .
As some great sage recently commented , " Fool me once , and , yeah , duh , I 'm fooled forever , " or something of that ilk .
I wish I could get into an alumni hockey game with duhbaya .
Sure , I 'd get 4 minutes for roughing , and five for fighting , and 10 - minute and game misconducts , probably , not to mention the high - sticking , cross-checking , slashing , and tripping ( prolly what would get me into the scrape in the first place , if you get my drift ) for what I 'd do to that miserable little cretin , but it would be worth it .
He 's pretty good at ducking clodhoppers , but I still have a slapshot .
( Disclaimer : this is no threat by any means - it 's simply a friendly challenge to a friendly little pick - up game of back - yard , Down - Maine , ice hockey .
Kennybunkport sounds just about fine . )
I seem to have gone off on a tangent .
I wish I knew a way out of this one , but in the event that things get even worse , I 'll be more than happy to help you all resettle into the ultimately reasonable , truly timeless heart of Europe .
( Take that , NSA ! )

I 'll add one more note to my comment - I think for me the most interesting legacy of the Bush presidency is the knoweldge that the constituation and laws are more of a gentleman 's agreement than anything else .
If it sounds like I 've given up hope of seeing anyone of signficance prosecuted and punished appropriately I more or less have .
The majority of the country holds Bush in low favarobility ratings , most people feel he does n't represent Democrats , Republicans or most Ameriacans but in the end it does n't seem to matter much .
America is vocal , they voted for the guy who was n't a Republican .
Citizens have the power of the vote and they turned the country and their districts over to the opposing party in hopes of straightening things out .
If Mr. Turely feels that voting , blogging , rallys , and expressing themself in everyway they can is n't enough to voice their dissaproval then the only next step is a revolution and lets face it , that can't happen .
This is n't a nation of muskets , where the group with more muskets win .
This is a nation of slow change and I think the people are on the path in that direction .
However if only a handful of people who run for public office for a major party are willing to prosecute the administration for their offenses I 'm not sure what else to do ?
Commenting on citizens apathy is the easy way out .
Providing solutions is tough .
I 'd like to hear someone as obviously bright as Mr. Turley provide solutions and organize .
Do n't come to me with problems , come to me with solutions .

" Liberte , egalite , fraternite ! "
" These are revolutionary times .
All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression , and out of the wounds of a frail world , new systems of justice and equality are being born .
The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before .
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light .
We in the West must support these revolutions .
It is a sad fact that because of comfort , complacency , a morbid fear of communism , and our proneness to adjust to injustice , the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries ...
Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit ... "

for example , how many comments on election night ?
or about Sibel Edmonds ?
can you tell how many people are paying attention by how many comments your blog receives on a particular subject ?
how come only 28 comments so far on the greatest political criminals EVER in american his - story ?
& some of them repeat offenders ... & hey reader , is no one really that interested ?
or maybe you are all smarter than me - to post on a public forum about my feelings toward prosecuting our current president ( according to the nuremberg statute (s ) .

Does anyone realise or suspect that until and / or unless the chief architects of the abuses of the American Constitution and fundamental Human Rights [ and some of their identities have been discussed on this tread , with all of them being a lot dumber than they would have you believe rather than you believing that they are not as dumb as they look ( COMMENT # 12 ...

[ with such a precedent and role model having already being set by themselves in prosecution of their nemesis / arch rival , Saddam Hussein ] .... will the dollar and the economy continue to decline and cause suffering even greater US suffering , as flight from the currency and realignment / reassessment of global strategic and political alliance render its power influence null and void / zero ?
Which incidentally , is a lot easier to do than you may be able to imagine .
Failure to resolve that conundrum , with so transparently removing that problem from the global stage , will cause the incoming Administration even more problems , for it can be fully expected that they will be battling against the old administration set-ups , which will then be " underground " and working entirely for themselves with no oversight .
Just because a Power Structure which has had two terms in Office , is turfed out of Office because of Gross Mismanagement and Feather Nesting , does not mean that their shenanigans will stop , whenever they have been able to do whatever they want and it is so lucrative .
The greatest enemy of Uncle Sam lies within and is invariably in the last Administration and its Offices which abused its Powers and has set up covert operations to feed itself Wealth and Influence .
And it is also probably the Real Al Qaeda too ...... hiding in full sight and inventing phantom enemies .
And if that is improbable , then it is probably so , delivering as IT does , an Almost Perfect Stealth .
Methinks Uncle Sam deserves
Better , do n't you ?

Get started
If you ’d like to save money , rest assured you can stash away some cash without too much time and effort .
There are plenty of easy savings tips that can help you spend less on everyday expenses and keep more of your hard - earned money .
Here are 31 ways to save money .
1 . Use the 30 - day rule
Whenever you want to buy something — especially if it ’s expensive — think about it .
Do n’t buy it on impulse .
Write down what it is and how much it costs .
While you ’re deciding whether to get it , deposit the money you ’d need to buy it in your savings account .
If it still appeals to you after 30 days , go ahead and buy it .
If not , the cash stays in your savings account .
2. Cancel your gym membership
Instead of going to the gym , which might be closed during the pandemic , exercise at home for free .
Watch workout tutorials on YouTube , download a fitness app like Freeletics or Ladder , or go for walks or a run around your neighborhood .
3. Buy used
Thanks to thrift stores , used - car sellers like CarMax and Carvana , and online resources like Craigslist , Facebook Marketplace and LetGo , you can get clothes , cars , electronics , and other things at a fraction of the cost of buying new .
4. Unsubscribe
Promotional emails touting great deals may tempt you to buy things you do n’t necessarily need .
To snuff out the temptation , unsubscribe from them so that you do n’t spend just because you find out about a flash sale or big discount .
5. Download money - saving apps
Money - saving apps can take the guesswork out of saving money by spending less .
Download popular apps like Ibotta , RetailMeNot and Checkout 51 to get coupons or cash back offers on the things you ’re already planning on buying .
6 . Take advantage of the library
Paying for books , magazines and movies can cost you some serious cash .
The good news is you can get them for free at your local library and stay entertained for hours without it taking a toll on your budget or bank account .
If you do n’t want to physically go to a library , use a digital public library .
7 . Say goodbye to paper
Get rid of or reduce your usage of paper towels , paper napkins and other paper products .
Use cloths or old clothing items that you can clean , save and reuse .
8 . Never miss a payment
Missing payments on your loans and credit cards can lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in late fees and interest charges .
To avoid wasting money due to late payments , enroll in automatic payments or schedule calendar reminders on your phone so you do n’t have to face late fees or other financial costs .
9. Buy generic
Compared to brand names , generic groceries , household products and medications are far more affordable .
Plus they ’re almost always just as good .
10 .
Choose cheaper cuts of meat
Meat can quickly cause your grocery bill to skyrocket , so opt for cheaper cuts of meat .
Swap chicken and steak for pork and ground turkey or beef .
If you do want to splurge on a Porterhouse steak , only buy it when it ’s on sale .
11 . Cut the cable cord
If you pay for cable , consider other less –expensive options instead .
Hulu , Netflix and Sling are a few good streaming video alternatives that can give you access to your favorite shows and movies without the high price tag .
12 . Sign up for rewards programs
Rewards programs are free to join and can save you some money on groceries , clothes and other products .
If there ’s a store or two you frequent regularly , sign up for them and start reaping the savings .
13 . Buy in bulk
Warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club offer a variety of items in bulk .
If you become a member , you ’ll be able to buy bulk products and save a lot of money over time .
14 . Turn off the lights
Keeping the lights on for an extended period of time can definitely increase your energy costs .
So , do n’t forget to turn off the lights any time you leave a room or your home .
15 . Invest in energy - efficient lightbulbs
You can also save on energy expenses by installing energy - efficient bulbs , such as LEDs , in your home .
They may cost you more upfront but will use less electricity and last longer than traditional light bulbs .
16 . Challenge yourself to a spending freeze
Go on a self - imposed spending freeze .
Do n’t make any nonessential purchases for a week or month .
If you succeed , reward yourself with a prize or purchase of your choice .
17 . Switch banks
Not all banks are created equal .
Switch to a bank that offers higher interest rates and better perks than the one you currently use .
If you run your life from your smartphone , consider online banks , which tend to pay higher rates and charge lower fees .
18 . Use a reusable water bottle
Drinking from plastic water bottles purchased at the store can add up quickly .
Use a reusable water bottle and drink tap water to avoid this expense .
19 . Meal prep
Plan and prepare your meals for the week every Saturday or Sunday .
This way , you ’ll be less likely to order takeout or overspend on groceries .
20 .
Buy frozen fruits and veggies
There ’s no denying that fresh produce is expensive .
With frozen fruits and veggies , you can save some cash and cut down on food waste .
21 . DIY gifts
The next time it ’s your friend ’s or family member ’s birthday , make him or her a homemade gift instead of buying one .
You ’ll keep more of your money , and they ’ll be thrilled by your thoughtfulness and creativity .
22 . Shop around for car insurance
Get quotes from several car insurance companies .
If you find a better rate elsewhere , let your current provider know to see if they can match it .
If not , switch carriers .
23 . Ditch bad habits
Not only can smoking and drinking alcohol damage your health , these habits can wreak havoc on your bank account .
Quit them and change your life for the better .
24 . Make a shopping list
Do n’t go grocery shopping without a list .
Once you ’re at the store , say no to impulse buys and only buy the items that are on your list .
25 . Create a zero - based budget
With a zero - based budget , you ’ll allocate every penny of your monthly income toward a certain expense or savings goal that can be justified .
This can help you avoid poor spending habits .
26 . Do n’t stress spend
If you tend to go shopping when you ’re feeling stressed , find other ways to relieve your stress .
Call a friend , soak in a warm bath or do some yard work .
27 .
Try to fix things on your own
It ’s expensive to hire a pro every time something breaks .
Use online tutorials and videos to learn how to make repairs by yourself .
28 . Buy a crock pot
If you lead a busy life , a crock pot can save you a lot of cash on takeout and drive thrus .
Dump some ingredients like meat , potatoes and carrots in the crock pot before work , turn it on , and come back to your kitchen hours later to a delicious meal .
29 .
Live in a smaller home
Chances are you ’d be just as happy ( and have less to clean and pay for ) in a smaller apartment , condo or house .
So do n’t be afraid to move and downsize if it makes financial sense .
30 .
Refinance your mortgage
If you own a house , refinance your mortgage while interest rates are at historic lows .
You can save thousands of dollars in interest over the life of your loan and also have the potential to lower your monthly payment .
31 . Stay healthy
Cook nutritious , well - balanced meals and exercise regularly to keep your health in check .
You ’ll spend less on doctor ’s visits , medications and co-pays .

Oliver Postgate , the creator of Bagpuss , The Clangers and a series of other classic children 's television programmes , has died at the age of 83 , his partner said today .
His other creations , including Noggin the Nog , Ivor the Engine and Pingwings , were screened on the BBC and ITV from the 1950s .
Postgate 's creations were made by Smallfilms , the company he set up with the artist and puppeteer Peter Firmin , and he also narrated all its productions .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Although only 13 episodes of Bagpuss were made from 1974 , the pink " saggy , old , cloth cat " remains fondly remembered and was voted Britain 's best - loved children 's television character .
Postgate 's partner , Naomi Linnell , confirmed he died at a nursing home near his home in Broadstairs , Kent , yesterday .
Born in Hendon , Middlesex , Postgate set up Smallfilms in a disused cowshed near Canterbury after spending his early years in a number of different jobs .
In October this year , the rights to many of his creations , including Bagpuss , The Clangers and Ivor the Engine , were acquired by media company Coolabi in a £ 400,000 deal .
In an interview with the BBC in 2005 , Postgate explained the process of how Bagpuss and some of his other characters came into being .
He said : " We would go to the BBC once a year , show them the films we 'd made , and they would say ' Yes , lovely , now what are you going to do next ? '
" We would tell them and they would say ' That sounds fine , we 'll mark it in for 18 months from now ' , and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance .
" And we 'd just go away and do it .
They had n't any ideas in their heads , and they were happy enough to leave that to us . "
In 1957 , Postgate married Prudence Myers , becoming stepfather to her three children , and the couple later had twins and another son .
Mrs Myers died in 1982 .
An active figure in the anti-nuclear campaign during the 1970s and 1980s , Postgate was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Kent in 1987 .
His autobiography , Seeing Things , was published in 2000 in which he charted his life from childhood to frustrated writer , political activist and inventor .

Via Skimble , a most interesting theory :
I have yet to see this reported anywhere , but an anonymous commenter named trademonster on an investment forum said this ( notice the dates ) : 01-09-06 06:49 AM
I 've heard that SEC is going to shut down Madoff financial and all of their hedge funds for SEC violations .
Can anyone confirm this ?
And this : 01-14-06 02:52 PM
I actually got some update and found out that it 's Spitzer 's office doing the investigation not SEC .
But I do n't know what the scope of the investigation is .
Suddenly Spitzer 's dalliances with a hooker do n't seem quite as fundmentally important to the financial health of this country .
We need people who understand the system to police it .
No matter how sanctimonious or egomaniacal you may find him , Spitzer understands the financial system .
If these posts are true , somebody in power was more interested in the the details of Eliot Spitzer 's transactions than Bernard L. Madoff's .
They were obviously more interested in killing the watchdog than in catching the billionaire burglar .
And via Corrente , something even more interesting from Michael Isikoff 's Newsweek story about the FISA whistleblower :
[ Under the secret and illegal " Stellar Wind " program of domestic warrantless surveillance , ] NSA was also able to access , for the first time , massive volumes of personal financial records — such as credit - card transactions , wire transfers and bank withdrawals — that were being reported to the Treasury Department by financial institutions .
These included millions of " suspicious - activity reports , " or SARS , according to two former Treasury officials who declined to be identified talking about sensitive programs .
( It was one such report that tipped FBI agents to former New York governor Eliot Spitzer 's use of prostitutes . )
These records were fed into NSA supercomputers for the purpose of " data mining " — looking for links or patterns that might ( or might not ) suggest terrorist activity .
Lambert asks an important question :
How did the suspicious activity report on Spitzer 's financial transaction get from the NSA to the FBI ?
He also notes the convenient timing , because Spitzer at the time was looking into the monoline insurance companies - another important piece of the Wall St. crash .
Was the Bush administration using illegally obtained information to take down political enemies ?
Oh , I think it 's a safe bet .
And do you suppose they were deliberately trying to keep Spitzer from exposing extensive Wall St. fraud ?
What do you think ?

Britons are likely to be making fewer trips to the US .
This time last year , bargain - hungry shoppers headed across the Atlantic to New York 's swanky department stores in droves .
With the pound worth more than $ 2 , they sought out cheap iPods , designer clothes and gourmet restaurants .
But few will be flying to New York to do their Christmas shopping this year .
Sterling has been one of the biggest victims of the global financial meltdown - losing more than a quarter of its value since July .
It has now fallen below $ 1.50 for the first time since 2002 .
The pound is also at its weakest level against the euro since the currency was created in 1999 .
See the pound 's performance against the dollar " People really are n't going to want to make international holidays , " says Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon .
' Worst recession ' Sterling 's problems are linked to the wider economic picture .
The UK is expected to have the worst recession of all the G7 rich nations and this means investors think UK assets will perform poorly .
" Like everywhere , the UK economy is slowing down , " says Daragh Maher , senior currency strategist at French investment firm Calyon .
Sterling has been like an elastic band that had been stretched too far and when it gave , it was vicious
Daragh Maher , Calyon
" But the perception is that we have over - borrowed more than other countries , so the payback will be greater . "
Falling interest rates put further pressure on sterling .
Last week , the Bank of England delivered a shock one - and - a - half percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 3 % , the lowest level since 1955 .
Economists expect rates to fall further .
It means that investors get a lower yield on pound deposits and sterling - denominated debt , making them less attractive .
This could pose a problem for the government , as it is expected to issue debt to pay for the banking bail - out .
Falling fast
It is unusual for a currency to fall so far , so fast .
Only twice in recent history has sterling fallen by such a degree .
On 16 September 1992 , the pound was withdrawn from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism , triggering a fall from around $ 2 to $ 1.40 .
Iceland 's financial crisis has made it more affordable for travellers .
Sterling fell by a similar degree in 1980 as a commodity bubble burst .
Mr Maher says that the pound at $ 2 was significantly overvalued and puts the currency 's long - term intrinsic value at around $ 1.60 .
" It 's been like an elastic band that had been stretched too far and when it gave , it was vicious , " he says .
Mr Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon says it is feasible that the pound could hit $ 1.40 in the near future and one euro could be worth more than 85 pence .
Winners
The fall in sterling could benefit manufacturers as the weak pound makes UK - made goods more competitive on international markets .
Similarly , overseas visitors may view the weak pound as reason to visit the UK .
" The recent fall in sterling and the approaching Olympics in 2012 give us a tremendous opportunity to promote Britain 's attractions as a destination to the world , " says Tom Wright , chief executive of Visit Britain .
But , with the world entering an economic downturn , demand for UK exports and holidays may dwindle , as hard - up consumers opt to conserve their cash .
Comfort
For those planning to take summer holidays abroad , there is some comfort .
While the pound has weakened against most major currencies , particularly the dollar , euro and yen , it has held up against others .
Sterling has risen 10 % against the Australian dollar since the end of June , as falling commodity prices have undermined the Australian economy .
And if you really want to maximise your hard - earned pounds , Iceland 's financial crisis has made the notoriously expensive country more affordable .
The pound has gained about 25 % against the Icelandic crown since the end of June , when Iceland 's economy began to hit the rocks .

“ People are calling 311 and coming up to me and saying , ‘ Where ’s my check ? ’ ” said Councilman Simcha Felder , who represents Brooklyn .
“ Now the mayor is saying , ‘ Guess what ?
The check is not in the mail , and we ’re going to increase your taxes . ’
It ’s like saying : ‘ We want to cut off your fingers .
If you do n’t let us do that , next year things are going to be so terrible we ’re going to cut off your legs . ’ ”
Even Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn , who has worked closely with Mr. Bloomberg on numerous issues , did not mince words , raising concerns about the canceled rebates , as well as the effect that the proposed cuts would have on education , public safety and public housing .
“ Specifically , we are troubled by the proposed withdrawal of the $ 400 homeowner tax rebate that has been scheduled for later this year , ” she said in a statement .
“ Many families will be counting on that money in their annual budget , and to withdraw it could cause a big hole in their pockets . ”

The mayor wants to reduce training for probationary firefighters to 18 weeks , from 23 weeks .

In making his case , the mayor presented slide after slide of bar charts to demonstrate the impact of the global economic crisis on the city .
And he recited a grim litany of statistics : $ 500 billion in losses on Wall Street , a loss of 147,000 jobs in the financial sector , a projected $ 2.6 billion drop in city revenues .
And , he said , the city would need to make up for an $ 8.4 billion shortfall in the pension system through fiscal year 2016 if the system , now down 20 percent in market value , posts a similar loss at the end of the current fiscal year .
Mr. Bloomberg said it gave him no pleasure to add another deflating number to the mix : a loss of 3,000 jobs from the municipal work force , including 500 layoffs .
And he warned that it was impossible to predict whether more cuts would be needed .
“ If things get worse and we have to cut back more , I do n’t think anybody can say , for sure , ‘ You are protected , ’ ” he said .

One boss Bernie Ecclestone says he is determined to introduce a new scoring system that would see the driver with most wins crowned champion .
Lewis Hamilton would have failed to win this year 's title under such a system , which Ecclestone wants for 2009 .
" It 's going to happen .
All the teams are happy .
The whole reason for this is I am fed up with people talking about there being no overtaking , " he said .
Gold , silver and bronze medals would be given to the top three finishers .
Regardless of the distribution of those medals , the driver who won most races would be crowned world champion .
The system still requires approval from F1's governing body , the FIA .
Its world council - the body that would decide whether to introduce the system - meets next month .
BBC Sport 's Adam Parsons , who was attending the news conference where Ecclestone made the remarks , said : " Ecclestone said he was determined to bring in a radical new scoring procedure .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Instead of scoring points for the top eight positions , as is the case now , it would see gold , silver and bronze medals being awarded for the top three positions , and at the end of the season the driver with the most race victories would take the championship .
" Ecclestone says it is a way of introducing more overtaking and says all the teams back it .
In reality , it is difficult to see F1's minnows backing a system that would see them end the season empty - handed . "
Ecclestone said : " The reason there is no overtaking is nothing to do with the circuits or the cars - it 's because the drivers do n't need to overtake .
" If you 're in the lead and I 'm second , I 'm not going to take the risk of falling off the circuit or doing something stupid to get two points .
" If I need a gold medal to win the championship , I will overtake .
It 's just not on that someone can win the championship without winning a race . "
The teams , through their umbrella organisation Fota , have made it clear they are keen to come up with new ways of improving F1 - and that includes considering a new points system .
But BBC
Sport understands that several of the teams have misgivings about the system and that these surround a number of issues .
Ecclestone believes his proposal would help promote overtaking Prime among them is that the new system could lead to the world title being settled earlier than has become the custom under the new system .
The current 10 - 8- 6-5-4-3-2- 1 points distribution was introduced in 2003 , partly to try to ensure the world championship stayed open for longer at a time when Michael Schumacher and Ferrari were dominating the sport .
In 2003 , the world title went down to the last race between Schumacher and McLaren 's Kimi Raikkonen even though the German had won six races to the Finn 's one .
Under Ecclestone's new proposal , the title would have been decided after the Italian Grand Prix in September when there were still two races remaining .
Conversely , the 2005 title - which Renault 's Fernando Alonso won with two races to go - would have been decided in the Spaniard 's favour only after the last race on a countback of second places after he and Raikkonen tied on seven wins each .
This season , McLaren 's Hamilton won one less race than Ferrari's Felipe Massa - but only because the Brazilian was controversially handed victory in Belgium after the Englishman , who had won on the road , was given a penalty .
Ecclestone claimed on Wednesday that there were quite a few races Hamilton did not try to win in 2008 .
606 : DEBATE
Do we really need a medal system in place ?
Why not alter the point system instead .
Restore the four - point advantage you use to get for winning a race and be done with it .
JKayF1 Former team boss Eddie Jordan , who will be a BBC Sport pundit in 2009 , said : " I think they ( Ecclestone 's proposals ) are a nonsense .
" I can't possibly believe he 's thinking straight , especially on this one .
His focus must be on cost - cutting and nothing else .
The rest is just dressing it up .
" The points are necessary .
I was one of the team principals who advocated the points should go down to eighth place because one point is as important to those teams as a win is to McLaren and Ferrari .
" He is tinkering with something on which he has lost the understanding .
He thinks only wins matter .
" When Hamilton lost the race in Spa and it was given to Massa , can you believe the controversy that would have created ?
" There has not been enough thought put into this and for him to say that it comes with the full approval of all the teams - I 'm sorry , I just do n't believe it . "
F1 is introducing a major change of technical regulations for 2009 in an attempt to spice up the racing .
These include changes to the aerodynamics and engines to make it easier for cars to follow one another through corners .
The front wing will be wider and lower , the rear wing narrower and higher and the number of aerodynamic appendages elsewhere on the car has been slashed - in an attempt to reduce the cars ' sensitivity to aerodynamic turbulence .
On top of that , the introduction of kinetic energy recovery systems ( Kers ) - where energy expended under braking is stored and reapplied during acceleration - will give drivers " push - to - pass " buttons that they can use for a limited amount of time each lap .
Ecclestone made his remarks at a news conference to announce that South Korean electronics giant LG would become a sponsor of F1 and have its branding on on the international broadcast feed , timekeeping systems and graphics .

Deserts of Libya Under Threat A Sea without Water

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Video clips of a Japanese police crackdown on a group of “ working poor ” who tried to get a look at the wealthy prime minister ’s luxurious private home in Tokyo have attracted of thousands of viewers on the Internet .
Three men were arrested on suspicion of assembling without a permit and scuffling with police , a spokesman at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said , when about 40 people gathered last month near Prime Minister Taro Aso ’s home in an exclusive area of the capital .
One of the several video clips , with over 96,000 views on the YouTube video - sharing website , showed dozens of uniformed police tackling a man who was accusing the premier of " creating poverty " and urging others to take a look at Aso 's house .
( here )
Another video showed one of the protesters speaking with the police about how to proceed with the group 's walk to Aso 's house .
( here )
“ I understand that the police took strict and appropriate measures against illicit acts in accordance with the law , ” Jun Matsumoto , a deputy chief cabinet secretary , told a news conference .
The organizers have said that they spoke to police about the event in advance .
“ It is hard to believe that the working poor , who object to their situation and are trying to do something about it , would get arrested just for walking on the streets , ” YouTube showed Karin Amamiya , an author and activist , as telling a news conference after the arrests .
In Japan , there are about 10 million “ working poor , ” defined as having an annual income of $ 20,000 or less .
More than a third of employees in Japan are temporary or non-regular workers without job security .
The 68 - year - old prime minister was born into a wealthy family of politicians and industrialists , and Aso and his immediate family have declared assets worth about 455 million yen ( $ 4.8 million ) .
( $ 1=95.62 Yen )
YouTube is by far the world ’s most popular online video web site .
But in some ways
Hulu is stealing the show .
With critical plaudits and advertising dollars flowing to Hulu , the popular online hub for television shows and feature films , YouTube finds itself in the unanticipated position of playing catch - up .
On Monday , YouTube will move forward a little , announcing an agreement to show some full - length television shows and films from MGM , the financially troubled 84 - year - old film studio .
Metro-Goldwyn - Mayer Studios will kick off the partnership by posting episodes of its decade - old “ American Gladiators ” program to YouTube , along with full - length action films like “ Bulletproof Monk ” and “ The Magnificent Seven ” and clips from popular movies like “ Legally Blonde . ”
These will be free to watch , with ads running alongside the video .
The initial lineup may not be all that compelling , but for YouTube , which is owned by Google , the relationship with MGM is a crucial step in an essential reinvention .
YouTube had its debut in 2005 and quickly became famous for the democratic sharing of bite - size video clips .
Users love the site — 81 million people visited in September alone , according to Nielsen .
YouTube is trying harder to make friends with Hollywood — and emulate the appeal of Hulu , a joint venture of NBC and Fox .
Along with its MGM relationship , YouTube has recently forged ties with the independent studio Lionsgate and with CBS , which this month started posting to YouTube full - length episodes of older shows like “ Star Trek ” and “ Beverly Hills 90210 . ”

Updated at 12:18 p.m.:
CHICAGO -- President - elect Barack Obama named New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson
Commerce secretary today , filling a top economic post in troubled times and placing a second former campaign rival in his new Cabinet .
Talking optimistically despite the recession , Obama also said , " We have everything we need to renew our economy , we have the ingenuity and technology , the skill and commitment -- we just need to put it to work . "
The president - elect called Richardson a leading " economic diplomat for America .
During his time in state government and Congress , and in two tours of duty in the Cabinet , Bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better . "
Richardson , 61 , was United Nations ambassador and energy secretary during the Clinton administration , and he is in his second term as New Mexico 's governor .
He also served seven terms in the House of Representatives .
If confirmed by the Senate , he would take over a sprawling department that oversees the National Weather Service , the Census Bureau , economic development programs and more .
One of the nation 's most prominent Hispanic politicians , Richardson pledged -- in English and Spanish -- to work to renew the economy .
He will become the latest former Democratic primary opponent to join Obama 's Cabinet .
The incoming chief executive has chosen another adversary - turned - ally , Hillary Rodham Clinton , to be his secretary of state .
Obama also chose former rival Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate .
Obama is considering another Hispanic politician , California Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra , to be U.S. Trade Representative , according to two Democratic officials speaking on a condition of anonymity ahead of an announcement for the position .
New Mexico's Lt. Gov. Diane Denish , a Democrat will become the state 's first female governor when Richardson leaves to assume his new post .
Denish will take over for the remainder of Richardson 's term , which runs through 2010 .
In neighboring Arizona , the ascension of a Democratic governor will put the state in the hands of a Republican governor .
Under Arizona state law , the move of Gov. Janet Napolitano to secretary of Homeland Security will mean a Republican , Arizona Secretary of State Jan Brewer , will assume the reins there .
The president - elect has moved quickly to fill out his Cabinet , having named more than half of it in the month since he was elected the country 's 44th president .
An energy secretary and United Nations ambassador in President Bill Clinton 's administration , Richardson was a contender for the State Department job , but Obama offered him the post as commerce secretary after choosing the former first lady as his top diplomat .
Among those Cabinet posts yet to be disclosed if not chosen : the heads of the Interior , Transportation , Labor , Energy , Housing and Urban Development , Education , Agriculture and Veterans Affairs departments .
Obama also has yet to name his intelligence team , including his director of national intelligence and CIA chief .
BEIJING , Nov. 30 ( Xinhua ) --
China 's economy is expected to grow by 10 percent in 2009 despite the impact of the financial crisis and global economic downturn , a researcher with the country 's Cabinet said .
" Although dim world economic situation has led to weak overseas demand , domestic consumption and investments , vast development potential decided the country 's economy will grow at fast paces , " said Zhang Liqun , the Development Research Center of the State Council researcher .
He forecasted China 's economic growth would accelerate largely at the second half of next year .
Zhang said his remarks were based on the country 's huge domestic consumption , and investment potentials ; sufficient fund , technology , labor and social security , and the government 's gradually mature macro-economic control measures .
" Personal income continues to increase as millions of migrant workers flow into the city to get their lives improved .
Enlarging demand for houses and autos will form huge and lasting consuming power , " he said .
" However , domestic enterprises need to accelerate their paces in upgrading business structure , in a bid to better cope with severe world economic situation , " he said .
China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew to 20.16 trillion yuan ( 2.96 trillion U.S. dollars ) in the first three quarters of this year , up 9.9 percent from the same period of last year .
The growth rate was 2.3 percentage points lower than the same period of last year .
In addition , Zhang expected the country 's consumer price index , or the main inflation gauge , to increase by three percent in 2009 year on year .
The index hit a record of 8.7 percent in February , and went up seven percent in the first nine months , far high from the government 's aim of 4.8 percent .
Just a few short hours ago , our fiendish friends at Billboard Liberation Front helped Wachovia Bank improve the messaging on a billboard in San Francisco 's Mission District .
From the BLF 's press release :
This campaign emphasizes the silver lining in the economic storm front now threatening to swamp our economy as well as our individual fiscal inner tubes .
" The calamitous decline in the value of all investments and the impending total collapse of the dollar will render the true value of the average savings account or investment portfolio roughly equal to a bucket of warm piss , " noted Thomas J. Wurtz , CFO of Wachovia .
Dr. John Silvia , Managing Director and Chief Economist noted : " After that golden shower we got from Golden West , we decided to fight fire with fire and start bailing for our clients and stockholders , mixed metaphors notwithstanding . "
KATHMANDU : Close on the heels of an international furore over California 's decision to ban same - sex marriages , the apex court of Nepal has given its nod to such unions .
The supreme court delivered full judgment regarding a ground - breaking verdict it had announced last year , recognising sexual minorities as being born such and entitled to all the rights and remedies all the other Nepali citizens enjoyed .
Police said there was no evidence the money was stolen and , having kept it unclaimed for six months , said Mr Hill can have it , and any of it he can piece back together will be legal tender .

COPYRIGHT 1998 JAMES " KIBO " PARRY &exclam &exclam &eclxam !!
SPOT'S WEBTV by James " Kibo " Parry 12/28/97 Poor Spot !
He wanted to browse that Web thing he kept reading about in his subscription to " Wired For Dogs " , but he could n't because he could n't figure out how to turn on his Macintosh Performa !
So he bought a WebTV .
The advantage of the WebTV was that Spot could n't break it .
It had no moving parts , no controls , and no on / off switch .
When he set it on top of his TV , it automatically detected the presence of a lower life form and activated itself permanently .
" HIYA , SPOT !
I'M YOUR NEW WEBTV !
YOU CAN BROWSE THE WEB WITH MEEEEE ! " The WebTV began to sing .
" DOO DOO DOO DOO DOOT DOO DOOT , DOO DOO DOOT DOO DOOT , DOOT DOOT DOO DOO DOOT DOOT DOO DOO DOOT DOOT ! "
Spot looked at the TV screen , which was now filled with colorful teal and orange icons which sparkled and shimmered and were all playing different musical tunes , which were drowned out by the WebTV 's loud singing .
The left half of the screen was filled with navigation controls , and the bottom half was filled with a status bar , leaving a small area at the upper right for displaying the Web .
This window , which could be scrolled diagonally but not horizontally or vertically , displayed all text in three - inch - tall Helvetica letters that buzzed .
It said : ## ## ####### ## ##### ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## # ## ##### ## ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ####### ####### ##### ####### ##### ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ##### ## ## ####### ###### ####### ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## # ## ##### ###### ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## # ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ####### ###### ## " DEE DEE DEE DEET DOO DOOT DEE DEE DEE DEET DAH DAH !!! " sang the WebTV .
" LA LA LA LA LA LA LA DEE DA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LAAAAAAA !!!!
ENTER YOUR NAME TO COMPLETE SETUP !!! "
Spot pointed the WebTV 's remote control at the WebTV's wireless mouse which was used to control the WebTV 's wireless keyboard to enter letters and numbers in Morse code .
He laboriously punched in " S " , which was difficult because the keys on the little toy keyboard were too small even for a puppy .
" S! " shouted the WebTV , " TEN DOLLARS ! DA DA DA LA LA LA WA WA WA DA DA ! "
Spot entered the second letter of his name .
The WebTV shouted again .
" P! TWENTY DOLLARS !
LOOBY DOOBY DOOBA DOOBA BWA WA WA DOOBY LOOBY SHABBA DABBA DADDA YADDA WA WA WA !!! "
After several minutes , he had entered all four letters of his name .
" WELCOME TO WEBTV , ESS PEE ZERØ TEE !
NINETY DOLLARS !
YADDA DADDA DOOT DOO DOO DOO DOOT DOO DOO DEEDLE DEEDLE DEEDLE ZING !!! "
" Waah ! " cried Spot .
" You mean I 've been charged ninety dollars just for entering my name ? "
" NO , VALUED STUPID CUSTOMER .
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN CHARGED HALF THAT .
THE NINETY DOLLARS , WHICH JUST WENT UP TO A HUNDRED , IS HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO PAY TO MAKE ME STOP SINGING 'PURPLE HAZE '!
BWAMP BWAMP NA NA NA NA !!! "
Spot sighed and slipped his major credit card into the flashing neon slot in the front of the WebTV .
It deposited the card deep within its bowels for safekeeping , scanned it and posted a GIF of it on his home page .
" Wow ! " said Spot .
" I did n't realize I had my own Web page ! "
" SURE YOU DO , SPØT .
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . "
It displayed his page , and because it could no longer sing " Purple Haze " , began singing " Batman " .

" Now I 'm somebody because I have a Web page I made myself on my WebTV ! "
After staring at his cool page for several hours , Spot realized he could scroll the screen to see the picture below .
It showed a baby picture of Spot picking his nose , and below that was the image of his credit card ( both sides , including his signature ) and a section labelled " MAP OF HOW TO GET TO WHERE SPOT LIVES FOR PERVERTS . "
Spot gasped .
" Why , I 've been scammed !
WebTVs are almost as evil as the rest of the Internet ! "
He began using the WebTV 's remote control to draft a letter of complaint to the president of WebTV Inc. , starting with the plain WebTV template : < BLINK >< CAPITALS >< CENTER ><HTML ></ HTML><HTML></HTML><HTML></HTML> < FONT FACE=" HELVETICA ULTRA BLACK 2000 " >< FONT SIZE = " +3 " >< FONT SIZE = " +3 MORE " >

" MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT ! "
Of course , the president of WebTV Inc. could n't read it because he had a real computer on his desk .
He flamed Spot . " Waah !
I do n't like my cool new WebTV any more ! "
" THAT'S TOO BAD , SPØT , YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME !

Spot tried whacking the WebTV with a hammer , dropping it from the roof , and even using it in the bathtub .
Unfortunately , its singing sounded even worse in the tub , especially when it finished " Goldfinger " and started on the theme to " Small Wonder " .
" SHE'S FAAAAANTASTIC , MADE OF PLAAAAASTIC ... "
In desperation , Spot tried throwing it into the ocean , but it was not only break - proof and water - proof , it was lose - proof !
It had welded itself to his paw !
" YOU SEE , SPØT , NO MATTER HOW MUCH OF A LOSER YOU ARE , YOU CAN'T LOSE A WEBTV !

Spot cried .
The WebTV really was perfectly designed to be an eternal companion to stupid puppies like him !
It paused for breath briefly and started singing " Batman " again .

Lawyers representing a man convicted of terrorism offences yesterday are to launch an appeal and embark on a civil action on his behalf alleging that he was tortured by Pakistani intelligence agents before being questioned by officials from the British security service , MI5 .
In a case that echoes claims made by several British terrorism suspects detained in Pakistan in recent years , Rangzieb Ahmed says that he suffered brutal mistreatment at the hands of the country 's notorious Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency shortly before being questioned by two MI5 officers .
The jury at Manchester crown court that convicted Ahmed of being a member of al - Qaida and of directing a terrorist organisation was not told that three of the fingernails of his left hand had been removed .
Ahmed , 33 , from Rochdale , says the nails were removed slowly with a pair of pliers over three consecutive days at a secret ISI prison , and alleged that on the fourth day he was hooded and bound and taken to a place where he was questioned by two MI5 officers .
Nor did the jury hear that MI5 and officers from Greater Manchester police passed questions to the ISI to be put to Ahmed during his interrogation .
Before the trial began , the judge , Mr Justice Saunders , rejected an application by Ahmed 's lawyers that the case should be thrown out because of the alleged mistreatment .
His ruling also dismissed Ahmed 's claim that his fingernails had been extracted shortly before he was questioned by MI5 .
The response from MI5 to the allegations that it had colluded in Ahmed 's torture were heard in camera , however , after the press and the public had been excluded from the court .
Part of the judge 's ruling on the matter is also being kept secret , so it remains unclear what he had to say about Ahmed 's treatment while a prisoner in Pakistan .
Ahmed 's lawyer , Tayab Ali , said he would be appealing against both the judge 's ruling and the jury 's verdict .
" We are also considering civil action against the British state for failing to protect him while he was in the custody of the Pakistani authorities , " he said .
While giving evidence during legal argument before his trial , Ahmed 's description of the cell in which he says he was tortured matched closely that of the cell where Salahuddin Amin , 33 , from Luton , says he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months in ISI custody two years earlier .
Amin , who has since been convicted of terrorism offences and is serving a life sentence in the UK , says he was repeatedly tortured by ISI officers in between interviews with MI5 officers .
Ahmed says that he was beaten with sticks , whipped with electric cables , sexually humiliated and deprived of sleep .
Some time later , he says , the nail of the small finger of his left hand was removed while he was asked questions about contacts in Lahore .
He told the court : " The officer said to the guards : ' Put him on the floor . '
I laid down on the floor , face down .
One of them grabbed my right leg , one of them held my left leg , and one of them held my right arm straight in front of me .
I was still handcuffed , and one of them held the cuffs over my left hand against the floor . "
Ahmed says that one of the interrogators sat on the floor beside him and forced the jaws of the pliers beneath the left side of his small fingernail .
He then slowly prised the side of the nail upwards .
" They started asking the same questions , who is waiting for you in Lahore ?
I was saying : ' I will tell you everything , I will tell you everything .
Leave me and I will tell you everything . '
It was very painful , I was crying out , I was screaming .
I said ' leave me , please God , ' but they were not listening . "
Ahmed says that his interrogator then began slowly raising the right side of the nail .
Next , the pliers were placed under the middle , and the entire nail slowly raised and removed .
The process , Ahmed says , took between four and eight minutes .
Then , he says , he was lifted on to a stool and a man in western clothes came into the room and gave him a painkilling injection in his forearm .
Ointment was applied to the wound , which was wrapped in plastic and bandaged .
He was blindfolded and hooded again , led to his cell and allowed to sleep .
Ahmed alleged that on two subsequent days he was subjected to the same torture , while being asked questions about two of the perpetrators of the July 2005 suicide attacks on London 's transport network and about a plot against the United States .
On each occasion , he says , he was given a painkilling injection at the end of the process .
There have been allegations that four other British citizens have been questioned by British intelligence officers , thought to have been from MI5 , after being tortured by the ISI or other Pakistani agencies .
One , a London medical student , was detained after the July 2005 attacks in London and held in a building opposite the offices of the British deputy high commission in Karachi .
He alleges that he was beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep and forced to witness other detainees being tortured , then questioned by British intelligence officers .
Consular officials repeatedly told his father that they had no idea of his whereabouts .
The student was eventually released , with an apology , and resumed his studies .
He now works at a hospital on the south coast of England , but remains traumatised .
Rangzieb Ahmed was found guilty of directing terrorism - the first person to be convicted of the offence in the UK .
He was also convicted of membership of al - Qaida , and of possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism .
Habib Ahmed , who is unrelated , was found guilty of membership of al - Qaida , professing to be a member of the same organisation , possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism , namely three books , and possessing a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism .
Both will be sentenced today .
Habib Ahmed 's wife , Mehreen Haji , 28 , was cleared of two counts of arranging funding for the purposes of terrorism .
The evidence : case based on surveillance
During Ahmed 's trial , prosecutors did not rely upon anything that had been gleaned during his interrogation in Pakistan .
Instead , they brought their case against him on the basis of surveillance evidence that had been gathered in Manchester and Dubai before he was detained , and on the basis of items seized from him and a second defendant , Habib Ahmed , 29 , a Manchester taxi driver , who is no relation .
The court heard how Rangzieb Ahmed travelled to Dubai from Pakistan in December 2005 and was set to fly out to South Africa as part of a " major activity " , but that the plans were changed after Hamza Rabia , a senior al - Qaida leader , was killed in an explosion .
Habib Ahmed was summoned to collect three diaries and the pair returned separately to the United Kingdom shortly afterwards .
Manchester detectives were monitoring the two men and bugged their hotel room in Dubai , where they made several coded references to al - Qaida .
The surveillance continued in Manchester .
Rangzieb Ahmed was detained in August 2006 after returning to Pakistan , and deported to the UK 13 months later .
When Habib Ahmed was arrested he was found to be in possession of two diaries , which had details of senior al - Qaida terrorists written in invisible ink , described in court as a terrorist 's contact book .
MADRID , Spain ( AP )  Spain rejected an asylum request from a son of Osama bin Laden on Wednesday after deciding he had not met the conditions necessary for him to remain .
Omar Osama bin Laden , 27 , flew to Spain earlier this week and remains in a transit area at Madrid 's Barajas Airport , an Interior Ministry official said .
He has 24 hours to appeal the government 's decision .
" The Interior Ministry has not accepted the request for asylum because this does not meet the conditions necessary for entering Spain , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government policy .
The official would not elaborate or discuss the younger bin Laden 's reasons for seeking asylum .
Omar Osama bin Laden is a metals trader who had been living in Cairo with his wife .
He has not renounced his father , but has said he wants to be an " ambassador for peace " between the Muslim world and the West .
The Spanish official said the government usually seeks a recommendation from the U.N. refugee agency in asylum request cases and he said the agency also recommended against asylum .
Omar Osama bin Laden — one of the al - Qaeda leader 's 19 children — arrived in Madrid Monday on a flight from Cairo .
He had been traveling on a Saudi passport .
The younger bin Laden caused a tabloid storm last year after marrying a British woman , 52 - year - old Jane Felix - Browne , who has since taken the name Zaina Alsabah .
She said in May that Omar Osama bin Laden had been denied a British residency request .
In media interviews , Omar Osama bin Laden has declined to directly condemn his father or the Sept. 11 attacks , instead condemning all violent acts and saying simply that he has a different approach to problems than his father .
Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding in the Pakistan - Afghan border region .
The younger bin Laden had moved to Afghanistan with his father in 1996 after living with him in Sudan , and trained at an al - Qaeda camp .
But Omar has said he has n't seen his father since he left Afghanistan in 2000 and returned to his homeland of Saudi Arabia .

1814 Lib Dem supporter Alix Mortimer 's reaction : This 0.5 % on National Insurance .
I smell another 10 p fiasco .
NI already hits lower earners disproportionately hard , with a current rate of 11 % on your earnings between about £ 6,000 and about £ 40,000 , and then 1 % above that .
What is this " offsetting " which will miraculously absolve those earning below £ 20,000 from being hit ?
Very over - complicated .

This is a welcome warm - up exercise after 30 years of inaction and neo-liberal economics . "

Either he 's too dozy , or he thinks his job is protecting ministers from scrutiny .

1742 Chas Roy-Chowdhury , head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants , says the government has an " extremely difficult task " - to encourage confidence , get people spending and yet show those outside the UK that the proposed increase in tax rate to 45 % is not a disincentive to working in the country .

1720 Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg says Mr Darling could have " rebalanced the tax system for good " but did not .

1716 Labour MP
Tom Harris gives his reaction on his blog : A comprehensive stimulus package ... the chancellor had much to say about ( and to give away to ) home owners , those who do n't yet have a home , those without a job , those in work , pensioners , parents , small businesses , medium - sized businesses , large businesses you get the picture ...
A lot of politics , too : he repeated that the current crisis is global , not British ...
The most controversial announcement , I admit , is on proposals to raise the higher rate of tax .
This is not the death of New Labour ... it 's about a new political culture .

Yet again we are being told that we are in a " good position " .
Nobody really believes that .
Apparently the Government has fixed the schools and hospitals in Britain ... that is nonsense ... the recession over within the next 18 months according to the Chancellor .
A hostage to fortune ?

Slight problem , the uptake of tax credits is appallingly bad .

1712 Professor Peter Spencer , chief economic advisor , Ernst & Young Item Club
This statement says more about the shocking state of the public finances inherited by Alistair Darling from Gordon Brown than it does about the recession or the measures he 's taking to try to deal with it .
The recession now hitting hard , we 're looking at public borrowing reaching a cool £ 118bn , 8 % of GDP next year .
In 2012/13 he is still going to be borrowing £ 70 bn - that 's almost £ 50 bn more than he anticipated for that year back in April .
1708 Former deputy prime minister John Prescott says the PBR was " extraordinary " and that there is " clear division " between Labour and the other parties .
Ex -Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith says the national debt will double and that borrowing next year could be £ 150bn , rather than the £ 118bn predicted by Mr Darling .
Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell calls the event a " big wasted opportunity " .
1708 The atmosphere in the Commons chamber has quietened , with many MPs filing out .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson says the pre-Budget report is designed to offer a definite " choice " between Labour and Tory policies .
There is not a " bombshell " in terms of a surprise , but there will be a " shock " for many when the changes kick in , he adds ,

MPs the recovery will be " long and painful " , under the course of action planned by the government .

So here 's the choice .
Do we want to push the economy forward , help consumers with lower VAT , offer tax relief for middle income households , lower fuel prices , have up front capital spending and help for small businesses ?
Or do we want to do nothing and hope that low interest rates will solve the problem eventually ?

If Labour wins the next election National Insurance is to go up by 0.5 p and a new 45 % income tax rate brought up on earnings over £ 150,000 .
Darling has slashed growth forecasts for the UK to between - 0.75 % and - 1.25 % in 2009 .

1609 Air passenger duty will be reformed so that those who travel furthest pay most , Mr Darling says .
1608 BBC political correspondent Iain Watson : The National Insurance rise announced of 0.5 p is the sting in the tail - a tax rise by any other name .
But the new higher income tax rate of 45 pc - after the election - will cheer Labour backbenchers even though it raises relatively little cash
1607 BBC political correspondent Iain Watson :
The relief for empty properties has been pushed by many Labour backbenchers and apparently had the support of the chief whip Nick Brown so this defuses a potential labour rebellion as well as helping busineses .

From today , firms facing difficulties will be able to spread the timetable for paying taxes , he adds .
1603 BBC political correspondent Iain Watson :
The VAT cut is the centrepiece and the chancellor immediately hits out at the Conservatives , suggesting they would do nothing - he will also make permanent the measures designed to help most of those who lost out from 10 p rate - the policy most toxic with Labour supporters during Brown 's darkest days in the summer .

1550 BBC political correspondent Iain Watson :

What should Mr Darling do today ?
He could begin by apologising for the leaks .
He is right to delay his increase in profits tax on small business and the extra vehicle excise duty on cars we already own - better still just to cancel those proposals ... nothing is going to work to reflate the economy unless the banks work ...
He should revisit the capital adequacy framework , the interest rates and the support package for the banks .
In that lies the answer to the credit crunch , not in the level of VAT .

South Texas county indicts Cheney , Gonzales
By Alex Lantier
20 November 2008
A grand jury in southern Texas ' Willacy County has indicted US Vice President Dick Cheney and former US attorney general Alberto Gonzales on state charges of misconduct involving private prisons .
The indictment , brought by District Attorney Juan Angel Guerra , also names several local officials .
The indictment alleges conflict of interest stemming from an $ 85 million investment by Cheney in the Vanguard Group , a company that holds shares in private companies running federal detention centers , noting that Cheney had influence over the federal contracts awarded to the prison companies held by the Vanguard Group .
The indictment also names Cheney as responsible for " at least misdemeanor assaults " at these prisons .
The indictment accuses Gonzales of intervening , as US Attorney General in 2006 , to stop an investigation into abuses at private prisons .
As of this writing , the presiding judge has declined to sign the indictment , halting any further action on the case .
Willacy County hosts a series of federal , state and county prisons , some of which are outsourced to private prison companies such as MTC and the GEO Group ( formerly Wackenhut ) .
These prisons have a long history of corruption and misconduct .
In 2005 Guerra obtained guilty pleas from three former county commissioners while investigating bribery charges related to MTC 's federal prison contracts .
In 2006 , a Willacy County jury ordered GEO Group to pay a $ 47.5 million fine in a civil judgment on a 2001 case , when Wackenhut guards allowed other inmates to beat inmate Gregorio de la Rosa Jr. to death with padlocks stuffed into socks .
Guerra told the Associated Press the current indictment is a " national issue " and that experts from around the country had testified before the grand jury .
The indictment reportedly refers to the de la Rosa case .
The indicted officials brushed off the charges .
Agence France - Presse wrote , " Cheney 's spokeswoman [ Megan Mitchell ] declined to comment because his office had not yet received a copy of the indictment . "
Mitchell arrogantly added , " Let 's wait and see if we even receive one . "
Gonzales ' attorney George Terwilliger III said , " This is obviously a bogus charge on its face , as any good prosecutor can recognize , " adding that he hoped Texas authorities would stop " this abuse of the criminal justice system . "
Michael Cowen -- the attorney for State Senator Eddie Lucio , who is also named in the indictment -- issued a statement declaring , " It is a shame that Guerra has chosen to dedicate his energy to fighting with his fellow public servants , rather than actually prosecuting criminals . "
In a revealing comment , Cowen added that Guerra dismissed so many cases that local officials disparagingly called him " The Great Emancipator " - - a common name of respect for President Abraham Lincoln , whose Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves after the US Civil War .
Cowen added that his office was planning to file a motion to quash the indictment .
The pose of incredulity and aggrieved innocence struck by Cheney and Gonzales reeks of hypocrisy and bad faith .
Far from clearing them , their record as members of the Bush administration suggests that accusations of misconduct directed against them deserve due consideration .
Cheney is hated in the US and around the world for framing and executing the Bush administration 's policy of aggressive war , most notably in Iraq , in flagrant violation of international law .
His longstanding policy is to shield himself from public oversight , notably evading Congressional attempts to obtain records of his 2001 Energy Task Force meetings on Iraq with the grotesque claim that his office is not part of the executive branch .
As for Gonzales , he resigned as Attorney General in disgrace last year , after refusing to answer Congressional inquiries into the Department of Justice 's improper firings of US attorneys .
As White House counsel during the first Bush administration , he played a key role in promoting the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program and helped draft legal memoranda arguing that the Geneva Convention 's provisions were " quaint " and need not be applied to Taliban and al - Qaeda prisoners .
Gonzales also requested the " torture memo " that defined torture so narrowly as to permit US forces to use abusive interrogation methods banned by US and international law .
District Attorney Guerra , on the other hand , has been the continuing target of a campaign of official harassment , facing bogus charges of extorting money from a bail bond company and using his office for personal business .
In March 2007 Guerra was jailed during a grand jury investigation of these charges .
Two special prosecutors were appointed in the investigation : former US attorney Mervyn Mosbacker and Gus Garza , who ran against and lost to Guerra for the position of District Attorney in 1992 .
Since 1996 , notes the Harlingen , Texas Valley Morning Star , " Guerra has won three elections , largely drawing support from working - class residents . "
However , Guerra lost the 2008 Democratic primary elections .
An appeals court later ruled that the special prosecutors were improperly appointed to investigate Guerra , and last month Judge Manuel Banales dismissed the indictments altogether .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Women who have ever been around smokers regularly may have more difficulty getting pregnant than those who have not , a new study suggests .
The findings , researchers say , offer one more reason for women to kick the smoking habit .

Studies have found that women who smoke raise their risk of a number of pregnancy complications , as well as their infants ’ risk of health problems .
Less is known about the dangers of second - hand smoke , though some studies have linked exposure during pregnancy to an elevated risk of miscarriage .
In the new study , of more than 4,800 women , researchers found those who ’d grown up with a parent who smoked were more likely to report they ’d had difficulty becoming pregnant -- defined as having to try for more than 1 year .
In addition , women who ’d been exposed to second - hand smoke in both childhood and adulthood were 39 percent more likely to have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth , and 68 percent more likely to have had problems getting pregnant .
“ These statistics are breathtaking and certainly ( point ) to yet another danger of second - hand smoke exposure , ” said lead researcher Luke J. Peppone at the University of Rochester , New York .
“ We all know that cigarettes and second hand smoke are dangerous , ” he added .
“ Breathing the smoke has lasting effects , especially for women when they ’re ready for children . ”
Peppone and his colleagues at the University of Rochester in New York report their findings in the December 5 online issue of the journal Tobacco Control .
For the study , the researchers analyzed surveys from 4,804 women who ’d visited the university ’s Roswell Park Cancer Institute between 1982 and 1998 for health screening or cancer treatment .
All had been pregnant at least once in their lives .
Overall , Peppone ’s team found 11 percent of the women had difficulty becoming pregnant , while one third had a miscarriage or stillbirth .
The risk of these problems tended to climb in tandem with the number of hours per day that a woman was exposed to second - hand smoke -- a pattern that suggests a cause - effect relationship .
Second - hand smoke contains a host of toxic compounds that could potentially harm a woman ’s reproductive health , Peppone and his colleagues note .
Tobacco toxins may damage cells ’ genetic material , interfere with conception , raise the risk of miscarriage , or inhibit the hormones needed for conception and a successful pregnancy .

What a wonderful eight years and a sweet election this has been !
For backwater Australia , the warts - and - all campaign in the US has allowed us to laugh at the absurd , snicker at the outrageous and roll our eyes at the expense that led to Obama ’s win .
In fact , Australia has been carrying on like this for much of the 21st century .
We had n’t signed Kyoto but we thought the US was worse for not signing it either .
We pollute more per capita , but at least we do n’t drive those big SUVs and drill for oil .
We have a racist element but nothing like our American brethren , no sir — there it ’s an appalling wound cut right across society , endemic to their culture .
And there are so many more black people over there .
Our smug self - righteousness has never been more obvious than during this presidential campaign .
There were undeniably rich pickings for the pundits : the battered un-electable war hero ; the " August pick " from nowhere ( or was that Alaska ? ) ; the first Roman Catholic Vice Presidential candidate ; and the One .
But despite the 4000 plus dead US troops in Iraq ( and the 1000 returned troops attempting suicide per month ) , a reckless Bush Administration , impotence in the face of global warming , Katrina , the economic meltdown , job losses and seemingly endless foreclosures — it was the element of race that was completely overblown and fixated on by Australians .
For more than a year , Fairfax had plenty of bell - ringers , finally culminating in the election - day headline " A new race for the White House " .
Janet Albrechtsen belted out a blog post on 5 November asking innocently , " Obama won , is America a racist nation after all ? " .
Clearly without much else to write about , she can afford to ask the big questions .
If Hillary Clinton had won , would America be a sexist nation after all ?
Even your ABC was entranced with the omnipotent racial divide .
This is Lateline ‘s Tony Jones speaking to Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Kaiser on election eve :
Tony Jones : … It ’s extraordinary is n’t it , the inexperienced black Senator , a couple of books under his belt , a pretty thin resume , was able to convince undecided voters even to overlook his race , and believe that without the experience he could actually run the country in a crisis .
Bob Kaiser :
Well , when you say , " Overlook his race " , you ’re implying something I do n’t think I agree with , and I do n’t think most Americans consider dark skin to be an impediment in these matters .
Tony Jones :
No , no , no you ’ve certainly misunderstood me , I ’m actually referring to the strain of racial antagonism in the country , which people are prepared to evidently overlook in his case .
Bob Kaiser : Yeah , well , yes , but I ’m saying many white Americans do n’t share that racial antagonism , it ’s a minority that does .
We do n’t have to get into that .
Tony Jones : Sure .
But it ’s not just the big bad media .
Witty political boffins were all sprouting their Bradley Effect Mark II theories .
Or white guilt .
Comments , even on the esteemed newmatilda.com flagged redneck states as racist states .
Forget their two jobs , no healthcare , busted industries or political beliefs , they are just racists .
Not like us .
This is not to say race was n’t a factor or is a non-issue .
It is an issue — just not in the way many are implying .
Many people in the US — regardless of their race — feel a foot taller after Wednesday ’s result .
Obama got there following the path created by the civil rights movement and critically , the leaders that shaped that movement .
Indigenous Australians do n’t have such leaders ( no , pontificating from Cape York is not enough ) .
Look at our Anglo parliament and then look at our diverse society and you realise just how far behind we are .
The deja vu of America ’s brand new dawn sits uncomfortably with the reality of a Rudd Government .
We are compensating our polluters for the Emissions Trading Scheme , bailing out already subsidised child care tsars and unsustainable car manufacturers while nation building and infrastructure like rail , ports and broadband are under review , probably ready for release as a five year plan .
Bright stars like Maxine McKew , Greg Combet , Bill Shorten or even Bob Debus are either stuck in another inquiry or possibly locked in a room playing mah - jong .
Rudd himself opened Parliament with a bang , visionary and eloquent .
He now talks like he ’s eaten a fist full of Rohypnol .
The union movement were activated with a clear target through to 2007 .
Now they are scattered , obsessing about Noel Washington but not much else .
Have they anything to say about the impact of the leviathan GFC ( no , not the Geelong Football Club ) ?
Where is their agenda to future - proof employment ?
Who is the ACTU boss again ?
After having a visionless PM for 11 years , Australia has forgotten how to stand on its own two feet and tell the world what we think and who we are .
We give old Rupert a Boyer to tell us what we are doing wrong , proselytise to Pacific nations and brag about sixth place in the Olympics like it means something .
In California , 52 per cent of people voted for Proposition 8 .
Well at least the California Legislature had the cajones to put gay marriage up for a public vote .
Our soft , progressive , cuddly - feely Labor Party would n’t go anywhere near such a vote ( except the ACT and look what happened ) .
Our PM is unequivocal : " Let ’s be absolutely clear about this , I have nothing to say about gay marriage … it ’s just a personal thing " .
Greg Sheridan has mourned the loss of our bestest friend ever George W Bush .
The crazy thing about friends is , you can always name attributes you like about them .
I ’ve objectively tried to think of three achievements of the Bush Administration and — just like Sheridan — failed .
Yes , this has been an unprecedented eight - year nightmare and America has not become progressive and perfect overnight .
I ’m not entirely overjoyed with Obama ’s success — and he is clearly holding Mrs Obama back — but for the past eight years , our default reaction to any of our national inadequacies has been , " At least things are n’t as bad as they are in America " .
That time has now passed .
I have a dream : Australia wakes up .

In contrast to the US , net neutrality does not seem to be an issue in the UK as one after the other , British ISPs start to throttle BitTorrent users .
Most recently , Virgin Media announced that it will target BitTorrent , which will render their newly released 50 M bit /s plan unusable for the people who really need it .
In the US , Comcast has been ordered to stop slowing down BitTorrent users , because this violates Net Neutrality .
Across the pond , this does not seem to be an issue , as several ISPs have installed hardware to slow down BitTorrent users .
There have n’t been many reports of British ISPs throttling BitTorrent traffic , but this does n’t mean that they do n’t .
Pipex , one of the largest ISPs in the UK , is notorious for its anti-BitTorrent measures .
They actively throttle BitTorrent traffic , especially during peak times , and also throttle all encrypted traffic .
Other UK ISPs that throttle BitTorrent traffic are BT Broadband , Eclipse , Plusnet , Freedom2 Surf and TalkTalk .
Virgin Media has not ( openly ) targeted BitTorrent traffic , but they will now follow suit .
Virgin Media ’s CEO Neil Berkett told The Register that the company will start limiting BitTorrent traffic for all its customers .
To some this might not really come as a surprise , as earlier this year Berkett said “ This net neutrality thing is a load of bollocks . ”
Virgin ’s BitTorrent throttling plans seem to back up this earlier statement .
Which throttling methods Virgin will use has not been announced , but Berkett said that they will be implemented mid 2009 .
ISPs have been messing with BitTorrent traffic for years , even when the traffic generated was just a tiny fraction of what it is today .
When the first ISPs began throttling BitTorrent traffic , Azureus ( now Vuze ) , BitComet and uTorrent introduced a countermeasure , namely , protocol header encryption .
This worked well initially , but soon after encryption was introduced , ISPs started to use hardware that could detect encrypted traffic .
The degree of traffic shaping varies a lot between different ISPs .
Some only limit BitTorrent traffic during certain times of the day or throttle in specific regions , others take a more aggressive approach and prevent their customers from seeding or even downloading . torrent files .
The most used argument to justify their actions , is that all the BitTorrent traffic on their network slows down other customers ’ connections .
Whether this is indeed the case can be debated .
Nevertheless , instead of investing in their own network to solve these potential congestion issues , ISPs prefer to slow down customers who just happen to use the ‘ wrong ’ protocol , claiming problems with capacity .
Which is interesting , since Virgin started offering an unlimited 50 M bit /s package this week , up from their old limit of 20 M bit / s. Maybe BitTorrent throttling helps make room for this new service .
Federal politicians and public servants are blowing the bank on travel – taking a multitude of trips at high - class prices to London , Paris , Geneva , Sydney and various North American destinations .
A Star investigation found spending by ministers , political staff and bureaucrats that is far from the frugal image of the Stephen Harper government .
Some federal travellers can't seem to get to London , England , for less than $ 6,000 , even though economy seats were available for $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 .
In our analysis of 60,000 travel records over four years , we found $ 18,000 flights to Australia , $ 7,000 flights to Paris , $ 11,000 flights to Indonesia and $ 8,000 flights to Switzerland .
By contrast , travel surveys show businesses are reducing costs by choosing more economical flights .
At least one other government , Alberta , has shown more care with taxpayer dollars .
For example , the Alberta environment minister and an aide spent $ 3,200 each to fly to Bali for a United Nations conference on climate change last year .
The former federal environment minister , John Baird , took a $ 10,920 flight to the same conference .
Three political aides and two bureaucrats joined him at similar rates .
Total airfare was $ 61,000 .
In the Star 's investigation , we found that Harper 's ministers often travel with a large entourage , at a high cost .
For example , when former federal agriculture minister Chuck Strahl flew to Geneva for World Trade Organization talks in 2006 , he took with him five political staff ( his chief of staff , his senior policy adviser , his junior policy adviser , a parliamentary secretary , a second parliamentary secretary ) and three bureaucrats – the deputy minister , the assistant deputy minister and the chief trade negotiator , who actually conducts the negotiations .
The week - long trip to Geneva , which began with a meeting of provincial ministers in Newfoundland , cost taxpayers $ 84,000 in airfare and accommodations .
Strahl 's airfare from Ottawa to Newfoundland to Geneva was $ 7,200 .
A spokesperson for Strahl said the meetings in Geneva were " extremely important for international negotiations on supply management and the pressing issue of opening borders to Canadian beef . "
Ted Yeomans said numerous aides went to support the minister at " informal side meetings " and business - class flights were chosen because " meetings commenced as soon as they arrived . "
Responding to questions about the Bali trip by former environment minister Baird , a spokesperson said the business - class flights " permitted members of the Canadian delegation to work while travelling and to assume their duties immediately upon arrival . "
Asked if the travellers had , like the Alberta delegation , considered a cheaper option , spokesperson Sujata Raisinghani said " we cannot speculate or comment . "
According to government rules , approval for international trips must come from the prime minister 's office .
Confronted with the Star 's findings , a spokesperson for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the government will now limit the number of political assistants travelling outside Ottawa to two .
Kory Teneycke also said the government is considering a plan to encourage federal travellers to fly economy class .
" Our government is always concerned about how hard - earned tax dollars are being spent .
We are continually improving the way we manage taxpayer money , to ensure the best value for money , " he said .
This story is based on data and interviews with government officials and travel professionals .
The data is a collection of approximately 60,000 federal travel records ( $ 70 million in expenses ) disclosed by 20 of the major federal departments , such as natural resources , environment , health and foreign affairs .
The travel took place during a four - year period – the last two years of the Liberal government ( 2004 - 2006 ) and the first two years of the Conservative government ( 2006 - 2008 ) .
Both Liberals and Conservatives have been big spenders but the Star 's analysis found most Conservative ministers spent slightly more than the Liberals they once accused of being lavish spenders .
In a detailed comparison of 12 major ministries , the Star found Conservative ministers outspent Liberal predecessors in 10 out of 12 cases .
But the Liberals outspent the Conservatives in the Prime Minister 's Office .
During the last two years of the Liberal government , the PMO spent $ 2.8 million on travel and hospitality .
During its first two years , the Conservative PMO reports spending $ 2.6 million .
However , the Prime Minister 's Office said its own analysis showed that overall , " our Government has spent significantly less than the previous government on travel and hospitality , period . "
Spokesperson
Teneycke did not provide proof of their analysis .
The trips the Star studied ranged from overseas conferences in Europe to visits with friendly politicians in Australia , to high - priced trips by one minister who travelled south to Florida in the winter and southeast to Maine in the summer ( see story , below ) .
The database the Star assembled includes flights , hotel stays and meals .
As high as the costs are , they should reflect discounts of up to 25 per cent because of agreements the federal government , with its massive buying power , has with travel providers .
So a $ 7,500 ticket would have cost the public $ 10,000 .
In either case , they are expensive tickets and indicate little attempt was made to get a better deal .
Travelling in business class ( sometimes called executive class ) is obviously more comfortable .
The seats are bigger , many reconfigure into beds , and cocktails and dinner are much more civilized .
These are big - ticket flights , taken by many senior federal government travellers .
The federal government has a cumbersome set of rules for travel .
The Travel Directive policy manual says the " standard for air travel is economy class " and the " lowest available airfares " shall be sought , with bookings made as far in advance as possible .
Beyond that are several caveats :
If you fly for longer than nine hours , you can take business class ( London is roughly an eight - hour flight ) .
If you are a senior bureaucrat ( such as a deputy minister ) travelling more than 850 kilometres , which is roughly the distance from Toronto to Quebec City , you can take business class .
Ministers are not subject to guidelines .
Many senior officials , whether politicians , political staff or public servants , take the more expensive business - class flights no matter where they are travelling .
The federal government 's travel costs do not reflect current business practices .
Companies are cutting costs by taking economical flights , or no flights at all .
The National Business Travel Association says that since 2007 , 72 per cent of business travellers are facing some restrictions on business class .
Not all federal travellers blow the bank .
In one example , then - Conservative Health Minister Tony Clement booked an economy flight to Kenya and Tanzania to visit health clinics and deliver a $ 150,000 Canadian government cheque .
Clement sat in economy class .
Up front in executive class sat his two political staffers , both flying on $ 11,000 tickets .
Clement 's office confirmed the details of the trip , and when asked about the difference in price said only that Clement chose to fly economy .
Clement is now Industry Minister .
The Star , noting that the trip had cost $ 30,000 in total , asked why it was necessary to spend that much to deliver an aid cheque .
Clement spokesperson Stephane Shank said the minister first went to Nairobi , Kenya , to open an infectious disease treatment centre that was partly funded by the University of Manitoba and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation .
He also visited the Ocean Road Cancer Institute in Dar es Salaam to announce a one - time funding commitment of $ 150,000 toward the training of local doctors and nurses .
Allan Rock , former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations ( Rock 's expenses were listed under the Foreign Affairs Department ) , spent just $ 722 to fly to Geneva in March , 2006 .
Most flights to Geneva in the Star 's database are $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 .
" It was n't a hardship flight , " said Rock , a former Liberal cabinet minister and now president of the University of Ottawa .

" I went to meet the Ugandan foreign minister to set the stage for an end to conflict in Uganda .
I just went economy .
The difference between economy and first class or business class is just astronomical .
I just could not face the prospect of paying $ 7,000 for the sort of flight that is not a hardship flight .
Just six to seven hours and sitting in the back in economy is not a hardship at all . "
Of all the government ministries studied , the Revenue Ministry was the most frugal .
Officials there recorded , for example , $ 700 flights to London , England , and $ 1,200 flights to Brussels , Belgium .
Some of the high costs the Star found were related to short - hop domestic trips .
Last year , 17 government officials flew from Ottawa to Toronto to meet federal finance minister James Flaherty .
The next day , Flaherty flew to Ottawa .
This begs the question :
Why did n't the 17 officials just wait for him to be in Ottawa ?
Flaherty 's staff says this happened during lead - up to the budget and " a situation like this is limited to important matters and occurs rarely to ensure value for taxpayers . "
The biggest spender of all ministers during the four - year period was former Conservative Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn , a frequent flyer with numerous trips to London , Paris and Australia .
He spent $ 340,000 on ministerial travel over two years , more than any other minister in a similar period , Liberal or Conservative .
( Ministers , as members of Parliament , receive other travel expense allowances for numerous trips home to their riding – the expenses detailed here are ministerial . )
Lunn takes along an entourage of political staff ( including his event co-ordinator ) when he is overseas .
Locally , he mainly flies between Ottawa and his home province of British Columbia – largely ignoring resource - rich Alberta and avoiding Ontario , Quebec and the Maritimes .
Often , he flies home from Ottawa on Thursdays to " meet stakeholders . "
Lunn 's aide told the Star the international trips are all part of the " minister 's commitment to make Canada a leader when it comes to natural resources . "
Lunn is now minister of state for sport .
In a case where a more economical trip would have presented a better image , former Indian affairs minister Jim Prentice and his wife travelled to Belgium in July 2007 to help commemorate the thousands of Canadians who died at Passchendaele during World War I. Airfare for the couple was $ 13,000 .
A spokesperson said protocol required the minister to travel with his wife ( he was meeting the King and Queen of Belgium ) , but she did not comment on the cost of the trip .
The Star also found some ministers use government jets and charters for flights when commercial flights would be cheaper .
For example , former transport minister Lawrence Cannon used a government jet at least 22 times in two years .
A spokesperson said it is the most cost - effective way to travel when the minister is headed to places ( often in Quebec ) where he cannot easily take a commercial flight .
Cannon 's travel expenses appear low ( $ 55,000 in two years ) because the cost of his charter jets are recorded as zero .
Cannon is now minister for foreign affairs .
Prompted by the Star 's questions , some political aides to Conservative ministers contacted the paper to say that some current public servants and members of the previous Liberal government also had some whopper travel bills .
An aide to former secretary of state for heritage Jason Kenney sent the Star an email explaining that Kenney flew on an $ 807 economy ticket to London , England , to attend a conference in November 2007 .
Up front in business class with a $ 4,697 ticket was a very embarrassed assistant deputy minister from the same department .
Kenney 's aide was responding to a question about Kenney 's trip to Istanbul ( $ 10,500 airfare ) as the Canadian government representative to the secretive Bilderberg conference , an annual meeting of top business and government leaders .
Kenney 's aide said Kenney went to Bilderberg to " converse about Canada 's successful experience managing diversity . "
An aide to former environment minister John Baird ( he is now transport minister ) emailed the Star to point out that Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion spent $ 27,000 to take five political aides to a Montreal environment conference when he was the environment minister .
Records show the cost for the trip , to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in December 2005 , was $ 23,560 and that he took seven aides : his chief of staff , director of communications , senior policy adviser , policy adviser , two special assistants and the director of parliamentary affairs .
Dion 's staff did not respond to requests for an interview .
Government travel costs have become easier to access thanks to a policy called Proactive Disclosure .
Each government department must post its travel expenses , per person , within three months of each trip .
Before 2004 , the information could only be obtained via an access to information request .
But the federal records do n't reveal the full story of a trip .
For example , an entry from 2007 shows that Ian Brodie , former chief of staff to Prime Minister Harper , took a $ 16,925 flight to Australia in May 2007 .
He went on his own and the trip is described only as " chief of staff 's visit to Australia . "
Asked about the 11 - day trip , a spokesperson for Brodie said the trip was " in advance of the APEC Summit " which was held in September .
Trip records show that Harper 's office sent three advance staffers in July to prepare for his involvement in the Asia Pacific Economic Summit .
The spokesperson would not comment on a press report in an Australian newspaper that at least part of the reason for Brodie 's visit was to thank members of the ruling John Howard government for providing advice that helped the Stephen Harper government get elected — –and possibly return the favour by advising Howard on his upcoming election ( Howard lost that November ) .

** Updated December 18 : U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday sentenced Ahmed Mohamed to the maximum 15 year prison sentence Thursday for providing material support to terrorists .
Prosecutors showed Mohamed 's YouTube video in court , in which Mohamed demonstrates how to use remote - controlled toys to detonate explosives .
Defense attorneys had asked that Mohamed be sentenced to eight years , arguing no one was hurt by his actions .
Merryday , however , said he heard no contrition from Mohamed .
The Tampa Tribune has details here .
The St. Petersburg Times story is here .
-------------------------------------------------------------------
When someone admits to committing a crime , the emotional angst is shared by loved ones of the victim and accused alike .
Drunk drivers have families , too , after all .
So do bank robbers .
But you wo n't see many newspaper stories devoted to their torment .
It is entirely different when it comes to those accused of terror - related crimes .
Take Ahmed Mohamed , a University of South Florida graduate student from Egypt who faces sentencing in a Tampa federal court Thursday .
In June , Mohamed pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists .
In his plea agreement , Mohamed admits producing a video demonstrating how a remote controlled toy can be converted into a detonator for explosives .
He did this to help those trying to kill American troops in Iraq , saying this technique was better than a suicide bombing because it allowed the attacker to save himself for " the real battles " to come .
Turns out Mohamed was a fun-loving fan of America – with a Christian girlfriend even - when he came to Florida at the start of 2007 .
That is what we learn from a St. Petersburg Times story Monday datelined Cairo .
It is the second feature to focus on Mohamed 's parents and their struggle to understand what happened to their son .
" How , " the most recent story asks , " had he gone from being a moderate , fun - loving young man to someone who pleaded guilty to making a training video for terrorists ? "
It offers this as a possible answer :
" For 11 months , Ahmed Mohamed was held in a small , windowless isolation cell in the Hillsborough County Jail on Falkenburg Road , allowed out in shackles for an hour a day .
He lost 40 pounds and became severely depressed .
' Forget about me .
Solitary confinement has made me dead , ' he wrote his parents in December 2007 .
' We fear the isolation and harsh treatment drove him crazy , ' said his father .
When the fatality count of U.S. soldiers in Iraq passed 4,000 people last spring , Mohamed sent a guard a note " congratulating him , " and drew a smiley face on it .
Defense attorney Lyann Goudie dismisses it as ' a desperate , sophomoric act , ' but in a memo urging the judge to give Mohamed the maximum 15 year prison sentence , prosecutors say it is " the most telling as to his hatred and disdain for the United States . "
Reporter Meg Laughlin cites this , so we know she read at least part of the prosecution sentencing memo .
Had she told her readers what else it said , her narrative would be blown .
So she did n't .
The memo makes clear that Mohamed exhibited the same anti-American hatred before he was arrested , before he was placed in solitary confinement .
At Thursday 's sentencing , we may hear from Mohamed 's former landlord .
According to the sentencing memo , she often heard Mohamed make virulently anti-American statements .
" She has reported that he repeatedly condemned ' stupid Americans ' and expressed his dislike of the United States and American law .
She characterized him as being an opportunist and as being an individual who always felt that he was intellectually superior to most persons and thus able to deceive them consistently . "
Mohamed and a friend had a brief interaction with Tampa police officers days before his arrest .
The officers cited the pair for shooting pellet guns in a local park .
In a videotape made later that day , Mohamed referred to the police as " dogs , " " Christians , " " Infidels , " " racists , " and " enemies of God . "
His laptop , which he lost custody of at the moment of his August 2007 arrest , contained files showing his interest in jihadist ideology .
The computer contained images of Osama bin Laden and videos " which extolled and endorsed that violent ideology . "
That fits with a poem also found on the laptop that investigators say Mohamed authored .
It lauds the " exalted Ossama ( sic ) Bin Laden " and other Al Qaeda members and contains his pledge of his own " blood " and " soul " to God and his dream that Egypt , his homeland , would lead the world " by G - D 's canonical law , and by jihad in the cause of G - D . "
Laughlin does describe the video Mohamed made and posted on Youtube in the summer of 2007 .
On it , he demonstrated how to make a remote - controlled bomb and described its benefits :
" .. we can make an explosion from a distance .
Instead of the brethren going to , to carry out martyrdom operations , no , may God bless him , he can use the explosion tools from distance and preserve his life , God willing , the blessed and exalted , for the real battles , unless he is forced to do so . "
After his arrest , and before his months in solitary confinement , Mohamed told investigators " his intention in producing and distributing the recording was to support attempts by terrorists to murder employees of the United States , including members of the uniformed services , while such persons were engaged in or on account of the performance of their official duties , " the government sentencing memo said .
It made clear that Mohamed is " no mere neophyte or ' arm - chair ' supporter of violent jihad . "
He took the time to research the explosives , to hunt for supplies and to make the video .
Low grade explosives were in his car when he was arrested after a routine traffic stop in South Carolina .
None of that is mentioned in the Times story .
The newspaper did a straight news report on the memo after it was submitted to the court last month .
It was given about a third the space as this week 's story .
Those who saw the most recent offering , and that alone , could have the impression that a young man made a rash decision in an otherwise mainstream life .
His attorney complains it was " the harsh conditions of solitary " and taunting by jail guards that set Mohamed off .
Anything he said or did after that , argues Lyann Goudie , should n't be held against him at sentencing .
Fair enough .
Take the taunting note to the guard about America 's dead in Iraq off the table .
Mohamed still has made it abundantly clear that the death of American soldiers in Iraq is not only something he desires , but something he tried to help come true all while a guest in the United States on a student visa .
This is not meant to mock the emotional pain his parents surely feel at the prospect that their 27 - year - old son may be imprisoned into his 40s .
It is a question , though , of what insights we gained from this story and why the focus is placed sympathetically on someone who does not wish us well .
At least balance the record by providing a more detailed account of the facts in the case – facts Mohamed is not disputing .
As the memo concludes :
For now , Eastern Europe is the epicentre of the crisis .
Lars Christensen , a strategist at Danske Bank , said the lighting speed and size of Ukraine 's bail - out suggest the IMF is worried about the geo-strategic risk in the Black Sea region , as well as the imminent risk a financial pandemic .
" The IMF clearly fears a domino effect in Eastern Europe where a collapse in one country automatically leads to a collapse in another , " he said .
Now that Digg has banned half of North America , I am proposing a new game for us banned folks with the number 666 tatooed on our foreheads .
Just come back as another person .
I ’m pretty sure this is being done already , but let me be the first to go out on a limb here and make it public .
And why not ?
What ’s wrong with coming back to Digg with a different user name ?
It ’s not like it ’s not easy to do .
I mean how many computers can I get into with a different IP address since I work at a college with hundreds of different computers on site .
And do I even need to feel bad about hiding my identity ?
Absolutely not !
They are n’t my rules , and besides , Digg members work for free , and Digg is getting rich so why should I care about a new name on Digg ?
So that brings up a different topic for Digg .
What if I am a banned Digger and get back on Digg and try to make friends with my old friends again ?
Do I tell them who I am ?
Absolutely not !
Well , should n’t I let my old friends know who I am or at least try to let them know it ’s me ?
I am going to say no .
If they guess , maybe , but do n’t volunteer anything .
And that brings me to a very good point about Digg anyway .
When someone is asking you to be freidns on Digg , remember , they may be an old friend coming back to life .
Be nice to them .
Maybe there should be a secret password to let the friend know you are a “ Digg Zombie ” .
Let me go on record as saying a Digg Zombie is a person who was on Digg before and got banned and came back to Digg in another life .
The secret code word then is ZOMBIE !
So the next time someone wants to be your friend on Digg , be careful , it just might be a zombie coming for you !
( smile )
I came back from a short trip today to find my laptop still running for some reason , even though I clicked on shutdown button before leaving .
It looks like you have to babysit Vista while it ’s trying to shutdown or else it may get confused by the log - off sound and wo n’t shutdown .
The Prius has a new use , and it does not involve driving .
The Harvard Press — which serves the Massachusetts town of Harvard as opposed to the university — reported that the car ’s battery helped keep the lights on for some locals during the recent ice storms .
The newspaper reports that John Sweeney , a resident who lost power , “ ran his refrigerator , freezer , TV , woodstove fan and several lights through his Prius , for three days , on roughly five gallons of gas . ”
Said Mr. Sweeney , in an e-mail message to The Press : “ When it looked like we were going to be without power for awhile , I dug out an inverter ( which takes 12v DC and creates 120v AC from it ) and wired it into our Prius . ”
According to the newspaper , “ the device allowed the engine to run every half hour , automatically charging the car battery and indirectly supplying the required power . ”
( The Times reported on a similar venture last year . )
In fact , this development , which comes at a tough time for Toyota , which makes the Prius , may not be as strange as it sounds .
Mr. Sweeney ’s tinkering is along the lines of the “ smart grid ” technology that many utility executives and other experts say lies in our future .
The idea is that the battery of an electric car — a plug - in , in most smart - grid scenarios — can feed power to the electricity grid when the grid needs it .
Even President - elect Barack Obama has endorsed this idea , as seen toward the end of this YouTube clip in which he said : “ We ’re going to have to have a smart grid if we want to use plug - in hybrids — then we want to be able to have ordinary consumers sell back the electricity that ’s generated . ”
Mr. Sweeney , out of necessity , got there first .
Watching this two - minute bio-ad from John McCain 's first campaign ( 1982 ) , " you do n't exactly get the impression of a candidate reluctant to discuss his war experience "
That 's because he never has been .
McCain has relied on using his service and sacrifice to his country as a major campaign asset from day one , and repeatedly ever since despite claims to the contrary .
Not that there should be anything wrong with that in that context , but , as Steve Benen pointed out :
Four years ago , when John Kerry campaigned in part on his military service , McCain criticized him for it , saying he was “ sick and tired of re-fighting the Vietnam War . ”
McCain even disparaged Kerry personally , saying his emphasis on his military record is “ clearly a tactical or strategic move . ”
What makes McCain 's claim all the more hypocritical is the fact that his campaign has recently been invoking the ' POW card ' anytime their candidate is questioned , not just biographically for political benefit as the senator did over and over during pastor Rick Warren 's Saddleback Presidential Candidates Forum , but quite literally offering it as an excuse for anything and everything to the point many in the media have begun questioning the tactic :
Whether he 's deflecting criticism over his health - care plan or mocking a tribute to the Woodstock music festival , Senator John McCain has a trump card : the Hanoi Hilton .
...
That was followed by Newsweek 's Howard Fineman , Politico 's Ben Smith , and Time 's Ana Marie Cox ( h/t Greg Sargent ) all calling foul .
The Washington Monthly 's Steve Benen inferred that McCain is becoming the new 9iu11iani , and that 's not all .
McCain even caught the ire of Brandon Friedman at VetVoice and then Lt Gen Robert G Gard really took him to task in posts at DailyKos and Huffington Post :
We obviously honor and respect McCain 's service and the five - and - a- half years of horror that he went through at the hands of the North Vietnamese ; but it 's not an excuse for everything .
He has already used it to explain away his infidelities in his first marriage .
He 's used it to defend his healthcare plan .
He just the other day used it to deflect accusations of having skirted the rules of the Saddleback forum .
It 's time for the Senator to stop cheapening the war experiences of thousands of vets and his fellow POWs , and his own as well , by stretching the boundaries of logic to make his POW status a wild - card rebuttal to all accusations or an answer to all difficult questions .
And in today 's NYT , Maureen Dowd hits on all of the above and goes even further by questioning whether what has been McCain 's ' get out of gaffe free card ' could actually be considered a handicap :
... While McCain ’s experience was heroic , did it create a worldview incapable of anticipating the limits to U.S. military power in Iraq ?
Did he fail to absorb the lessons of Vietnam , so that he is doomed to always want to refight it ?
Did his captivity inform a search - and - destroy , shoot - first - ask - questions - later , “ We are all Georgians , ” mentality ?
You think ?
Take the AOL poll on whether John McCain is overplaying the POW card below .

Where Homes Are Worth Less Than the Mortgage
In 43 states , First American CoreLogic was able to analyze data for all homes with mortgages .
Using estimates of current property values , the analysis shows that many homeowners owe more on their mortgages than the homes are now worth , a condition known as having negative equity .
Move the cursor over a state to see the percentage of mortgaged homes with negative equity .

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Monday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says " there is no possible way to justify " CEO Jeff Thain's $ 10 million bonus request .
( CNN ) --
You know , it may be we have been looking at the economic picture all wrong .
The notion that perhaps things really are n't so awful as all that popped into our heads today when we heard the CEO of Merrill Lynch was putting in for a $ 10 million bonus for 2008 -- mostly because , in 2008 , he adeptly held Merrill Lynch down to a loss of only $ 11.67 billion .
Now , put it in context .
This was at a time when Wall Street rivals like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed entirely .
John
Thain is the CEO we are talking about , and he also argued he was able to arrange the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America during these troubled times .
And that orchestrating the sale of an outfit that had lost more than $ 11 billion surely ought to be worth some big bonus cash .

One of my neighbors worked for Merrill Lynch , and she recently got laid off .
Literally thousands of Merrill employees are likely to be let go because of the sale to Bank of America .
And the CEO wants a $ 10 - million bonus .
Is it me or is this guy nuts ?
This was all front page news in The Wall Street Journal today , and because of that , I 'm guessing , by late this afternoon Mr. Thain came to his senses and withdrew his bonus request .
iReport.com : How is the automaker crisis affecting you ?
Being publicly hung out to dry can be quite a motivator .
Look , Mr. Thain may well have inherited a mess of a company .
He may have done an admirable job of limiting the losses and he may be paying for the mistakes of his predecessors .
But that 's life .
That is the world we all now live in and newsflash , Mr. Thain , we are all now paying for the mistakes of Wall Street big shots like your predecessors .
Every single tax - paying American .
We are glad you came to your senses because in this current environment there is no possible way to justify a request like this .

All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a drubbing these days for its abject failureâ despite detailed tipsâ to catch Bernie Madoff in what appears to be the biggest Ponzi scheme in our nationâs history .
Now , thanks to little - noticed report from the agencyâs inspector general , we have a detailed glimpse into other bad behavior by some SEC employees .
The report , released the day after Thanksgiving , reveals that some employees at the agency were clearly preoccupied with matters other than their mission of " protecting investors and maintaining fair , orderly , and efficient markets . "
The semi-annual report to Congress , which covers the period from this past April to September , details among other things a handful of employees circumventing internal controls to download porn .
Letâs pause for some detail :
[ Investigators ] uncovered evidence that an employee who was still in his probationary period had used his SEC laptop computer to attempt to access Internet websites classified as containing pornography , resulting in hundreds of access denials .
The OIG investigation also disclosed that this employee successfully bypassed the Commissionâs Internet filter by using a flash drive .
Presumably , thatâs not the kind of initiative the SEC is looking for .
There were also more serious misdeeds raised by the report .
For example , there is the case of the senior - level commission employee who " clearly and purposefully identified herself as a Commission employee when dealing with brokers about a family memberâs account , " making the broker in question feel like she was trying to " intimidate and bully him . "
The OIG referred the matter to management for " disciplinary action , up to and including dismissal . "
By the end of the period covered in the report , management " had not proposed or taken action . "
There are other examples where the punishment was less than fulsome .
Investigators found employees in separate offices operated private photography businesses out of the commission :
An employee repeatedly and flagrantly used Commission resources , including Commission Internet access , e-mail , telephone and printer , in support of his private photography business for several years .
The IGâs office recommended " disciplinary action up to and including dismissal . "
In turn , the report notes , " management suspended the employee from duty and pay for nine calendar days . "
When asked about the report , Deputy Director for Public Affairs John Heine said , " In each of these [ cases ] there is some sort of response from the Commission .
We donât have anything to say beyond that . "
The report reveals also that two commission staffers employed as attorneys didnât have active bar memberships .
One attorney let his bar license lapse in 1994 .
The report said one of the lapsed lawyers " submitted a declaration in Federal court , in which he stated that he was an attorney employed by the SEC .
We referred the potential false statement or perjury to the applicable United States Attorneyâs office . "
( The office declined to prosecute . )
The IG also found that the commission did not have a sufficient system in place to " prevent and detect insider trading on the part of Commission employees or violations of the Commissionâs rules . "
The agencyâs information management also comes in for criticism .
An employee survey conducted by the inspector general revealed that employees failed to enter data into a computer system used to manage investigations .
The system known as the HUB was launched in August 2007 after the Government Accountability Office had highlighted major problems with the SECâs previous case management and tracking system .
The IG semi-annual report also reveals that the commission lacks " an inventory of its laptops and was unable to trace ownership of laptops to specific individuals . "
Here at ProPublica weâve just begun working our way through the fascinating 95 - page document .
Take a look at it yourself and let us know what you find .
Friedrich Karl
Flick died one of the world 's richest people
Thieves have stolen the remains of a billionaire who died in 2006 from his vault in southern Austria , moving granite slabs to reach his coffin .
Police believe they must have used heavy lifting gear to remove the coffin of German - born Friedrich Karl Flick in the town of Velden , Carinthia .
Flick , who ran a German industrial empire and owned Austria 's largest private forest , died at the age of 79 .
Austrian media have speculated that his body was stolen for ransom .
It is believed that the theft was committed at the weekend but news of the crime only emerged in recent days .
The coffin was reportedly made from solid zinc and weighed more than 200kg ( 441lb ) .
The grave - robbers also had to remove heavy granite slabs to break into the tomb .
The late billionaire 's father was Friedrich Flick , a German industrialist convicted at Nuremberg of employing slave labour in his armaments factories in Nazi Germany .
He served three years in prison before emerging to rebuild his business .
His son , Friedrich Karl Flick , steered the family concern after his father 's death in 1972 .
He was listed by Forbes magazine shortly before his own death in 2006 as one of the world 's 100 richest people .
The team considered doing an alternate version for a McCain win , but it proved to be ...
Parker was crossing his fingers for an Obama victory because he wrote and directed an episode of " South Park , " which aired Wednesday night , based on the premise that the Democratic candidate had won the night before .
If the results had flipped , Parker says they would have aired the episode anyway , and later dealt with their own " Dewey defeats Truman " moment .
( For a video clip of the Obama episode , click on the Read more line below and scroll down . )
" South Park " co-creator Trey Parker was elated when he heard the news Tuesday night that Barack Obama had won the presidency .
That 's not because he bought into Obama 's promises for change , or because he dislikes John McCain -- in fact , Parker says McCain is " a great guy . "
... too daunting a task .
So , finally they decided , " Well , we 're just going to make the Obama version , and if McCain somehow wins , we 're basically just totally screwed , " Parker said .
But throughout production , Parker says he had no doubt that Obama would win .
That 's because the sports betting website he uses to gamble on football games placed the odds heavily against the Republican nominee .
" Who do we trust the most ? "
Parker said he asked himself when deciding whether to write the episode .
" Who knows the most about who 's going to win ?
And we just went to Vegas . "
Parker even threw some of his own money on the line , placing a bet for Obama in October , when the odds were slimmer , he said .
Just before the election , Las Vegas parlors upgraded their prediction to - 800 -- what the odds might be for an NFL matchup between the undefeated Tennessee Titans and the winless Detroit Lions .
( In other words , not close . )
Luckily for Parker , the house does n't always win .
But just because the episode had been written before the election 's fate had been decided does n't mean Parker was partying in the streets Tuesday night .
Like every Tuesday during a " South Park " season , he did n't get a wink of sleep .
The episode still was n't completed on the eve of its air date .
They needed to replicate the stage on which Obama gave his acceptance speech , and record voice - over excerpts from the transcript for the episode 's cartoon reenactment of the oration .
They finished production on the episode Wednesday morning , about three hours after they normally wrap .
Still , Comedy Central had only seen bits and pieces of it before airing at 10 p.m .
One scene executives asked to see involved a joke about Obama 's grandmother faking her death , which Parker says was n't intended to be insensitive .
" It 's kind of nice , " he said .
" She 's OK , and helping her grandson out . "
Parker was committed to doing an episode on the election for this week 's show once he heard about a McCain - Nazi joke on " Family Guy , " which recently stirred some controversy .
He called the scene , which showed the Stewie character dressed in a Nazi uniform and outfitted with a McCain - Palin button , " lame " -- amongst a series of expletives not suitable for publication .
" South Park " creators have publicly condemned " Family Guy " in the past , and Wednesday 's episode was an attempt to one - up the Fox cartoon .
But Parker was n't going to make his version a political commentary .
" We 've all heard about everything ; we 've talked about everything to death , " Parker said of the exhausted political sphere .
" And it 's like , let 's just put him in a diamond heist movie .
They 're just diamond thieves , and it 's not about the politics at all anymore . "
But what about change ?
Is n't Obama going to singlehandedly fix all our problems , and swiftly transform the nation into an eternal utopia ?
" I think this whole country is supposed to be based around the fact that one guy does n't have that much power , " Parker said .

In reluctantly tossing a $ 17.4 - billion government lifeline to General Motors Corp. and Chrysler on Friday , President Bush ensured that the automakers would not fail in the coming weeks -- sparing the economy and his own legacy another potentially devastating blow .
But Bush ’s action leaves most of the tough decisions about the the U.S. auto industry ’s future to President - elect Barack Obama .
The conditions Bush attached to the emergency loans , such as requiring trade unions to accept wages and benefits comparable to those at U.S. factories run by foreign automakers , were largely nonbinding and thus subject to change by the next president .
That could mean a far different future for American automakers than many analysts have been predicting .
Obama has consistently echoed Bush ’s call for major restructuring by U.S. automakers to assure their long - term viability in a changing global marketplace .
Advertisement
With his strong environmental and pro-labor stances , however , Obama may have a much different view from his predecessor of what constitutes viability .
For example , in his energy plan Obama has called for not just keeping Detroit alive but making it a world leader in fuel - efficient , environmentally friendly vehicles .
“ This is clearly a temporary measure , ” said Mark Oline , an analyst with credit rating firm Fitch Ratings .
“ We expect the agreement will be significantly reworked once the new Congress and the new administration take office . ”
Detroit automakers have begun shifting production from gas - guzzling trucks to smaller , fuel - efficient cars and investing in technology to produce hybrid and electric vehicles .
But those changes have been slow in coming , and the recession and credit crunch have hammered Detroit ’s already financially weakened Big Three .
GM and Chrysler have said they needed a total of $ 14 billion by March 31 or they could face bankruptcy .
Ford said it did not need short - term funding but warned that a failure of one or both competitors could endanger it as well .
Advertisement
In an indication of what may lie ahead , the United Auto Workers union and some Democratic lawmakers Friday were already calling on Obama to change some conditions .
Obama called the bailout a “ necessary step ” and warned GM and Chrysler executives not to squander the chance to remake their companies because “ the American people ’s patience is running out . ”
But Obama , speaking at a news conference in which he stressed the importance of increasing wages throughout the economy , said workers should n’t be the only auto industry stakeholders asked to take “ painful steps . ”
“ I just want to make sure that when we see a final restructuring package , that it ’s not just workers who are bearing the brunt of that restructuring , ” Obama said .

Bush ’s announcement Friday morning ended a monthlong drama that saw the chiefs of Detroit ’s Big Three trek to Washington twice to ask Congress for emergency loans for their companies and the 3 million people whose jobs directly or indirectly rely on them -- only to be rebuffed .
“ There is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly collapse of the auto companies , ” Bush said .
“ My economic advisors believe that would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry . . . and send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession . ”
GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and other GM executives provided few new details of how they would restructure their company beyond the plan they submitted to Congress this month .
That plan included eliminating or selling GM ’s Saab and Saturn brands , shrinking the Pontiac division to a handful of niche models , laying off thousands of workers and cutting the GM sales network by about 2,000 dealers .
“ We know we have a lot of work in front of us to accomplish this plan , ” Wagoner said Friday at a news conference in Detroit .
“ We look forward to proving what American ingenuity can achieve . ”

GM stock shot up 23 % on Friday to $ 4.49 .
Chrysler is privately held .
Its chief executive , Robert Nardelli , said the company was committed to meeting the bailout requirements .
News of the rescue drew praise from auto dealers , who were worried that a bankruptcy filing would scare away customers and worsen the already bleak sales outlook .
“ When you have the government declaring its confidence and commitment to U.S. auto manufacturers , it helps reassure the American public that domestic automakers will be around for the long term , ” said Annette Sykora , head of the National Automobile Dealers Assn. , which represents 19,700 dealers nationwide .
“ This sends a clear message : Consumers can now consider any car from any manufacturer with confidence . ”
The plan announced by the White House is similar to one crafted with congressional Democratic leaders this month .
The legislation was blocked largely by strong opposition from Senate Republicans , who argued that bankruptcy was the only way to force U.S. auto companies to make major changes .
Advertisement
The plan proposed in Congress would have taken the loan money from an existing $ 25 - billion fund to help automakers retool their factories to produce more fuel - efficient vehicles .
With Bush unable to use that fund for a bailout without congressional approval , he agreed to Democratic demands to use money from the $ 700 - billion financial rescue fund .
Several Republicans sharply criticized Bush for that decision Friday .
Under the White House plan , the Treasury Department will provide $ 13.4 billion in short - term loans to GM and Chrysler from the first half of the $ 700 - billion fund .
An additional $ 4 billion would be available Feb. 17 , assuming Congress approves the second half .
GM will get about $ 9 billion of the initial allocation , while Chrysler will receive $ 4 billion .
GM and Chrysler must achieve long - term financial viability by March 31 , the White House said , or they would have to repay the loans immediately .
The key to financial viability is for the companies to deliver restructuring plans by Feb. 17 showing they can achieve a “ positive net present value . ”
The term is used in corporate budgeting to assess investments .
It means the cash coming into a company must be greater than the cash flowing out , taking future debt obligations into account .
Advertisement
But the precise parameters of that calculation were unclear Friday .
Documents released by the Treasury Department said the net present value must be calculated “ using reasonable assumptions and taking into account all existing and projected future costs . ”
A Treasury official could not say what time frame would be used to make the calculations .
“ It ’s a very odd way of determining whether the company is viable and whether they ’re making progress or not , ” said Shelly Lombard , a debt analyst at Gimme Credit .
Other conditions include a ban on stock dividends , limits on executive compensation , compliance with federal fuel - efficiency standards and the provision of warrants to the government to purchase nonvoting stock equal to 20 % of the loan amount .
Advertisement
Aside from the executive compensation and stock warrant conditions , which are required for money disbursed from the financial sector rescue fund , Obama could revise the other conditions and restructuring targets , Bush administration officials acknowledged .
Nevertheless , the White House set out several restructuring aims for the companies .
Among them are reducing their debt by two - thirds by swapping it for equity ; eliminating a jobs bank that pays laid - off workers ; making wages and benefits competitive with U.S. workers for Toyota , Honda and other foreign automakers ; and requiring the UAW to take at least half of future payments into a retiree benefit trust in the form of company stock .
Persuading creditors to exchange their bonds for stock wo n’t be easy , analysts said .
Some issues of GM bonds , for example , are currently trading for less than 20 cents on the dollar , but the company ’s woeful stock -- it is down more than 80 % since the beginning of the year -- is n’t a very attractive alternative .
If the companies end up in bankruptcy , stockholders probably would be wiped out .
Even with the emergency federal loans , the bankruptcy risk for all three companies remained “ very high , ” said Gregg Lemos - Stein , a credit analyst with Standard & Poor ’s Corp .

“ These loans help near - term liquidity , ” he said .
“ But they do nothing to help the very weak demand for vehicles in the U.S. ”

Editor 's Note : Fernando Espuelas is the host and managing editor of Café Espuelas , a Los Angeles Spanish - language radio talk show and a media entrepreneur .
Fernando Espuelas says it was a mistake for Latino voters to support Proposition 8's gay marriage ban .
LOS ANGELES ( CNN ) --
It 's a done deal : Proposition 8 , making same - sex marriage illegal in California , has been approved by voters .
The constitution of the state was amended to take away rights recognized by the California Supreme Court under the equal protection clause of the California constitution just this May .
And Latinos were in the vanguard , providing critical support for the passage of Prop 8 .
For the past few weeks , Latinos have called in to my radio show , horrified at the idea of same - sex marriage .
Callers said they would vote for Obama for change -- and for Proposition 8 .
They told me that the future of their family was at stake .
Biblical passages were quoted , divinely inspired indignation given voice .
The vision of a collapsed society , where men abandon their wives in droves to " become gay , " ' consumed these callers .
Is this simply a case of cognitive dissonance ?
By now , the media has reported the importance of the Latino vote to Obama 's win in such key states as Florida , New Mexico , and Colorado .
President - elect Obama , by some early estimates , garnered the largest share of the Latino vote of any candidate in history , carrying it by more than 2 to 1 over John McCain .
Do n't Miss L.A. stops issuing licenses for gay marriages
L.A. stops issuing licenses for gay marriages Analyst : Same - sex marriage in limbo
In spite of what seems to be sweeping approval for a progressive agenda , Latino support of Prop. 8 has exposed an entrenched bias against homosexuality at once profound and confounding .
Perhaps because of the teachings of the Roman Catholic priests and now the evangelical preachers who have captured many Latinos ' devotional intensity ; or simply because of the macho albatross we all carry as part of our Latino heritage , the very idea of gay marriage is anathema to many in the Latino community .
The fight for civil rights in America -- from the abolition of slavery in 1865 , through the battle for a woman 's right to vote , to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- has been long , fierce , and steady .
Politicians from both parties never tire of telling us that a metaphorical Liberty Bell rings brightly , as it does in no other country in the world .
Yet even as civil rights in America have come so far , Latinos still suffer keenly under the heel of oppression .
Everyday , I feel the blow of news reports about Latinos struggling against dark odds in our country : the immigrant mother forgotten in a jail cell for four days without food , water , or a toilet ; slaughterhouse workers herded like the cattle they process into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement bus .
Maricopa County , Arizona , Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who has attacked the immigration conundrum with zeal , is being sued by Latino human rights organizations for allegedly demanding proof of citizenship from anyone who looks Latino , and even from people listening to Spanish - language radio in their cars .
The irony of Latino support for Prop. 8 is sad .
That a community that continues to struggle for basic rights would deny them to another is particularly baffling .
A marginalized minority -- Latinos -- voting to take away the rights of another marginalized group -- gays and lesbians -- is like the kid who 's picked on in the third grade and only makes some headway when a punier kid comes along to take the punches instead .
Throughout this campaign , in an avalanche of Spanish - language commercials , Latinos were exhorted to vote " Yes " on Prop 8 .
A calm voice -- a voice that could be selling baby wipes or low - fat cookies -- told us that we should check yes " for the good of our families , " that we must save everything that is good and decent about America .
Take away the civil rights of gays and lesbians so that we can be safe .
But safe from what ?
The low - fat cookie voice of the radio commercial did not really say .
Latinos were asked not just to look away as these rights would be withdrawn , but to actively vote for the demolition of someone else 's family .
We were implored to look at " them " as the unredeemable " aliens " that must be expurgated from our society .
And we did .
Once you start the process of taking away other peoples ' fundamental rights -- like food and water in a jail cell , or the right to drive and listen to whatever music you like -- you must ask yourself where to draw the line , and who will draw it ?
What -- and whose -- rights will be next on the chopping block ?
As Martin Luther King Jr. said , " Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere . "
You'd think that as Latinos , proud and strong and willing to fight for our own rights , - we 'd refuse to turn against the " punier kid , " would n't you ?
That we might in fact stand up for that kid , tell the bullies to back off , the same way we told the bullies of racism and " the real America " to take a hike -- and in the process carried Obama to triumph .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fernando Espuelas .

In tough circumstances , sometimes all you need is hope , but other times you need a blow - up survival shelter featuring a bed , a couch , freeze - dried food , a 50 - gallon water bladder , a first - aid kit , a radio and a cookstove .
And the latter is exactly what the " Life Cube " from startup Inflatable World is designed to provide .
Packaged into a four - foot - tall cube , it inflates into a 12 - foot - tall structure built from the same thick plastic as a bouncy house .
Designed to provide shelter and basic amenities for people in the days and weeks after a disaster , the instant housing will come with a $ 3,900 price tag , so the company 's first market could be wealthy survivalists .
" We need a versatile design that is completely self - contained that gives you instant survival , " said Nick Pedersen , business development head of the fledgling startup , based in Santa Barbara , California .
" We 'll get you through the critical first 72 hours and beyond . "
Inflatable World is n't the first company to focus on short - term housing for disaster - struck areas .
In fact , a wide variety of architects and builders , notably TED - grantee Cameron Sinclair and Architecture for Humanity , have designed structures to keep people alive in the aftermath of calamity .
But Inflatable World sees a market between the long - term FEMA trailers and the tents used in the immediate recovery efforts .
In FEMA 's 2008 Disaster Housing Plan , officials identified the period after the initial disaster but before homes can be rebuilt as a major priority .
" Finding and providing the actual structures to house displaced disaster victims during this interim housing period is the most tangible challenge that emergency management officials , at all levels of government , face , " they wrote ( .pdf ) .
In developing countries , providing basic shelter after disasters is even more difficult .
When a major quake struck Pakistan in October 2005 , 74,000 people died , most of them from exposure to the elements in the weeks after the initial disaster .
Just last week , another major earthquake struck Pakistan , prompting Red Cross officials to note the " urgent need for shelter and blankets . "
Right now , Pedersen said that Inflatable World was trying to raise one million dollars in capital to begin production of the Life Cubes .
They 'll be targeting first - responder agencies like the Red Cross as well as consumers in disaster - prone areas in the southeastern United
States .
Though the Life Cube is the company 's flagship product , and what made them a finalist at yesterday 's Department of Energy - sponsored
California Clean Tech Open , Inflatable World is also looking to sell other blow - up structures , including a next - gen slip and slide , because even the post - apocalypse should be fun .

The Bacon Meme Rolls On
By Chuck Sudo in Food on Dec 16 , 2008 4:30 PM
When we tried the country fried bacon at Risqué Café a few months back we knew that we were taking a few months off our life expectancy .
Then we noticed that Evanston 's popular hot dog joint Wiener and Still Champion ( also made their own country fried bacon and thought to ourselves , " What the hell ? "
We 're never visiting Risqué again .
This , readers , is the acme to which all who dabble in country fried bacon should aspire .
Wiener and Still Champion uses thick country bacon , gives it a nice coating of seasoned batter , and serves a heaping helping ( at least eight slices ) for only $ 5 .
What you get is the crispy goodness of , say , fried chicken with the tender succulence of bacon .
Served in a large Styrofoam sour container , the whole thing resembles a mock bucket of extra crispy from the Colonel .
An order of this and a couple of Wiener and Still Champion 's dipping dogs  corn dogs made with homemade polenta batter  and you 've got yourself a meal fit for a street king .
Wiener and Still Champion is located at 802 Dempster St. , Evanston .
Hours of operation are 10:30 a.m. - 9 p.m. Monday - Saturday ; 11:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Sunday .
The release this January of the first dissolvable tobacco product by a major company has some public health officials concerned .
" This is a wake - up call for the public health community , " says Gregory Connolly of Harvard School of Public Health .
" It 's a total sea change . "
For smokers who can't light up in the office or at a restaurant , a new aspirin - sized tablet , called " Camel Orb , " will let tobacco melt in their mouth .
The dissolvable product — arriving January in stores in Portland , Ore. , Columbus , Ohio , and Indianapolis — is the first such product by a major tobacco company and is part of a booming market in smokeless alternatives to cigarettes as smoke - free laws sweep the nation .
" It 's meeting the needs of smokers , " says Rob Dunham , of R.J. Reynolds , maker of Orb and Camel cigarettes .
With lozenge - like Orb , he says there 's no smoke , no spit , no litter .
In the past two years , the nation 's two largest cigarette companies , R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris USA , have moved into the smokeless tobacco market as cigarette sales continue to fall .
Each introduced smokeless pouches or " snus , " touted as spit - free products that sit inside the mouth .
They also bought smokeless tobacco companies .
" We 've been very pleased with the consumer response " to Marlboro Snus , says David Sutton , spokesman of Altria Group , which owns Philip Morris USA .
He says smokeless is a " growing category " with sales rising 6 % - 8 % annually .
He says cigarette sales are falling 2 % - 3 % each year .
Many public - health advocates are alarmed .
" These products are designed to enhance social acceptability of tobacco , " says Connolly .
" They 've left the realm of traditional tobacco products " and are more akin to food .
He says they may pose fewer health risks than cigarettes because they are smokeless , but he says they 're dangerous because they keep people addicted .
Also , he says , they 're attractive to kids , because they 're easy to hide .
Cigarette smoking rates among U.S. teens continued to fall last year but their smokeless tobacco use remained stagnant , according to the annual Monitoring the Future study at the University of Michigan .
Teens like risk - taking behavior and a tablet , unlike a cigarette , wo n't lure them , says Sara Troy Machir , spokeswoman of Star Scientific , a small tobacco company that sells two dissolvable products , Ariva and Stonewall .
After Ariva began selling in 2001 , a coalition of public health groups asked the Food and Drug Administration to regulate it as a food but FDA said it was tobacco .
Under a pending bill in Congress , which President - elect Barack Obama supports , the FDA would be given authority to regulate tobacco products .

Seven of the terrorists who brought carnage to Mumbai are British , Indian government sources claimed yesterday .
They said two British - born Pakistanis are under arrest .
And another five suspects are said to have been born and raised here .
Two of the seven are from Leeds , one is from Bradford and one from Hartlepool , the sources claimed .
All are aged between 20 and 26 .
The claims were made as the death toll in Mumbai reached 155 – with predictions it could go as high as 200 .
The Hartlepool suspect was allegedly found in the five - star Taj Mahal Palace hotel , scene of some of the most horrific killings .
The man from Bradford and one from Leeds were allegedly discovered on the 17th floor of the Oberoi - Trident Hotel .
A second man from Leeds was allegedly captured near a jetty after a gang of around 25 terrorists landed in Mumbai by boat on Wednesday .
The suspects were allegedly found with documentation , possibly including passports , which revealed their origin .
The sources say they also spoke to each other in a heavily - accented Punjabi common in UK Pakistani communities .
Gordon Brown yesterday urged caution saying it was “ premature ” to draw any conclusions .
He said Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had not told of him of “ any evidence at this stage ” that Britons were behind the massacres .
The Foreign Office and MI6 were last night trying to establish the facts amid chaotic scenes in Mumbai as Indian commandos continued operations to flush out the remaining gunmen .
If the terrorists are Britons , the UK security service will have to urgently discover how they slipped through the surveillance net .
In the wake of 7/7 London bombings the monitoring of militant and disaffected Muslim groups has been tightened up .
The security services were criticised after 7/7 for not keeping better track of the bombers .
Since the early 2000s Britain has had an unwelcome reputation as a haven for Islamic radicals .
The 7/7 bombings were planned in Dewsbury , Leeds , by Mohammed Siddique Khan and Shezhad Tanweer , both of Pakistani origin .
They travelled via Pakistan to Afghanistan and trained at jihadi camps before returning to murder 52 people on Underground trains and a bus .
Indian - born Dhiren Barot , raised in Britain , travelled to Pakistan - held Kashmir before plotting a dirty bomb attack on London and atrocities in New York .
Earlier this year Parviz Khan was jailed for life for plotting to behead a British Muslim soldier in Birmingham .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Thursday called religious freedom the foundation of a healthy society and defended the U.S. record in protecting Muslims caught up in foreign conflicts .
Addressing a United Nations “ interfaith ” meeting in almost certainly his last appearance at the world body , Bush , a devout Christian , said religious liberty was a central element of U.S. foreign policy that could best be promoted through democracy .
The meeting , attended by leaders and diplomats from some 70 countries , was initiated by Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah , who in an opening speech on Wednesday denounced terrorism as the enemy of all religions .
Bush implicitly criticized countries that restrict religious practice .
Saudi Arabia forbids public non-Muslim worship .
“ Freedom is God ’s gift to every man , woman , and child -- and that freedom includes the right of all people to worship as they see fit , ” Bush said , noting that the United States had been founded by people fleeing religious persecution .
Bush was speaking a short distance from the site of New York ’s former World Trade Center , destroyed in 2001 by planes piloted by Islamist al Qaeda militants .
His subsequent “ war on terror ” has been branded by some Muslim critics as a crusade against Islam .
Bush said God had called men “ to oppose all those who use His name to justify violence and murder . ”
“ Our nation has helped defend the religious liberty of others , from liberating the ( World War Two ) concentration camps of Europe to protecting Muslims in places like Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq , ’ said Bush , a Methodist who said faith had sustained him through his presidency , which ends in January .
“ We ’re not afraid to stand with religious dissidents and believers who practice their faith even where it is unwelcome . ”
German minister of state Hermann Groehe defended the right to convert to another faith -- a right not recognized in some Muslim countries .
“ It is unacceptable that up until now laws in some countries threaten those who want to convert with the death penalty , ” said Groehe , without naming any countries .
President Asif Ali Zardari of Muslim Pakistan said there was “ nothing more un - Islamic ” than discrimination , violence against women and terrorism , but also denounced hate speech against Islam in countries he did not identify .
“ The imaginary fear of Islam has been rising , ” Zardari said .
“ This is exactly what the terrorists had hoped to provoke .
Those in the West who accept this are falling into the trap of the terrorists . ”
Zardari , whose wife , former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated by a suicide bomber last year , proposed an international agenda to combat hate speech , religious discrimination and bigotry and promote religious dialogue .

Some of the nation 's biggest property developers are asking the government for assistance as a record amount of commercial real - estate debt comes due , according to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Monday .
The industry is reportedly asking to be included in a new $ 200 billion loan program initially created by the government to assist the market for student loans , car loans and credit - card debt .
The industry is warning that thousands of office complexes , hotels , shopping centers and other commercial buildings are headed for defaults , foreclosures and bankruptcies , owing to some $ 530 million of commercial mortgages that will be coming due for refinancing in the next three years .
They say that this poses another major threat to the global financial system , already severely weakened .
In a recent letter to Henry Paulson , signed by a dozen real - estate trade groups , the scenario was described as grim .
" Right now , we believe there is insufficient systemic capacity to refinance expiring , performing commercial real - estate loans .
For many borrowers , [ credit ] simply is not available . "
When a 2lb rabbit comes face to face with a 2 - ton rhino , it looks like a David and Goliath encounter of the animal kind .
But the wild bunny and Umquali the female rhino have become the best of friends since the rabbit - nicknamed Robby - has begun hopping in for breakfast at the Western Plains Zoo in outback New South Wales .
He waits until Umquali gets his morning supply of hay before bobbing through the fence and joining his huge friend for a shared meal .
While Umquali munches down the hay , Robby tucks into the seeds that drop down - and the huge southern white rhinoceros is more than happy for his little friend to share the ' tucker ' .
They may not have become nuzzling companions yet , but Robby has been seen tucking into seeds literally in the shadow of the rhino 's ferocious - looking horn .
' It 's quite a sight to see this little furry thing tucking into food beside the rhino with its tough skin , ' said zoo keeper Kevin Milton .
' You usually find some bird or rabbits hanging around trying to get the seed that 's in the rhino feed . '
But Robby has shown he has more courage than the rest of the colony of rabbits which live in the surrounding plains , venturing closer each day until deciding that the massive beast is n't going to cause him any serious damage .
Umquali has been in the spotlight at the zoo in recent months since giving birth in April to a calf named Nadira , making it the sixth rhino to be born in the zoo's white rhino breeding programme .
It began in 2003 when the species was brought from the Kruger National Park in South Africa .
Already Nadira is piling on the pounds .
Weighing ' only ' 8 stone at birth , she now stands at around 32 stone .
' Her mother is a very dominant female in the herd and Nadira uses that to her advantage , ' said Mr Milton .
' In a feeding frenzy Nadira pushes the other rhinos around and usually gets away with it .
But once they object , Umquali the mother steps in . '
Except , of course , if a little rabbit called Robby happens to drop by for a snack .
That 's when Umquali stops throwing her weight around and welcomes him to the ' table ' .

A retired managing director who wrote a cheque on toilet paper in protest at an " over - zealous " parking fine was today spared a £ 15 penalty .
Richard Roper , 63 , of Long Melford , Suffolk , was sent to sit at the back of a magistrate 's court for a morning session as an alternative punishment .
Roper staged his " peaceful protest " after receiving a £ 30 ticket for illegally parking his car across two spaces in Sudbury , Suffolk .
He was issued a court summons when Suffolk police refused to accept his " cheque " , saying it would cost £ 15 to cash .
" This is not a case of not wishing or refusing to pay but a case of the authorities refusing to accept my payment , " Roper said , giving evidence .
" What I did here , your honour , was done in good humour . "
In a letter he read to the court , he added : " My payment … has been written on stationery which aptly reflects my feelings towards the system which I am unfortunately forced to support through my taxes . "
District judge David Cooper suggested that a way of resolving the matter would be to ask Roper to sit at the back of court until his list of cases was complete .
" I ca n't say it would be very enlightening to you , " the judge said .
" If you do that , it 's a way of clearing it all off .
" As soon as I have finished court , you can be released .
Do you mind doing that ? "
Roper was assured it would not lead to a criminal record and said : " Your honour , thank you very much indeed . "

EVER had a feeling come over you that you just ca n’t explain ?
Like suddenly getting all warm and fuzzy when you meet someone for the first time , while somebody else who looks just as good leaves you cold ?
Or experiencing a sudden pang of fear on a plane even though you ’re totally at ease with flying ?
These seemingly unrelated and illogical human reactions may have a reasonable explanation after all , although one that not everyone will be happy to hear .
They may be reactions to other people ’s pheromones .
Pheromones are something of a sensitive subject in human biology .
Though they are found across the animal world from insects to mammals , research into human pheromones has been dogged by flaky experimental designs and dubious commercial endorsements , with the result that the entire field has a whiff of the disreputable about it .
“ It ’s not so much that the jury is out , but that the jury has been dismissed before the trial has begun , ” says Mike Meredith , a neuroscientist at Florida State University in Tallahassee , who studies animal pheromones .
In recent years , though , this has begun to change .
Evidence that animal pheromones do n’t always work in they way we thought , backed up by a growing number of brain - imaging studies in humans , is convincing some researchers that we really do make and respond to pheromones .
As a result some think it ’s time to stop asking if human pheromones exist and start investigating exactly how they affect our behaviour .
The term pheromone was …

I wanted to do something a bit different for the BeerCamp puzzle over Christmas .
Hopefully this qualifies .
Santa has to deliver presents at cities scattered over a small area .
Unfortunately he only knows where one of the cities is .
Thankfully he can expect that the residents will be able to point him to another city when he arrives there .
Santa has a lot of other places to go to so does n't want to spend too much time going back and forth visiting cities in this small area .
Can you help him ?
Your task is to write a computer program that will help to guide Santa as he looks for the cities that he must visit .
In order to help him to find the best program Santa approached Felspar and we put together a quick Django application so that he can find the best program to use .
The programs
The program that you write must be capable of interacting with the Santa website to tell a virtual Santa where to move .
He can make a single move going north , south , east or west .
The program will play on square tiles and can only see the eight tiles immediately around Santa ( and of course the tile that Santa is on ) .
At the start of the game you will be at a city and you will be told of the location of another city .
All locations are given relative to the position where Santa is .
So , for example , if you are told that a city is 3 north and 2 west then you must move north three times and west twice in order to land on it .
When you do land on it another city location will be revealed to you ( assuming that there are more cities to reveal ) .
The initial configuration is played with ten cities spread over a 15 ȕ 15 area .
The board is not bounded — there is nothing stopping you from just heading north forever .
You are not told where you are relative to the small populated area where the cities are — you only know the positions of the cities that you have discovered and that have been revealed to you .
Using the Travelling Santa website
The first thing you should do is to head over the Travelling Santa web site and register then log in .
To make sure you properly understand what happens we have created a web interface that you can use to play manually .
Click on the link for the “ test city plans ” and create a new city plan .
You will see some API instructions that will be useful to you later , four buttons to move Santa and the information that you currently have and there are links to show what that information will look like to your program .
Registering a program
When you have a program that you want to use to enter you should register it .
This is done from the home page by clicking on the “ list of programs ” link .
You will probably want to register one program for different algorithms that you want to enter , maybe also keeping one for test runs .
Later on you will be able to mark some programs as inactive .
Once the program has been registered it can make new city plans and control Santa 's journey completely automatically .
Scoring entries
There are many details here yet to be sorted out — your feedback is welcome .
Santa realises that there is a large random element to this and does n't want to penalise unlucky programs .
Because of this he will not count either the best or the worst performances of a program and nor will he just use the number of moves .
What he wants to do is to work out what the best route would have been given the starting city and then mark the program based on its ratio of moves that it made to this optimum .
That is , a program that visits all the cities using 100 moves , when it was possible to do the journey in 50 moves will get a score of 2 — clearly the lower the score the better and hopefully some programs will be able to get quite close to 1 .
Santa knows that if any programs get less than one then he 's got his calculations wrong .
In order to get the puzzle out so everybody gets plenty of time to think about it and work on it we have n't written the marking part of the system yet — that should follow sometime this week .
The API
You can work in any programming language that you want .
The only requirements are that the program must be able to make HTTP requests on our server ( both GET and POST ) and that it must be able to understand the JSON data sent back .
In order to make it easier for people we have not implemented any security layer — the program and the city plan URL s are based on SHA1 hashes .
So long as you do n't give them away this ought to be secure enough for the modest requirements of this site .
Making a new city plan
Once a program has been registered on the site you will get a URL that looks something like this :
http://santa.example.com/program/72ad9d54ed20330fdeaa539be922f6b9b8c01bd3/
This page will list out what your program has done so far .
In order to make a new city plan it must make a POST request to the following :
http://santa.example.com/program/72ad9d54ed20330fdeaa539be922f6b9b8c01bd3/new/1/
Note that case is important , and so are those trailing slashes .
Because the REST API expects to be given JSON you will need to put some valid JSON in the POST body .
This should just be the string null .
Assuming that everything works properly then you will get back a HTTP 302 with the base URL for the new city in the Location header .
For now there is only a single city configuration ( 10 cities on a 15 ȕ 15 grid ) , but Santa is considering adding new ones later on .
Getting the status of a current city plan
The URL that you will have gotten back from the previous operation will look something like this :
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/
This is the URL of the normal web page that you can use to monitor what is happening .
In order to get access to the starting data in JSON format the program should perform a GET agains :
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/json/
Again , the case and the trailing slash are important .
In order to make a move the program should now do a POST request against one of four URLs depending on which direction it wishes to move .
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/json/N/
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/json/S/
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/json/E/
http://santa.example.com/city/f2e20e4dc8929643b9a5b5adafa6dfef670f82aa/json/W/
Did we say that the case and the trailing slash were important ?
After processing you will get back an updated status message .
You will know when you have completed the map because the “ completed ” time stamp in the problem meta - data will be filled in .
JSON format
I 'm not going to document the JSON format here .
You should do some maps manually first and look at what you are told in the JSON for various scenarios — this is what the pretty printed JSON link is for .
Example program
In our Subversion repository you will find the following an example Python program that is none too clever , but shows how to interact with the site .
import sys , urllib2 , simplejson def main ( args ) : print " Solving problem at " + args [ 1 ]
#
The first program argument should be the URL of the configuration that we wish to make # i.e .
http://santa.example.com/program/17959aa371fd744b858cc10bdb6ad0662634a19f/new/1/ request = urllib2.urlopen ( args [ 1 ] , ' null ' ) #
Assuming this is succesful the final URL will be the redirection to the city page .
We can # then get the initial information by asking for the JSON blob .
status = simplejson.loads(urllib2.urlopen(request.url + ' json / ' ) ) #
The ' completed ' time stamp will be filled in when the final city is visited while not status [ ' problem ' ] [ ' completed ' ] : next = None #
The revealed list shows us cities we 've been told about .
The city ordering is stable , # but newly revealed cities may appear anywhere in the list for city in status [ ' revealed ' ] : #
Find the first city we 've not visited if not city [ ' visited ' ] : print city for k in city .keys ( ) : #
Find the first key which is not ' visited ' and then use that as the direction to move in if k != ' visited ' : next = simplejson.loads(urllib2.urlopen(request.url + ( ' json/%s / ' % k ) , ' null ' ) ) break break #
Make sure we 've refreshed the status properly if next : status = next else : status = simplejson.loads(urllib2.urlopen(request.url + ' json /' ) ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : sys.exit(main(sys.argv ) )
The Travelling Santa web site code
The code that runs the Travelling Santa web site is available for everybody to see .
It can be fetched via :
svn co http://svn.felspar.com/public/travelling-santa/trunk travelling - santa-trunk
Feel free to take a look .
Doing so is not cheating as it gives nothing away .
Running the site on your own system
If you 're familiar with Django then hopefully it will be fairly clear how to use the code and run the site locally to develop against — this has two benefits .
Firstly your code will run faster and secondly , you wo n't be overloading our server .
I 'll get some better instructions out , but some quick notes that might help you get up and running :
The settings .py contains connection data for a Postgres database .
You will need to change this to something that works on your machine , or create a " Django " user ( password of " django " ) who is the owner of a database called " santa " .
contains connection data for a Postgres database .
You will need to change this to something that works on your machine , or create a " Django " user ( password of " django " ) who is the owner of a database called " santa " .
You will want to set the PYTHONPATH to the location of the " web- site " directory .
If you do not have SimpleJSON installed in your Python installation ( i.e. you have n't or could n't do something like apt - get install python - simplejson ) then you will also want the " web- site /django/utils " directory on the PYTHONPATH .

You will need to use python manage .
py syncdb to create a blank database , and you will also need to do python manage .

json to load the standard city plan configuration .
Patches welcome
We 're very happy to accept patches for bug fixes and enhancements — especially simple example client programs to show how to interact with the site using other languages .

U.S. Representative and former presidential candidate Ron Paul tells Newsmax that bailouts of U.S. corporations are “ bad morally ” — and says current federal economic policies “ will literally destroy the dollar . ”
He also insists that the use of “ counterfeit ” paper money instead of a gold - backed currency is “ insane , ” and declares it is “ foolhardy ” for Barack Obama to propose national health care under the present economic conditions .
The Texas legislator ran for president as the Libertarian candidate in 1988 , and sought the Republican presidential nomination beginning in March 2007 .
He withdrew this past June and did not endorse GOP candidate John McCain .
Asked by Newsmax ’s Ashley Martella about the bailouts of Wall Street , the banking industry and apparently the Big Three automakers , Paul — a member of the House Financial Services Committee — said :
“ I think we ’re going in the wrong direction and I strongly oppose it .
“ I find it to be bad economics .
I find it bad morally to transfer wealth from one group of people to another no matter what kind of problems they have …
“ Lo and behold , the Constitution does n’t talk much about allowing Congress to go and bail out their friends .
So I oppose it from practical and well as philosophic reasons . ”
Martella noted that some of the big problems automakers face are union - related , such as commitments to life - long pensions and health care for retired workers .
Paul said the automakers are “ sort of trapped because they ’ve signed these contracts …
“ These commitments , which had been signed onto by the pressure of the unions , which were backed up by law , [ have ] brought them to their knees .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ If we take the funds from those people who have been more efficient to prop this system up , we ’ll never see the correction …
“ Excessive labor costs are very very important but the business people , the people who run the car companies , wo n’t dare say so , or wo n’t say very much , because they ca n’t offend the liberals in Congress who are the ones who are going to bail them out . ”
Paul said his fellow legislators are “ working real hard , we ’re working overtime , maybe this weekend we ’re going to work real hard to prolong the agony and not allow the market to correct the imbalances . ”
Paul has called for abandoning the Federal Reserve System and returning the nation to a gold and silver standard .
He told Newsmax why .
“ It ’s not so much that gold is perfect , it ’s that paper is insane .
To give politicians and bureaucrats and secret bankers the license to counterfeit money and create money out of thin air is destined to fail , and it has .
That ’s why we ’ve had this financial bubble develop since the linkage to gold has been severed in 1971 …
“ Now they ’re trying desperately to print and spend , but the bubble was overwhelming and the bursting of this bubble is something they can’t contain .
It would never happen under a gold standard because there would be no legal right for our central bank to spend money and create money out of thin air .
The arrogance of it all is unbelievable .
“ If we continue doing what we ’re doing now , we will literally destroy the dollar . ”
Paul , who is a physician , was critical of Obama ’s stated aim of developing a national health care plan .
He said : “ He has no money .
Where is he going to get the money ?
“ He has no intention of bringing our troops home .
He ’s talked a little about Iraq , but we ’re maintaining a world empire to the tune of a trillion dollars a year .
He wants more troops in Afghanistan …
You have to save some money someplace .
“ So if you want to help some people who are sick , we ’ll have to change our foreign policy and bring our troops home .
“ I believe that all goods and services in a free society should be by voluntary means and never through government coercion .
The more the government ’s involved , the more money they spend , and the more they pretend they ’re helping , it does but one thing — it pushes prices up .
“ When Obama says something like that , somebody in the media someday would have to say , ‘ Where are you going to get the money ? ’
If he ’s going to steal it from someone , who is he going to steal from ?
The producers are hurting .
The corporations are bankrupt .
There ’s no funding .
“ Instead of coming back to a balanced budget and living within our means , to propose national health care , and not attack our empire , is just foolhardy and will seal our fate . ”
An opponent of the Patriot Act , Paul was asked if he would give any credit to the measure for keeping Americans safe since 9/11 .
“ No , not really , ” he said .
“ All it ’s done is regulate people .
We ’ve regulated the American people .
The people are less free , but the fact that we have n’t had an attack is probably just a coincidence . ”
Paul was especially popular on college campuses during his most recent presidential campaign .
Martella asked : “ Did you sort of feel like a rock star when you spoke to college students ? ”
Paul responded : “ No , not really .
I ’m pleased that they ’re interested in the issue of freedom and individual responsibility , so I ’m delighted with that , but I guess the rock star status goes to Obama and others . ”

A potted plant at a cafe near Tokyo , Japan is entertaining customers by writing a regular blog about its feelings .
It is the work of a university engineer who has been studying how to communicate with plants .
He devised a sensor which he attached to the plant named " Midori - san " that measures bio-electric signals .
These are converted into data by a computer next the plant and then translated into Japanese in the form of a blog .
The plant 's latest entry reads : " It was cloudy today .
It was a cold day . "
The government 's new banking authority will start work on Monday by seeking three new board directors for Royal Bank of Scotland — now majority - owned by the taxpayer after the £ 20 bn government bail - out .
Existing shareholders in RBS shunned the fundraising by what had been Britain 's second - biggest bank until the credit crunch struck last year , leaving the taxpayer with 57.9 % of the bank - and a £ 2.4bn loss on the basis of the current share price .
Only a handful of existing investors took up the offer to subscribe to new shares at 65.5 p because the shares had been trading below that level , giving them no incentive to support the cash call .
The shares closed last night at 55.3 p , also leaving the directors of the bank , including the departing chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin , with a paper deficit .
The Edinburgh - based bank was raising £ 15 bn through the share sale while the government is also buying £ 5bn of preference shares which must be paid off before ordinary shareholders are able to receive dividends again .
Just 0.24 % of the 22.9bn shares being issued were bought by shareholders , prompting the new management team led by chief executive Stephen Hester to express " regret " about the low take - up .
The government stake , funded by the issue of government bonds known as gilts , will be controlled by UK Financial Investments , which will be chaired by J Sainsbury boss Philip Hampton .
The body , destined to keep the bank stakes at arm 's length from government , has also hired John Crompton from Merrill Lynch to devise and execute a strategy for the sale of the holdings , which also include Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley .
In the coming weeks , Lloyds TSB and HBOS will be added to its stable .
Agreeing to three new non-executives for the board of RBS , which also needs a new chairman when Sir Tom McKillop retires at next year 's annual meeting , is the body 's main priority .
Hester , while regretting the lack of interest from existing shareholders , said he understood that " market sentiment toward the banking sector made this [ rights issue ] uneconomic in the short term " .
" We must put the past behind us and move forward with a clear focus on what we need to do next .
We will focus on rebuilding RBS on its powerful customer franchises globally and , in time , deliver the economic returns that all our shareholders expect and deserve , " he said .
He has already put management consultants at McKinsey to work on reviewing the operation , which expanded rapidly with Goodwin at the helm , starting with the acquisition of NatWest in 2000 and a spate of other deals , including insurance company Churchill and Charter One in the US before culminating in last year 's ill - timed takeover of the investment banking arm of Dutch bank ABN Amro .
Much of the expansion is likely to be wound down by Hester , who is expected to sanction job cuts , particularly in the investment banking operations .
Goodwin , who stopped being chief executive last week , will leave at the end of January .
Decisions will also need to be made about RBS 's sponsorship of sports such as Formula 1 , golf and rugby amid much speculation that the bank is trying to pull the plug on some of the multimillion pound deals .
The bank said the sponsorships were " naturally reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are aligned to our business objectives " .
As the taxpayer took control of RBS , Gordon Brown visited the workforce of Halifax , which is part of the HBOS group due to be taken over by Lloyds TSB .
Derek Simpson , Unite joint general secretary , said : " This visit gave the staff an opportunity to raise their concerns in relation to the current turmoil across the financial services sector . "
The number of jobs to be cut when Lloyds takes over HBOS is yet to be announced , but there are persistent rumours that as many as 40,000 out of a near 140,000 - strong workforce are under threat .

Barack Obama has been elected the 44th president of the United States of America .
After nearly two years of intense campaigning in primaries and the general election , voters have given an overwhelming victory to Barack Obama .
" Change has come to America , " the first African - American leader tells his country .
Story By Alex Johnson , Reporter , msnbc.com Barack Obama , a 47 - year - old first - term senator from Illinois , shattered more than 200 years of history Tuesday night by winning election as the first African - American president of the United States .
A crowd of 125,000 people jammed Grant Park in Chicago , where Obama addressed the nation for the first time as its president - elect at midnight ET .
Hundreds of thousands more -- Mayor Richard Daley said he would not be surprised if a million Chicagoans jammed the streets -- watched on a large television screen outside the park .
" If there is anyone out there who doubts that America is a place where anything is possible , who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time , who still questions the power of our democracy , tonight is your answer , " Obama declared .
" Young and old , rich and poor , Democrat and Republican , black , white , Hispanic , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , disabled and not disabled , Americans have sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of red states and blue states , " he said .
" We have been and always will be the United States of America .
" It 's been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this day , in this election , at this defining moment , change has come to America , " he said to a long roar .
Obama congratulated his opponent , Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , for his " unimaginable " service to the United States , first as a prisoner of war for five and a half years in North Vietnam and then for nearly three decades in Congress .
McCain called Obama to offer his congratulations at 11 p.m. ET , Obama 's chief spokesman , Robert Gibbs , told NBC News .
Obama thanked McCain for his " class and honor " during the campaign and said he was eager to sit down and talk about how the two of them could work together .
The GCP prediction for this momentous event was set for the 24 hour period beginning at 15:00 Eastern time ( 20:00 UTC ) on November 4th .
This includes several hours of election day in the US , and enough time for the votes to be counted to determine the winner of the election ( assuming the margin would not be razor thin ) , and continues until most of the world has awakened to begin a day with a new US President - elect .
Beginning about two hours before the official announcement that Obama had won , the data show a consistent positive trend that continues through the declaration at 23:00 ET and his subsequent speech to 125,000 people at Grant Park in Chicago and the public via TV .
The formal data segment overall shows a significant positive trend through the 24 hour period .
Chisquare is 87102 on 86400 df , for p = 0.046 and Z = 1.686 .
This represents a relatively large effect size compared with the average of Z = 0.33 over the full GCP database .
Late in the day , with a clear win in Pennsylvania and Ohio also decided for Obama , his win appears to be a fait accompli .
At this time , about two hours before the official declaration , the data take on a steady positive trend .
It continues through the formal announcement and McCain 's concession speech at 11:00 pm and for two hours after Obama 's acceptance speech in Grant Park at midnight .
The following figure shows this period of time .
This is of course a post hoc analysis , rather than a formal result , but the trend is consistent with the idea that the widespread and intense emotional response to Obama 's election might register on our network .
Alternate Measures
The huge worldwide interest and engagement in the 2008 election suggests a deeper exploration of the data is warranted .
Early results using alternate measures are available .
You will also be interested in the analyses for President Obama 's Inauguration .
There are three other Obama related GCP events that are consistent with an effect of his presence or charisma , though we can't make scientific claims beyond the finding of consistent correlations .
In June , we identified the final determination that he would be the Democratic nominee as a formal event .
Then , in August we did a formal assessment of his nomination acceptance speech .
Yet another related measure was an informal , exploratory FieldREG recording at an Obama rally in Chester PA .
All of these show positive , sometimes striking results .
Should n't the effect be bigger ?
Given the powerful emotions aroused by Barack Obama 's success , and the feeling of wonder and joy generated in huge numbers of people around the world , we might expect a correspondingly powerful effect in the GCP data .
It is positive and significant at the usual 5 % level , but it is n't " off the charts " and we are tempted to believe it should be .
Quoting one correspondent , " I had hoped to see a bigger response , and this only increases my doubts about the consciousness hypothesis . "
This offers an opportunity to explain the statistical nature of the GCP question , " Is there a correlation of structure in our data with widely shared states of consciousness and emotion generated by great events ? "
The tools we have to answer this kind of question are averages and variance and correlations among the scores from all the devices in the network .
Such measures have intrinsic variability , which is another way of saying they are " noisy . "
Thus , when we look for structure , we have to expect some difficulty differentiating real patterns from mere noise -- both signal and noise are represented by the same simple numbers .
In general , to understand the data , we have to examine the distribution of the numbers to see if they are pushed away from the mean or spread out unexpectedly .
If the distribution is distorted in identifiable ways ( corresponding to the scientific predictions or hypotheses we have set ) then we can say there is evidence for the signal we are looking for .
Yet , because of the intrinsic variability , it can happen that the signal is obscured or weakened by an accidental but entirely normal excess of variation in the noisy background .
Or , equally problematic , we may see an exciting trend or spike of activity that is just normal fluctuation .
Here is our standard caution to encourage patience and to avoid over - interpretation of GCP data :
It is important to keep in mind that we have only a tiny statistical effect , so that it is always hard to distinguish signal from noise .
This means that every " success " might be largely driven by chance , and every " null " might include a real signal overwhelmed by noise .
In the long run , a real effect can be identified only by patiently accumulating replications of similar analyses .
In addition to this signal - to - noise issue , we know from categorization studies that celebrations ( and the 2008 Election has a great deal of this quality ) show relatively small effects in the standard Netvar statistic , but relatively large effects using one of our Alternate Measures called Covar , which looks at second order variance of the internode correlations .
Finally , an instructive example of what is a " big " effect .
The September 11 2001 terror attacks were analysed carefully and extensively , and we can conclude that the effects were among the largest in our 10 - year database .
The following figure shows a comparison of 24 hours of data from 9/11 beginning with the crash of the first plane into the World Trade towers , and a 24 hour period of data beginning with the announcement that Barack Obama had won the election to become the 44th President of the United States of America .
The figure speaks for itself -- remembering that we cannot reliably interpret single events like this , nevertheless it appears that the election shows at least as strong an effect as the terror attacks .
We can hope that the election is the beginning of truly positive change .
Partly because of XMonad , partly because I 've been looking into functional languages for a while , I 'm now learning Haskell .
Looking for some introductory material I 've found the following docs useful :
The online beta version of the tutorial - like Real World Haskell here
The one I like the most , Yet Another Haskell Tutorial originally by Hal Daume III , available at Wikipedia
And A gentle introduction to Haskell , Version 98 that appears to be a kind of official tutorial , though somewhat difficult to grasp at first .
And just for kicks , here 's a solution to the last exercise of the chapter " Language basics " of YAHT .
The only difference between this and the one in the book is that here getNums is tail - recursive .
Not that it really matters ...
module Main where import IO main = do hSetBuffering stdin LineBuffering nums <- getNums [ ] putStrLn ( " The sum is " ++ ( show ( sum nums ) ) ) putStrLn ( " The product is " ++ ( show ( product nums ) ) ) printFactorials nums getNums xs = do putStr " Give me a number ( or 0 to stop ) : " num <- getLine if num == " 0 " then return xs else getNums ( ( read num :: Integer ) : xs ) printFactorials [ ] = return ( ) printFactorials ( x : xs ) = do putStrLn ( ( show x ) ++ " factorial is " ++ ( show ( factorial x ) ) ) printFactorials xs factorial n | n < 0 = 0 | n > 1 = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) | otherwise = 1
Note that this is a basic solution ; it 's possible to solve the problem in different , more elegant ways - see the comments at Reddit .
Bush Labor Department misled Congress in effort to privatize jobs John Byrne
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008
Print This Email This President George W. Bush 's Labor Department misled Congress in an effort to prove outsourcing jobs to private companies was more efficient than assigning the jobs to government employees , according to a Government Accountability Office report released Monday .
The report ( pdf here ) found that the Department used fictional projected numbers to improve " savings reports " -- even when real numbers were already available .
And when the government did find private firms to take a government job , that employee generally was either reassigned to another task with the same title or promoted .
The effort was called " competitive sourcing , " aimed to increase government efficiency by having federal and private organizations compete for providing services .
While part of a federal government approach since 1955 , the Bush Administration has made the approach a key element of the President 's Management Agenda under the Office of Management and Budget .
An investigation revealed , however , that the Labor Department -- under direction from Bush budget officials -- deliberately withheld information about true costs .
According to the report , the Department of Labor " excluded a number of substantial costs in its reports to Congress -- such as the costs for precompetition planning , certain transition costs and staff time and post competition review activities -- thereby understanding the full costs of this contracting approach . "
The report noted that this approach was consistent with " guidance " given by the Administration 's Office of Management and Budget .
In addition , the report found the Department 's " savings reports " were " not reliable : a sample of three reports contained inaccuracies , and others used projections when actual numbers were available , which sometimes resulted in overstated savings . "
Most workers were also demoralized as the government tried to find private firms to take over their jobs , the probe found .
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao began having workers compete for their jobs in 2004 .
Few employees have lost their jobs .
But when the government found a private company to take over their position , 84 percent were reassigned to different positions with the same title or were promoted .
Since implementation , 22 employees were laid off or demoted , all of them African American .
The senator who commissioned the report , Iowa 's Tom Harkin , along with the House committee that oversees the Labor Department , David Obey , said in a letter Monday that the report proved " the negative impact the Bush Administration 's failed policies have had " on the Department .
" Under the direction of this White House , the Department of Labor has increasingly attempted to move work performed by Federal employees to private contractors " and , in so doing , hurt workers ' morale and " grossly overstated savings , " they wrote .
" We look forward to working with the Obama Administration to strengthen the Department of Labor as it undertakes the critical missions of making sure our workplaces are safe ; protecting employee pensions , health benefits and rights ; and providing workers with the skills they need to compete successfully in the 21st century economy . "
Scientists : Space Lasers Could Measure Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide
December 8th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Lasers :
They ’re more than just fun toys .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) recently demonstrated how lasers can accurately measure atmospheric CO2 levels .
The A - SCOPE ( Advanced Space Carbon and Climate Observation of Planet Earth ) space mission is one of six being considered by the agency .
According to ESA scientists , atmospheric column CO2 can be measured from space using two short laser pulses emitted at adjacent wavelengths .
As a result of the pulses , CO2 is absorbed by one of the wavelengths .
The other wavelength is used as a reference point , and the comparison between the two shows the total column concentration of CO2 .
A - SCOPE proponents believe that understanding more about the movement of carbon between the atmosphere , land , and ocean will improve estimates of the global carbon cycle ’s future changes .
If the A - SCOPE mission is chosen , expect a launch in 2016 .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
By Kevin Connolly
BBC News , New York
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
I was starting to think that it was time we got real and stopped referring to these stilted , stage - managed , stuttering candidate encounters as debates at all .
After all , the earlier meetings of Campaign 2008 were only faintly reminiscent of the world of genuine political argument - just as Olympic fencing with its padded suits , elaborate rules and obsession with safety is a pale shadow of the bloodthirsty and dangerous world of real sword fighting .
Well - I was wrong .
On Long Island , Barack Obama and John McCain restored a sense of vigour to the debating process with a tense , edgy and occasionally highly - personal face - to - face showdown .
I could n't help smiling when I heard that both camps were insisting on having air - conditioning outlets positioned above the respective heads of their candidates to make sure they did n't start looking hot and sticky - and therefore shifty - under the lights .
There had been nothing in Oxford , St Louis or Nashville to prompt either of them to break into a sweat .
In Long Island , they both had reason to be glad of that cooling flow of air .
Punchy questions
In part , that was down to the format of the debate which allowed the two men to argue directly with each other as they sat together around a horse - shoe shaped table .
Schieffer 's questioning produced fierce exchanges between the candidates
But a little credit must go to the moderator , the veteran CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer , who asked punchy and direct questions and had enough poise to sit back and let the two candidates fight it out directly .
It produced some spiky exchanges - after one discussion of whether or not Americans should be paying higher taxes , Mr McCain tried to have the last word by saying : " Let 's not raise anybody 's taxes . "
Mr Obama almost spoke over him to add : " I do n't mind paying a little more . "
Schieffer 's best question was probably a direct challenge to the candidates to establish whether or not they were prepared to repeat to each other 's faces the kind of slurs and distortions their campaign workers and surrogates happily peddle every day .
Mr Obama 's best direct shot was probably when he chided his rival with the words : " John , 100 % of your TV ads are negative . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr McCain was more aggressive - partly because that 's the way he is , partly because he is now trailing badly in opinion polls in a whole string of battleground states and is therefore the candidate who needs to change the game .
He made a couple of dismissive references to Mr Obama 's " eloquence " - for which you can read slippery stretching of the truth .
And he accused him directly of not keeping to a promise to restrict himself to using limited funds from the public purse for his campaign - an offer he made before he realised the huge advantage that his colossal fund - raising machine could offer .
Mr McCain looked directly at Mr Obama and said : " You did n't keep your word on campaign finance . "
In the jargon of American politics , that was " taking it to Obama " - but while McCain supporters will feel he landed plenty of scoring punches it did n't feel to me that he'd done nearly enough to reverse the tide of bad economic news and bad opinion polls which are combining to choke the life out of his campaign .
Joe the plumber
The debate lasted 90 minutes and for the first 45 of them the atmosphere between the candidates crackled with genuine disagreement and , I thought , thinly - veiled dislike .
But there was a whiff of the surreal about the debate , too , which helped to offset the tension a little .
Key words used most frequently by Barack Obama in the debate
Enlarge Image
Very early on , Mr McCain mentioned by name a plumber from Ohio who'd been seen in many television news clips discussing with Barack Obama how his tax plans would affect small businesses .
Mr McCain addressed the plumber - Joe Wurzelbacher - directly through the camera - a good , if rather over - used populist trick .
Mr Obama though , then did the same thing .
And when the debate came onto the subject of healthcare , the Wurzelbachers were back front and centre in the political life of the nation again listening along with the rest of us to a discussion of how the rival plans would impact their lives .
Mr Wurzelbacher is now the most famous plumber in North America since Super Mario , although he must have got quite a shock when his name first popped up .
Competing visions
Not all of the debate lived up to the promise of the early passages .
The two candidates produced fairly predictable presentations on issues like health and education and at one point even found themselves discussing - albeit briefly - the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement .
You'd have got long odds against that coming up at the start of the evening .
Key words used most frequently by John McCain in the debate
Enlarge Image
The question of who won is more difficult than usual because the two men are aiming to give such different performances .
As a front - runner , Mr Obama seeks to look cool and measured - as underdog , Mr McCain has to look scrappier and more aggressive .
They 'll probably both be pleased with their performances I think , although it 's impossible to imagine that Mr McCain 's was convincing enough to shift the terms of an election that is slipping out of his grasp .
So my winner ( with a nod to Bob Schieffer for his sharp questioning ) is the American voter who has dutifully watched the earlier debates in huge numbers and been rewarded only with dull and predictable exchanges .
At last the country was given a debate worthy of the name , which reminded us what this race is about and what drives the competing visions of the two men fighting for the most powerful job on earth .

What are these ?
Opinion
Cheney wielded the war to deceive
In the end , the shame of Vice President Dick Cheney was total : unmitigated by any notion of a graceful departure , let alone the slightest obligation of honest accounting .
Although firmly ensconced , even in the popular imagination , as an example of evil incarnate - nearly a quarter of those polled rated him the worst vice president in U.S. history , and another 41 percent as " poor " in this week 's CNN poll - Cheney exudes the confidence of one fully convinced that he will get away with it all .
And why not ?
Nothing , not his suspect role in the Enron debacle , which foretold the economic meltdown , or his office 's fabrication of the false reasons for invading Iraq , have ever been seriously investigated because of White House stonewalling .
Nor is the new president , committed as he is to nonpartisanship , likely to open up Cheney 's can of worms .
Cheney has even had a pass on torture , the " enhanced interrogation " policy that he initiated in his first months in office .
" Was it torture ?
I do n't believe it was torture , " he told the Washington Times on Monday , a week after the release of a unanimous Senate report concluding that the policies Cheney initiated were indeed torture .
In fact , the Senate Committee concluded that the model for the Cheney - Bush interrogation policy was the torture practices of the Chinese Communists during the Korean War .
But it 's not torture when the U.S. president does it , according to the legal judgments Cheney 's chief counsel , David Addington , pushed through the administration .
Fortunately , Cheney 's view of the unquestioned unitary power of the presidency was scorned by the Vice President - elect Joe Biden : " His notion of a unitary executive , " Biden said , " meaning that , in time of war , essentially all power , you know , goes to the executive I think is dead wrong . "
With Biden occupying Cheney 's old office and presumably his secret bunkers as well , maybe we will , at last , learn a bit more of the nefarious truth of the man .
One place to start is with the statement of retired U.S. Army Col.
Larry Wilkerson , who was Colin Powell 's chief of staff , who stated unequivocally that Cheney was the primary author of the torture policy : " There 's no question in my mind where the philosophical guidance and the flexibility in order to do so originated - in the vice president of the United States ' office . "
That lame duck Cheney was bellowing his claim of innocence in a series of friendly interviews should have been expected .
For he , like the president he served , can use the self - proclaimed " global war on terror " as a convenient cover for eight years of treachery on all fronts :
" If you think about what Abraham Lincoln did during the Civil War , what FDR did during World War II ; they went far beyond anything we 've done in a global war on terror . "
Actually , neither of those presidents authorized the waterboarding of prisoners or the other explicit acts of torture approved by this administration largely under the vice president 's direction .
But the true absurdity of Cheney 's self - defense is in placing the nebulous war on terror at the same level of threat as the civil war that tore apart this country or the Nazi military machine that rumbled unstoppable across most of Europe , augmented by the military might of Japan .
The invocation of a " global war on terror " is a big - lie propaganda device that has no grounding in reality .
The proof that " terrorism " does not exist as an enemy identifiable by commonality of structure , purpose and leadership comparable to the World War II Axis or the confederacy can be found in its use as a target to justify the invasion of Iraq .
An invasion billed as a response to the 9/11 attack , which had nothing to do with Iraq .
The Bush administration , with Cheney in the lead , did not so much fight the danger of terrorism as exploit it for partisan political purpose .
The record is quite clear that the administration was asleep at the switch before 9/11 , blithely ignoring stark warnings of an impending attack .
But the hoary warmongering after 9/11 afforded a convenient distraction from the economic problems at home .
As I questioned in a column on June 26 , 2002 : " Has the war on terrorism become the modern equivalent of the Roman circus , drawing the people 's attention away from the failures of those who rule them ?
Corporate America is a shambles because deregulation , the mantra of our president and his party , has proved to be a license to steal . "
That is the true legacy of Dick Cheney and the president he ill - served .
Whither NASA ?
On the campaign trail a year or so ago , then - Presidential candidate Barack Obama said he would cut NASA money to help fund education .
Then he changed his tune , saying he would add money to NASA 's budget to help ease the transition from the Shuttle era -- which will end abruptly with the last Shuttle launch in 2010 -- to the age of Constellation , NASA 's program for future manned spaceflight using the new Ares rockets , still being designed and built .
It should be noted he said that while stumping in Florida and Texas , both of which are major states supporting NASA ; they 're the homes of NASA 's Kennedy and Johnson space centers .
Then came rumors that NASA chief Mike Griffin was giving Obama 's NASA transition team a lot of static .
Griffin denounced those rumors , but that does n't do much in real life to dispel them ; denials never do .
And so the whispers still exist that Constellation may suffer cuts , drastic or otherwise .
At the same time , Obama is making an incredibly strong showing of his support for science .
Nobel Laureate Steven Chu will head the Department of Energy .
Physicist John Holdren will be his science advisor .
Jane Lubchenco will head the NOAA .
These people are all highly - trained scientists at the top of their game , not policy wonks or campaign contributors or just plain old buddies grossly unqualified to run a lemonade stand , let alone a government agency .
A fresh wind is blowing through the White House , and it 's taking away the stench of antiscience .
To doubly mix a metaphor , it looks like the jackbooted heel that 's been at the throat of science for eight years is about to get the boot .
Still and all ... where does NASA fit in with all this ?
It has always been scrutinized for wasting money .
That 's not surprising , given how high profile NASA missions are , and how expensive they seem .
When an astronaut loses a $ 100,000 tool bag over the side of the space station , it seems like a colossal boondoggle .
But that ignores the details : you can't just take a canvas tote bag into space ; the materials have to withstand a vacuum , not disintegrate when the air is gone , not leak out toxins when the pressure drops , be accessible in microgravity and by astronauts ' bulky gloves , and so on .
There is no simple stuff when you 're dealing with space travel .
Complexity equals cost .
It 's orders of magnitude worse when a probe is lost .
The instant a Mars spacecraft goes missing , the first thing the newspapers report is " The 200 million dollar Mars probe ... " .
Heck , they do that when things go well .
But in reality , NASA is cheap .
It comprises less than 1 % of the U.S. annual budget .
It 's paid for itself a dozen times over ( did you know that digital cameras are a direct descendant of the detectors used in Hubble 's Wide Field / Planetary Camera ? ) .
We get so much out of it , for what is in reality so little cost .
But now we 're in a recession .
The economy is tanking , and politicians need to look like ( or actually indicate ) they are fiscally responsible .
Now , when you have a full hard drive , it makes more sense to delete that 4
Gb movie you 've already seen rather than manually delete a bunch of 4 K text files .
But politicians are n't like that .
They go after highly - visible targets , even if they are only a tiny fraction of the problem .
And NASA 's head sticks way , way out .
Cutting it may look responsible ... even when we still spend $ 20 million dollars per hour on a war started for no reason , when a large fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars given as a blank check to the bank bailout program might as well have been shredded , and when there are far larger government agencies than NASA that would n't be able to fund their catering bill with the cost of NASA 's lost tool bag .
And now there are reports that Obama is looking very closely at NASA 's budget .
I agree -- quite strongly -- that NASA really needs to tighten up its budget management .
But NASA is a drop in the government 's bucket as far as money goes .
And that is a huge bucket .
If I had Obama 's ear , I would tell him this : put a team on NASA .
Have them look over its management , see where improvements can be made , and recommend implementations so that it runs a tighter ship .
But we need that ship .
There are many , many places to go looking for money that can be used to fund needed programs , money that is being wasted as quickly as it's printed .
NASA does n't need budget cuts .
It needs better fiscal management , and it needs more money .
Money to build bigger telescopes that take pictures of surpassing beauty , images of distant realms that inspire children and make adults gasp in awe .
Money to build satellites that study our home planet and see what man has wrought .
Money to research how to build better airplanes ( that 's what the first " A " in NASA is , after all ) .
Money to reach out and touch other worlds .
And money to design cheaper access to space to make all this possible .
NASA is flawed , of course .
It 's a government bureaucracy .
But it does n't need much to keep it going , and going better .
NASA is a symbol .
It shows us the best of what we can achieve .
Studying the Universe , exploring it , trying to understand it , is part of what makes us human .
We need that , and it costs so little .
I hope some of the brilliant scientists Obama has chosen to advise him can make that point to him .
I would consider it one of their most important duties .

I prefer watching DVDs on a DVD player attached to a TV , rather than watching on my PC .
DVD players are so much simpler to operate – just power it on , insert the disc and watch it .
No need to wait for it to boot up , no need to start a media player and most importantly , I can shut it off instantly by flipping the mains off – no need to wait ( again ) while it systematically shuts itself down .
Besides , watching a movie on the PC is so distracting – I ’m often tempted to go online to read new mails or messages or feeds .
There is one solution to this problem – GeeXBox .
GeeXBox is a small media center Linux live CD distribution that can run on any PC and play almost any media like DVDs and online streams without any codecs , without any OS ( Windows , Linux , Mac etc ) and without even a hard disk !
GeeXBox is perfect to transform your old hard disk less PC lying on the corner into the ultimate media center PC .
GeeXBox can play all kinds of files – VCDs , DVDs , DivX , XviD , AVI , Ogg , MP3 , MP4 , anything .
Simply boot your PC from the GeeXbox bootable media and it will automatically ejects it after copying itself to the memory .
The optical drive is now free to load your DVD discs for playing .
But that ’s not how a DVD player operates , does it ?
You still have to keep the GeeXBox CD handy to power up the PC , and wait … how do you open the optical drive when your PC is turned off ?
No , that would n’t work .
In order to make your PC behave completely like a DVD player you have to install GeeXBox into your hard disk .
To install GeeXBox , boot from the CD and at the boot prompt type " install " and hit enter .
This will launch the installer and from there it ’s like installing any Linux distro .
If you have done that before you will have no problem in installing GeeXBox , otherwise you can follow the installation guide .
GeeXBox requires just an 8 MB partition to install .
Now every time you power on your PC , you will get a boot menu with the option of loading GeeXBox or the other operating system (s ) .
When you need to watch a movie and only a movie , load GeeXBox , insert the movie DVD and play it .
When you need to turn off , stop the movie and hit Exit in GeeXBox ’s menu and your PC will turn off instantly – just like a DVD player .
A Riverside teenager who left home to run an errand came home 20 minutes later to find paramedics , police and a firetruck outside his home .
A neighbor took him to see the family dog , beaten and bleeding under a bush .
The female dog , a 6 - month - old shepherd mix named Karley , allegedly was beaten by a neighbor , Los Angeles County Assistant Fire Chief Glynn Johnson , who was placed on administrative leave Friday while the incident is investigated .
Johnson reportedly told investigators that he had acted in self - defense .
Karley was euthanized a few hours after the incident , which occurred about 4:30 p.m. Monday .

Karley apparently had run across Johnson ’s yard and into the next yard .
Travis Staggs said he started walking the dog home from his yard when Johnson offered to take Karley home .
“ Then something in his head snapped and he started beating the dog , ” Staggs said .
Johnson allegedly punched Karley with a closed fist about a dozen times and then beat her with an 11 - inch rock , Staggs said , adding that he tried to stop Johnson but was pushed away .

Authorities received two calls from the 17000 block of Armintrout Drive : one from a woman who said her husband was attacked by a dog , and another from a man who said his neighbor had beaten a dog , Riverside County Sheriff ’s Sgt. David Barton said in a statement .
After Brandon
Toole , 19 , saw the injured dog , his 17 - year - old sister , Heather , rushed the animal to a veterinarian , and later an animal intensive care unit .
Karley was euthanized because she was so badly injured , said Jeff Toole , the teenagers ’ father .
“ I ca n’t describe the way [ Karley ] looked and the pain she was in , ” Brandon Toole said .

Police said Johnson was taken to a hospital for wrist and thumb injuries .
Jeff Toole said the thumb puncture occurred when Johnson grabbed Karley ’s mouth and broke her jaw .
Johnson told his bosses about the incident , which he described as self - defense , said Los Angeles County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman .
“ The Los Angeles County Fire Department is deeply concerned with allegations regarding Assistant Chief Glynn Johnson ’s actions in the beating of his neighbor ’s dog , ” Freeman said in a statement .

The Riverside County Sheriff ’s Department is investigating .
Malicious and intentional injuring of an animal is a felony .
The Toole family said Karley was a well - behaved dog .
“ We are going to have to find another place to live , ” Jeff Toole said .

Is It Cheesy to Name Your Baby After a Holiday If Your Due Date is December 25 ?
Baby Naming Expert Says It 's OK To Consider the Name Mary Christmas -- Though With A Few Caveats
As long as the name you choose for your baby feels like a celebration for his or her arrival , it 's fine to go ahead and tap your favorite holiday , according to an article posted today online at BabyZone.com , a website that serves the needs of expectant and new moms .
" Holidays like Christmas offer copious options to new parents who have n't yet decided what to name their baby , " says Suelain Moy , baby name expert and author of the book , Names to Grow On , in the Q&A , " Is It Cheesy to Name Your Baby After a Holiday ? " ( Link : http://www.babyzone.com/askanexpert/holidays-baby-name).
Holidays like Christmas offer copious options to new parents who have n't yet decided what to name their baby Is It Cheesy to Name Your Baby After a Holiday ?
I 've had to show people my license a couple of times People think it 's fun It 's positive .
It 's a conversation piece .
According to the feature posted on BabyZone , Natalie , Natalia , and Natasha all mean " born on Christmas Day . "
Noel , Noelle , and Navidad simply mean " Christmas . "
Many December babies have been named Nicholas ( after St. Nick ) , Claus ( after Santa ) , or Kris ( after Mr. Kringle ) .
Other festive names include Joy , Holly , and Yule .
However , be aware when making first and last name combinations .
Consider the case of the 90 or so women in the U.S. whose legal name is Mary Christmas .
While Utah - based , stay - at - home mom , Mary Christmas ( nee Young ) admits that her name is a big hit during the holidays , she does encounter her share of doubting Thomases .
" I 've had to show people my license a couple of times , " she said to BabyZone .
And when her name shows up on the caller ID or on a package , some folks think it 's a prank .
Still , it 's hard to find fault with a name that brings people so much joy and happiness .
" People think it 's fun , " Mrs. Christmas said ( good - naturedly ) to BabyZone .
" It 's positive .
It 's a conversation piece . "
And , as her husband likes to point out , he gets to celebrate with Mary Christmas , not just on December 25 , but all year long .

We ’ve just done something that makes us all very proud at Logitech – we ’ve shipped our one billionth mouse .
How cool is that !?
When all of this started for Logitech back in the early ‘ 80s ( PDF ) , the mouse was primarily a tool for CAD ( computer - aided design applications ) .
Since then , the mouse has become something much more – it is truly the key to the kingdom – the device that unlocked the power of the computer .
The mouse opened up computing to the average person by providing a simple , intuitive way to interact with the computer .
As we look to the future and what it holds for the mouse , I ’ve tasked our product - development team with continuing to assess new technologies and how they might enhance the human - computer interface .
No idea is too far - fetched , from touch technology to mind control .
If you take a look at some of our ideas that never made it to manufacturing ( PDF ) , you ’ll see that our engineers can be pretty creative .
In conjunction with next Wednesday ’s celebration of the 40th anniversary of the first public demonstration of the computer mouse , I ’ll be blogging more about what the future holds for the mouse .
Until then , I want to thank you for your support .
We could n’t have reached this milestone without our customers , so to celebrate , we ’re inviting you to follow the journey of our billionth mouse from the factory to its final destination for the chance to win some great prizes .

Wait , It Gets Worse :
The part where the family tree of every living creature on Earth collides at a single point on a single day in the past , making you related to Hitler as well as every insect you 've ever killed ..
Weâre all familiar with the basics of evolution : that a munificent monkey - goddess birthed us all from Her banana - scented womb .
But there are some lesser - discussed implications of natural selection that are just plain weird .
For one , scientists have concluded that around 140,000 years ago in Kenya , there lived a woman called Mitochondrial Eve ( cavemen had weird names ) , so named because today , every living human on Earth has her mitochondrial DNA in their body ( cavemen were also prescient ) .
And only 3,000 years ago lived a person known as the Most Recent Common Ancestor , who , through exponential growth of the family tree , is the ancestor ofevery single person on Earth .
And did you know that , based on the same principles ( and a lot of rape ) , Genghis Kahn has over 16 million descendants ?
Whoâs your Daddy now ?!
Well , for one , you can rest assured than anyone you ever have sex with in your entire life is at least your distant , distant cousin .
So thatâs nice .
And if youâre really a nut for genealogy , why not trace your heritage back to the Last Universal Ancestor , the single - celled organism who , about 4 billion years ago , decided to go ahead and give rise to every living creature that will ever exist on the face of the Earth ?
Talk about a pimp .
In essence , the whole of life on the planet can be considered one long , unbroken chemical reaction that is still resolving itself , like the foam flowing out of a science fair volcano .
The genetic chaos continues .
The Endosymbiotic
Theory says that the mitochondria in our bodies , without which we couldnât live , let alone write snide humor articles , was at one point a separate organism that invaded our cells and set up camp .
They formed a symbiotic relationship so beneficial that weâve never booted them out .
Furthermore , large chunks of the human genome are thought to be ancient retroviruses that managed to transcribe themselves into our DNA and have spent the remainder of their days happily clambering up and down our nucleotides like the McDuck children on a mansion banister .
Basically your cells are millions of individual organisms , all huddled together in a you - shaped beehive .
Now see how long you can go before wanting to shower .
And lastly , a thought for the right - wingers out there :
At some point half of you was an egg in your Motherâs womb .
That egg existed in her body from the day she was born .
And a long , long time ago , she too was an egg in

This is the first post - merge release of Merb .

We * can * chew gum and walk at the same time !
I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their weekend .
I , for one , am looking forward to continuing work this week !
December 9 , 2008  -- Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich wanted President - elect Barack Obama " to put something together … something big " in exchange for going along with Obama 's choice to fill his vacant U.S. Senate seat , according to a FBI affidavit unsealed following the governor 's stunning arrest .
" I 've got this thing and it 's f*** ing golden , and , uh , uh , I 'm just not giving it up for f*** in ' nothing .
I 'm not gonna do it .
And I can always use it .
I can parachute me there , " Blagojevich said in a phone call secretly recorded by the FBI on Nov. 5 , the day after the election , according to the affidavit .
Click here to read the full affidavit .
" It is conduct that would make Lincoln roll over in his grave , " said U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in announcing the charges today in Chicago .
He said the governor 's efforts to " sell " the Senate seat was the " most sinister and appalling " of a range of alleged corrupt acts detailed in today 's case .
Fitzgerald said " there 's no reference in the complaint to any conversations involving the president - elect or indicating that the president - elect was aware of it , and that 's all I can say . "
His comment did not close the door on the possibility that Obama or someone on his staff may have known of some aspect of the governor 's demands .
Obama addressed the scandal over his Senate seat Tuesday afternoon , saying , " I had no contact with the governor or his office and so we were not , I was not aware of what was happening . "
But Obama 's senior advisor David Axelrod told a Chicago affiliate of Fox News that Obama had in fact spoken to Blagojevich about his empty Senate seat .
" I know he 's talked to the governor and there are a whole range of names , many of which have surfaced , and I think he has a fondness for a lot of them , " Axelrod said in the Nov. 23 interview .
The controversy continued Tuesday evening , when Axelrod issued a statement retracting his statement .
" I was mistaken when I told an interviewer last month that the President - elect has spoken directly to Governor Blagojevich about the Senate vacancy .
They did not then or at any time discuss the subject , " said Axelrod .
The president - elect , who was speaking to reporters following a meeting with Al Gore about green energy and climate change , also said , " Obviously , like the rest of the people of Illinois , I am saddened and sobered by news that came out of the U.S. Attorney 's office today , but as this is an ongoing investigation into the governor , I do n't think it'd be appropriate for me to comment at this time . "
Congressman Jesse Jackson , Jr. said he met with Blagojevich yesterday " for the first time in years " and voiced his desire to fill Obama 's empty Senate seat .
He said he was " shocked " by Blagojevich 's arrest , adding " If these allegations are proved true , I am outraged by the appalling , pay - to - play schemes hatched at the highest levels of our state government . "
Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , called on the Illinois State Senate to set a special election to fill Obama 's vacant Senate seat , claiming that " No appointment by this governor under these circumstances could produce a credible replacement . "
As the Governor of Illinois , Blagojevich retains power to fill Obama 's seat , however sources say that is n't likely .
ABC News ' George Stephanopoulous reports that Illinois state legislators will meet next week to pass a bill for a special election in February .
Beyond a special election , the Illinois Secretary of State has the power to certify Blagojevich 's pick , and the U.S. Senate can choose not to seat whoever he might appoint .
Candidate 1 May Be Valerie Jarrett
There are strong indications that Candidate 1 may be Valerie Jarrett , Obama 's close confidante who has since been named a special presidential adviser .
Senate Candidate 1 is identified in the federal documents as an adviser to the president - elect .
Durbin in his news conference said Blagojevich was considering Jarrett until she withdrew her name from consideration .
" The governor asked me if I thought she [ Jarrett ] was serious about not being appointed and I said ' Yes , she told me point blank that she was , ' " Durbin said .
The federal complaint also states that Candidate 1 eventually withdrew from consideration .
In addition , Durbin declined to speculate whether Senate Candidate 5 could be in peril .
Blagojevich Wanted Obama Cabinet Appointment , Well - Paying Job , or Campaign Money , FBI Says
The FBI says Blagojevich wanted an appointment to the Obama cabinet as Secretary of Health and Human Services , a well - paying job , or huge campaign contributions as the price for naming Obama 's successor .
Blagojevich was overheard by the FBI saying " I want to make money , " complaining he was " financially hurting . "
Blagojevich also sought a high paying job for his wife , according to the FBI .
" Is there a play here , with these guys , with her " to work for a firm in Washington or New York , he reportedly asked .
The FBI affidavit said Blagojevich had been told by an adviser " the president - elect can get Rod Blagojevich 's wife on paid corporate boards in exchange for naming the president - elect 's pick to the Senate . "
Told by two other advisers he has to " suck it up " for two years , the FBI says it heard Blagojevich complain he has to give this " motherf ** * er [ the president - elect ] his senator .
F*** him .
For nothing ?
F*** him . "
The governor is heard saying he will pick another candidate " before I just give f*** ing [ Senate Candidate l ] a f***ing Senate seat and I do n't get anything . "
Candidates for Obama 's Senate Seat
According to the affidavit , one candidate for the senate seat , identified as Senate Candidate 5 , promised to " raise money " for Blagojevich .
The governor described , in a recorded call , an earlier approach by an associate of Senate Candidate 5 .
" We were approached ' pay to play . '
That , you know he 'd raise me 500 grand .
An emissary came .
Then the other guy would raise a million , if I made him ( Senate Candidate 5 ) a Senator , " Blagojevich was quoted as saying .
The affidavit said Blagojevich was interested in a high - paying position with an organization affiliated with the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , called Change to Win , and that he suggested in a conversation with a SEIU official on Nov. 12 , 2008 that Obama wanted other people to be considered for the Senate seat besides Senate Candidate 1 .
Previous phone conversations indicated that Blagojevich knew the SEIU official " was an emissary to discuss Senate Candidate 1's interest in the Senate seat , " the affidavit said .
" HARRIS suggested that SEIU Official make ROD BLAGOJEVICH the head of Change to Win and , in exchange , the President - elect could help Change to Win with its legislative agenda on a national level , " noted the affidavit .
SEIU has denied any involvement , saying in a statement , " We have no reason to believe that SEIU or any SEIU official was involved in any wrongdoing . "
Change to Win released a statement saying the organization never " considered , discussed or promised " any position to Blagojevich or his staff , and that the group only learned of conversations between the governor and his advisers discussing such a position upon the release of the affidavit today .
Affidavit Says Blagojevich Knew He Was Under FBI Investigation
The FBI affidavit says Blagojevich thought he might get something " tangible up front " from Senate Candidate 5 .
Aware that he was under FBI investigation , Blagojevich apparently considered appointing himself to Obama 's Senate seat , the affidavit says .
He is quoted as saying " he will be able to obtain greater resources if he is indicted as a sitting senator as opposed to a sitting governor . "
He was arrested this morning on a two count criminal complaint .
Blagojevich Appears in Federal Court , Must Surrender Passport
Blagojevich and Harris appeared briefly in federal court in Chicago this afternoon .
Bond was set at $ 4,500 for both of them , and Blagojevich was ordered to turn in his passport and gun card .
Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom .
" If it is n't the most corrupt state in the United States , it 's certainly one hell of a competitor , " said the head of the FBI 's Chicago office , Robert Grant , about the state of Illinois .
He said veteran FBI agents were " disgusted , sick " as they listened to the intercepted conversations of the Illinois governor .
The governor was taken into custody in handcuffs from his home by two FBI agents just after six this morning , according to Grant .
Grant said he had first called the governor to tell him there was a warrant for his arrest .
" Is this a joke ? " the governor responded , according to Grant .
Blagojevich has previously been linked to former political fundraiser Tony Rezko , who was convicted in June of charges stemming from him using his influence with the governor 's office in a multi-million dollar kickback scheme .
Blagojevich 's relationship with Rezko , who is in jail while he waits sentencing on Jan. 6 , was a consistent theme of Rezko 's trial .

A hacker has successfully changed the nameservers of the popular BitTorrent meta - search engine Torrentz.com .
For a few hours the site was replaced with an Adbrite ad , and a link to a warez forum .
To top it off , the hacker then contacted the Torrentz admin to brag about his hacking abilities .
Last week we reported that Torrentz was facing a hostile domain takeover .
With a forged driver ’s license , the impostor attempted to change the domain Whois .
Yesterday , the nameservers to Torrentz were indeed changed , giving the ‘ hacker ’ control over the Torrentz domain .
Flippy , the admin of Torrentz told us that he noticed some worrying changes when he checked his website late last night .
There were banners from Adbrite at the top and bottom of the site , banners that did n’t belong there .
It turns out that “ the hacker ” we mentioned before , managed to change the nameservers of the torrentz.com domain .
In the middle of the new page torrentz.eu was now loading in a frame , so the site was usable apart from the extra ads .
When Flippy added some Javascript to the torrentz.eu site to prevent it from loading inside the frame , the .com domain suddenly linked to some fresh warez forum and an image hosting site .
The warez forum , warez2 share.com , was apparently hosted on a shared hosting account , and it did n’t take long before the account was suspended because of the traffic overload .
The hacker did n’t stop there of course , and he soon changed the page to a single Adbrite banner .
And as if that was n’t enough , he decided to email Flippy , to tell him how good of a hacker he is .
“ So , I emailed him back , and informed him that I have a lawyer who will subpoena Adbrite first thing in the morning , to get the account ’s details , ” Flippy told us .
After some emails back and forth , the hacker suddenly changed his tone .
After Flippy reminded him that forging a US driver ’s license is a serious crime , he suddenly became surprisingly cooperative .
Instead of bragging about his hacker skills , he was suddenly willing to change the nameservers back .
At the time of publication , the domain details have indeed been reverted , and until the changes clear , torrentz.com is being redirected to the backup domain , torrentz.eu .
It is not over yet though , as Flippy told us that he will do everything he can to find out the identity of the ‘ hacker ’ , so stay tuned .
Update :
The hacker is from California and forged a CA drivers license , which he can be put in jail for .
Flippy , however , decided not to go after him , since it would be very costly to do from Poland , and it ’s not worth it for 4 hours downtime .
4/1/2020 UPDATE : The United States Senate has approved a multibillion - dollar phase 2 emergency aid package that will provide paid family and sick leave , free coronavirus testing , and bolster unemployment insurance for many Americans during the coronavirus pandemic .
President Trump has also now signed a phase 3 aid package that includes direct payments to taxpayers .
The bill , which has now become law , has taxpayers receiving stimulus payments of up to $ 1,200 for each individual and $ 500 for each child .
For full details go to our stimulus check 2020 article .
If you ’re recently unemployed , check out this article on expanded unemployment benefits .
4/15/20 UPDATE : People are starting to receive their first stimulus payment via direct deposit .
Many are now asking if there is a second 2020 stimulus check on the way .
After an original 2.2 trillion stimulus package , congress is now considering a second economic impact payment for taxpayers .
A Second Stimulus Package Popular Among Many In Washington
The idea of a second round of economic stimulus checks or economic impact payments being sent out sometime in the next few months has been gaining steam in the hallowed halls of Congress .
It has been mentioned by a number of Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , President Trump , as well as other prominent politicians from both sides of the aisle .
Pelosi talked about the first stimulus , and the possibility of a second just last week :
“ Pelosi has said that another stimulus should include a second round of direct payments .
This month , many Americans taxpayers received stimulus checks of up to $ 1,200 for single filers and up to $ 2,400 for married couples .
But many congressional Democrats have said that the $ 1,200 check , which barely covers what the average American spends on rent and utilities , does n’t go far enough .
Pelosi ’s plan would also give more aid to states , cities , small businesses , health systems , and first responders , Politico reported .
ABC
News reported that Pelosi hoped to bring the phase - four stimulus package to the House floor in late April .
For the politicians a second round of stimulus payments are a no brainer .
In an election year like this the pols are looking for just about any way they can to sway the voters .
Giving their constituents money seems to be a great way to do that .
Even if a second round of checks is passed , it sounds like it probably wo n’t happen until for a month or more at the earliest .
Mitch McConnell has said that they likely would n’t broach the topic until they return on May 4th .
President Trump has said that he’d be open to a new round of stimulus checks , and it is being considered .
So for now , even if we get a second check , it probably is n’t going to happen for a while .

First Check – Just Not Enough ?
Will A Second Stimulus Be More Effective ?
The first check does n’t seem to have had enough of an effect , and any positive effects that they did have seem to have been offset by rising gas prices , food prices and prices of other essentials .
From what I ’ve read around the blogosphere it also seems that a lot of people did n’t spend their first rebates .
A creditcards.com poll conducted March 7 - 9 by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Media found :
half of Americans do n’t have spending in mind , with 26 percent saying they ’ll pay off some debt , and 24 percent planning to save it .
So a quarter said that they planned to save their stimulus payment , and another quarter said they would use it to pay off debt .
Not exactly the outcome that the government had hoped for .
Would people be more likely to spend a second round of stimulus checks ?
My guess is that more people probably would spend it .
The fact that they ’ve already used one payment to pay off debt or save means that a lot of people will feel like they “ deserve ” to spend their second check .
I think you would see much higher numbers of people actually spending their stimulus checks the second time around .
Is A Second Round Of Checks A Good Idea ?
Is it a good idea to continue doling out checks until the economy picks back up ?
Or have we already spent more than we can afford at 2.2 trillion dollars for the latest stimulus package ?
I ’d love to hear your feedback on the topic .
Personally I ’m of the opinion that the stimulus checks are actually pretty necessary right now .
We ’ve watched as millions have filed for unemployment after losing jobs , the government has ordered people to shelter in pace with no end in site , and small businesses ( and large ) are shutting their doors – often for good .
Something has to be done to keep people afloat until this pandemic is sorted out .
What Would You Do With A Second Economic Stimulus Check ?
If a second stimulus package does materialize in the next few months , what will you do with your check ?
Will you :
Spend it ( like they want you to ) ?
Save it ?
Use it to pay down debt ?
Donate the money to help people in your community ?
Let us know what action you ’ll take if you get a second check – in the comments below !
Dec. 16 , 2008  --
In an exclusive interview with ABC News , a reflective Vice President Dick Cheney praised President - elect Barack Obama 's national security team and admitted he 's changed during his time in office .
In his first exit interview and first television interview since the November election , Cheney said the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks most certainly became " a prime motivation , " critically shaping his actions in the years that followed .
" Have I changed ? " Cheney asked .
" Well , not in the sense that I 've gone through some fundamental psychological transition here , but I have been , since that day , focused very much on what we needed to do to defend the nation , and I think the policies we 've recommended , the programs that we 've undertaken , have been good programs .
I think those have been sound decisions , and if that 's what they mean by saying I 've changed , I 'm guilty . "
With 35 days left in office , the vice president also weighed in on those who will take the place of the Bush administration , assessing Obama 's picks to spearhead national security .
" I must say , I think it 's a pretty good team , " Cheney said .
" I 'm not close to Barack Obama , obviously , nor do I identify with him politically .
He 's a liberal .
I 'm a conservative . "
" But I think the idea of keeping Gates at Defense is excellent .
I think Jim Jones will be very , very effective as the national security adviser . "
Cheney likewise weighed in on Sen. Hillary Clinton , who Obama has tapped to be the next secretary of state .
" While I would not have hired Sen . Clinton , I think she 's tough , " the vice president added .
" She 's smart , she works very hard and she may turn out to be just what President Obama needs . "
Cheney said the new administration must carefully assess the tools put in place to fight terror .
" How they deal with these issues are going to be very important , because it 's going to have a direct impact on whether or not they retain the tools that have been so essential and defending the nation for the last seven - and - a - half years , or whether they give them up , " he said .
Obama 's team needs to look at the specific threats , understand how the programs were put together , and how they operate , the vice president said .
" They should n't just fall back on campaign rhetoric to make these very fundamental decisions about the safety of the nation , " he warned .
As for what the vice president himself needs , Cheney said there 's " no question " he 'll miss the job and has " a few stories " that could warrant writing a book .
" I loved being vice president and I loved my time in government , " he said .
" Being secretary of defense or Ford 's chief of staff . "
Still , he conceded , " It 's been 40 years since I came to Washington to stay 12 months , and I think it 's about time I went and did something else . "
On Waterboarding and Guantanamo
There was no softening of Cheney 's stances Monday on sizing up the policies of the Bush administration .
The vice president was unapologetic in his defense of the Bush administration 's anti-terror policies , including the use of waterboarding , and said the prison at Guantanamo Bay should remain open as long as there 's a war on terror .
Cheney said waterboarding was an appropriate means of getting information from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind behind the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
He was also asked whether he authorized the tactics used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
" I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , as the agency in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and could n't do , " Cheney said .
" And they talked to me , as well as others , to explain what they wanted to do .
And I supported it .
" There was a period of time there , three or four years ago , when about half of everything we knew about al Qaeda came from that one source , " he added , referring to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
" So , it 's been a remarkably successful effort .
I think the results speak for themselves . "
Cheney said the prison at Guantanamo Bay could be responsibly shut down only when the war on terror has ended .
Asked when that might be , he added , " Well , nobody knows .
Nobody can specify that . "
Cheney warned that prisoners released from Guantanamo could prove dangerous to the United States , adding that the problem of what to do with released prisoners had not yet been solved .
" If you 're going to close Guantanamo , what are you going to do with those prisoners ? " he asked .
" One suggestion is , well , we bring them to the United States .
Well , I do n't know very many congressmen , for example , who are eager to have 200 al Qaeda terrorists deposited in their district . "
Meantime , Cheney said the Guantanamo detainees have been " well treated . "
" I do n't know any other nation in the world that would do what we 've done in terms of taking care of people who are avowed enemies , and many of whom still swear up and down that their only objective is to kill more Americans , " he said .
Cheney Disputes Rove
The outgoing vice president also disputed former Bush adviser Karl Rove 's recent comments about the decision to go to war in Iraq .
While discussing Bush 's legacy earlier this month , Rove said he did not believe the administration would have gone to war had intelligence revealed Saddam Hussein did not possess weapons of mass destruction .
" I disagree with that , " Cheney said Monday .
" As I look at the intelligence with respect to Iraq , what they got wrong was that there were n't any stockpiles . "
" What they found was that Saddam Hussein still had the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction .
He had the technology , he had the people , he had the basic feed stock . "
Cheney added that , given Saddam Hussein 's capabilities , reputation and track record of brutality , " this was a bad actor , and the country 's better off , the world 's better off with Saddam gone , and I think we made the right decision , in spite of the fact that the original NIE was off in some of its major judgments . "

Sounds cool and all , but nothing earth shattering .
Assuming Eli and Steve did get to work on an iRon Man suit , I imagine it would have no visible seems , be incredibly light , have sub par battery life , radiate at about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit and provide absolutely no protection against machine guns or tank shells .
I can also assure you it would be beautiful and Eli would be fired about 3 months into the process for “ not getting the vision ! ”
I suppose I should also mention that Iron Man is the best selling Blu Ray of all time .
So many people bought it , in fact , that they shut down Sony ’s BD - Live servers .
I ’ve decided I ’m never going to buy a Blu Ray .
I ’m going to wait until the players are incredibly cheap , then Netflix them until they are completely replaced by digital content distribution .
Eli is going to Chicago this week ( all week ) .
If you know of anything he should make sure to visit , experience or a great place to take photos , feel free to post it in the comments .
I ’m sure he ’ll appreciate it .
Maybe some Chicago FB ’s want to buy him a beer ?
Frum : Maddow 's sarcasm same as shouting out ' kill him ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 14 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow introduced an interview with National Review columnist David Frum on Monday by sarcastically enumerating recent examples of chaos in the McCain campaign and its increasing loss of support from GOP activists , intellectuals , and elected officials .
Frum , a former Bush speechwriter , has expressed his own criticisms of how the McCain campaign has been run , but he appeared less interested in discussing them than in attacking Maddow 's satiric tone as being somehow equivalent to the Republicans ' demonization of William Ayers .
Maddow , however , handled Frum so deftly that one top Daily Kos diaries headed an entry on the encounter , " Rachel PWNS Frum -- Big Time . "
Even Matt Lewis at the conservative website Townhall wrote " David Frum Has His Clock Cleaned by Rachel Maddow , " and called the interview " arguably one of the most pathetic appearances I 've seen . "
Maddow began by asking Frum what he had meant by his recent suggestion that " those who press this Ayers line of attack are whipping Republicans and conservatives into a fury that 's going to be very hard to calm after November . "
" You were talking through much of the show about the matter of tone in our politics , " Frum stated in response , " and yet I think we are seeing an intensification of some the ugliness of tone that 's been a feature of American politics in the past eight years .
I mean , the show unfortunately is itself an example of that problem , with its heavy sarcasm and sneering and its disregard for a lot of the substantive issues that really are important . "
" Do you think that my tone on this show is equivalent to people calling Barack Obama somebody who pals around with terrorists ? "
Maddow asked in amazement .
" People yelling from the audience at McCain - Palin rallies ' bomb Obama , ' ' kill him , ' ' off with his head , ' ' traitor . '
Are you accusing me of an equivalence in tone ? "
" I do n't think that 's an important question , " Frum answered condescendingly .
" I think the question is , given the small plate of responsibility that you personally have , how do you manage that responsibility .
The fact that other people fail in other ways is not an excuse for you failing in your way . "
" You did just say that it 's the same thing , " Maddow insisted .
" I sense also that there 's a devotion to coming up with a sort of false equivalence .
...
You saying that my tone on this show -- sarcasm , being playful , the way that I approach issues -- would be somehow equivalent to the McCain campaign , I 'm guessing , saying they do n't want to talk about the economy . "
" If we want to have a more intelligent , more grown - up politics ... then we ought to do it , " Frum replied , attempting to maintain a position of superior seriousness .
" I absolutely am concerned and unhappy by the kind of campaign my party has been running , and I 'm doing my best to try to raise the tone . "
" When you say that you want the discourse to be more grown - up and more intelligent , I agree with you on intelligent , " answered Maddow .
" I do n't necessarily agree with you on grown - up .
I think there 's room for all sorts of different kinds of discourse , including satire .
...
But I do think that there 's something qualitatively different about threats of violence and about accusations that people are un-American . "
Frum , appearing backed into a corner , was finally reduced to arguing that candidates may not hear the more inflammatory cries from the audience , but that " John McCain has tried to dial it back . "
He also acknowledged that " the McCain campaign is doing a non-substantive job and doing a lot of politics of cultural resentment .
That 's all true , and they 're going to pay a heavy price in November . "
Frum attempted to explain his poor performance the next day , writing , " I do n't watch the show , but I had ( or thought I had ) a rough idea of what it was like .
... I watched the show in horror in the MSNBC green room .
Maybe I was a bit crankier than usual : I 'm still jet - lagged enough that I have been going to bed by 8:30 most nights this week ...
Anyway I was unprepared for the sarcasm and anger of what I saw .
So when it was my time to go on air -- and instead of being asked about Afghanistan I was asked about how awful and hateful the John McCain campaign was -- I got a little grouchy . "

Browsing other peoples ’ code is a great way to learn new things about a language or framework .
I never made it to the Django docs about Contexts , but the Pinax developers apparently did and I got a chance to learn this from them .
This is a few sections of their code and how they use RequestContext in their apps .
If you are looking at the source of some of their views you might see how they are using it .
Here is what it looks like in friends_app.
friends
return render_to_response ( template_name , { " join_request_form " : join_request_form , " invites_received " : invites_received , " invites_sent " : invites_sent , " joins_sent " : joins_sent , } , context_instance=RequestContext ( request ) )
So what extactly does context_instance =RequestContext ( request ) do ?
I took a look at the django documentation to find out more .
And that led me to check the settings file and I found that there were quite a few things listed in TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS .
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
= ( " django.core.context_processors.auth " , " django.core.context_processors.debug " , " django.core.context_processors.i18n " , " django.core.context_processors.media " , " django.core.context_processors.request " , " notification.context_processors.notification " , " announcements.context_processors.site_wide_announcements " , " account.context_processors.openid " , " account.context_processors.account " , " misc.context_processors.contact_email " , " misc.context_processors.site_name " , " messages.context_processors.inbox " , " friends_app.context_processors.invitations " , " misc.context_processors.combined_inbox_count " , )
I opened up friends_app.context_processors to see a bit more and it looked like this
from friends .
models import FriendshipInvitation def invitations ( request ) : if request .
user .
is_authenticated ( ) : return { ' invitations_count ' : FriendshipInvitation .
objects . filter ( to_user=request .
user , status= " 2 " ) . count ( ) , } else : return { }
This means that every view that has context_instance =RequestContext ( request ) in it will call the above function since it is listed in settings.py and it will provide the template variable , {{ invitations_count }} .
Using RequestContext makes it easy to have the common template variables available on every page and I will have to start using it more in my apps .
So make sure you have from django .
shortcuts import render_to_response and from django. template import RequestContext in your file and add your context processor to the settings file and you should be ready to add template vars to your contexts .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

How to Kick Your Friends in the Teeth
Naomi Klein , in an October speech at the University of Chicago , said :
I think all ideologies should be held accountable for the crimes committed in their names … .
Now , of course , there are still those on the far left who will insist that all of those crimes were just an aberration –Mao , Stalin , Pol Pot ; reality is annoying–and they retreat into their sacred texts … .
But lately , particularly just in the past few months , I have noticed something similar happening on the far libertarian right … , and it comes from the fact that the Bush administration … adopted so much of their rhetoric … .
But , of course , Bush is the worst thing that has ever happened to believers in this ideology , because while parroting the talking points of Friedmanism , he has overseen an explosion of crony capitalism , that they treat governing as… an ATM machine , where private corporations make withdrawals of the government in the form of no - bid contracts … .
The Bush administration is a nightmare for these guys –the explosion of the debt and now , of course , these massive bailouts .
So , what we see from the ideologues of the… far economic right … frantically distancing themselves and retreating to their sacred texts :
The Road to Serfdom , Capitalism and Freedom , Free to Choose .
Some of us left - wing free market advocates have repeatedly come to Klein ’s defense , extolling the value of Disaster Capitalism ( despite its theoretical incoherence on the difference between free markets and corporatism ) as a concrete account of the Washington Consensus policies adopted around the world .
It ’s only fair to give her the benefit of the doubt .
After all , one ca n’t turn on the television without seeing some neoliberal politician or journalist equating corporate capitalism to the “ free market . ”
The Internet is full of commentary by mainstream libertarian think tanks , defending everything from Wal - Mart to resource waste and pollution to income inequality to corporate power as a natural outgrowth of “ our free enterprise system . ”
Under such circumstances , it ’s hard to blame a casual observer on the Left from taking the mainstream rhetoric at face value .
After all , if I thought the “ free market ” meant what Tom Friedman meant by it , I ’d hate it too .
On the other hand , Klein is no longer what you ’d call a casual observer , after all this time .
She herself has explicitly distinguished the corporatism prevailing in the American ( and global ) corporate economy from a genuine free market .
So her quoted remarks are asinine .
First of all , it ’s an insult to her left - wing free market defenders , who have publicly and vocally expressed our opposition to corporate rule , to hold us morally responsible for the fact that Dick Cheney and his ilk have misappropriated our rhetoric .
Second , does Klein really blame Pyotr Kropotkin and Rosa Luxemburg for Stalin and Pol Pot ?
I hope not .
And it is just as foolish to blame libertarians for George Bush .
It ’s true that the Bush adminstration adopted free market rhetoric .
And no doubt some libertarians are scurrying about in embarrassment , fearful lest this will be used to “ discredit ” free market ideas in the same way that the fall of the Soviet Union was broadly used to discredit the Left .
But the people who thought the fall of the Soviet Union discredited all attacks on corporate capitalism were either dishonest or stupid .
And the same is true of those who think AIG and Citigroup discredit the free market .
Every ruling class in history has adopted a legitimizing ideology ; and since to stay in power it must justify itself primarily to the ruled , to the people it ’s exploiting , its legitimizing ideology generally borrows heavily from the belief systems of–guess who ?
–the ruled .
The Federalists , for example , managed to squeak their trojan horse through the state ratifying conventions by packaging it in the anglo - republican rhetoric of the Anti-Federalists .
Stalin legitimized his rule in Russia by misappropriating the language and symbolism of the classical socialist and movement and falsely appealing to its values .
And neoliberals , similarly , misappropriate the language and symbolism of “ free enterprise , ” “ free markets , ” and “ free trade . ”
And guess what else ?
The symbolism and language of Progressivism were appropriated by FDR to sell corporatist policies drafted by GE ’s Gerard Swope and the Business Advisory Council .
If anything , it ’s fairer to blame Progressives for Swope and the NIRA , because Progressivism ( the movement founded at the turn of the 20th century by Herbert Croly , the National Civic League and the editorial circles at The New Republic ) really was corporatist .
From its beginning , it was a managerialist ideology , and its class base the new middle class of managers and professionals who ran the new giant organizations that dominated society in the wake of the corporate revolution .
It ’s a huge jump from Luxemburg to Stalin , or from Rothbard to Halliburton .
But it ’s not much of a jump from Croly to Swope .
So there !
There ’s nothing clean .
Any belief system with a high level of currency among the ruled populace is likely , in the natural order of things , to be misappropriated by the rulers , in order to secure popular compliance with their rule .
But this is only one side of the picture .
On the other hand , such belief systems–of all kinds–are contested terrain .
They are grab - bags of values and symbolism to which rulers can appeal , true enough .
But the very same values and symbolism can be reclaimed by the ruled and used to undermine their authority of the ruling class .
For example , working class resistance to the Soviet - imposed regimes in Eastern Europe commonly justified itself in libertarian socialist terms , and relied heavily on socialist symbolism and rhetoric .
In East Germany in 1953 , Hungary in 1956 , Czechoslovakia in 1967 , the Solidarity movement in Poland–in every case , the aim was workers ’ power , workers ’ control of industry , etc. , and the instrument chosen was self - mangement through workers ’ councils in the factories and self - government through direct democracy at the neighborhood level .
In other words , the working class of Eastern Europe resisted the Soviet Union with a battle cry of “ All power to the soviets ! ”
This concept–using the master ’s tools to tear down the master ’s house –should be familiar to most people on the Left .
I ’d be surprised if Klein was n’t aware of it .
The parallel to the free market ideology should be obvious , to anyone who is n’t deliberately obtuse .
One of the most powerful weapons against neoliberalism and corporate rule is to demonize the big business interests in terms of their own “ free market ” rhetoric .
Dean Baker does this regularly .
Baker skewers the “ free trade ” rhetoric of Tom Friedman by pointing out the real mercantilist nature of phony “ free trade agreements , ” in which so - called “ intellectual property ” plays the same protectionist role for transnational corporations as tariffs did for the old national industrial trusts .
RFK Jr. regularly points out that all the “ free market ” rhetoric conceals a real - world practice of externalizing costs on the taxpayer .
And we on the libertarian left , who really believe in free markets , are doing this kind of thing every day .
There is an enormous potential , among Progressives and the free market left , for entente and common action against the corporate state .
Noam Chomsky frequently refers to “ privatizing profit and socializing risk and cost , ” and “ socialism for the rich and free market discipline for the poor . ”
Murray Rothbard , at his best , referred to the ways in which “ our corporate state uses the coercive taxing power either to accumulate corporate capital or to lower corporate costs .
Whatever that process may be called , it is not ‘ free enterprise , ’ except in the most ironic sense . ”
Is that not the basis for a common agenda ?
So why the gratuitous insults ?
It ’s precisely because we on the free - market left see the value in Klein ’s work , that we cringe at the sight of reprehensible remarks like those quoted above .
I just typed up a post dissing Sarah Palin for not knowing that Africa was a continent .
And then I deleted it .
There 's been a lot of stuff reported around Palin - - a lot of it true .
But the horror of that Katie Couric interview and Palin 's general cluelessness make it easy to believe almost anything .
I do n't know why , but the Africa thing just smells fishy .
I 've got one reporter saying that Palin , essentially , knows less about the world than my eight year old son-- when he was five .
Maybe it 's true .
But I 've played myself before .
I 'm gonna try not to do it again .
The shopping stuff seem a lot more solid :
As first reported by Newsweek on Wednesday , McCain aides said some of that money was spent on clothing for Palin 's children and husband , Todd , who may have received between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 in wardrobe purchases .
The money also included thousands of dollars in shoes .
Several aides also said the items included jewelry , but a Palin aide disputed that .
Top McCain aides Schmidt , Rick Davis and Nicolle Wallace were flabbergasted by the magnitude of the spending as the receipts began trickling into the Republican National Committee , aides said .
Wallace had arranged for a stylist to shop for Palin before the convention because the Alaska governor did not have a chance to return home after she was selected as McCain 's running mate .
Aides familiar with the campaign 's internal discussions said Wallace and other top aides authorized the purchase of three outfits for Palin to wear during convention week and three ensembles for the campaign trail .
But cost was to be kept to no more than $ 25,000 to $ 35,000 .
When Schmidt learned that Palin 's staff was putting clothing purchases on personal credit cards , aides said he called them to stop it .
One word -- ghetto .
Prepare for chaos : U.S. electoral system warned it ' ca n't cope ' as historic number of voters cast their ballot
A record turnout of up to 130 million voters may spell chaos for America 's voting system today .
The presidential election could descend into electoral farce as unprecedented numbers of voters turn out to cast their ballot in a system that is largely untested .
The U.S. has an electoral system that is not organised , designed or funded to cope with ' anywhere near a 100 per cent turnout ' , a director of a leading independent electoral reform group has said .
Record turn - out : Voters wait in a line that circles the block in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington , DC .
today
It is estimated that more Americans will vote in this election than in any other .
Doug Chapin , director of The Pew Charitable Trust 's Electionline.org , said voter turnout will ' dwarf ' all other problems in this year 's presidential election .
There were also fears that the allegations of stolen votes that marred the 2000 and 2004 would be repeated , especially if the result is closer than the polls suggest .
Widespread claims have been made in the past few days that electronic voting machines have ' flipped ' people 's choices , so that votes cast for Barack Obama have ended up being counted as McCain votes .
Historic election : Voters wait in line to vote at the Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington
Similar claims have been widely reported in the last week of early voting , in which 27 million Americans made their choice .
Jim Harrington , of the Texas Civil Rights Project , said : " Voters reported , for example , that when they tried to vote a straight - party Democratic ticket , the machine flipped their choices to Republican candidates instead . "
Local elections administrator Javier Chacon claimed that " the intensity of the election may be spurring conspiracy suspicions in some voters " .
Shortages of voting machines and strict identity checks mean long queues in some areas .
Protesters in Virginia are alleging that black voters are deliberately being disenfranchised by long queues .
Voters wait in line to vote at Albright United Methodist Church in Phoenix , Arizona , where Republican presidential candidate John McCain is scheduled to cast his vote today
New laws demanding photo ID in Indiana , Arizona and Florida are also said to discriminate against poor , elderly and minority voters .
Huge teams of lawyers have been drafted in to mount legal challenges at a local level .
Some have tried to obtain lists of people whose homes were repossessed so that they can be disqualified on the grounds that their address is not up to date .
A USA Today / Gallup poll published this found likely voters favouring Obama by 11 points over McCain , 53 - 42 per cent .
A survey for ABC / Washington
Post showed the same margin .
With the economy in turmoil and the approval levels of President George W. Bush , Democrats look set to capture the White House and expand their majorities in both chambers of Congress .
But with the threat of electoral chaos looming , the result may not be so clear cut .
Resentment is still strong over the 2000 election when , after bitterly contested recounts , a Supreme Court ruling gave the presidency to George W Bush .
It 's not over yet : A defiant John McCain rallies supporters in Florida earlier today
On top : But a confident Barack Obama was also campaigning in the Sunshine State today , where every vote will count
It hinged on so - called hanging , dimpled and pregnant chads - all terms coined to describe card ballot papers that had not been punched through properly .
In 2004 there were eight - hour queues in some areas , which critics said effectively blocked some people from voting .
The hope among election officials is that the result will be so clear - cut that there will be no need for a prolonged dispute when , inevitably , some machines break down .
But today , six years after the largest federal overhaul in how the U.S. elections are run , voting experts are still predicting machine and ballot shortages in several swing states and late tallies on election night , U.S. media have reported .
About half of all voters will vote in a way that is different from what they did in the last presidential election , the New York Times reported , and most will use paper ballots rather than the touch - screen machines that have caused concern among voting experts .
But paper ballots come with their own problems : the scanners reading them can break down , and up to a third of them will be counted later at a central polling station , meaning that if a voter has made a mistake filling out the ballot it will not be caught until it is too late .
Lawsuits have been filed in the key states of Pennsylvania and Virginia by voting rights groups accusing officials of not having enough paper ballots in stock , the New York Times has reported .

In states with early voting , there have been scattered reports of touch - screen machine malfunctions , ballot misprints causing scanners to jam and vote - flipping , in which the vote cast for one candidate is recorded for another
' The challenge is we will get closer to 100 per cent turnout on election day this year than ever before , ' Mr Chapin said .
He said the U.S. typically sees a turnout in the ' high 50s to 70 per cent range ' but added : ' You now see some states forecasting , 80 per cent , 85 per cent , even 90 per cent turnout of their registered voters on election day .
' And this flood of new voters is going to challenge the system in a way that it really never has been before . '
He said if there was a problem at the front of the line at a polling station , this was an inconvenience if there were ten people in the queue .
But he went on : ' If there are 100 people in line it is a problem ; if there are a 1,000 people in line , it 's a crisis .
Given the number of folks that we have coming out to vote this year , any problem that occurs at the point of voting has the potential to be a real challenge on election day . '
He said many states were ' overwhelmed and in many ways overrun ' by the number of voters during the primary season , but were ' fully prepared , or what they think is fully prepared , for record turnout across the country ' on Tuesday .
' It is an article of faith and job mission of every election official in the U.S. that every eligible American who wishes to do so should have the right to cast a ballot and have that ballot count , ' he said .
' The truth however , is that , given how decentralised our system is and the disputes over our system , we do not necessarily have a system that is organised , designed or funded to handle anywhere near a 100 per cent turnout . '
He said the voting system was ' startlingly ' decentralised .
' It is a myth that there is a United States ' election system .
We have at least 50 separate state systems ; in actuality , probably closer to thousands of state and local election systems ' , he said .
' I would be very surprised if we do n't hear more of , " We need to centralise elections more " after this election . '
He said the problems caused by voter turnout were already being seen in reports of early problems related to long queues , scattered reports of machine problems , and a ' system characterised by overwhelming demand ' .
Mr Chaplin also said he could see another problem such as the one in Florida which dogged the 2008 election and said three states would be worth watching closely for any problems .
Florida , the home of the ' hanging chads ' and spoiled ballots of 2000 , has been a ' symbol of election reform ' since and has seen 'as much change , if not more , than any other state in the country ' .
Ohio , a ' plumb political catch ' is usually very closely fought and ' no dispute in this country has taken place since 2000 without taking place in some meaningful way ( here ) , ' he added .
And Colorado , also a key battleground state this year , is 'as unsettled in its election administration as any state in the country right now ' , he said .
It was one of the last in the country to complete a required upgrade to its state - wide voter rolls , its chief state election official is a candidate for the US Congress , and its state election director recently resigned .
Mr Chapin , who also wrote a report subtitled " What if we had an election and everyone came ? " , said : ' If we have a problem ... it will be because of something completely unexpected , not because of a lack of preparation . '
He said voters had shown increased interest this year , not just in the candidates but also in the mechanics of casting their votes .
' So while we wo n't know until polls close on election day whether or not we have avoided the problems of the past , there are signs for optimism . '
In the UK , the 2005 General Rlection saw a national turnout of 61.36 per cent .
Last week , MPs were told that Britain should learn from the expected high turnout in the presidential election .
Commons leader Harriet Harman said a lack of voter registration and low turnout was something that had to be tackled in Britain , particularly among people living in inner cities .
' It looks set to be an election with very high turnout from people who previously have not necessarily voted , people who have registered to vote and then have gone out to vote , ' she said in the House of Commons .
' One of the things that all of us should be preoccupied to tackle is lack of registration , particularly in inner city areas and among poorer people and low voting turnout .
' If there is something we can learn from the American elections about more people voting and more young people voting then that is something we should look to . '

Whether you 're rocking a digital single - lens reflex model or a reliable point - and - shoot , there are a lot of different shots and gear you can experiment with , and important lessons to learn , that cost less than $ 40 , if anything .
Read on for our roundup of ten cheap or free DIY projects and lessons for aspiring photographers .

The blog we pulled this tip from has ceased to be , but the tip holds true — lots of item listing pictures on eBay and Craigslist , frankly , stink .
If you 've got a smallish object to be captured in straightforward style , and you 've got a flatbed scanner clunking around , it 's a lot more convenient than setting up a blank background , keeping shadows and glare off the angles , trying to get your digicam to focus closer - up , and so on .
Just set , scan , and upload .
9 . Make a remote camera trigger .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
It can be really helpful to take pictures without having to be right up on your camera — especially if you 're supposed to be part of the shot , or you can't get your own shadow out of the picture .
There are plenty of remote triggers available for both higher - end DSLR models and standard consumer cameras , but our favorite versions are cheaper and have better range .
One Instructables hacker showed us how to build a trigger out of a $ 3 hands - free phone kit , while those looking for a DIY project that mechanically presses the button for you can check out Wiley publishing 's free PDF for true shoot - anywhere freedom .
8 . Sling your camera with a fast - action R - Strap .
Advertisement
The commercial version of the R - Strap goes for about $ 44 and hooks into a DSLR 's tripod socket , and lets your camera slide up and around your hip to your hands with little friction .
As you might imagine , DIYers across the net latched onto this idea and found their own reasons to break out their creativity .
Two different projects let you use your own favorite shoulder - slung strap , such as from a favorite bag or guitar , and neither requires more than a few dollars of gear or much tinkering .
Check out the original creator 's video demonstration for a look at how the R - Strap works .
7. Get a Gorillapod ( or make it yourself ) .

If you 're willing to lug around a full - sized tripod wherever you might possibly spot a really great picture that requires steady hands , go ahead and skip this item .
For those of us like to roll a bit looser , the Gorillapod , a flexible , attach - anywhere tripod for consumer and DSLR digital cameras , makes for a addition to a glove compartment / back pocket / satchel .
If the $ 20 price tag ( or $ 40 for the DSLR ) does n't ring true , we 've previously offered up at least two DIY versions that get the same basic job done .

6 . Take underwater photos with a DIY enclosure .
Advertisement
If you 've ever seen a nature special on deep - sea creatures , or shopped for custom enclosures for your camera , you can appreciate the cost and logistics of getting an underwater shot or video .
For the simpler stuff you want to grab in the pool or the shallow end of the lake , though , you can certainly seal your camera without a federal research grant .
We 've highlighted DIY enclosures in three distinct flavors — the two - condom " Navy SEAL " wrap , recommended for your cheaper digicam ; a leak - alerting plastic bag enclosure , and a military ammo box casing that 's a bit more secure , but requires an auto - shooting still or video camera .

5 . Take wider - angle shots by creating mini-panoramas .
Advertisement
Panoramas are n't just for gigantic , wall - sized Grand Canyon shots or cheesy " virtual " apartment tours .
For those sporting a standard digital camera that does n't have much scope to its shots , free software panorama tools can help you capture great vistas ( the scenic kind , not the much - maligned - OS kind ) and improve shots that might have some unfortunate objects or lighting problems .
We previously detailed how to stitch photos into panormas with the free , open - source tool Hugin , which I prefer for its fine - grain controls .
Windows users can also check out the much simpler AutoStitch .

4 . Get started with time - lapse photography .
Photography site Photojojo has a tried and tested ultimate guide to time - lapse photography , and the results speak for themselves .
The video below shows what you can do when you put a camera in the right place and have it go off at the right times , often without you having to do much than check the batteries once in awhile .
And it 's a great way to document the more active moments of your life , as Adam did by time - lapsing his birthday party .

3. Super -charge your Canon camera 's firmware .
Advertisement
We 've already extolled the virtues of the Canon Hacker 's Development Kit a few times recently , and provided a tour of its features and installation , so we 'll just point out here that , in addition to giving you way more control and information about your shots , and giving you the ability to automate time - lapse shooting and shoot in RAW files , the CHDK exists and runs only from your camera 's memory card .
In other words , you can mess with it all you want , and not worry about messing up your basic firmware .
Truly a license to tweak your camera , and see how far your imagination can stretch .

2. Master your DSLR Camera with two tutorials .
Advertisement
It 's easy to think that once you 've dropped the plastic on a professional ( or pro-am ) , exchangeable - lens digital camera , your shots will automatically be worthy of Flickr 's front page .
And to some extent , you do have a better sensor and glass pointed at your subjects — but there 's a lot more to great photos than hardware .
Learn to let go of " auto " mode and get schooled about lighting , flash use , and much more with photographer Scott D. Feldstein 's two - part DSLR guide for Lifehacker readers .
Part one takes you through the basics of flash use , ISO modes and white balance .
Part two gets all photo lab on you , opening your eyes to shutter speeds , apertures , and explaning how all those settings fit together into great shots .

1 . Make your own macro kit .
Advertisement
If you 've ever felt your mouth water over super - closeup food shots , or your eyes pop open at ridiculously closeup shots of common surfaces , you need to get yourself into macro photography .
Like most camera gear , a serious macro set is n't cheap to come by , but you can get started with some seriously cheap setups .
One British DIYer came up with a Pringles can macro tube that 's easy to fit into any DSLR ( after washing out , of course ) .
While it's not the most professional - looking attachment , you can paint it black or cover with cloth for the aesthete inside you .
As for the stuff you 're actually shooting , your spotty kitchen table wo n't do .
Grab less than $ 10 worth of cardboard , paper , and other gear , take an hour , and set up a macro photo studio that makes your subjects really stand out .

Los Angeles Times
A US federal judge yesterday ordered the release into the United States of 17 Chinese Muslims who have been held at the US military prison at Guantánamo Bay , a ruling that dealt a setback to the Bush administration .
District Judge Ricardo Urbina gave his ruling at a hearing to consider the appeals by members of the Uighur ethnic group , who are seeking their release from the military prison and asking to go to the US .
He said there was no evidence that the detainees , who have been held at Guantánamo for nearly seven years , were enemy combatants or a security risk , and said that the US constitution prohibited indefinite detention without cause .
He ordered them to be brought to the court for a hearing on Friday .
The Bush administration had argued that federal judges do not have the authority to order the release of the detainees into the US .
Lawyers for the prisoners said the ruling marked the first time that a federal court had ordered the release into the US of prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay .
The Uighurs remain at the prison even though the US military no longer considers them enemy combatants .
The US has been unable to find a country willing to accept them .
It has said they would face persecution if they were returned to China .

See the blog about the journey east with the Bus SF Chronicle did a article about da Topsy Turvy bus here
Ok like all great things , this bus took a lot of work .
The crew did this in about 3 months .
I worked on it for about a month doing all of the electical wiring .
We did the work in a huge wharehouse along side Dan Dasmann and Karen Cusolito building the giant sculptures for Burning Man .
This place was kind of like a dungeon with metal grinding and welding noises 24 / 7 .
It is kind of like a casino , when you are in there you can't tell if it is day or night .
Flash says it neither rains nor shines in this place .
Here is the final product .
It was commissoned by Ben of Ben and Jerry 's Ice Cream .
I met him .
He is a very down to earth guy who cares enough about our country to spend his money on things that make people think a bit more about our out of control government .
His point is basically this ... we spend enough money each year to be able to blow up all the major cities in the world about 12 times .
How about if we only spend enough to blow up all the major cities only 6 times over and put the savings into something like education .
The Us Budget is Topsy Turvy .
That is the point this bus makes .
If he spent the same amount of money on a commercial he would probably get a 30 second commerical to air about 5 - 10 times and that would be it .
This bus will continue to make a statement for years to come .
I like it because no one has to say a thing to describe the point it is trying to make .
You just have to show up .
Here what we replaced the stop sign with .
The point it makes is very clear to see where all the US budget goes .
It is easy to see where all the money goes .
I also like this bus because it is not offensive to anyone .
How can you not be pro-education .
The only other statement this bus makes is in the inside of the bus on the ceiling it shows a bar graph of how much money
The US spends on military versus the top two other countries .
The US annual budget ( not including Iraq spending ) is 14 times greater than the number two country China .
When you see the disparity visual it is quite shocking .
Here is Major Tom and the Bus .
He is an amazing fabricator .
One of the most amazing I have ever seen .
Here is Major Tom 's daily car .
He has created so many art cars I can't even remember the name of this one .
Yes this bus really is topsy turvy .
I shot this while driving behind him on the Bay Bridge , trying to capture how it leans .
Do n't worry though it has been anaylyzed by an engineer and it is not as top heavy as it looks .
Here are the main creators Tom and Haideen .
An unstoppable couple .
They are now delivering the bus to the east coast .
The default bash prompt is useful , but can be customised considerable .
In this article I show you what you can use in it and some examples of some advanced techniques for improving your prompt to show more useful information .
Types of prompts
Bash has four different prompts controlled by environment variables called PS1 , PS2 , PS3 and PS4 .
Each prompt is used in particular places .
The most common prompt is PS1 , which controls the main prompt you see at the command line .
PS2 is the continuation prompt , used when you do n’t close a string or use the line continuation marker ( \ at the end of a line ) .
The other two are rather rarer .
PS3 is used when you use the select builtin command .
PS4 is used to show traced calls when you use set -x .
The default is '+ ' .
Prompt Description Default PS1
Default interactive prompt .
‘ \s-\v\$ ’ PS2 Continuation interactive prompt ‘> ’ PS3 Prompt used by the select builtin .
PS4
Used by set -x to prefix tracing output . '+ '
Prompt expansion items
Bash has a large number of special character sequences you can use in prompts .
You can also include any ordinary bash expansions , including variables and command expansions .
Prompt Description Example Result \a
An ASCII bell character ( 07 ) \a$ $ ( and beep ) \d The date in “ Weekday Month Date ” format \d $ Wed Mar 08 $ \e An ASCII escape character ( 033 ) \h
The hostname up to the first `.’ \h$ beebo$ \H The hostname \ H$ beebo.example.com $ \j
The number of jobs currently managed by the shell \j$ 0 $ \l
The basename of the shell ’s terminal device name \l$ 1 $
Newline \d
\h$ Wed Mar 08 < newline > beebo$ \r Carriage return \ d\r\h $ beebo$r 08 \s
The name of the shell , the basename of $ 0 ( the portion following the final slash ) \s $ bash $ \t The current time in 24 - hour HH : MM:SS format \t $ 07:24:57 $ \T
The current time in 12 - hour HH : MM:SS format \ T$ 07:24:57 $ \@
The current time in 12 - hour am / pm format \@$ 07:25 AM $ \u
The username of the current user \u$ david$ \v
The version of bash ( e.g. , 2.00 ) \v$ 3.1 $ \V
The release of bash , version + patchlevel ( e.g. , 2.00.0 ) \ V$ 3.1.5 $ \w The current working directory \w$ ~/articles / bash - prompts $ \W
The basename of the current working directory \ W$ bash - prompts $ \!
The history number of this command \!$ 537 $ \#
The command number of this command \ #$ 40 $ \$
If the effective UID is 0 , a # , otherwise a $ \$ $ or # as root
nn The character corresponding to the octal number nnn \ 141 $ a$ \\ A backslash \\$ \$ \ [
Begin a sequence of non-printing characters , which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt \]
End a sequence of non-printing characters
The bash default is \s - \v\$ , which results in bash - 3.1 $ , which is n’t very exciting .
The default in Debian ( and most other linux distributions ) is ‘ \u@\h : \w\$ ‘ , which results in david@beebo : ~/ articles / bash - prompts $ , which is much more useful .
My preference is to show my username rather than the current directory because I tend to use several different users and I want to know who I am , so I use \h \u % .
Using colour
I tend to find that if I ’m using a white prompt I can’t easily tell where the start of a command was when scrolling back .
To fix this I made my prompt stand out by making it colourful .
You can do this using the terminal control sequences for your terminal .
In my case I use VT100 escape codes , which have worked on every terminal I ’ve tried , but you may need to test first .
I put the following in my ~/.bashrc :
STARTCOLOUR ='\e [ 31 m ' ; ENDCOLOR = " \e [ 0 m " PS1= " $ STARTCOLOUR\h \u % $ ENDCOLOR "
Here we can see that < escape > [ 31 m is the VT100 code for red and < escape > [ 0 m is the code for white .
There is a little problem here in that the shell does n’t know that these characters are not printed , so think that the prompt is 22 characters long ( host is 5 and username is 5 ) , when in fact only 13 get displayed .
This results in bash wrapping lines at the wrong place .
This is what the mysterious \[ and \ ] are for .
They tell bash that the characters between them do n’t actually display on the screen .
So now we have :
STARTCOLOUR ='\ [ \e [ 31 m\ ] ' ; ENDCOLOR= " \[ \e [ 0 m\ ] "
PS1= " $ STARTCOLOUR\h \u % $ ENDCOLOR "
This is much better and does n’t corrupt the display .
Now would n’t it be nice if you could tell the difference between an ordinary user and root a little easier .
To do this , I made root ’s prompt cyan rather than red .
This way I know a cyan prompt means I should be careful .
This resulted in :
case $ ( id - u ) in 0 ) STARTCOLOUR ='\ [ \e [ 36 m\ ] ' ; ;; *) STARTCOLOUR ='\ [ \e [ 31 m\ ] ' ; ;; esac ENDCOLOR= " \[ \e [ 0 m\ ] "
PS1= " $ STARTCOLOUR\h \u % $ ENDCOLOR " ;
Change xterm titles
One interesting feature of my bash prompt is that it includes the host and the current directory in the xterm title bar , which is very useful for switching windows or tabs on gnome - terminal or konsole .
This is done by using another escape sequence that xterms understand .
You only want xterms to do this , so we check to see if we are on an xterm .
This results in :
case $ ( id - u ) in 0 ) STARTCOLOUR ='\ [ \e [ 36 m\ ] ' ; ;; *) STARTCOLOUR ='\ [ \e [ 31 m\ ] ' ; ;; esac ENDCOLOR= " \[ \e [ 0 m\ ] " case $ TERM in xterm * ) TITLEBAR ='\ [ \e ] 0 ; \h \ w\007 \ ] ' ; ;; *) TITLEBAR= " " ; ;; esac PS1= " $ TITLEBAR$STARTCOLOUR\h \u % $ ENDCOLOR "

Updated Parallels v4.0 , billed as speeding Windows virtualisation on Macs , has been slated by some users for slowing their systems to a crawl instead .
Some are demanding their money back .
Parallels software enables
Macs to run Windows concurrently with Mac OS X as an application alongside other Mac OS X applications .
Files can be shared between the two environments and external disks can be seen in both as well .
Version four was released on November 4 and added things like a better GUI , support for up to 8 - core processors , and better integration of Windows and Mac applications but the main billed event was the speed boost .
The upgrade process for existing users was complex and took an unexpectedly long time as existing virtual machines were converted but it is the slowness of the installed product which has surprised users .
Parallels desktop support has a note on its web page alluding to the sudden increase in the support call load : " Note : Due to the recent version launch , please expect extended delays while we continue to work around the clock to handle all requests . "
Posts on the Parallels desktop forum reveal the users ' discontent .
User villox said : " I 'm noticing that the VM is extremely slow ... taking a really long time to launch applications .
Reboot takes forever . "
Rebooting the Mac was suggested as a temporary fix but did n't work , as poster sdi noted : " Re-booting the Mac does seem to improve things but it comes back after a while and everything goes SLOOOOOW again .
Today it took about three minutes to resume Windows XP Pro and everything was unresponsive during this time . "
Poster solus chipped in with : " Currently , PD4 ( Parallels Desktop v4.0 ) is absolutely useless .
PD3 was lightning fast compared to this new version , and it's very disappointing . "
He said that it slowed down to a crawl in Coherence mode , in which the Parallels desktop window is hidden and the Windows application runs in an apparent Mac OS window .
User DiScO said : " I was all excited about this version but not so much anymore . "
' eis76uk ' was " very disappointed indeed with P4 ...
I wonder if Parallels actually tested this before chucking it out , or did they just write it and hope for the best ? "
A poster called nmetro@frii.com said removing the Parallels Internet Security software from the Windows XP virtual machine on his Mac solved the problem .
No one else concurred .
I 'm talking about the Haskell Platform at the London Haskell Users Group this Thursday .
It is an extended version of the 10 - minute talk Haskell : Batteries Included that Don Stewart and I presented at the recent Haskell Symposium .
Abstract :
Some people pick a programming language because it has the best type system , the best facilities for abstraction or perhaps the fastest compiler .
Most people however pick a whole programming platform that lets them solve their problem the quickest or best .
A programming platform consists of a language , a compiler , and a set of standard libraries and tools .
Other popular programming languages have a standard platform that puts together everything you need to get started .
This talk is about the Haskell Platform .
We 'll cover what the Haskell Platform is and who it is for .
We 'll also look at the technical infrastructure and the social aspects of how it will be managed .
Not all of the details are set in stone .
We need to have a discussion within the Haskell community about how the platform will be managed and extended , especially since it needs buy - in from package maintainers .
My hope is to use this talk to kick off that discussion .

Two Important Decisions by the State Canvassing Board Go His Way ...
LATE UPDATE : Coleman Camp ' Desperate , ' Headed to Court for FL 2000 - style Attempt to Stop Ballot Counting , Says Franken Camp
Brad Friedman Byon
12/12/2008 , 4:35 pm PT
[ Ed Note : Now updated at bottom , with Coleman 's attempts to have the state Supreme Court stop the counting , ala Bush / GOP 's FL 2000 playbook . ]
We 've been on the road for several weeks , and have n't been able to report on the day - to - day details of the hand count of the razor - thin U.S. Senate race in Minnesota between incumbent Sen.
Norm Coleman ( R ) and challenger Al Franken ( D ) .
Happily , the mainstream coverage of the counting has been pretty good ( surprisingly so ) , so we have n't felt the need to jump in to fill in the untold stories .
But today is an important one , and has resulted in two very key wins today at the State Canvassing Board for Franken , who has recently claimed that he 's up by just 4 votes in the race , presuming that the thousands of challenged ballots ( by both sides ) are decided by the board the way his team believes they will be .
As of this afternoon , things are looking good --- very good --- for Franken ...
From TPM :
[ T ]he Minnesota state canvassing board is meeting today to make some crucial decisions on the Senate race recount .
Already this morning the board has unanimously decided to ask local election boards to count an estimated 1,600 absentee ballots that were disqualified by clerical error , which is expected to boost significantly Franken 's prospects of catching Coleman in the recount .
TPM 's additional reporting notes that while the state canvassing board --- made up of Republicans , Democrats , and independents --- can't out and out order counties to count the inappropriately rejected absentee ballots , most counties are now doing so , and those that refuse to do so may find themselves in court .
TPM 's conclusion is a very positive result for Franken ...
Because of all that , it seems very likely that the vast majority of these ballots will be counted before this is over --- and it could possibly seal the deal for Franken .
Pre-election polling showed him winning the overall pool of absentee ballots by a solid margin , so it seems pretty reasonable to assume that the newly - counted votes will break for Al .
If that proves to be correct --- and if Norm Coleman is unable to stop it through further litigation --- Franken will probably pull ahead of Coleman and win the election .
The other major decision made by the canvassing board today is that 133 ballots from a Minneapolis precinct that were counted on Election Night , but have since been misplaced , will be included in the final totals " by going back to the recorded Election Night vote totals for this precinct , sparing Al the loss of a net 46 votes . "
Both decisions , of course , allow Coleman plenty of reason to go to court and try to have the decisions overturned , or even have the election results thrown out entirely .
We 'd not put it past him to do exactly that , even though the GOP --- which has institutionally been declaring from the jump , without any evidence whatsoever , that Franken has been attempting to " steal the election " --- has long been claiming that Franken would try to have the courts decide the race rather than the people .
But the Republicanists frequently charge others with doing exactly what they intend to do , so , at this point , you can rest assured that they 'll be in court pronto , without apology , if they feel it may help their case .
The same is true for Franken of course , but so should it be , if , in fact , any process in the election has violated the rule of law or disenfranchised voters .
Our money has long been on Franken to win this one after all is said and done .
And it still is .
UPDATE : Like clockwork , the Coleman camp , now said to be ' desperate because they know they are going to lose , ' according to Franken 's people during a late afternoon press conference today , are heading to court , and pulling a page straight from the GOP's " successful " FL 2000 play book :
Franken 's lead recount lawyer Marc Elias said to not believe the Coleman camp 's spin that they 're not trying to stop the vote count .
" But just read the papers that they file when they file them , and do n't look past what they file , " he said .
" They are seeking an injunction , they are seeking to stop counties from counting lawful ballots . "
Elias rebutted the Coleman camp 's legal arguments that the sorting of rejected absentees will lack uniform standards , pointing out that the canvassing board handed down a clear procedure under state law .
" The cold reality of where they stand in this count is upon them , and they are desperate to do something to keep these ballots from being counted , " Elias added , according to AP late tonight .
And Eric Kleefeld further reports on the Coleman court filing :
It 's as yet unknown when when the state Supremes might rule on this , but it does n't seem too likely that the court will shut down the count .
Two of the judges , both of them GOP appointees , are also members of that very canvassing board that voted unanimously to allow the count today .
Even if they recused themselves , it 's hard to imagine the other judges contradicting them in the middle of an ongoing count .
Bad news for Coleman .
Good news for MN 's voters , all of whom deserve to have their votes counted and counted accurately .

Mac , a mischievous , young Asian elephant who had become one of the Houston Zoo 's most popular animals , became ill and died Sunday .
He was 2 .
He entertained visitors with his ability to dance , produce music on wind pipes and stand on his head .
Many zoo staff members , won over by his intelligence , playfulness and occasional headstrong ways , were devastated by the death of the 2,200 - pounds - and - still growing animal .
" Everyone shares in the grief .
Mac was embraced by the community in the past two years .
It was sudden .
It was quick , and we just could n't save him , " said zoo director Rick Barongi , who choked up with tears and stepped away from the microphone during a press conference Monday .
Elephant keepers realized he was ill Sunday morning when he was sluggish , had no appetite and his head was swollen , said Joseph Flanagancq , the zoo 's chief veterinarian .
Flanagan said he and other members of the veterinary staff viewed the symptoms as signs that Mac had elephant herpes virus .
The virus weakens blood vessels , and they begin to leak blood , Flanagan said .
The heart pumps faster to compensate and sometimes fails .
The cause of elephant herpes virus remains unknown , but it is not transmitted sexually , Flanagan said .
Many elephants carry the virus in latent form from an early age , and veterinarians remain puzzled over why it flares up in some animals .
After veterinarians administered an antiviral medication , Mac appeared to recover .
He began playing and eating Sunday afternoon .
But that night , " unfortunately , he stood up , yawned , sat down and passed , " Flanagan said .
Mac 's mother , Shanti , and Methai , a female elephant who helped mother him in the maternally - run herd , stayed by his body , grieving him , Barongi said .
A necropsy — an animal autopsy — will be performed at the state veterinary diagnostic lab at Texas A&M University .
His body will be cremated there .
After his birth , he got his name through an Internet contest .
Zoo officials chose " Mac " because they thought it was apt — he was big like a Mack truck .
Zoo spokesman Brian Hill said , " There was almost this eagerness to please in him .
He enjoyed interacting with the keepers .
He was all boy — he enjoyed knocking his wind pipes .
Sometimes , he'd take a box of produce , smash it , and eat the produce along with parts of the box . "
With his death , five elephants remain at the zoo , including Mac 's father , Thai .
Mac is the sixth elephant that was kept at the zoo or was born at the zoo to die from elephant herpes , Barongi said .
Singgah , 10 , died from the disease at the zoo in 2000 .
Kimba , 8 , died in 2004 .
Three elephants born at the zoo died at zoos in Berlin , Chicago and Canada , Barongi said .
Flanagan said most elephants are infected with the virus , so he and others have no reason to believe that the virus was especially rampant among the zoo 's elephants .
The virus was n't detected until 1995 .
Veterinarians have n't found a test yet to detect when elephants are carrying it in its latent form .
After composing himself , Barongi returned to the microphone and said a cure or vaccine will be found only if veterinarians devote themselves to finding one .
Among the zoo 's remaining elephants is 3 - year - old Tucker , who was Mac 's playmate .
But the herd may be growing .
" Shanti's in the early stage of pregnancy , " Barongi said .

Announcing this week that British troops will leave Iraq by the middle of next year , Gordon Brown and the Prime Minister of Iraq , Nouri al - Maliki , spoke about " building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism " .
Yet , if the war in Iraq has proven anything , it is the utter ineffectiveness of using military power to counter terrorism .
US President - elect Barack Obama has also pledged to withdraw troops from Iraq and I warmly welcome moves in this direction .
My fear , however , is that a key motivator behind this approach is the desire to bolster troop numbers in Afghanistan .
While the original Taliban regime may have been ousted , the movement itself continues to threaten that country 's future security .
Yet not only does an even more visible military presence further increase the risk of fuelling extremism , it also distracts attention and resources away from strategies far more likely to be effective at tackling terrorism .
For example , there must be an immediate ceasing of air strikes on targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan , in preparation for more long term measures .
These should include support for negotiations between all parties involved in the conflict , reform of humanitarian aid and reconstruction funding to prioritise Afghan organisations over foreign contractors , and investment in the kind of lasting aid that increases self - reliance , not least in sustainable agriculture initiatives , for example .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Afghanistan , women have played a key role de-escalating the violence , as they have in other conflict zones like the Balkans , Somalia and Northern Ireland .
However , despite being a signatory to United Nations agreement to include women in preventing and resolving violence , Britain is reluctant to engage with what this means in practice – be it training significant numbers of police women or supporting their role in development and education .
This aversion means losing out on opportunities to deliver a powerful kind of " human security " , based on addressing human needs and grievances that , if frustrated and ignored , may fuel violence .
Paul Rogers , Professor of Peace Studies at Bradford University , uses the term " liddism " to describe the current mindset .
He defines this approach as " keeping the lid on things rather than acknowledging the underlying problems " .
Britain 's commitment to nuclear weapons , for example , stems from a belief that one day we may need to contain all kinds of unimaginable horrors and will require the ultimate in force to do so .
Yet for most people the greatest threats they face are socio-economic and environmental .
The global economy has failed miserably to deliver global justice .
Around one billion people in the world live fairly comfortably – the remaining five billion do not .
As Archbishop Desmond Tutu explains , " the real threat to global peace is failing to recognise our interdependence " , and we do this at our peril .
As worldwide recession takes hold and the consequences of environmental crises like climate change are felt , many hundreds of millions of the world 's poorest people will be marginalised even further .
History shows that when this happens , violent social movements can materialise , often provoking a repressive backlash in return .
In other words , self - fulfiling cycles of violence are established , breeding terrorism rather than countering it .
In the pages of this newspaper Howard Jacobson has accused me of being complicit in terrorist atrocities .
Why ?
Because I do not acknowledge that seeking to unravel complex grievances is the same as justifying violent action in pursuit of them .
Killing terrorists will not destroy terrorism and I argue , instead , that the answers are more complex , less reactionary and , ultimately , far more difficult .
The only people to blame for terrorism are the terrorists themselves , and they must in all circumstances be held to account – be they individuals , established governments or insurgent groups .
This is only the beginning of the process .
Increased international efforts to solve festering conflicts and strengthen failed states , development assistance , promoting democracy and equality , effective and equitable resource management , consensus building , multilateral activity and strengthening the UN apparatus all have a role to play too .
Surely the war on terror will only ever be won when we replace a culture of fear with one of respect , engagement , vigilance and solidarity ?
The writer is the leader of the Green Party in England and Wales and a Member of the European Parliament
In the past few days , two official documents on Iraq and the war on terror have come out : a bipartisan inquiry by the Senate Armed Services committee into treatment of detainees , and a report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction .
Reading through the executive summary of the first and highlights of the second gave me a distinct feeling of nausea — a sense of being dragged back down into an extremely unpleasant experience in which I ’d been immersed for years and that I ’d only recently started to leave behind .
No chance .
A few sentences into each document and it was real and vivid all over again : the official lies and deceptions buried under acronyms and jargon ; the headlong folly of arrogant policymakers ; the fateful decisions made in the shadows or on the fly , and the years of terrible consequences .
These two documents bring very old news ; there ’s nothing remarkable about their main conclusions .
The nausea I felt came from having seen and heard almost all of it before .
The Senate inquiry finds that the humiliation and cruelty inflicted on prisoners at Guantanamo , Bagram , and Abu Ghraib followed from directives that originated in the White House and the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
The Inspector General ’s report ( which , at 513 pages , contains far more revealing detail than the declassified version of the Senate inquiry ) establishes that the U.S. government was completely unprepared for the reconstruction of Iraq , owing to the almost criminal negligence of those responsible , and that the years since the invasion have been marked by bureaucratic confusion and incompetent execution , with private contractors playing a large role in the disaster .
In both narratives , President Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld are the prime culprits , heading a large cast of failed officials , along with a few quiet dissidents .
Both documents show , without quite saying so , that years of official statements amount to a long string of lies .
These documents are , among other things , a vindication of American journalism , which was years ahead of the official story — something to be noted as newspapers come crashing down all around the country .
Is it worth having these belated official imprimaturs of what anyone paying attention has known for years ?
I think so .
They will make it all the harder for officials who have written or plan to write self - justifying memoirs ( such as this , this , this , this , and this ) to claim that the tragedies of the past decade were someone else ’s fault .
They will also make it harder for partisan hacks to rewrite the story for political advantage .
In the future , anyone demanding to know who lost Iraq or who ’s to blame for the next acts of global jihad should be forced to explain these dispassionate findings from bipartisan or nonpartisan sources ( the Senate inquiry marks the beginning of John McCain ’s campaign for rehabilitation ) .
The trouble is , the information in these reports does n’t tell the whole story , and it does n’t tell it as a complete story .
The reports only give us fragments , which will be too easily overlooked or forgotten .
The official sanction of torture and the woeful management of occupied Iraq are related pieces of a much larger epic : the first is marked by criminality , the second by bureaucratic ineptitude , but they are joined together as expressions and outcomes of the ideas and habits of mind of the highest officials in the Bush Administration .
Eventually the country will need , even if it wo n’t entirely want , the whole story to be told .
The best way to tell it would be to reproduce the 9/11 Commission — to convene a single bipartisan panel , with the authority to look into the conduct of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and of the war on terror , and give the panel full investigative power , even if its conclusions put some of the principals in legal jeopardy .
The next Administration and the next Congress will have to decide whether it ’s worth the agony to look back .
The agony will be worse , sooner or later , if we do n’t .
Australian Scientists Create World 's Most Efficient Solar Cells
October 26th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Scientists at the University of New South Wales have set a new world record by creating the first silicon solar cell to achieve 25 % efficiency .
Team leader , Prof. Martin Green of the university ’s ARC Photovoltaic Centre of Excellence , says their world - beating solar cell is now a massive six percent more efficient than the next best technology .
The record edges the current generation of solar cell technology closer to the theoretical limit of 29 % efficiency .
The rise in efficiency is due to new knowledge about the composition of sunlight , leading to an improvement in the solar cell ’s ability to capture more energy at the extremes of the solar light spectrum .
According to Green , “ These light - trapping features make our cells act as if they were much thicker than they are .
This already has had an important spin - off in allowing us to work with CSG Solar to develop commercial ‘ thin - film ’ silicon - on - glass solar cells that are over 100 times thinner than conventional silicon cells . ”
Negotiations for commercial production of the latest advancement are already underway , and could soon lead to a new generation of low cost , high energy output solar cells .

At the recent Microsoft Professional Developer 's Conference there was a presentation by Anders Hejlsberg about The Future of C# which unveiled some of the upcoming features of C# 4.0 .
Of all the features announced , the one I found most interesting was the introduction of duck typing via a new static type called dynamic .
For those who are n't familiar with Duck Typing , here is the definition from Wikipedia
In computer programming , duck typing is a style of dynamic typing in which an object 's current set of methods and properties determines the valid semantics , rather than its inheritance from a particular class .
The name of the concept refers to the duck test , attributed to James Whitcomb Riley ( see History below ) , which may be phrased as follows :
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , I would call it a duck .
In duck typing one is concerned with just those aspects of an object that are used , rather than with the type of the object itself .
For example , in a non -duck - typed language , one can create a function that takes an object of type Duck and calls that object 's walk and quack methods .
In a duck - typed language , the equivalent function would take an object of any type and call that object 's walk and quack methods .
If the object does not have the methods that are called then the function signals a run-time error .
This is perfectly illustrated with the following IronPython program
def PrintAt ( container , index ) : print " The value at [ %s ] is %s " % ( index , container [ index ] ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : # create dictionary table = { 1 : " one " , 2 : " two " , 3 : " three " } #create sequence list = ( " apple " , " banana " , " cantalope " ) PrintAt ( table , 1 ) PrintAt ( list , 1 )
In the above program the PrintAt ( ) simply requires that the container object passed in supports the index operator ' [ ] ' and can accept whatever type is passed in as the index .
This means I can pass both a sequence ( i.e. a list ) or a dictionary ( i.e. a hash table ) to the function and it returns results even though the semantics of using the index operator is very different for lists and dictionaries .
Proponents of static typing have long argued that features like duck typing lead to hard - to - find bugs which are only detected at runtime after the application has failed instead of during development via compiler errors .
However there are many situations even in statically typed programming where the flexibility of duck typing would be beneficial .
A common example is invoking JSON or SOAP web services and mapping these structures to objects .
Recently , I had to write some code at work which spoke to a JSON - based Web service and struggled with how to deal with the fact that C# requires me to define the class of an object up front before I can use it in my application .
Given the flexible and schema - less nature of JSON , this was a problem .
I ended up using the JsonReaderWriterFactory to create an XmlDictionary Reader which maps JSON into an XML document which can then be processed flexibly using XML technologies .
Here 's what the code looked like
using System ; using System .IO ; using System .
Runtime .
Serialization .Json ; using System .
Text ; using System.Xml ; namespace Test { class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { string json = @ " { " " firstName " " : " " John " " , " " lastName " " : " " Smith " " , " " age " " : 21 } " ; var stream = new MemoryStream ( ASCIIEncoding .Default. GetBytes( json ) ) ; var reader = JsonReaderWriterFactory .CreateJsonReader( stream , XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas . Max ) ; var doc = new XmlDocument ( ) ; doc.Load ( reader ) ; //error handling omitted for brevity string firstName = doc.SelectSingleNode ( " / root / firstName " ) .
InnerText ; int age = Int32 . Parse( doc.SelectSingleNode ( " / root / age " ) . InnerText ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " {0} will be { 1} next year " , firstName , age + 1 ) ; Console . ReadLine ( ) ; } } }
It works but the code is definitely not as straightforward as interacting with JSON from Javascript .
This is where the dynamic type from C# 4.0 would be very useful .
With this type , I could rewrite the above code as follows
using System ; using System .IO ; using System .
Runtime .
Serialization .Json ; using System .
Text ; using System.Xml ; namespace Test { class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { string json = @ " { " " firstName " " : " " John " " , " " lastName " " : " " Smith " " , " " age " " : 21 } " ; var stream = new MemoryStream ( ASCIIEncoding .Default. GetBytes( json ) ) ; dynamic person = JsonObjectReaderFactory .CreateJsonObjectReader( stream , XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas . Max ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " {0} will be { 1} next year " , person.firstName , person.age + 1 ) ; Console .ReadLine ( ) ; } } }
In the C# 4.0 version I can declare a person object whose class / type I do n't have to define at compile time .
Instead the property accesses are converted to dynamic calls to the named properties using reflection by the compiler .
So at runtime when my [ imaginary ]
JsonObjectReader dynamically creates the person objects from the input JSON , my application works as expected with a lot less lines of code .
It 's amazing how Python - like C# gets each passing year .

The Worst Movies Ever Made
What is the worst movie you have ever seen ?
Let 's make a collection of the most dismal mainstream films ever created , and we 'll see if some sort of pattern develops - like that they 're all directed by Michael Bay or something .
Pop singer Imogen Heap wants to hire a web programmer .
She writes on her website blog :
Does anyone fancy helping me out in creating a little webtoy / game thing ? …
What I ’d like to do is to get some kind of webpage up where people can upload photo’s of their faces , voice and text into the space .
Plan is … basically , it ’s me dancing ( very silly ! ) about to one of the tracks off my new album either on stage / in garden or studio … but you can put your face on my animated body ( slightly elf yourself with a few twists ) .

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy , authority , or control on the Internet .
A domain is the physical address of a website .
It is the name that is typed into the address bar when you want to visit a particular website .
A domain is very important when it comes to building a website because it is the first thing people will see related to your website .
A good domain name can ensure that more traffic will be directed to your website , while a bad domain name can discourage people from visiting your website .
Today websites are dynamic , so everybody looks for the web to host connectivity at cheaper prices .
In addition to that , they also want the web to host solution and technologies to security , server network , and server management usage .
Cheap web hosting companies also provide domain names for free with the hosting service .
Most of the web designers and other professionals in this sector may have only a basic idea regarding instigation of a site or a basic web page .
Multiple domain web hosting is a newer and an essential option while performing web hosting , where the user has to bring in numerous domains on the same account .
While looking for an unlimited domain web hosting plan , first of all , go through the packages that may offer adequate space and bandwidth , because you may require all the space for the domains that you open as well as all the sites will take specific bandwidth too .
The basic step is to decide a domain name and to get it registered .
It is important to choose a name that will be a memorable address pointing towards a specific server address on which your website is hosted .
The next step is to find a domain web hosting provider that will host your website .
Some web hosts will offer you a free domain name if you pay a monthly subscription fee , which is quite minimal .
In this way , you will have to pay some amount , but not for the domain name .
In other cases , you can be charged a fee for web hosting , but not for the domain name .
This is actually a good plan because you will get all the services you need in one package .
When it comes to a website , you do not just need a free domain name ; you will also need a free domain host .
Cheap Web Hosting provides a domain with the hosting .
With this , you can register , configure and manage your domain names like a Pro. Webhostingcheap .
net explains the best ways to decide upon and find an available domain name , register it , configure it with a DNS host and use it for your website and email address .

Katie Couric ’s newsmaking interviews with the Republican vice presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , last week had only a slight impact on the ratings for her CBS newscast .
But if the network could have added up all the other viewers the interviews ( and its spoof ) racked up , on places like CNN , YouTube and “ Saturday Night Live , ” Ms. Couric would surely have been more seen and talked about than in any week since she began her tenure as anchor .
Ms. Couric received a rush of attention for the two interviews , in which Ms. Palin , governor of Alaska , spoke haltingly on , among other topics , her state ’s “ narrow maritime border ” with Russia .
Clips turned up across the spectrum of television and Web sites .
The first interview last Wednesday , for example , has been viewed more than 1.4 million times on YouTube , while the parody of the interview on “ SNL ” was streamed more than 4 million times on NBC.com , viewed in full more than 600,000 times on YouTube and in shorter clips many more hundreds of thousands of times .
Still , the “ CBS Evening News ” gained only about 10 percent in audience from the previous week  and it was actually down from the same week the year before .
The newscast averaged just under 6 million viewers for the week , up from 5.44 million the previous week .
A year ago Ms. Couric ’s program drew about 6.2 million viewers .
( CBS was also a distant third last week behind ABC , which won with 8.07 million viewers , and NBC , with 7.98 million . )
A compound in muskrat faeces is an effective antibiotic , a new patent application says ( Image : Wikimedia Commons )
Muskrats are semi-aquatic rodents prized for their musk – a strong - smelling substance produced by specialised glands – which can be used in perfumes , cosmetics and medicines .
Now Ki Keun Kim and colleagues at Pusan National University , South Korea , have found that the animal produces another useful by - product .
The Pusan team claims that muskrat excrement contains a potent antibiotic that can kill the Salmonella bacteria that are a common cause of food poisoning , as well as the Vibrio bacteria that cause seafood - linked food poisoning .

It also proved effective against Staphylococcus aureus , a common cause of opportunistic infections , they say .
The patent also notes that experiments show the compound kills termites too , perhaps providing an environmentally friendly method of insect control .
Collecting the antibiotic requires drying the faeces , and using an organic solvent to extract the compound .
However , the patent says nothing about the chemistry of the compound , or whether it might be safe to administer to humans .

They 're usually most active shortly after the beginning of the rainy season .
The verdant grass and renewal of life brings out all sorts of animals , including the unicorn , but a more important factor are the rainbows and moonbeams that are most spectacular that time of year .
As you surely know , moonbeams are what give unicorn 's their particular shine and luster , so they can often be spotted frolicking and basking beneath the glow of a full moon on a partly - mostly cloudy night .
Most people think the association between unicorn and rainbows is similarly benign , but the truth is much more sinister .
Little known fact , the unicorn 's horn is a leprechaun killing machine .
Their violent blood feud spanning the ages is part of the reason both species are now so rare .
When the rainbows are out , the unicorns go hunting .
If you 're skilled at night photography , you can get some lovely shots of unicorns at play .
The lighting conditions that give rise to rainbows are almost ideal for a highly romanticized play of soft light and delicate shadows ... unfortunately the unicorns are usually covered in chrysochlorous ichor of leprechaun .
Which sounds like it might look pretty , but it 's not .
Dead gods , how it 's not .
So , yeah , shortly after the beginning of rainy season .

For all the misery it represents for ordinary people , there is at least one positive result of the current capitalist financial crisis .
The idea of nationalisation is getting an airing again in the West , however squeamish bourgeois leaders and pundits may be about using the actual word .
Of course , this is clearly a case of governments mobilising massive resources and taking drastic action to save bankers and speculators from the consequences of their greed but , nevertheless , there it is .
And if nationalisation — state or public ownership — is allowable in this dubious instance , why not for far more deserving and urgent causes such as saving the planet and the lives and welfare of masses of working people ?
The question of nationalisation is important because it is simply impossible to conceive of addressing a whole series of key problems facing us today without a major expansion of the public sector and bringing the “ commanding heights ” of the economy under state ownership and control .
First , of course , there is the overriding issue of climate change and all the things related to that — especially energy and water sustainability , food security and the preservation of workers ’ jobs as the economy is restructured .
Then there is the struggle to preserve workers ’ jobs and livelihoods in the face of widespread downsizing during the economic downturn .
By way of an introduction , the reader is referred to two articles I wrote for Green Left Weekly in 1995 ( issues of September 6 and October 3 ) .
They provide a useful overview of the whole question of privatisation and nationalisation from a socialist perspective .
They can be found online at http://www.greenleft.org.au/1995/201/11264 and http://www.greenleft.org.au/1995/205/11117.
The political background was the 1992 election victory in the state of Victoria by the conservative Liberal Party - National Party Coalition , led by Liberal Party leader Jeff Kennett .
His seven years in power were marked by a veritable orgy of neoliberal restructuring and harsh attacks on working people .
Public ownership in the past
Today we are living in the period of total neoliberal madness — madness , it should be stressed , from the point of view of society as a whole but not from the capitalist standpoint — when just about everything in sight has either been privatised or is slated for privatisation .
In official circles , the idea of state enterprise is decidedly on the nose .
As the wretched Victorian Labor Party state government transport minister Lynne Kosky has notoriously said , the government is not , or should not be , in the business of running the transport system .
But it was n’t always so …
In fact , historians have dubbed the period 1850 - 1914 in Australia as “ colonial socialism ” .
Large - scale public activity was carried out — especially in transport , communications , water supply and sewerage systems , and immigration to boost the population .
Of course , it was n’t really socialism but rather public enterprise in the service of capitalism , creating the infrastructure that private enterprise needed but could n’t effectively organise itself .
The 1930s were the culmination of this process .
The 1989 Evatt Research Centre publication State of Siege explains :
… the 1930s provide the highwater mark in the development of public enterprise and regulations …
[ The labour historian Brian ] Fitzpatrick described a “ remarkable change ” in which “ systems like supervision of labour relations in industry , and the institution of public financial and industrial undertakings … the New Protection and public competition with private enterprise in production ” took hold .
It gave “ an impression that an experiment in state control or modification of capitalism was being pursued ” .
1
However , the reality was that private capital never lost its control of the country ’s economic organisation .
It accepted public economic activity in essential areas in which it could not profitably operate — the railways are the prime example here .
State enterprises which did n’t come under this heading were generally sold off ( as were the profitable NSW government brickworks , metal quarries and pipeworks in 1936 ) .
Neoliberalism today
Since the early 1980s , neoliberalism has been in the ascendant .
Internationally capitalism is in a period of sharply intensifying economic competition .
Everywhere it demands that social expenditures be cut to the bone and handouts and tax breaks for big business increased ; and it wants to get its hands on every bit of hitherto public enterprise that it might use to turn a profit .
The first of my 1995 articles lists the five main forms of privatisation under neoliberalism : outright sell - offs , contracting out , liberalisation and deregulation , abrogation of responsibilities , and implementation of a user - pays regime .
I do n’t want to spend any time on these here —
I ’m sure we are all familiar with many examples under each heading .
We can also dismiss without much discussion the ideological justifications for privatisation .
Whatever the faults of public enterprise under capitalism — and we are far from denying them — the idea that the private sector is inherently better or more efficient is utterly ludicrous .
The only real “ efficiencies ” of the private sector lie in slugging the public and putting its hand out for ever more government subsidies and concessions .
We oppose privatisation in all its forms .
It is a massive attack on working people and our quality of life .
In opposition to neoliberalism we must advocate nationalisation , public ownership and a massive expansion of public sector on all levels ( federal , state and municipal ) .
If we are to cope with a whole series of problems we need rational , democratic social and economic planning and for this all the “ commanding heights ” of the economy must be in public hands .
Transitional Program
On an April 2007 edition of Aló Presidente ! , the immensely popular weekly television program of Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chávez — “ a television chat show like no other ” , as the British Guardian aptly described it — he urged viewers to study Leon Trotsky ’s 1938 Transitional Program .
We can only concur .
And in the light of the current global financial crisis some passages seem especially relevant .
There is a section on advancing the demand for the nationalisation of particular sectors of the economy .
The socialist program of expropriation [ writes Trotsky ] , i.e. , of political overthrow of the bourgeoisie and liquidation of its economic domination , should in no case during the present transitional period hinder us from advancing , when the occasion warrants , the demand for the expropriation of several key branches of industry vital for national existence or of the most parasitic group of the bourgeoisie …
The difference between these demands and the muddleheaded reformist slogan of “ nationalisation ” lies in the following : … we reject indemnification … we call upon the masses to rely only upon their own revolutionary strength … we link up the question of expropriation with that of seizure of power by the workers and farmers .
The necessity of advancing the slogan of expropriation in the course of daily agitation in partial form , and not only in our propaganda in its more comprehensive aspects , is dictated by the fact that different branches of industry are on different levels of development , occupy a different place in the life of society , and pass through different stages of the class struggle .
Only a general revolutionary upsurge of the proletariat can place the complete expropriation of the bourgeoisie on the order of the day .
The task of transitional demands is to prepare the proletariat to solve this problem .
2
We should stress that today our language — as well as our political circumstances — is a little different .
When we advocate nationalisation we can leave open the question of compensation ( “ indemnification ” ) .
For us this is a question of political expediency and not of principle .
In Venezuela , for instance , in most cases the state has purchased the enterprises it has nationalised — of course , the government has driven a hard bargain but it has the oil wealth and this policy is probably better politics ( at this point at least ) than outright confiscation .
In Australia , in the event of nationalisation we would advocate full compensation to any ordinary small investors who are simply trying to augment their modest incomes .
But for large corporate owners and investors our attitude to compensation would be wholly determined by political considerations .
Morally , we consider that we owe them nothing .
Their enterprises have been built up through the toil of the workers and slugging the public .
In most cases we would be in favour of simply expropriating the big capitalists .
However , in certain exceptional circumstances it might make political sense to negotiate with the former owners in order to secure their cooperation .
Following this section , Trotsky includes a separate one devoted to the nationalisation of the banks and the financial sector .
It is impossible to take a single serious step in the struggle against monopolistic despotism and capitalistic anarchy — which supplement one another in their work of destruction — if the commanding posts of banks are left in the hands of predatory capitalists .
In order to create a unified system of investments and credits , along a rational plan corresponding to the interests of the entire people , it is necessary to merge all the banks into a single national institution .
Only the expropriation of the private banks and the concentration of the entire credit system in the hands of the state will provide the latter with the necessary actual , i.e. , material resources — and not merely paper and bureaucratic resources — for economic planning .
3
How well this reads today !
Rather than bailouts of the criminals responsible for the financial crisis , “ merge all the banks into a single national institution ” and “ create a unified system of investments and credits , along a rational plan corresponding to the interests of the entire people ” .
Use the truly immense resources suddenly revealed by the government response to the crisis to tackle global warming , keep people in their homes and provide everyone with decent jobs .
Of course , we are keenly aware that , ultimately , only the installation of a workers ’ government based on the mobilisation of the working class and its allies can solve the problems of society .
But the nationalisation demand points to what is necessary and is a key part of the struggle to get there .
Objections and problems
When the question of public ownership and nationalisation is raised , we often encounter various objections .
People might say , under capitalism what is the real difference between private and public ownership ?
For instance , look at the truly appalling Australia Post .
It is run like a private corporation .
Profitability and service to big business is its main concern ; it has a whole raft of obscenely overpaid executives ; in an effort to undermine the union and cut costs , it is engaged in a continuous assault on its work force ; and through aggressive contracting out it is slowly privatising the whole service .
( And , we might add , our post offices more and more resemble flea markets : as one waits in the inescapable queue one can peruse the merchandise bins offering André Rieu CDs or various dinky gadgets …)
Is this the sort of thing we want ?
Clearly not .
We advocate something radically different .
We want public enterprises to be run as genuine public utilities — public service and workers ’ rights should go hand in hand .
Public enterprises should be run democratically , controlled by boards representing both the community and the workforce .
The corporate bludgers [ freeloaders ] should be cleaned out ; managers should be elected and receive workers wages with only modest margins for skill and responsibility .
Another argument is that the public does n’t relate to the idea of public ownership and nationalisation .
However , this proposition is not borne out by the facts .
First , look at the struggle in NSW : there the public massively opposes the sell - off of the power industry .
Whatever the problems of the state - owned power industry — and there are a lot of them — people realise that privatisation will only make things radically worse .
Second , as the crisis deepens a lot more people will relate to calls for nationalisation and public ownership .
Right now , lots of workers do n’t relate to many things that we believe are objectively necessary .
Our struggle is to get a hearing for our ideas .
Third , as mentioned above , the intervention of capitalist governments around the world to prop up their system has been in sharp contradiction to their ideology of yesterday .
The market was n’t left to sink or swim .
In the US and the UK the government has taken over certain financial institutions lock , stock and barrel , i.e. , it has nationalised them , whatever spin it tries to put on this fact .
Thus , it seems , nationalisation is not only not impossible but even desirable in some instances .
Finally , the stirring events in Venezuela and in Latin America will penetrate people ’s consciousness .
In several countries there , with strong popular support , the state is resuming key entities and sectors of the economy .
( Recently , for instance , the Chávez government announced it would nationalise the wholesale petrol distribution sector , saying it was making profits at the country ’s expense . )
In regard to nationalisation , in Australia we sometimes hear the cry that it is against the constitution .
This is simply not true .
There is no absolute prohibition , either on a federal or state level .
( I ’ll say a little more about this later in relation to the bank nationalisation struggle of 1947 - 49 . )
But as Marxists we know that fundamentally it is not a question of what is written on a bit of paper — it is a question of the class struggle .
With sufficient public support and mobilisation and sufficient political will and determination , a government can do just about anything .
New laws can be passed , the composition of courts can be changed , etc. , etc .
Another argument we may hear is that it wo n’t or ca n’t happen under capitalism .
Again , this is ill founded .
The truth is that in the advanced capitalist countries , at particular times in particular circumstances , nationalisations have taken place .
In Britain , for example , the iron and steel industry was nationalised in 1949 by the reforming postwar Labour government , the Tories de-nationalised it in 1951 and Labour re-nationalised it in 1967 .
Today , it is in private hands again .
And as a result of the financial crisis the UK and US governments find themselves owning a number of key financial entities .
A lot of things we call for wo n’t happen or are extremely unlikely to happen under capitalism .
Alternatively , they might happen .
But so what ?
The key thing is consciousness and the struggle .
Fighting — and winning — on the question of public ownership can help to educate people about what is required and drive the struggle forward .
Chifley ’s effort to nationalise the banks
I would like now to look briefly at the struggle around bank nationalisation in Australia in 1947 - 49 .
We can learn a lot from a study of this largely forgotten episode .
Nationalisation of banking had been in the Australian Labor Party ’s ( ALP ) platform since 1919 and it was one of the clearly stated “ methods ” of implementing the party ’s 1921 objective of “ the socialisation of industry , production , distribution and exchange ” .
During World War II , the banking sector had been stringently regulated .
The federal Labor government wanted to maintain a high level of control of the financial sector in the postwar period in order to underwrite the peacetime reconstruction effort .
Two federal bills passed in 1945 effectively continued the wartime banking regulations .
Among other things they directed state and local governments and semi-government bodies to do all their business with the Commonwealth Bank .
( This was then the state - owned central bank , there being no Reserve Bank . )
In August 1947 the Melbourne City Council secured a High Court judgement ruling this provision invalid .
Prime Minister Ben Chifley concluded that other aspects of his regime of financial controls were at risk of being overturned in the courts and that nationalisation of the private banks was the only way to guarantee his program .
Robin Gollan , in his 1975 book Revolutionaries and Reformists , explains the significance of this chapter in Australian history :
The attempt [ by the Chifley federal ALP government ] to nationalise the trading banks was the strongest attempt ever made by an Australian government to control directly an important area of the capitalist economy .
The issue , connected though it was with many others , dominated politics for more than two years , from August 1947 to the general elections late in 1949 .
In the course of the battle the conservative forces were more effectively organised for political action than they had ever been before or have ever been , or needed to be , since .
4
The government ’s announcement ( in August 1947 ) touched off a veritable firestorm of opposition from the banks and the Liberal Party , led by Robert Menzies .
They went all - out to kill the legislation .
A. L. May , in his 1968 study , The Battle for the Banks , gives a feel for this :
Some idea of the language used to describe the proposal by its opponents in comments , resolutions , letters , and editorials is gained from a published “ sample ” of adjectives used in the Sydney Morning Herald between 18 - 23 August [ i.e. , in the week immediately following the government ’s announcement ] …
“ Sensational , radical , unprecedented , spleenful , Red , revolutionary , dishonest , communistic , ill - considered , terrible , irresponsible , ruthless , authoritarian , totalitarian , unauthorised , insidious , subversive , disturbing , drastic , stupid , astonishing , tragic , iniquitous , impudent , arbitrary , violent , destructive , contemptible , mad , ominous , calamitous , audacious , illegal , sinister , servile , predatory , venomous , extremist , unwarranted , scandalous , unscrupulous , unjustified , undemocratic , unsound , doctrinaire , unconstitutional , putrid , appalling , tyrannical , anti-democratic , unnecessary , provocative , ill - conceived , dangerous , vindictive , shocking , deplorable , cynical , savage , wanton , petty . ”

The banks organised on a truly tremendous scale .
As Robin Gollan explains :
For two years Australians were subjected to the most intense , highly organised , highly financed , and unscrupulous propaganda campaign they had ever experienced .
At first it was against nationalisation of the banks , but this by easy stages became an all - out attack on the government .
It was a struggle , as they put it , in defence of freedom , against a government determined to regiment and dictate .
The parliamentary opposition took the lead in public , but numerous citizens ’ organisations lent their support and helped with propaganda and money .
The banks themselves appointed a general staff of senior officers and a small army of bank officials who became full - time political activists , supported by a larger contingent who gave part - time service .
6
It is worth pointing out that the bank workers — “ bank officers ” , as they were called — were overwhelmingly onside with the bank bosses and opposed to nationalisation .
Being a bank employee was seen as a secure lifelong career path .
In Sydney in September 1947 a bank officers ’ meeting in the Domain protesting nationalisation attracted 10,000 people .
Against this right - wing barrage there was a only a very weak response by the ALP and the trade union movement .
There were a number of reasons for this .
First , Chifley seems to have had no idea of what he was entering into .
He did not want to challenge capitalism .
He actually had quite modest objectives and blundered into nationalisation which the capitalists saw as a fundamental attack on all they held sacred .
He was totally incapable of responding to what he had unwittingly unleashed .
Second , the Cold War was beginning and anti-communism was growing rapidly .
The ALP - led trade unions were reluctant to campaign in a full - blooded way on an issue widely seen as a key Communist Party ( CPA ) demand .
Likewise , the growing far - right Catholic Action “ Industrial Groups ” section in the trade unions , although nominally in favour of nationalisation , would have nothing to do with communists on any basis .
The issue was tested in the High Court in 1948 and before the London - based Privy Council in 1949 , with the government suffering defeat in both cases .
However , even in strictly legal terms , it is by no means clear that these judgements mean that any future nationalisation attempt will be automatically ruled out of order .
In the event , these setbacks plus the decisive victory of the Menzies - led Coalition in the 1949 elections buried the idea of bank nationalisation .
Then and now
Looking over the bank nationalisation struggle of the late 1940s from today ’s vantage point is very instructive .
If there were a full - blooded attempt by a radical - minded government to nationalise the banks and the financial sector today , the bosses would be politically in a qualitatively weaker position .
It would be impossible for them to simply replicate their 1947 - 49 Red - scare campaign .
Conversely , any campaign for public ownership that was reasonably and resolutely led would seem to have a good chance of success or at least of winning substantial popular support .
For instance , would bank workers rally behind their employers as they did in 1947 - 49 ?
It seems highly unlikely .
Today they are a casualised , insecure , badly paid workforce .
The prospect of permanent , secure , well - paid jobs with decent conditions in a universal state - owned bank would surely be very attractive to them .
Bank propaganda advertisement , Melbourne Argus , November 12 , 1949 .
The text reads :
``Like Betty Freeland , most of us prefer to do business the friendly way .
At the bank , it is pleasant to know that you are a valued customer and that your requirements will receive prompt and confidential attention .
``How different if you had to queue up at a government monopoly bank where you were only a number in a file .
Your business then might take days , even weeks , to complete .
“ Remember if you have no choice you have no freedom . ”
Just look at the banks ’ anti-nationalisation advertisement from 1949 ( reproduced above ) .
How things have changed in 60 years !
Today they simply could n’t run this crap without being laughed out of town .
Today banks mean casualised staff , queues , branch closures , being forced to transact your business at a hole in the wall out in the street and outrageous fees and charges , forever increasing .
In some small rural towns there is no bank and people have to travel for 50 kilometres to find one .
The big banks are widely hated .
Imagine — in today ’s conditions — a massive all - out campaign for folding all the banks ( and other financial institutions ) into a single state bank , backed by a pledge to open branches in every locality and town , enable customers to interact with real people , cut the outrageous fees , provide cheap housing finance for ordinary people and provide permanent jobs for all finance sector workers — surely such a push would win overwhelming public support .
The banks , we can be sure , would resist bitterly but amongst ordinary people they do n’t have many friends .
Nationalise the entire energy sector
In NSW , 2008 has seen a big campaign against the state ALP government ’s push to privatise the power industry .
Polls have repeatedly shown more than 80 % of the public are opposed to the sell - off .
The workers in the industry are opposed and the consuming public is opposed .
ALP conferences have overwhelmingly opposed the privatisation .
People understand that privatisation will mean higher electricity charges , a worse service and even less action on climate change .
But a narrow clique of Labor cabinet ministers , responding to the insistent demands of their ruling - class masters , are determined to have their way on the issue , come what may .
In Victoria , the electricity sector used to be run by the State Electricity Commission .
The SEC had many faults but at least the state ’s electricity system was an integrated whole — embracing generation , distribution and supply .
The sell - off , it is important to note , did not begin with Coalition Premier Jeff Kennett but with an ALP government .
In 1991 , Labor premier Joan Kirner ’s government sold 49 % of the huge Loy Yang B power station .
It also corporatised the SEC , preparing it for privatisation .
After coming to power at the end of 1992 , Kennett sold off the rest of the state ’s electricity assets .
Privatisation of the power industry in Victoria has long been a bipartisan policy .
Campaigning for re-election , Labor refused to make any promise to re-nationalise the electricity sector ( or indeed to reverse any of Kennett ’s cuts in any fundamental way ) .
Then , in 2005 the Steve Bracks - led ALP government re-licensed the decrepit , heavily polluting — but privately owned — Hazelwood power station for a further 25 emission - spewing years .
Grappling with climate change ( trying to halt and reverse it , coping with the inescapable consequences ) is the number - one issue facing humanity in the 21st century .
( There are other issues but this is the absolutely decisive one .
If we do n’t solve it most of the human race will perish . )
Making the “ big switch ” to renewable energy necessitates a radical plan and a complete restructuring of our economy .
This can not be done with the bulk of the economy in the hands of the profit - mad capitalist corporations .
At an absolute minimum , the whole energy sector must be placed in public hands .
Its foundation charter must be to achieve a rapid phasing out of the fossil fuel - fired power stations ; build up the renewable energy sector ; and achieve a radical improvement in energy efficiency across the whole economy .
Furthermore , all this has to be done on an all - out emergency basis .
Only a strong public sector can possibly achieve this and achieve the redistribution of the workforce , preserving jobs and living standards and thus securing strong public backing for the necessary changes .
Public ownership key to job protection and creation
The recent wave of factory closures , especially in Victoria , has led to significant job losses in the manufacturing sector .
The looming recession will also lead to significant downsizing across the whole economy .
Decent redundancy agreements , protection of entitlements , retraining packages and special assistance in finding new work — these are all vitally important things to fight for .
But what about protecting jobs in the first place and charting a course to create large numbers of new jobs ?
Government handouts to big business wo n’t save workers .
The bosses will happily take the money but they have no commitment to their employees — only to themselves and their big shareholders .
In our opinion , calls to raise tariffs to protect workers ’ jobs are also misplaced .
Such taxes on imported goods increase their cost to consumers but offer no guarantees to workers who remain vulnerable to losing their jobs due to new technology or the company relocating offshore where labor is cheaper .
Corporations recognise only one imperative — to make profits for their big shareholders .
In the face of the escalating jobs losses , the current Victorian ALP government has been accused by the union movement of not having an industry plan .
However , although it wo n’t be admitting to it in public any time soon , the Victorian Labor Party government — and the Liberal opposition , for that matter — does have an industry plan .
It ’s a very clear and simple one .
Labor Premier John Brumby and his gang intend to keep shovelling taxpayers ’ money to the big end of town , no matter what — through outright handouts , tax breaks and a host of concessions .
This wo n’t do anything to save workers ’ jobs but it will keep the bosses happy .
Workers and trade unions need a totally different approach .
Working people are not responsible for the problems of the capitalist economy .
We want decent jobs , security , health and safety , and the futures of ourselves and our families protected — no matter what .
The so - called “ free market ” ca n’t and wo n’t do this — irrespective of how many handouts the corporations are given .
Only a revitalised and massively expanded public sector can create the hundreds of thousands of permanent , well - paid , secure jobs that are needed to give work to all who need it .
If the bosses want to close a factory or if it ’s really going broke , it should be taken into public ownership , reorganised and put to producing socially necessary things .
Conclusion
The nationalisation demand is not a panacea .
It is one element in our transitional program , but an extremely important one for the times in which we live .
Used intelligently , it can play an important role in the struggle .
It is impossible to put forward effective solutions to the many problems we face without incorporating this demand into our program of struggle .

“ In my basement I have a room pretty near full of stuff that I ’ve gotten at potlatches , ” he says .
“ We ’ll give some of it away again . ”
He plans to give cash and special gifts to some fellow chiefs , like the one who gave him a stereo system at a recent potlatch , but he does n’t plan to go into debt .
“ The thing is not to go overboard and buy really expensive gifts .
But enough to show people that you care for them and are thinking about them . ”
Control your animosity .
If your family ’s holiday exchanges have turned into warfare , do n’t give up hope .
Although one - upmanship is inherent in gift - giving , the history of the potlatch suggests that viciousness is not inevitable .
In the 19th - century potlatches , chiefs one - upped each other by cutting off a piece of an engraved copper shield and either throwing it into the fire or giving it to the other chief .
Because these “ coppers ” were a form of currency , it was a bit like cutting up $ 100 bills , except the coppers could be worth far more .
A 1934 textbook , “ Patterns of Culture , ” quotes a chief talking about a prized copper named Dandalayu :
“ Furthermore such is my pride that I will kill on this fire my copper Dandalayu , which is groaning in my house .
You all know how much I paid for it .
I bought it for 4,000 blankets .
Now I will break it in order to vanquish my rival .
I will make my house a fighting place for you , my tribe . ”
Today , though , potlatch scholars say that those extravagant copper fights were a historical anomaly caused by the arrival of white fur traders , which upended the Indians ’ social structure and created a class of nouveau riche leaders vying for prestige .
After that 19th - century economic boom passed , the potlatches became less ostentatious , and today the chiefs play up the cooperative aspects of the ceremonies .
Chief Cranmer and the other leaders in Alert Bay , his home on an island northwest of Vancouver , have toned down the hostility by agreeing not to break up coppers anymore .
Now that the bubble has burst on Wall Street ’s nouveau riche , maybe they will become less competitive .
Maybe .
But a little showing off is still fine .
Today ’s potlatchers still engage in some conspicuous destruction .
After the dancing was finished at a potlatch several years ago , the chief impressed the crowd by tossing the dancers ’ masks into the fire .
The tradition of pouring fish oil into the fire continues , although there are no longer carved figures called “ vomiters ” that spew a continuous flow .
Now that this eulachon oil costs $ 500 per gallon , potlatchers show more restraint .
Could this destructive tradition work elsewhere ?
The gratuitous burning of oil would be an environmental faux pas 
I ca n’t see many people proudly letting their SUVs idle during holiday feasts  but there ’s something to be said for this form of display : it lets you demonstrate your wealth without going shopping or inflicting more clutter on someone ’s else closets .
The ceremonial burning of a Santa Claus tie or “ World ’s Greatest Mom ” apron would send the same message  and would acquire even more meaning if the donor of the gift were present .

AUGUST was the best money - spinning month so far for the presidential candidates .
In that month both men beat their fund - raising records .
John McCain 's campaign , heartily boosted by Sarah Palin , brought in $ 47 m ; but Barack Obama raised $ 66 m , more in a single month than any candidate for political office in America 's history .
Mr Obama has helped to change the direction of corporate giving .
By late July , the political action committees of American companies had contributed almost $ 214 m to the Democrats and Republicans .
For the first time in over two decades , the cash was evenly divided : each party received roughly $ 107m .
Traditionally Democrats have always lagged in attracting money from business .
During the 1996 election cycle , for instance , Republicans received almost 73 % of corporate donations while Democrats received 27 % , according to the Federal Election Commission .
This uneven ratio persisted almost up to the present .
In the last presidential election , in 2004 , Republicans received close to 68 % of the money that businesses gave .
The new trend is not simply important for the war - chests of Democratic candidates .
It also suggests that corporations are betting on a Democratic victory in November .
The trend of giving to Democrats accelerated , and giving to Republicans declined , as soon as the Democrats won control of Congress in 2006 .
This year Democrats expect their congressional majorities to swell , and corporations may be positioning themselves for a long Democratic ascendancy .
But many corporations may also think that a Democrat will win the presidency , which could explain why corporate donations to the Democrats have risen so much .
Darrell West , a vice - president of the Brookings Institution , a think - tank , says that because many corporations anticipate a victory for Mr Obama , they consider their gifts to Democrats an investment in their company 's future .
Among the top contributors are sectors with special interests , including banks , telecoms companies and the health - care industry .
Corporations were conspicuous at the Democratic convention , which boasted 141 business sponsors .
According to the non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute , the Republican convention has announced only 91 sponsoring companies .
The Republicans may not yet have disclosed all their sponsors ; but nonetheless , so far , fat cats are contributing the Democrats ' way .
Manchester City 's wealthy Arab owners are determined to try to land a " world superstar " in the January transfer window and have drawn up a list of targets , headed by Kaka and Lionel Messi .
The other names that have been discussed are Fernando Torres , Carlos Tevez , Cristiano Ronaldo and Samuel Eto'o , with the Abu Dhabi United Group prepared to pay upwards of £ 70 m for a top - name signing to add to their British transfer record purchase of Robinho , for a fee of up to £ 34 m , on the final day of the summer transfer window .
Although it would appear almost impossible to prise any of the players away from their clubs , especially mid-season , City are determined to test the resolve with a world - record fee – beating the £ 48 m that Real Madrid paid Juventus for Zinedine Zidane in 2001 – in the hope that one of the big names will be signed .
It is part of a strategy that City 's owners have , after a series of discussions , decided to settle on to make a statement of intent in world football and to help the team to " kick on " in the second half of this season .
They believe that if they can sign Kaka or Messi then other big - name players will follow for football , as well as monetary , reasons .
A bid is also being weighed up for the Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and for Valencia 's David Villa but it appears that those two targets will wait until next summer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" They are going for a big player , " a source , who has been involved in the discussions , said yesterday .
" If they really want to be a big club and move to a new level they need to get a big player in and that would mean one of Kaka , Messi , Ronaldo or Tevez , because of his availability .
Unless a player like that can be signed then it will be a struggle and the sooner it is done the better , which means trying to do so in January .
Then others will follow . "
City are also likely to grant the wish of their manager , Mark Hughes , to try to acquire a few more modest names as he overhauls his squad .
Among those he has identified are Roque Santa Cruz , Wayne Bridge , Lassana Diarra and Benfica 's Luisao .
City are likely to be the busiest Premier League club during the January window because Abu Dhabi United had only one day , the last day of August , to enter the transfer market following their whirlwind purchase of the club last summer .
They signed Robinho under the noses of Chelsea and , although there was surprise at the fee paid , the owners are delighted with the contribution made by the Brazilian and the profile he has helped to give the club .
Robinho has also become an influential player off the field and it is understood that Hughes , who listens to the striker , has become more receptive to the idea of trying to acquire other big - name players .
On that final day in August names including Ronaldo and Torres were bandied about , as well as Villa and Dimitar Berbatov .
It then appeared City had cooled on the idea of trying to acquire superstars .
But a series of discussions have taken place , with the owners looking at how Chelsea , in the early years of Roman Abramovich 's purchase , went about acquiring lots of players – such as Juan Sebastian Veron , Hernan Crespo and Adrian Mutu – rather than concentrating on one or two superstars .
City believe that strategy has , ultimately , proved wasteful and sense they can make a bigger impact by signing a big name .
Top of the list is undoubtedly Kaka and his remarks last week , ahead of Milan 's Uefa Cup tie against Portsmouth , when he said he was flattered by City 's interest and that he had spoken to the club 's players Robinho and Elano about the Premier League , did not go unnoticed .
Then , when Hughes was asked about Kaka , he said : " It 's always interesting when top players talk about their situation .
Until something happens , though , we will have to wait and see .
These are exciting times here , anyway , and January is going to be a part of that . "
City certainly hope that an offer of around £ 70 m would be too good for Milan to refuse while if Kaka did move to Eastlands it would be another serious blow to Chelsea , who have long coveted the player , especially having already lost out on Robinho , whom the Stamford Bridge manager , Luiz Felipe Scolari , would still like to sign .
Messi would appear to be a far less likely acquisition , given that he is absolutely central to Barcelona 's plans and the success they are having , while City have pretty much ruled out an attempt to sign either Ronaldo or Tevez , even though the latter is still to sort out his future at Manchester United .
A move for Tevez would have a greater chance of succeeding in the summer , although it is thought that the Argentine will have signed permanently for United by then .
Torres is regarded as an interesting case .
Although the Spanish striker is understood to be happy at Liverpool and he would undoubtedly be the last player that their manager , Rafael Benitez , would want to sell , the finances of the club are such that a deal could be offered that Anfield 's American owners might find irresistible .
Even so , their standing with the supporters would plumb new depths if Torres were sold , no matter the price .
But it appears that City 's owners may be about to shake up the market .
Six shooters :
The big - name players coveted by Manchester City
Kaka
Has committed himself to Milan in the past , with Chelsea interested , but that resolve appears to be softening as Manchester City prepare a bid .
Despite his importance , the Italians may sell if the price is right .
Lionel Messi Regarded as the ultimate fantasy signing , the Argentine is of supreme importance to Barcelona , who would reject any bid .
Would be interesting , however , if City matched the buyout clause in his contract , which would be in excess of £ 100m .
Fernando Torres Happy at Liverpool and is understood not to have any desire to leave .
There has been interest in the past from Chelsea and City .
A bid of £ 70 m may , however , have Liverpool 's American owners twitching .
Cristiano Ronaldo
Although coveted by City 's owners , and a move for him has been discussed , he is regarded as a " no - no " for obvious reasons .
Carlos Tevez Similar to Ronaldo in that his present employers would bar any move .
But given his contract situation – a permanent deal has not yet been agreed – and his peripheral role this season , it can not be wholly discounted .
Samuel Eto'o
Fit and back in form – like Messi he has 14 goals already this season – the Cameroonian was linked with a move away from Barcelona in the summer , but no real interest materialised .
Could be different in January , however , and it would be interesting to see how his club react .
The best league in the world is back .

Volkswagen ’s 2009 Jetta TDI has been named as the ‘ Green Car of the Year ’ at the LA Auto Show on Thursday by the Green Card Journal .
Green Car Journal is a quarterly magazine and it covers developments in environmental friendly cars and fuel - efficiency .
The Journal said that it was the first time that the award was being given to a diesel vehicle .
Ron Cogan , the editor and publisher of the magazine , says : “ It indicates that clean diesel has arrived , as people have been hearing about this for years . ”
The Jetta TDI was debuted in LA a year back , and it covers 41 miles per gallon on the highway , the Environmental Protection Agency estimates .
A manufacturer ’s suggested retail price for the sedan is $ 21,990 , while a SportWagen version will be available starting at $ 23,590 .
Company ’s Chief Executive Stefan Jacoby says that the company is planning to increase production of the car .
“ The Jetta TDI is a real alternative to hybrids .
Diesel is being very much promoted in the United States .
It decreases fuel consumption as well as environmental friendly and a real fun to drive , ” he added .
Diesel vehicles are quite popular in European markets , but they are slow to catch on in the U.S. and it is somewhat due to hard emission requirements in some states like California .

NEW YORK ( JTA ) —
The securities fraud of Bernard Madoff has rocked the Jewish nonprofit world — and the worst may be yet to come .
Madoff , the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , was arrested Dec. 11 after admitting to his board that a hedge fund he ran was essentially a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
At least two foundations have been forced to close because they had invested their funds with Madoff .
The Robert I. Lappin Foundation in Salem , Mass. , announced Dec. 12 that it would shut down after losing $ 8 million — all of its money .
And the Chais Family Foundation , which gives out some $ 12.5 million each year to Jewish causes in Israel , the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , announced its closing Dec. 14 .
At least one nonprofit is calling out for help in the wake of Madoff ’s collapse .
The Gift of Life Foundation , a Jewish bone marrow registry that relied heavily on Madoff as a benefactor , announced on its Web site Sunday that it would immediately need to raise $ 1.8 million to make up for recent losses .
Sources close to Yeshiva University , where Madoff served as treasurer of the board of trustees and board chairman of the university ’s Sy Syms School of Business until he resigned last week , said the school has lost at least $ 100 million .
Y.U. officials declined to offer any specifics .
Just as the reverberations of the subprime mortgage collapse are still seen as contributing to the nation ’s wider economic meltdown , philanthropic insiders say the fallout from Madoff ’s scheme could be even greater .
The insiders note that Madoff and others heavily invested in his fraudulent fund were major supporters of a plethora of nonprofit organizations , served on their boards or advised those organizations on how to invest their money — in some cases placing large sums of the groups ’ capital in Madoff ’s hands .
Reflecting this sense that the full extent of the damage is still unclear , the executive vice president and CEO of the UJA - Federation of New York said that even though its endowments were not exposed , the organization still could be hurt if donors lost money in the scheme .
“ We do not yet know the full extent of the losses that supporters of UJA - Federation and other Jewish institutions have had , ” John Ruskay said .
“ But we have already heard that many major institutions had substantial funds invested , as did foundations .
Already in the context of a very challenging economic environment this will present another significant difficulty .
We do n’t know yet the extent of the wreckage . ”
Reports are trickling out in the national media about prominent businessmen from across the country who lost money in Madoff ’s scheme .
New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon , GMAC Financial Services chairman J. Ezra Merkin and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman all were reported to have taken significant hits due to their dealings with Madoff , who reportedly would not accept any investment in his fund below $ 10 million .
Reports have surfaced also that media magnate Mortimer Zuckerman was significantly hurt by investing with Madoff .
In Los Angeles , the Jewish Community Foundation ’s $ 238 million Common Investment Pool lost $ 18 million it had invested with Madoff , according to a letter sent out by the foundation .
Among other Jewish institutions and foundations believed to be hit by the Madoff scandal : the American Jewish Congress , the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology , Steven Spielberg ’s Wunderkinder Foundation , Elie Wiesel ’s Foundation for Humanity and Carl Shapiro ’s charitable foundation .
But Merkin , who last week told investors in his hedge fund , Ascot Partners , that all of their money had been defrauded by Madoff , is of particular interest to the Jewish community .
He has philanthropic ties to a number of Jewish organizations and institutions , serving as a volunteer investment adviser for many of them , including Yeshiva University .
Among other causes with which he is said to be connected are the SAR Academy , a Jewish day school in the Bronx , as well as State of Israel Bonds , The Jewish Campus Life Fund , Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center , the Ramaz School , Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun and the Fifth Avenue Synagogue .
Sources say that several of these entities had money in Ascot , which they now stand to lose because of Merkin ’s decision to invest so heavily in Madoff ’s fund .
According to Orthodox communal insiders , Ramaz and SAR lost millions between them .
A woman who answered the phone Sunday at one of Merkin ’s listed numbers suggested that he could be reached in the office Monday .
An official at one major Jewish foundation told JTA that it had been advised to invest with Madoff , but decided against it after concluding that his return - on - investment forecasts seemed too good to be true .
Certainly the extent of the damage to the philanthropic world could become clearer as details emerge in coming days and weeks of just who was invested with Madoff .
With each day since news of the fraud broke , new organizations and funders emerge as victims : Yad Sarah in Israel , the Maimonides school in Boston , Charles I. and Mary Kaplan Foundation in Rockville , Md. , the Julian J. Levitt Foundation , are among others to announce losses .
One philanthropic official said there is a lesson to be learned here for the philanthropy world , where Jewish businessmen and philanthropists directed their own private funds and the funds of institutions that they help oversee toward Madoff .
“ What really emerges out of this , ” said Jeffrey Solomon , the president of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies , is that “ people sometimes forget to conduct the due diligence when dealing with others with social prominence — and especially in the hedge - fund area where people think you have to be really smart to be in hedge funds .
In many ways for all investments something like this is tragic , but for nonprofits where boards have the fiduciary responsibility of acting with great prudence , it is even more tragic . ”
According to a fund - raiser who has been scouring recent 990 tax filings to see how this might affect his nonprofit , several other major philanthropists have put money in Madoff ’s hands :
As of the end of 2007 , Sandy Gottesman had $ 20 million of his foundation ’s $ 144 million invested with Madoff and Robert Beren had two foundations with more than that in endowments invested with Ascot.
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) says his foundation has about $ 15 million invested with Madoff .
Yeshiva University issued a statement via e-mail to JTA on Sunday .
“ We are shocked at this revelation , ” the university said .
“ Bernard Madoff has tendered his resignation from all positions affiliated with the university and involvement with the university .
Our lawyers and accountants are investigating all aspects of his relationship to Yeshiva University .
We reserve our comments until we complete our investigation . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. banking regulator unveiled a plan on Friday to prevent about 1.5 million foreclosures , breaking ranks with the Bush administration by demanding bailout funds be diverted from banks to consumers .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said the plan would modify millions of delinquent mortgages and the government would reward participating lenders by sharing the cost of defaults on restructured loans .
The dispute over housing policy during the administration ’s final weeks spilled into the public as a the President George W. Bush administration renewed its opposition to using money from the $ 700 billion bailout fund to support such a foreclosure - prevention program .
“ The FDIC proposal at the end of the day is a spending proposal , ” Treasury Interim Assistant Secretary Neel Kashkari told a Congressional hearing on Friday .
Kashkari said the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) , which the Treasury controls , was designed for making investments in the financial system , not giving aid .
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair spent weeks lobbying Bush administration officials to fund her plan through TARP before announcing the initiative .
“ I have never seen anything like this , ” said John Douglas , a former FDIC general counsel who is now a partner at law firm Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker .
“ This is extremely unusual for an agency to get out in front of the administration like this . ”
Viewed narrowly , Bair ’s responsibility is to protect the solvency of the nation ’s bank insurance fund -- the pot of money that is used to protect depositors if a bank fails .
Bair is taking an uncommonly broad view of her role and has become a consumer crusader through the housing crisis .
Douglas said that Bair does not have the power to unilaterally implement the foreclosure plan but that her approach is gaining currency .
“ She certainly has a lot of cover from Democrats and even some Republicans , ” he said .
REGULATORY TENSION
Kashkari said Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson thinks the FDIC proposal “ is a very interesting idea ” and urged Congress to consider drafting legislation to create such a program . [ n N14430931 ]
The White House said it is carefully reviewing the FDIC plan , but that it has to think about its potential cost .
The FDIC said its plan would cost the government about $ 24.4 billion , which could be paid from the TARP .
Most of the money from an initial disbursement in that program has been injected as capital into banks .
The FDIC issued the proposal two days after Paulson publicly dismissed the idea .
Leading Democratic lawmakers have rallied behind Bair , a Republican , and have even pushed for her to have a place in Democratic president - elect Barack Obama ’s administration .
The FDIC pushed forward with its plan , posting it on the agency 's Web site on Friday morning ( here ) .
“ Although foreclosures are costly to lenders , borrowers and communities , the pace of loan modifications continues to be extremely slow , ” the FDIC said .
Still , Douglas said , Bair ’s bold plan might obscure the fact that modifying mortgages is a complicated business .
Litton Loan Servicing , one of the nation ’s largest servicers for subrime loans , has found that more than one in four home loans that go into foreclosure have already been abandoned by the borrower .
“ Many times these homeowners did not respond to loan modification offers and have simply walked away from their homes , ” Larry Litton , Jr. , the company ’s president , told a Congressional panel on Friday .
“ This sort of approach can create all sorts of incentives for people to change their behavior and look at their mortgages differently , ” Douglas said of Bair ’s proposal .
Eligible borrowers would include those who have missed at least two monthly payments on loans for homes they live in .
Lenders would be expected to lower those borrowers ’ monthly payments to about 31 percent of the borrowers ’ monthly income .
The plan is modeled on the FDIC ’s program to modify distressed mortgages at failed lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc , which the agency seized in July .
The federal government has laid out a number of plans in recent months to try to help distressed homeowners , the latest of which came earlier this week .
On Monday , the federal overseer of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said the companies ’ struggling borrowers can apply to have their mortgage payments lowered to 38 percent of their income .
The FDIC has said those industry - led efforts have not gone far enough , and that $ 24 billion in federal money should be spent on the mortgage guarantee program .
Professor McGann said such research organizations all shared the problem of maintaining independence from donors .
But , he said , Mr. Podesta ’s may be less susceptible to conflicts of interest than those financed primarily by a single patron .

“ When there is a range of funders , ” he said , “ even if they are all left of center , ” the beneficiary is not “ beholden to any one of them or any single group . ”
Mr. Podesta did not respond to an interview request made through Ms. Palmieri .
But she emphasized that he had set up the Center for American Progress in a way to keep it at arm ’s length from its patrons .
“ You want to be careful that you are able to maintain autonomy in your work , ” she said .
“ So our donors and our board members do n’t direct policy projects or weigh in on our policy positions .
And we do n’t accept donations for directed work ”  that is , work in which donors want their money used to study a specific issue .
After the Clinton administration , Mr. Podesta initially worked as a lobbyist , taking on clients like the Nevada Resort Association and the American Insurance Association .
But after the Republican sweep in the 2002 midterm elections , he decided to focus on helping Democrats rebuild .
He observed that a leading source of the Republicans ’ success was their superior intellectual infrastructure : institutions outside government that helped develop and communicate pragmatic conservative ideas , even when the party was not in power .
Mr. Podesta focused on building a liberal counterweight to the conservative Heritage Foundation , a well - financed group that has funneled experts into government positions and produces readable policy reports for Congress .
That counterweight became the Center for American Progress .
During the debate last night , Senator McCain repeatedly talked directly to some magical blue collar hero named Joe the Plumber .
If this " Joe the Plumber " bullshit had any resonance ( beyond with pundits who assume viewers and voters are so much dumber than them ) it was probably tossed out the window once McCain said " hey Joe , you 're rich .
Congratulations . "
He said like at least twice , did n't he ?
( McCain always repeats his practiced zingers , which is a terrible habit . )
Of course only in Matt Drudge 's wet dreams did Joe the Plumber resonate with Ohio swing voters to begin with .
He 's a plumber , sure , respectable blue collar work .
But honestly , right now , in this climate , how many voters exactly personally relate to a guy who 's planning on buying a business ?
Oh no , Senator Obama might stop
Pete the Locksmith from flipping his house and buying that Land Rover !
And that was before it was revealed that Joe the Plumber might be a Republican plant !
This Joe " the Plumber " Wurzelbacher already talks like a GOP pundit ( he 's got the accidental casual racism down ! ) , and his aw shucks willingness to repeat ancient class war talking points to every camera in sight is actually a bit suspicious for a random voter , but the most important thing about Joe Wurzelbacher is his last name : it 's the same as the last name of Charles Keating 's son - in - law !
Keating 's son- in - law , Robert Wurzelbacher , served a 40 - month prison sentence in 1993 in connection with Keating 's Lincoln Savings and Loan collapse .
Since then , who knows what he 's been up to , but there is a Robert Wurzelbacher who lives just outside of Cincinnati , owns a wood company , and donates to Republicans .
Meanwhile there is a Joseph Wurzelbacher who owns a painting company in Cincinnati !
Along with a septic tank repair company !
These dots were all connected by a DailyKos diarist , who has no proof that Joe and Robert Wurzelbacher are related , but , you know , it 's suspicious .
The Wurzelbvacher connection was also made , amusingly , by this right - wing satirical blogger .
But regardless of whether Joe the Plumber is a Republican plant or not , one thing is for certain : he 's not actually voting for McCain .
Because the asshole is n't actually registered .
Update : Joe the Plumber does n't pay taxes .
At all .
He is registered to vote though !
But if there 's a typo in his registration , which seems possible , his provisional ballot will probably be thrown away .
Hah .
A MAN died of a heart attack after being repeatedly shot with a Taser in one of the first uses of the weapon in NSW , but police omitted it from official records , including on the man 's death certificate .
Gary Pearce , a violent , mentally - ill 56 - year - old , died about two weeks after being shot with a stun gun when he threatened police with a frying pan in May 2002 .
The link between his death and his being shot by a Taser could have been used as evidence of the risks of the controversial weapon , but was only made public by the NSW Ombudsman on Tuesday .
The Police Commissioner , Andrew Scipione , yesterday admitted he only learned of the Taser link on Tuesday night , when he was given a copy of a scathing report by the Ombudsman , Bruce Barbour , into the use of stun guns .
The revelation comes on the back of a growing body of international research that draws links between the weapon and a series of deaths .
The trailer for Fanboys .
It 's 1998 and Star Wars fanboys across the globe eagerly await the release of Episode I . But for Eric , Linus , Hutch and Windows the term " fanboy " is more than just a title , it 's a badge of honor .
Spurred by impatience and an undying loyalty to their cause , these former high school friends reunite to undertake the road trip of their fan - tasies .
Traveling
West across the country to visit their Mecca - George Lucas ' Skywalker Ranch - the plan is to break in , steal the film and stake their claim as the first fanboys in history to watch it .
But to secure their place in the fanboy hall of fame , they 'll have to contend with bizarre bikers , a crazy pimp , a deranged group of trekkies and the quiet intensity of William Shatner .
The coffee shop in the film is called Java the Hut which is a play on the name Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars .
Although Fanboys references Star Wars often , this is also a reference to Kristen Bell ’s beloved show Veronica Mars as it was the name of the coffee shop Veronica Worked .
One of the early promotional posters read , “ Coming to a Galaxy in 2007 ” but the film was not released until February 8th .
2009 .
It was filmed three years earlier in early 2006 .
Fanboy actors Seth Rogen , Jay Baruchel , Danny McBride , and Craig Robinson are also all in the film This is the End .
The actors have all worked with each other multiple times .
Jorge Garcia was originally going to play Harry Knowles , but filming for Lost kept him from doing it .
Kevin Smith was then going to play Knowles and was excited to do so , but the editing for Clerks 2 caused him to turn down the role at the last minute .
Ethan Suplee filled in the last minute .
As an admitted nerd , the trailer for Fanboys is everything I want and more in a comedy .
The group of fanboys which includes the always delightful Jay Baruchel , Sam Huntington , Chris Marquette , and Dan Fogler who are all familiar and likable actors .
Kristen Bell is the Fangirl in the film and she is adorable with her black hair and glasses , making her look less like Veronica Mars and more like Velma Dinkley .
The plot of the film takes the idea of the heist movie but makes their target the Skywalker Ranch , because what would be more valuable to a bunch of fanboys than George Lucas ’s secret lair ?
The trailer for Fanboys has a lot of energy and is targeted for a specific group of people but appears to also be able to cast a wider net with its charm and talented cast .
The trailer also earns extra points for introducing Princess Leia , Jay , the hot chick from Sin City , Captain James T. Kirk , and Kevin Smith as the “ Guy from Die Hard 4 ” , among others .
It may actually be the best cast introduction in a movie trailer .
Whether you are a fanboy , fangirl , fanperson , or just someone who is open to watching a comedy about them , the Fanboys trailer promises a great time .
Keith Olbermann comments on GOP attempts to suppress votes by attacking ACORN
In 2008 , faced with a groundswell of public opinion that should deliver a landslide of disapproval for the Republican party and send it into the political wilderness for years , the poor losers of the GOP are more than ready to prevent that end by any means .
Few , if any , of the tactics it is using are illegal - often the result of careful legislation designed to preserve the Republican majority forever - but added together they comprise an assault on democracy which would stun even the cynical and sly politicians of Old Europe .
In state after state , Republican operatives — the party 's elite commandos of bare - knuckle politics — are wielding new federal legislation to systematically disenfranchise Democrats .
If this year 's race is as close as the past two elections , the GOP 's nationwide campaign could be large enough to determine the presidency in November .
" I do n't think the Democrats get it , " says John Boyd , a voting - rights attorney in Albuquerque who has taken on the Republican Party for impeding access to the ballot .
" All these new rules and games are turning voting into an obstacle course that could flip the vote to the GOP in half a dozen states . "
The GOP and the McCain campaign have been trying to drum up a Bradley Effect , with campaign and party apparatchiks trotting out racist whistles against Obama ( and by extension against the party he now leads ) at every opportunity while party leaders pretend to be oblivious and unknowing .
McCain , Palin and the GOP's Congressional leaders would condemn any overt racism , of course , and attribute it to some bad apples - but they seem remarkably dense in not spotting anything other than utter hate speech racism from their followers ( or the candidate himself ) when it occurs .
The merest veil of deniability conceals their deliberately looking the other way while their supporters run riot .
Nor have their smears stopped at racism .
Calling Obama and Dems in general traitors , terrorist abettors , " feminazis " and ( oh , horrors ) socialists has become a substitute for debating issues .
( Actually , Obama 's just echoing Lincoln . )
From an early stage , the GOP knew it was going to run on personality smears as a substitute for facts .
Again , much of the groundswell of hate on the Right is implausibly deniable by the leadership , but since any media attention only fuels their base 's paranoia and engenders new smear attacks , " implausible " is all they need to keep the ball rolling independently .
But even all that is n't sufficient to either cage the vote or at least to provide plenty of excuses to keep Republican leaders in charge of their party after the elections .
So we now have the ACORN faux - scandal , which John McCain has hyperbolically called ' an assault on democracy " and which seeks to provide a ready - made narrative for de-legitimizing the election .
It also serves , through the time - honored tactic of calling your opponents out for what you yourself are doing , to conceal very real Republcan voter registration fraud - not just individuals cooking up daft names to register as a way of getting paid for no work but a concerted effort to cook the books by making Republican support seem stronger than it really is .
Voters contacted by The Times said they were tricked into switching parties while signing what they believed were petitions for tougher penalties against child molesters .
Some said they were told that they had to become Republicans to sign the petition , contrary to California initiative law .
Others had no idea their registration was being changed .
I am not a Republican , " insisted Karen Ashcraft , 47 , a pet-clinic manager and former Democrat from Ventura who said she was duped by a signature gatherer into joining the GOP .
" I certainly . . . wo n't sign anything in front of a grocery store ever again . "
It is a bait - and - switch scheme familiar to election experts .
The firm hired by the California Republican Party -- a small company called Young Political Majors , or YPM , which operates in several states -- has been accused of using the tactic across the country .
...
The 70,000 voters YPM has registered for the Republican Party this year will help combat the public perception that it is struggling amid Democratic gains nationally , give a boost to fundraising efforts and bolster member support for party leaders , political strategists from both parties say .
Those who were formerly Democrats may stop receiving phone calls and literature from that party , perhaps affecting its get - out - the - vote efforts .
They also will be given only a Republican ballot in the next primary election if they do not switch their registration back before then .
Some also report having their registration status changed to absentee without their permission ; if they show up at the polls without a ballot they may be unable to vote .
The guy behind that particular bit of skullduggery , Mark Anthony Jacoby , who owns the firm known as Young Political Majors , was arrested Saturday for vote fraud in 2006 and 2007 .
And , of course , we still have that mysterious glitch in electronic voting machines - the one that only ever seems to work in favor of Republican candidates - in places like West Virginia .
Virginia Matheney and Calvin Thomas said touch - screen machines in the county clerk 's office in Ripley kept switching their votes from Democratic to Republican candidates .
" When I touched the screen for Barack Obama , the check mark moved from his box to the box indicating a vote for John McCain , " said Matheney , who lives in Kenna .
When she reported the problem , she said , the poll worker in charge " responded that everything was all right .
It was just that the screen was sensitive and I was touching the screen too hard .
She instructed me to use only my fingernail . "
Even after she began using her fingernail , Matheney said , the problem persisted .
When she tried to vote for candidates running for two open seats on the Supreme Court , the electronic machine canceled her second vote twice .
On her third try , Matheney managed to cast votes for both Menis Ketchum and Margaret Workman , Democratic candidates for the two open seats .
Calvin Thomas , 81 , who retired from Kaiser Aluminum in Ravenswood in 1983 and now lives in Ripley , experienced the same problem .
" When I pushed Obama , it jumped to McCain .
When I went down to governor 's office and punched [ Gov. Joe ] Manchin , it went to the other dude .
When I went to Karen Facemyer [ the incumbent Republican state senator ] , I pushed the Democrat , but it jumped again .
" The rest of them were OK , but the machine sent my votes for those top three offices from the Democrat to the Republican , " Thomas said .
Thomas , who brought his daughter with him to the polls , said she had the same problem .
" After I finished , my daughter voted .
When she pushed Obama , it went to McCain .
It has often been said that , to prevent such " glitches " having an effect , Obama has to not just win but win handily .
That 's inconvenient to network bosses who are already wondering how they 'll fill election evening coverage if it's all decided by teatime .
John McCain has assured Chris Wallace today that there will be a full election night to cover and some polls seem to help his case for that ( and , obviously , influence voter 's perceptions ) - even while others do n't .
But at the end of the day the GOP is prepared even for a Democratic landslide .
They 'll just package up all the hate , all the smears , all the Alien Nation rhetoric and throw caution to the wind .
Back to Bilmon ( h/t Ron ) :
We do n't need to hark back to the unfortunate history of a certain Central European country in the 1930s to understand how poisonous this kind of political myth making can become .
Powerful elements of the Republican Party and the conservative " movement " are n't just preparing themselves to go into opposition , they 're preparing themselves to dispute the legitimacy of an Obama presidency -- in ways that could , if taken to extreme , lead to another Oklahoma City .
It 's hard to tell to what degree the GOP high command fully understands or is trying to feed these dynamics ( indeed , it 's becoming increasingly difficult to even tell who the GOP high command is these days ) .
The last thing I want to do is get into an arms race with the wingnut right when it comes to paranoid conspiracy theories .
( That 's one race the left will always lose ) .
Still , the recent statements of John McCain and his Bircher - influenced running mate are n't exactly reassuring :
My opponent 's answer showed that economic recovery is n't even his top priority .
His goal , as Senator Obama put it , is to " spread the wealth around . "
You see , he believes in redistributing wealth , not in policies that help us all make more of it .
Joe , in his plainspoken way , said this sounded a lot like socialism .
I 've been following politics for going on 35 years now , and I do n't think I 've ever heard a Republican candidate publicly refer to his Democratic opponent as a " socialist " -- not even while hiding behind a cardboard cutout like " Joe the Plumber " .
This from a man who told the entire nation on Wednesday night that believes an obscure nonprofit group is " perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . "
Likewise , I do n't think there 's ever been an American vice presidential candidate who explicitly referred to entire regions of the United States as " pro-American " -- with the clear implication that other regions are something less than " pro-American . "
Not since the Civil War , anyway .
We 've crossed some more lines , in other words -- in a long series of lines that have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between the ultraconservative wing of the Republican Party and an explicitly fascist political movement .
And John McCain and his political handlers appear to have no moral compunctions whatsoever about whipping this movement into a frenzy and providing it with scapegoats for all that hatred , simply to try to shave a few points off Barack Obama 's lead in the polls .
To call this " country first " only works if you assume your opponents ( and scapegoats ) are not really part of that same country .
And we all know where that leads .
Yes , we do .
And the extreme Right has been happily contemplating violent resistance or even a coup to defend themselves from what they see as a hostile and un-American Democratic takeover for years now .
They even write books about it .
Originally posted in a different form at Newshoggers
Liberty magazine , a publication of the Seventh - Day Adventist church , has recently published “ Faith Attack “ , a polemic by Clifford Goldstein against the New Atheists .
The entire article is little more than repetition of the modern equivalent of the medieval blood libel : that atheists like Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett want to take over the world and outlaw religion .
I ’ll offer some more specific criticisms , but what should be noted is that Goldstein presents no evidence whatsoever that this is in fact what atheists want .
He tries to gloss over this point by calling such tyranny the “ logical outgrowth ” of our views – as if criticizing a belief was equivalent to wanting to ban that belief – but offers nothing more in the way of substantiation .
In The New Republic , author Damon Linker expressed concern about what he called the “ illiberal ” and “ brutally intolerant ” proselytism of the new atheists .
Among them are ideas that , if taken to their logical conclusion , would wreak havoc on the free exercise of religion .
Since , again , no examples are presented to demonstrate the point , there ’s nothing of substance to refute here .
Again , we merely see Goldstein insinuate that this is the “ logical conclusion ” of atheist activism , which is like saying that the logical conclusion of pro-literacy efforts is the rounding up and mass slaughter of everyone who does n’t know how to read .
The new atheists want to defeat and eradicate beliefs , not people !
As far as Linker ’s criticism , this snippet does n’t explain what he finds so troubling about atheist broadsides , so it serves little purpose other than as an echo .
I ’ll note only that , for many religious believers , “ tolerance ” and “ respect ” are code words for submission , and attack labels like “ intolerant ” are used against anyone who does not genuflect to their beliefs and treat them with deference they have not earned .
The comparison with [ Madalyn Murray ] O’Hair — for decades the ultra-nasty den mother of American atheism — is n’t , however , limited merely to the intellectual paucity of their apologetics .
O’Hair did n’t just attack religion as religion ; she went after practice and expression as well .
Whatever one can say about the tone O’Hair chose to take , there ’s one thing that needs to be remembered , and that this article tries hard to forget .
The way Goldstein depicts it , O’Hair was the oppressor and religious believers the oppressed , when in fact the reverse was true .
The case at issue in her most famous lawsuit , Murray v. Curlett , was whether school officials and lawmakers could institute mandatory Bible readings and prayers in public school .
One would think a magazine purportedly founded to defend religious liberty would be on O’Hair ’s side in this .
Perhaps they only support the fight for religious liberty when it ’s being waged by the right people .
Next , some predictable inanities about Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins :
But Harris is promoting an assault not just on action , not just on speech , but on belief itself .
Who would have thought that Orwellian “ Thoughtcrime ” would be taken out of the realm of political satire and promoted by someone deemed liberal , or progressive ?
Apparently Liberty ‘s editors hold the bizarre notion that people ’s thoughts are sacrosanct and no one can ever be justly punished for what they merely believe .
In the real world , we routinely punish people who hold and intend to act on certain thoughts ; this is the crime called “ conspiracy ” .
Intent to do harm and violence is a crime , and it is an actual crime , not a thought crime .
In context , this is clearly Sam Harris ’ point .
Certain bizarre views can , at times , get special protection under the principles of free exercise jurisprudence , but that ’s part of what religious freedom costs .
That Dr. Dawkins — who is opposed to all religious belief — finds that too costly proves only the shallowness of his worldview .
Despite their insulting rhetoric , in this passage Liberty has completely conceded our point : that religious beliefs get not equal protection , but “ special protection ” – additional privileges not available to other groups or belief systems .
And I agree : this is too costly .
Religious believers and churches should have the same rights as every other individual or organization ; no more , no less .
They should not be exempt from any generally applicable law .
They should not have any freedom or privilege that is not also available to nonbelievers .
When the laws are written to accommodate irrationality , it is all the rest of society that pays the price .
Next , Liberty adopts the language used by the atheists which they decried as “ brutally intolerant ” a few paragraphs above ;
The new atheists , then , would teach their children — what ?
That we ’re created by chance , with no ultimate purpose or destiny , and that more conscious thought went into someone spray painting graffiti on a wall than went into our existence ?…
Child abuse , Dr. Dawkins , can come in myriad forms .
This is the same article that , in its introduction , fearfully fretted that “ parents could be charged with ‘ child abuse ’ for giving their offspring a religious education ” .
Since they appear to have an identical proposal with regard to atheism , should we conclude that the author is actually engaging in projection and accusing atheists of what he himself wants to do ?
Why could one not conclude , after reading this passage , that Liberty ‘s editors want to ban atheism and then berate them for their advocacy of oppression and thoughtcrime ?
And finally :
Their most damaging impact might be , instead , the fertile fodder they provide the Christian Right , long trying to convince the flock that their religion is under attack by secular elites and that the only way to protect themselves is for Christians to gain the reins of political power .
Dominionist Christians have been trying to seize the reins of political power for a long time , and they needed no atheists to help them .
They were around , and had the same goals , long before there was ever an atheist movement to speak of .
What ’s different is that now there is an opposition to them – a forceful and effective opposition , one that does n’t stop at tepid platitudes but goes further to attack dangerous , irrational faith at its root .
The religious right does not want compromise .
In fact , they violently spurn compromise .
They have said so themselves , many times , and they are still saying so .
Their goal is a world run by them and ruled according to their specific conception of God ’s will , and they are not going to shake hands and settle for something less if only we approach them in respect and good faith .
On the contrary , they view any retreat or concession as simply an invitation to push for more .
I have a message for Clifford Goldstein and Liberty magazine :
If you ’re truly concerned about freedom of expression , why do you obsess on the entirely hypothetical scenario of atheists taking away your right to speak , when large , militant religious groups are right now attempting to stifle and outlaw criticism ?
At the U.N. , 56 Islamic nations are pushing through resolutions to combat “ defamation ” of religion .
In Russia , Christian evangelical groups , with assistance from state prosecutors , are pressing to ban TV shows that “ insult the feelings ” of believers .
Even in the U.K. , Christian complainers are trying to bring back blasphemy prosecutions .
These are the real enemies of free speech – not atheists , but crusading religious believers .
They , not we , are the ones who want to outlaw criticism and satire and take away the right of dissenters to speak their minds .
They , not we , are the ones waging war against the liberties we hold dear .
Netflix is exiting the previously - viewed DVD market .
In a blog post yesterday , the company said it would stop selling DVDs to its members as of November 30 to focus on DVD rentals and streaming video .
" Our core business is delivering great movie rentals to you on DVD by mail and instantly to the computer and TV , " a Netflix representative says in the post .
" So we 've decided it makes sense for us to focus exclusively on that . "
According to comments on the blog post , some members are unhappy about the decision , and many are concerned that Netflix will eventually get out of the disc business entirely -- even for rentals .
Netflix 's streaming service already is popular with PC users , and just last week , Netflix expanded that streaming service to Mac users .
Still , despite a bigger push into the streaming market and the service 's rising popularity , it seems very unlikely that Netflix would give up on its physical disc rental service anytime soon .
This is especially true given recent statements by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings about the importance of Blu-ray to the company 's future .
So where are all those used DVDs going if they 're not being sold to members ?
Netflix seems to be selling the used discs to wholesalers who then re-sell them .
In fact , there are reports that used Netflix DVDs are already showing up on New York City street corners .
So after November 30 , you might want to consider a trip to the Big Apple to satisfy your need for cheap and legal discs .
Detective Sergeant Flynn said US authorities were waiting to receive a green light from the Queensland Department of Public Prosecutions to take Watson into custody in Helena , ahead of a potential extradition battle in the US courts .
" They are doing everything they need to do as far as dotting the i's and crossing the t's so to speak , " Flynn said .
" Basically as soon as the paperwork gets drawn up and sent over through Interpol , then we will work with the ( US ) Department of Justice to handle it on our end . "
Watson and Tina married in Birmingham , Alabama , on October 11 , 2003 and travelled to Australia for their honeymoon .
Tina died during a diving expedition with her husband off the Queensland coast 11 days after the wedding .
One theory presented at the coronial inquest was that Watson turned off his wife 's air supply , restrained her underwater , and then turned it back on when she was dead or nearly dead .
The case has received plenty of media attention in the US , including an investigation by NBC TV current affairs program Dateline .
It took another sensational turn when Detective Sergeant Flynn videotaped Watson using a bolt - cutter to remove flowers laid at Tina 's grave by her mourning parents .
The detective staked out the Alabama cemetery for two days with a camera to discover who was tossing the flowers away .
" Just when you think it 's not going to get more bizarre or take a turn for the more macabre , it tends to , " Flynn said .
" Her dad said 'ever since we buried her we had flowers turn up missing .
What can we do ? '.
" Never in all my years have I heard of flowers turning up missing in a cemetery .
" So we decided to set up some surveillance on the grave to see who it was and lo and behold , there he ( Watson ) came . "

What would Christmas be without warnings of the secular crusade to destroy it ?
Thanks to the fulminations of cable news cranks and evangelical moralists , the War on Christmas has become an annual outrage .
The story typically goes as follows : secular elements have intimidated stores into replacing the phrase “ Merry Christmas ” with “ Happy Holidays ; ” nativity scenes have been removed from public spaces under threat of ACLU lawsuits ; a decadent culture is moving ever closer to eradicating Christian morality ; and America slouches towards Gomorrah .
Judging from the panicked tone of movement conservatives , this year ’s War on Christmas campaign threatens the country ’s moral fiber more than ever .
According to The Wall Street Journal ’s Daniel Henninger , the secular Grinch has claimed the economy as its latest casualty .
“ A nation whose people can't say ' Merry Christmas ' is a nation capable of ruining its own economy , ” he fumed on November 20 .
Having laid off 20 percent of its staff the day after Election Day , Christian right mega-ministry Focus on the Family declared “ Merry Tossmas ” imploring its supporters to toss out holiday season product catalogs that wish shoppers “ Happy Holidays . ”
( The 201 freshly unemployed staffers might have more practical reasons to trash their catalogs . )
“ If you can get religion out , ” Bill O’Reilly warned , “ then you can pass secular progressive programs , like legalization of narcotics , euthanasia , abortion at will , gay marriage . ”
On December 2 , Utah Republican state senator Chris Buttars sponsored an urgent resolution demanding that stores greet shoppers with the phrase , “ Merry Christmas . ”
“ I 'm sick of the Christmas wars , ” Buttars proclaimed .
“ We 're a Christian nation and ought to use the word . ”
The Christmas kulturkampf is a growth industry in a shrinking economy , providing an effective boost for conservative fundraising and a ratings bonanza for right - wing media .
So who was the genius that created it ?
To find the answer , a visit with the ghost of conservatism ’s past is in order .
Back during the culture wars of the 1990s , Peter Brimelow , then a Fortune magazine editor , grew incensed with the increasing use of the phrase “ Happy Holidays ” by retailers like Amazon.com .
“ I just got real interested in the issue , ” Brimelow told The Daily Beast , “ because I noticed over the years there was this social shift taking place where people no longer said ‘ Merry Christmas . ’ ”
In his 1995 book , Alien Nation , Brimelow argued that the influx of “ weird aliens with dubious habits ” from developing nations was eroding America ’s white Christian “ ethnic core , ” and in turn , sullying its cultural underpinnings .
The War on Christmas was , in his view , a particularly pernicious iteration of the multicultural “ struggle to abolish America . ”
Brimelow went to his fellow Briton and Tory , John O’Sullivan , then editor of the conservative movement ’s flagship publication , National Review , with a big idea .
National Review should host “ an annual competition for the most egregious attempt to suppress Christmas . ”
Though O’Sullivan liked Brimelow ’s idea , he was replaced as editor on Christmas Eve 1997 by Rich Lowry .
With the exception of a 2001 column in which O’Sullivan blamed “ religious minorities ” for the War on Christmas , the issue disappeared from the pages of National Review .
At the same time , the magazine jettisoned O’Sullivan ’s anti-immigration politics in favor of the Big Tent conservatism preferred by younger writers like Jonah Goldberg and Ramesh Ponurru .
The shift at National Review forced Brimelow even further into the political wilderness .
Shunned by conservatives there rankled by his unabashed racial resentment — Goldberg belittled him in a 2002 column as a “ once respected conservative voice ” — Brimelow founded what would become the internet ’s leading anti-immigration web journal , VDare.com , named for the first British child born in the Americas .
Brimelow ’s new venture provided a forum to allies like Jared Taylor , a white supremacist publisher , and Kevin MacDonald , an evolutionary psychology professor who has argued that Jews are genetically equipped to out - compete Gentiles for resources and power .
In 2003 , four years after VDare ’s founding , the Southern Poverty Law Center classified the journal as a “ hate group . ”
VDare became the staging ground for the War on the War on Christmas .
Unlike their more respectable counterparts , Brimelow ’s writers dared to name the true anti-Christian Grinch : Jews .
The winner of Brimelow ’s 2001 War on Christmas competition , a “ paleoconservative ” writer named Tom Piatak , insisted that those behind the assault on Christmas “ evidently prefer ” Hanukkah , which he called the “ Jewish Kwanzaa , ” a “ faux - Christmas . ”
“ Teaching children about Hanukkah , rather than the beliefs that actually sustained Jews on their sometimes tragic and tumultuous historical journey , ” Piatak fumed , “ inculcates negative lessons about Christianity , not positive ones about Judaism . ”
VDare ’s 2005 War on Christmas winner , Steve Sailer , a Eugenics enthusiast and author of the new biography of Barack Obama , America ’s Half - Blood Prince , picked up where Piatak left off .
“ American Jews , ” Sailer wrote , “ those exemplars of successful assimilation now seem to be de-assimilating emotionally , becoming increasingly resentful , at this late date , of their fellow Americans for celebrating Christmas . ”
Sailer went on to quote at length from a column by the purportedly Jewish writer , Bert Prelutsky , called “ The Jewish Grinch Who Stole Christmas . ”
Brimelow was ambivalent when I asked him about Sailer ’s theory on Jewish de-assimilation .
“ It ’s an argument , ” was all he would say .
Following the invasion of Iraq , George W. Bush ’s re-election , and the Republican sweep of Congress , Brimelow said conservative movement elites could no longer ignore the right - wing populism sweeping the nation .
Suddenly the War on Christmas was gaining traction .
“ This issue became very popular in the conservative grassroots , so conservative media had to pay concession to it , ” he said .
By 2005 , Fox News personalities Bill O’Reilly and John Gibson were dedicating entire shows to the War on Christmas .
While their rants were directed at “ secular progressives , ” they echoed the arguments of Brimelow ’s allies .
“ It ’s all part of the secular progressive agenda , ” O’Reilly grumbled .
“ If you can get religion out , then you can pass secular progressive programs , like legalization of narcotics , euthanasia , abortion at will , gay marriage . ”
National Review ’s website jumped back on the bandwagon , beginning with editor Kathryn Jean Lopez ’s promotion of Gibson ’s bestselling 2005 polemic , The War on Christmas : How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought .
Of the conservatives who once dismissed his Christmas crusade , Brimelow remarked with a self - satisfied chuckle , “ They went over to the dark side . ”
From its origins in Brimelow ’s website and fevered imagination to its popularization by the conservative media , the War on Christmas has become an institution .
And the rest is holiday cheer .

DECEMBER 17-- What makes a good photograph ?
A compelling subject , proper lighting , and exquisite composition would certainly be components .
But what makes a good mug shot ?
A compelling subject , of course .
And a cow costume never hurts .
On these pages you 'll find the 2008 Mug Shots of the Year , 20 booking photos selected from among the tens of thousands reviewed this year by TSG 's staff ( all three of us ) .
While most of the images speak for themselves , on some pages you 'll find links to stories providing additional details about the arrestees .
As seen here , the list , arranged in descending order , kicks off with an unruly Jersey girl who got bounced from a Shore bar and then kicked , punched , and bit some cops .
And befitting a year marked by a historic presidential election , the list reaches its apex with a group of suspects busted in the act of advocating change .
( 20 pages )
“ How we gonna make this shit funny ? ” Jon Stewart plaintively asked last night on The Daily Show , in the middle of a series of lukewarm bits about Barack Obama ’s historic presidential victory .
And it ’s a good question .
During Tuesday ’s Election Night special , Stewart ’s Daily Show correspondents gathered around to weep for the end of the election .
“ We ’ve been on the campaign trail for two years , ” Jason Jones cried .
“ What do we cover now ? ”
It was a funny bit , but we think the correspondents were asking the wrong question .
The end of the election campaign wo n’t doom The Daily Show .
The Barack Obama presidency just might .
It ’s no secret that plenty of satirical outlets — Saturday Night Live , the Onion , late - night talk shows — have had trouble finding good Obama jokes .
But we ’re not forecasting their doom .
The Daily Show is unique , though , in its audience and in its comedic approach , and we ’re very worried that an Obama presidency might send Jon Stewart ’s show speedily on the road to obsolescence .
Why ?
First of all , in one eventful day , the prototypical Daily Show viewer has been transformed :
Once disaffected and angry at Washington ’s power structure , he ’s now delighted and hopeful about the new president and all that he symbolizes .
And if you ’re an Obama fan — eager to give Barack the benefit of the doubt , and proud and excited about the change you ’ve helped bring the nation — do you really want Jon Stewart sitting on the sidelines , taking potshots at your hero ?
Beyond the problem of audiences souring on Obama jokes is the question of whether Jon Stewart even wants to make Obama jokes .
Of course , The Daily Show has found ways to goof on the Obama campaign , but it ’s no secret that Stewart and his writing staff lean leftward .
And The Daily Show differs from nearly all other popular political satire in that the show ’s strength is in its writers ’ outrage and anger at the powers that be .
Stewart memorably described the show ’s writing process to Michiko Kakutani as a bunch of “ curmudgeons ” writing about the things that upset them the most .
If President Obama ’s administration is the love - in that progressives hope it will be , we think it ’s awfully unlikely Stewart ’s heart will be in Obama - bashing .
The guy teared up at eleven on Election Night !
Not that we did n’t , but still .
So let ’s say that Stewart ’s half - hearted Obama gags just keep on flopping on The Daily Show .
( “ Your William Ayers joke bombed , ” a sage Chris Wallace observed on last night ’s episode . )
With Bush and Cheney heading off into the sunset , and Sarah Palin hopping a charter back to Wasilla , who ’s left to skewer ?
Roll call !
• Republicans .
Obama ’s win does n’t mean , of course , that the Republican Party is dead .
There will still be plenty of Republican operatives , wing - nut school boards , and convicted - felon senators to belittle .
But it ’s a lot less fun — and brave — to kick the losers than it is to take the winners down a peg .
And political satire that only goes half - heartedly after the ruling party sacrifices relevance in order to appease its audience .
• Other Democrats .
There ’s great potential for mischief in the party ’s control of the House and Senate , and Stewart would be wise to make great hay of Congress ’s still - likely inability to get anything done .
• The media .
Last night ’s episode included some great potshots at CNN ’s stupid holograms and NBC ’s stupid ice rink .
Stewart could make even more regular targets of Fox News and other right - leaning outlets , but Stephen Colbert satirizes that world far better than The Daily Show could ever hope to .
• Obama fans .
One Daily Show writer suggested as much to the Times on Election Night .
“ I get worried that all of us who wanted Obama will take themselves too seriously , ” he said , noting that there was still humor to be had in the Obama crazies who will “ sit on the couch ” and expect the impossible from their hero : “ Hey , Obama , where ’s my jet pack ? ”
But it seems to us like there ’s a substantial overlap between America ’s young Obama acolytes and America ’s young Daily Show viewers ; how often can Stewart and his writers make fun of their studio audience ?
• Random celebrities .
But then you ’re The Soup .
That the real highlight of Election Night was Stephen Colbert ’s begging a cockatoo to slit his throat suggests that the balance of power on the Stewart - Colbert axis might have shifted .
We can see a future in which The Colbert Report becomes Comedy Central ’s late - night star , mixing Dadaist whimsy with legitimate critique of the Obama administration .
And , sad to say , in that future , Jon Stewart sits on the sidelines , happy that Barack Obama is the leader we all hoped he would be , but wistfully remembering his words from last night ’s episode : “ Oh , George W. Bush impression , I ’ll miss you most of all . ”

" Primatologists have known for some time that organized , lethal violence is common between groups of chimpanzees , our closest relatives .
Whether between chimps or hunter - gatherers , however , intergroup violence is nothing like modern pitched battles .
Instead , it tends to take the form of brief raids using overwhelming force , so that the aggressors run little risk of injury .
" It 's not like the Somme , " says Richard Wrangham , a primatologist at Harvard University .
" You go off , you make a hit , you come back again .
" This opportunistic violence helps the aggressors weaken rival groups and thus expand their territorial holdings . "
" For the past eight years , conservatives have marched in lockstep to defend the indefensible .
Just about everything that President Bush and his administration have done has been endlessly praised , defended and echoed .
In fact , in their arrogance , Republicans have described Bush 's actions -- to an increasingly skeptical populace -- as creating its own new reality .
I'm thinking of the unnamed Bush official who , in 2005 , told reporter Ron Suskind , Now that most of America has rejected Bush 's version of reality , you have to ask , what were these people thinking ?
Was it the lizard brain in action ?
That 's the , an almond - sized part of the right side of the brain that generates fear and blocks out the logical left side of the brain .
When presented with a life - threatening situation , the Amygdala kicks into gear in the classicmode .
Reason becomes impossible and the subconscious looks for any nonverbal cue that communicates safety and security .
Since 9/11 , the lizard brain of the white heterosexual male appears to have been in charge of the national psyche .
Fear of terrorism , of " the other , " of pointy - headed do - gooder liberals out to take your Bibles and guns away , of homosexuals and feminists and black people -- has been steering the ship of state .
No questions allowed .
We like to think that this election was a triumph for the reality - based , multicultural community , the people who did n't believe we would be greeted as liberators in Iraq and who suspected that cowboy capitalism ... just might not advance the greater good .

Are you for or against wind farms ?
A thousand people who overflowed the auditorium of Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate on Guildwood Pkwy .
last night debated the question at a meeting that mixed neighbourhood angst with debate over the pros and cons of Toronto Hydro 's proposed offshore wind farm .
The first stage of the project is to place what amounts to a small weather station on a platform about two kilometres off the Scarborough Bluffs to measure wind speeds .
The platform will operate for about two years to collect the data needed to find out whether a wind farm in the lake is workable .
If conditions are favourable , Toronto Hydro would like to build about 60 turbines in the lake , sprinkled over an area 25 kilometres long , extending as far east as Ajax and as far west as the waters off the Leslie Street Spit .
But the sometimes - raucous meeting turned into a discussion over who was from Scarborough , now part of the City of Toronto .
Environmental groups had bused supporters to the meeting from outside the immediate area .
That rankled John Lennie , a local resident .
" You 've loaded the auditorium so people in the community can't ask legitimate questions , " Lennie said , pointing to the long lines of people formed behind the microphones .
" Would you consider having a community meeting without all the lobbyists and the paid people ? "
Vy Hoang , another local resident , agreed .
" Stand up , Scarborough , " he said .
" The green people and the people they bus in are taking your opportunity to ask the questions . "
But others argue the project affects everyone in Toronto and beyond .
" You know what ? " asked Fyodor Snagovsky , " I live on this planet .
This is an issue that goes way past Scarborough .
" This will affect you no matter where you live on earth . "
Jim Prall , who works at the University of Toronto , argues that Canada is falling behind much of the world in renewable energy .
He said many university graduates that he knows have to leave Canada to find work in the renewable energy sector .
" I 'd like to see some graduates find work here , " he said .
Supporters of the proposed wind farm were often interrupted as they spoke by cries of " Do you live here ? "
The proponent of the wind farm is Toronto Hydro Energy Services , an unregulated unit of Toronto Hydro Corp. , which is owned by the City of Toronto .
The polarized feelings simply frustrated some in the audience .

Ed Linhares , who lives in Scarborough , said he'd come to the meeting simply to get information and was frustrated by the adversarial tone of the debate .
" I 'm not sure I trust either one , " he said of the two sides .
He pointed to one pamphlet put out by the opponents of the proposed wind farm stating that the turbines will be 121 feet high .
In fact , if they 're built , they 'll rise about 30 metres above the lake .
Last night 's session was Toronto Hydro 's second attempt to hold an information meeting on its proposed wind farm .
An earlier meeting , scheduled four weeks ago in a small church hall , had to be cancelled when the meeting room overflowed and about 200 people were unable to get in .
Supporters of the wind turbines were taken aback at local opposition to the proposed turbines ; some residents fear the lake view will be spoiled , their property values will suffer and migratory birds will be killed or disrupted .
Last night , a coalition of environmental groups encouraged their supporters to attend the meeting to support the turbines , and chartered buses to provide transport to the meeting from Kennedy subway station .
The platform and its instruments will rise four metres above the water level ; they 'll measure wind speed and direction , temperature and humidity .
Toronto's eastern shoreline is considered a good prospect for wind turbines because of a relatively shallow underwater reef two to four kilometres offshore , where the turbines can sit .
The turbines would be bigger than the turbine at Exhibition Place , and would generate about twice as much power .
A wind farm this size could generate up to 200 megawatts when the wind blows ; one megawatt powers about 250 homes .

I have read a couple of posts on memory models over the couple of weeks : one from Jeremy Manson on What Volatile Means in Java , and one from Bartosz Milewski entitled Who ordered sequential consistency ?.
Both of these cover a Sequentially Consistent memory model — in Jeremy 's case because sequential consistency is required by the Java Memory Model , and in Bartosz ' case because he 's explaining what it means to be sequentially consistent , and why we would want that .
In a sequentially consistent memory model , there is a single total order of all atomic operations which is the same across all processors in the system .
You might not know what the order is in advance , and it may change from execution to execution , but there is always a total order .
This is the default for the new C++0 x atomics , and required for Java 's volatile , for good reason — it is considerably easier to reason about the behaviour of code that uses sequentially consistent orderings than code that uses a more relaxed ordering .
The thing is , C++0 x atomics are only sequentially consistent by default — they also support more relaxed orderings .
Relaxed Atomics and Inconsistent Orderings
I briefly touched on the properties of relaxed atomic operations in my presentation on The Future of Concurrency in C++ at ACCU 2008 ( see the slides ) .
The key point is that relaxed operations are unordered .
Consider this simple example with two threads :
#include < thread > # include < cstdatomic > std::atomic<int > x ( 0 ) , y( 0 ) ; void thread1 ( ) { x.store (1,std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; y.store ( 1,std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; } void thread2 ( ) { int a=y.load( std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; int b=x.load( std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; if ( a==1 ) assert ( b==1 ) ; } std:: thread t1( thread1 ) ; std:: thread t2( thread2 ) ;
All the atomic operations here are using memory_order_relaxed , so there is no enforced ordering .
Therefore , even though thread1 stores x before y , there is no guarantee that the writes will reach thread2 in that order : even if a==1 ( implying thread2 has seen the result of the store to y ) , there is no guarantee that b==1 , and the assert may fire .
If we add more variables and more threads , then each thread may see a different order for the writes .
Some of the results can be even more surprising than that , even with two threads .
The C++0 x working paper features the following example :
void thread1 ( ) { int r1=y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; x.store(r1,std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; } void thread2 ( ) { int r2=x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; y.store (42,std::memory_order_relaxed ) ; assert ( r2==42 ) ; }
There 's no ordering between threads , so thread1 might see the store to y from thread2 , and thus store the value 42 in x .
The fun part comes because the load from x in thread2 can be reordered after everything else ( even the store that occurs after it in the same thread ) and thus load the value 42 !
Of course , there 's no guarantee about this , so the assert may or may not fire — we just do n't know .
Acquire and Release Ordering
Now you 've seen quite how scary life can be with relaxed operations , it 's time to look at acquire and release ordering .
This provides pairwise synchronization between threads — the thread doing a load sees all the changes made before the corresponding store in another thread .
Most of the time , this is actually all you need — you still get the " two cones " effect described in Jeremy 's blog post .
With acquire - release ordering , independent reads of variables written independently can still give different orders in different threads , so if you do that sort of thing then you still need to think carefully .
e.g .
std::atomic x ( 0 ) , y( 0 ) ; void thread1 ( ) { x.store (1,std::memory_order_release ) ; } void thread2 ( ) { y.store ( 1,std::memory_order_release ) ; } void thread3 ( ) { int a=x.load( std::memory_order_acquire ) ; int b=y.load(std::memory_order_acquire ) ; } void thread4 ( ) { int c=x.load( std::memory_order_acquire ) ; int d=y.load(std::memory_order_acquire ) ; }
Yes , thread3 and thread4 have the same code , but I separated them out to make it clear we 've got two separate threads .
In this example , the stores are on separate threads , so there is no ordering between them .
Consequently the reader threads may see the writes in either order , and you might get a==1 and b==0 or vice versa , or both 1 or both 0 .
The fun part is that the two reader threads might see opposite orders , so you have a==1 and b==0 , but c==0 and d==1 !
With sequentially consistent code , both threads must see consistent orderings , so this would be disallowed .
Summary
The details of relaxed memory models can be confusing , even for experts .
If you 're writing code that uses bare atomics , stick to sequential consistency until you can demonstrate that this is causing an undesirable impact on performance .
There 's a lot more to the C++0 x memory model and atomic operations than I can cover in a blog post — I go into much more depth in the chapter on atomics in my book .

Mr. Volcker , now an adviser to Mr. Obama , is remembered as an economic hero and has been suggested as a possible Treasury secretary in the Obama administration even though he is 81 years old .
But in the early 1980s Mr. Volcker was blamed for causing a severe recession that began early in Mr. Reagan ’s tenure and continued through November 1982 .
The Republicans suffered losses in the 1982 midterm elections , and Democrats thought they were in good shape to win back the White House in 1984 .
Instead , the economy was clearly in recovery by then , and inflation was down sharply .
Mr. Reagan was re-elected in a landslide , and was so successful that he became the first president since Calvin Coolidge to leave office and be succeeded by a member of his own party , George H. W. Bush .
George W. Bush , the son of the elder Bush , came into office determined to follow the Reagan course and not make the mistakes that his father had made , which led to his being a one - term president .
He too confronted a weak economy early in his administration , and like Mr. Reagan he was able to push through substantial tax cuts as a way of stimulating the economy .
But unlike Mr. Reagan , who later allowed taxes to be raised to combat soaring budget deficits , the younger Mr. Bush refused to contemplate such an action .
When the economy was booming , he saw no need to apply the brakes , and neither did the Federal Reserve chairman he had inherited , Alan Greenspan .
Had they been willing to do so , the current bust might have been avoided , or at least been much milder .
Like Mr. Reagan , Mr. Obama will have to confront taxes in his first year .
The Bush administration ’s large tax cut in 2001 was temporary  a strategy that under Senate rules made it possible to push through the cut without having to win Democratic votes  and needs to be changed in 2009 .
Had Mr. Bush chosen a bipartisan approach , the tax cut would have been smaller , and the new Congress would not have to pass a tax bill immediately .
In passing a tax bill , the Congress and Mr. Obama will have to balance the long - term deficit problem with the need for shorter - term stimulus .

“ Hey , I just had a weird tingling in my pituitary gland – did you just accept a mission ?
If you did , say nothing .
Okay , I sense from your silence that your mission is to blow up a generator in the North - West airfield to cripple APR operations in the area .
Drive five - hundred miles in the opposite direction , through nine heavily guarded enemy checkpoints , come into my bedroom , and I ’ll give you some important information that for some reason I can’t tell you right now , then stand there for six hours wordlessly watching you sleep .
If you do n’t , I ’ll hate you . ”
“ Hey , about time .
It ’s been forty - five seconds since I demanded you cross half the breadth of Africa to hear me say something I could have easily said down the phone .
So , the UFLL want you to blow up that generator , right ?
I ’ve heard that the police chief ’s cousin ’s step son is carrying a piece of paper with the location of a magic radio that will summon a whole battallion of enemy troops to your objective , pointlessly making your mission much , much harder for no extra reward .
“ Intimidate him , steal the radio , lure the troops through a hostile village by performing a flamboyant jig , then defeat them all while being shot at by two other armies that you would have otherwise easily avoided .
Then blow up the generator .
Then save me because I ’ll be in life - threatening danger by then .
If you do n’t do this , I will forget you saved my life and phone you up just to insult you . ”
The idea of setting up an ambush , Michelle , is that the enemy should get ambushed .

A man he ’s never seen before , leaning against the wall , announces that he is Clint ’s second - best buddy in the world and will one day save his life .
When Clint returns home that night , he finds the man standing in his bedroom , trying to get cellphone reception .
Clint goes to bed and dreams of the game he will make at work the next day .
I ’m missing something fundamental about the buddy missions .
Why do they want to hurt the APR / UFLL much more seriously at enormous risk to my health and for no extra reward ?
And why do they think I will want to ?
It ca n’t be that they ’re die - hard UFLL or APR supporters , because my next mission will be against that faction and they will again demand that I take enormous , preposterous detours to commit mass murders .
Some of these missions are to destroy medicine .
Some are to ruin farms or sever water supplies .
I ’ve had five buddies , and each one ’s sole motivation seemed to be to cause as much indiscriminate human suffering as possible , even – in fact especially – mine .

With the economy in the throes of a global recession , oil producers are facing their toughest business prospects in 25 years .
Oil demand is expected to decline this year and next , the first drop since the energy shocks of the early 1980s .
As economic growth slows down sharply , oil prices have collapsed from their summer peaks in record time .
The stunning speed of the downturn has made for a sudden nightmare for producers , who face shrinking revenue next year .
Oil has lost $ 100 a barrel , or 70 percent of its value , since July and many analysts forecast further declines as the global economy worsens .
OPEC is meeting Wednesday in the coastal city of Oran , Algeria , to discuss ways to stem the drop in prices .
Chakib Khelil , the organization ’s president and the Algerian oil minister , suggested last week that producers would approve “ a severe production cut to stabilize the oil market . ”
Magician David Copperfield 's assistant sucked into the blades of a giant wind machine as horrified audience looks on
Horror : David Copperfield was forced to cancel Wednesday 's show after his assistant Brandon was severely injured
Illusionist David Copperfield 's assistant was rushed to hospital on Wednesday night after suffering horrific injuries during a live show .
A technician named Brandon was accidentally pulled into the vortex of an oversized fan on stage of Copperfield 's An Intimate Evening of Grand Illusion at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas .
Audience members watched in horror as the assistant was sucked into the fan , before another staff member rushed to switch it off .
Brandon , who is in his twenties , suffered puncture wounds in his face and broke his arm in several places .
He was rushed to University Medical Center where he underwent emergency surgery to his arm .
A representative for Copperfield told UsMagazine.com : ' During an illusion where David attempts to walk through the rotating blades of a 12 - foot high industrial fan , the fan and its platform were being rotated by one of David 's illusion technicians .
' Just prior to David himself walking through the fan , [ the assistant ] was accidentally pulled into the vortex of the moving fan blades , causing injury to his arm and face .
' The surgery was several hours wherein the doctors could insert pins and bolts .
There was a puncture on his face requiring eight or nine stitches .
The Copperfield crew waited at the hospital during his arm and face surgery . '
Copperfield was with his assistant when he woke up after surgery on Thursday morning and presented him with a children 's magic kit as a get well present .
Scene of the accident :
The MGM Grand Hotel / Casino on the Las Vegas Strip this week
The magician said : ' Brandon is a fantastic guy that has been with our team almost a year and is a loyal and hard - working illusion technician that is truly loved by all who know him .
' Many people assume that the death - defying illusions I do on stage are not dangerous .
This unfortunate accident shows that could n’t be further from the truth , and we ’re just thankful that Brandon ’s injuries were n’t worse . '
After Brandon 's injuries , the curtain came down and Copperfield later informed the audience the rest of the show had been cancelled and they were all entitled to full refunds .
An audience member told the website : ' One of the assistants dropped to the floor .
The curtain came down partially .
Blood was everywhere , and the other assistants dragged the victim back .
Then the curtain closed all the way . '

Pakistan believes al - Qaeda 's presence has been massively reduced Seven years after 9/11 , the taunting continues .
" Leave us alone to establish the Islamic Shura state which will unite the Muslims of the earth in truth and justice , " said a recent al - Qaeda webcast .
" A single word of American protest will be silenced by a thousand Islamic bombs . "
But since that morning in 2001 , al - Qaeda has not landed one blow inside the United States - and this year the head of the CIA said the group had suffered " strategic defeat . "
So how strong is al - Qaeda ?
' Collective losers ' Pakistani intelligence officials claim that the organisation is down to around 80 people in their country .
They say al - Qaeda survives in the tribal areas only thanks to its alliance with the much more numerous Taleban .
But the problem is that recent military strikes by the Americans in Pakistan 's tribal areas are unifying the different radical Islamic groups .
The bombing of Islamabad 's Marriott Hotel reawakened terror concerns " If the Taleban are given respect , if they are treated as actual partners and stakeholders in Afghanistan , I 'm very sure they will play their role in containing the threat of al - Qaeda , " said security analyst Zaid Hamid .
" If the West is serious about containing al - Qaeda , they must engage the Taleban ...
There 's a split going on right now between al - Qaeda and the Afghan Taleban .
" And if the West can not see this or cannot exploit this , or if Pakistan cannot understand this , then the world will be collective losers . "
But far from talking to the Taleban , the West is fighting it .
And not for the first time .
When Kabul fell to the Americans following 9/11 , hundreds of al - Qaeda fighters fled Afghanistan and opened a new front - in Saudi Arabia .
Al - Qaeda attacked Western housing compounds , assassinated senior police officers , and fought gun battles in cities across the Kingdom .
But the Saudi authorities prevailed .
" If we take al Qaeda as an organisation , it has been destroyed , " said Abdul Rahman al - Hadlaq , from the Saudi Ministry of Interior .
" ... by arresting their leaders and their followers , you are basically destroying their organisation . "
Formidable enemy Being extremely rich - oil revenues are a $ 1bn ( £ 560 m ) a day - the Saudi state really does have the strength to get things done , things like wrapping up al - Qaeda .
The West is worried about the use of the internet by extremists
But in nearby Jordan the story is different .
There , I meet a man who would not give me his name but who said he had recruited fighters for al - Qaeda - specifically for Iraq .
" Everyone in the world knows that America has launched a crusade against Islam all over the world .
Iraq is one of those spots , " he said .
" It 's a duty for all Muslims to support Jihad and Mujahedeen in the war against this occupation .
So we go to Iraq to protect our lands ... to make the Americans leave and to protect our fortune . "
Despite these words , al - Qaeda has met a formidable enemy in Iraq .
At a US base just outside Baghdad you can see the scale of the American operation .
Helicopters fly in and out every few minutes disgorging soldiers and picking up fresh ones .
It is an awesome display of power .
And the Americans are increasingly confident - one retired General wrote recently that the al - Qaeda leaders in Iraq are " dead men walking " .
" We 've had offensive operations directed at where they 've been , intelligence tells us where they might go , " said US Colonel Gerry O'Hara .
" So not only do we have operations that are on top of them , we have operations planned on the escape routes that they would use to set up in another location , " he said .
" We 're not going to let up on them .
We 're taking every bit of safe haven away from them . "
New attack ?
Al - Qaeda 's problems were compounded by the American surge of 2007 .
The US not only sent more troops to Iraq but also starting paying Sunni tribal leaders to oppose al - Qaeda .
It was called the Sunni awakening .
Bin Laden had called on fighters to force America into " protracted , exhausting close combat , " particularly in cities .
However Nabil Haj , an advisor to the American military in Iraq , said that the strategy failed .
" We pushed al - Qaeda out from the urban areas like Ramadi , Falluja , Baquba , central Baghdad .
They were pushed out to the rural areas , " he said .
" So they are really fading , fading out . "
But while al - Qaeda 's campaigns in Iraq and Saudi are not going well , it is still winning recruits .
Algerian jihadists have sworn allegiance to al - Qaeda , and Western officials are concerned about developments in Morocco , Tunisia and Somalia too .
And the West never knows if there is going to be another major attack - perhaps with weapons of mass destruction .
The head of the CIA , General Michael Hayden , has warned of a new generation of recruits brought up in the West .
That worries EU officials too .
" Pakistan is so important - both as a place where people can get training , and where an al - Qaeda corps can hide itself , " said Gilles de Kerchove , the EU 's counter - terrorism coordinator .
" On the other hand , you have this new development where you have this home - grown terrorism , where people get this information just on the internet and do not train , " he said .
" That to a certain extent is good news , because it leads to a less sophisticated attack . "
Nevertheless , with one attack al - Qaeda could transform the current situation .
As things stand , the organisation is down but by no means out .

What are these ?
She was history 's most notorious femme fatale , with three husbands , numerous lovers , and a rumoured penchant for poisoning men of whom she grew tired .
Yet not a single portrait survives of Lucrezia Borgia , the infamous Italian Renaissance noblewoman – or so it was believed until now .
After four years of detective work , the National Gallery of Victoria ( NGV ) announced yesterday that it had identified Borgia as the subject of a mystery painting held in its collection for more than four decades .
The oval portrait is believed to be the work of Dosso Dossi ( 1486 - 1542 ) , a contemporary of Titian , Raphael and Michelangelo , and to have been painted between 1515 and 1520 .
The gallery bought it for £ 8,000 in London in 1965 .
It was entitled Portrait of a Youth , by an unknown north Italian painter .
Displayed on and off for the past 43 years , it baffled every expert on the subject , and was always assumed to depict a young man – in part because its subject was holding a dagger .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But lengthy technical analysis and research by the NGV 's paintings conservator , Carl Villis , yielded astonishing results .
Not only was the portrait the work of Dossi , a great artist , albeit less well known than some of his peers , Mr Villis concluded , but its subject was a woman whose name was synonymous with dark deeds , corruption and sexual profligacy .
Gerald Vaughan , the gallery 's director , was barely able to contain his excitement during the announcement in Melbourne .
He said : " What was previously a portrait of an unknown sitter by an unidentified artist now seems likely to be one of the most significant portraits surviving from the Renaissance , by one of the great north Italian painters . "
The NGV believes it is the only portrait in existence of Borgia , the illegitimate daughter of Rodrigo Borgia , the powerful Valencian who ruled as Pope Alexander VI from 1492 to 1503 , and his mistress , Vanozza dei Cattanei .
Mr Villis said : " If it is accepted for what we believe it to be , then it will be highly significant , because it will be incredibly rare .
We believe this to be the only formal painted portrait of Lucrezia Borgia . "
That note of caution may have been sounded because , in a highly embarrassing mistake that came to light last year , the NGV misattributed a painting to Vincent Van Gogh .
However , Mr Villis appeared confident , saying that the portrait 's idiosyncratic style and oval shape matched the work of Dossi , who worked for the ruling family of Ferrara when Borgia was duchess .
" It has been very exciting to unlock the secrets of this beautiful and enigmatic painting , " Mr Villis said .
" Generations of art historians have attempted to identify portraits of Lucrezia Borgia , but this appears to be the only one that contains direct personal references to this intriguing historical figure . "
He said the only reliable likeness of Borgia was found on a bronze portrait medal made in 1502 .
" The facial profile on the medal bears a striking resemblance to our portrait . "

The Hackulous pirating site is dedicated to cracking and distributing iPhone applications without paying any money to their developers .
In what can only be described as hilarious irony , a beta version of that application was itself pirated and released ( cached ) before it could enter a full open - source distribution .
SaladFork , the author of Crackulous , called the leak " absolutely disgusting , and downright insulting . "
He writes about his pride of development , saying , " [ I ] have released a new version of Crackulous almost every day or two , fixing all the bugs that had been reported up until that day .
I was proud of Crackulous , and put a large majority of my free time into ensuring it will be the best application it possibly could be .
I responded to beta tester feedback , and each version of Crackulous was better than the last . "
Alas , one of his pirate compatriots betrayed him , allowing the Crackulous beta to be freely downloaded .
After a time of reflection and calming down , SaladFork announced that he would not , after all , be abandoning the project ( cached ) and looks forward to a public release .
He asked , however , that bloggers and forum members not spread the leak , putting his faith in their humanity and goodness .
He wrote , " Several of you had noticed the irony in me complaining that a tool used to steal from other developers was stolen , but I hope you realize the difference in situation .
i Phone developers almost always ( 99 % of the time ) develop applications for the App Store in hopes of getting money . "
Leaving aside the obvious jokes about honor among thieves , it 's a shame this experience was not more of an ethical learning opportunity for Mr. SaladFork and his friends .
Point , shoot and … what ?
From amazing architecture to abandoned places , sometimes the subject is at the center of compelling and creative photography techniques and photographers – but at other times the types and approaches take the proverbial cake .
These fascinating photography techniques take the art of image - making into entire new dimensions .
Some photographers seem to freeze , slow , or speed up time .
Others like Will Pearson rotate our views in dizzying directions elevate our views to dazzling heights .
Featuring eye - popping works from 3D , panoramic and high - speed to infrared , HDR and tilt - shift photographers , here is a visual guide to ten of the world ’s most awesome ways to take a photograph .
Who says photography is limited to what a standard frame or even a panoramic one can see ?
Some photographers shoot entirely in the round , creating amazing full - circle spiralling panoramas or even fully - mobile three - dimensional shots that can only be viewed via computer .
While most images capture moments in time that any ordinary human could see some high - speed shots provide us with photographic glimpses of faster - than - sight phenomena invisible to the naked eye , from bullets piercing bottles to aesthetically splendidly water splashes .
At the opposite extreme from high - speed photography lies the vast world of motion - blur imagery .
From a single time - lapse shot it can be possible to see many moments collapsed into one and create permanent montage artworks from ephemeral events .
Employed to the extreme and they can seem like gimmicks but taken to just the right degree and color - altering approaches like infrared and HDR can take ordinary scenes and make them extraordinary , enhancing contrast and rendering some aspects of an image more real than reality .
Night photography can bring out the best in photographers , playing on subtlties of shadow , shade and contrast not visible during the daytime .
These photographers range in their approaches but universally add something new to the art of creating nighttime images .
Black and white is , of course , where photography began – but is not at all where it has ended up .
However , some contemporary photographers have reclaimed this original art and applied new techniques to the old approaches begun by the original masters of photography .
: Monochrome and duotone photography are not , however , limited to black and white .
Many photographic artist make marvelous compositions from a single color , shade or tone beyond greyscale .
These works can be potently expressive despite their singular colors .
Mirrors are found in many places in nature and architecture – from smooth running streams to finely polished floors .
Many photographers continue to experiment with the myriad possibilities of reflection that present themselves in our everyday experience .
Scale are perspective are pervasive issues in the realm of photography – mastering them is one thing , but twisting them to a whole different purpose can be quite another .
Tilt - shift photography tweaks our ideas of relative and real sizes and unique and creative ways .
Who says you need a camera to take pictures ?
Long before cameras as we know them existed , innovative artists and scientists used these techniques to create images – creative contemporary photographers have returned to them as well .
While they stage their work very carefully – to the point of it being as much about performance as freeze - frame photography – Denis Darzacq and Liwei have made an incredible art out of perfectly timed and angled photographs .
As with Darzacq and Liwei , Michael Hughes has made a mission of somewhat less - than - serious but strangely compelling photography .
He travels the world and replaces real - life monuments and wonders with his own miniatures in self - made images .
WASHINGTON , Dec 4 ( Reuters ) - A sudden drop this week in the value of the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS could reignite political tensions over the huge U.S. trade deficit with China , U.S. business groups said on Thursday .
“ This is extremely disturbing , ” Frank Vargo , vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers , told Reuters as U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other senior Bush administration officials were in Beijing for high - level economic talks .
The yuan ’s drop came just days before that meeting and just a little more than one month before President - elect Barack Obama takes over in the White House .
During the campaign , Obama accused China of deliberately manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage and said he supported legislation to let the United States impose countervailing duties against countries that do that .
In Beijing earlier on Thursday , Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming brushed aside speculation that China may be engineering a depreciation to help cushion its exporters from the global economic downturn .
“ The recent small fluctuation of the yuan against the dollar is quite normal .
I would call it the U.S. dollar strengthening , rather than the yuan depreciating , ” Chen said .
BAD TIMING FOR TEXTILES INDUSTRY
Even as the dollar climbed against other currencies in recent months , the yuan had remained relatively steady against the greenback until Monday , when it had its biggest single - day depreciation since it was taken off a dollar peg in July 2005 .
Cass Johnson , president of the National Association of Textile Organizations , said he saw the yuan drop as part of a concerted Chinese government effort to boost exports .
“ Not only have they begun to devalue again , but they ’ve increased their export subsidies pretty dramatically for textiles and other products as well , ” Johnson said .
“ That ’s particularly disturbing since U.S. import quotas on Chinese textiles expire in just 27 days .
They ’re pumping a huge amount of support into their industry at a critical time , ” Johnson said .
U.S. manufacturers were already unhappy the yuan had stopped rising against the dollar after appreciating roughly 21 percent between July 2005 and July 2008 .
The U.S. trade deficit with China hit a record $ 256.2 billion last year .
But by mid-2007 , the stronger yuan appeared to be stopping growth in the trade deficit and setting the stage for it to actually decline this year .
“ We thought , ‘ Wow , maybe it ’s turning around and getting smaller . ’
But the last three months , it ’s really grown a lot and I think that probably reflects that the currency is n’t appreciating any more , ” Vargo said .
On a seasonally adjusted basis , the most recent monthly trade figures show an annual U.S. trade deficit of around $ 290 billion with China , Vargo said .
“ It ’s a problem and I really hope the Chinese will get the message and let the yuan move higher again , ” Vargo said .
Qatar has asked Kenya to lease it 40,000 hectares of land to grow crops as part of a proposed package that would also see the Gulf state fund a new £ 2.4bn port on the popular tourist island of Lamu off the east African country .
The deal is the latest example of wealthy countries and companies trying to secure food supplies from the developing world .
Other Gulf states , including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , have also been negotiating leases of large tracts of farmland in countries such as Sudan and Senegal since the global food shortages and price rises earlier this year .
The Kenyan president , Mwai Kibaki , returned from a visit to Qatar on Monday .
His spokesman said the request for land in the Tana river delta , south of Lamu , in north - east Kenya was being seriously considered .
" Nothing comes for free , " said Isaiah Kabira .
" If you want people to invest in your country then you have to make concessions . "
But the deal is likely to cause concern in Kenya where fertile land is unequally distributed .
Several prominent political families own huge tracts of farmland , while millions of people live in densely packed slums .
The country is also experiencing a food crisis , with the government forced to introduce subsidies and price controls on maize this week after poor production and planning caused the price of the staple " ugali " flour to double in less than a year .
Kibaki said that Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani was keen to invest in a second port to complement Mombasa , which serves as a gateway for goods bound for Uganda and Rwanda and is struggling to cope with the large volumes of cargo .
By building docks in Lamu , Kenya hopes to open a new trade corridor that will give landlocked Ethiopia and the autonomous region of Southern Sudan access to the Indian Ocean .
Kabira said that if the financing was agreed , construction of the port would begin in 2010 .
Qatar , which has large oil and gas revenues , imports most of its food , as most of its land is barren desert and just 1 % is suitable for arable farming .
It has already reportedly struck deals this year to grow rice in Cambodia , maize and wheat in Sudan and vegetables in Vietnam .
Much of the produce will be exported to the Gulf .
Qatar 's foreign ministry in Doha did not return calls today , but Kabira said that its intention was to grow " vegetables and fruit " in Kenya .
The area proposed for the farming project is near the Tana river delta where the Kenyan government owns nearly 500,000 hectares ( 1.3 m acres ) of uncultivated land .
But a separate agreement to allow a local company to grow sugarcane and build a factory in the area has attracted fierce opposition from environmentalists who say a pristine ecosystem of mangrove swamps , savannah and forests will be destroyed .
Pastoralists , who regard the land as communal and rear up to 60,000 cattle to graze in the delta each dry season , are also opposed to the plan .
" We will have to ensure that this new project is properly explained to the people before it can go ahead , " said Kabira .
The sudden rush by foreign governments and companies to secure food supplies in Africa has some experts worried .
Jacques Diouf , director general of the UN's food and agricultural organisation ( FAO ) , recently spoke of the risk of a " neo- colonial " agricultural system emerging .
The FAO said some of the first overseas projects by Gulf companies in Sudan , where more than 5 million people receive international food aid , showed limited local benefits , with much of the specialist labour and farming inputs imported .
A deal struck last month by Daewoo Logistics and Madagascar to grow crops on 1.3 m hectares of land also attracted strong criticism .
While the South Korean firm has promised to provide local jobs and will have to invest in building roads and farming infrastructure , it is paying no upfront fee and has a 99 - year lease .

In May 2008 , average gas prices in the United States approached , and in some places passed , $ 4.00 a gallon , shattering records .
But this was nothing new to American consumers .
May was a month of records that broke one after another , and that came on the heels of months of rising prices .
And then the cycle continued , with prices eventually falling and then inching toward the $ 4.00 mark again in 2011 .
Gasoline is the bloodline that keeps America moving , and tracking gas prices can feel like a roller coaster ride .
They 're down a little one month , up the next , and then they shoot up more than 50 percent in a year .
Plus , they 're different depending on where you look .
Other countries -- and even other states and cities -- can have very different gas prices from your local Gas - N - Go .
To the average person , it probably seems as though there 's little rhyme or reason to how gas prices are determined .
In this article , we will look at the forces that impact the price of gas at the pump , and we 'll find out where your gas money actually goes .
Americans have an insatiable thirst for gasoline .
Just look at the amount of traffic on roads and highways , and you 'll see that a severe gas shortage would practically cripple the United States .
Americans drive nearly 3 trillion miles per year , according to the Motor and Equipment Manufacturer 's Association [ source : MEMA ] .
That 's about 820 trips from the sun to Pluto and back .
The United States consumes about 20 million barrels of oil products per day ( bbl/d ) , according to the Department of Energy [ source : DOE ] .
Of that , almost half is used for motor gasoline .
The rest is used for distillate fuel oil , jet fuel , residual fuel and other oils .
Each barrel of oil contains 42 gallons ( 159 L ) , which yields 19 to 20 gallons ( 75 L ) of gasoline .
So , in the United States , something like 178 million gallons of gasoline is consumed every day .
Typically , the demand for gas spikes during the summer , when lots of people go on vacation .
Holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July create logjams of tourist traffic during the summer .
This high demand usually translates into higher gasoline prices .
Cleaner - burning summer - grade fuels , which are more expensive to produce , can increase the price as well , but prices do n't always go up in summer .
For instance , while gas prices soared 31 cents in April and early May of 2001 , reaching $ 1.71 per gallon ( which seems inexpensive compared to today 's prices ) , prices actually declined during the 2001 summer .
In 2004 , prices continued to rise past the end of the summer travel season for a variety of reasons , including several hurricanes and an increase in the price of crude oil .
And in 2005 , Hurricane Katrina ( along with a sizable increase in crude oil prices ) pushed prices to $ 3.07 per gallon on September 5 .
Prices settled down somewhat in November and December of 2005 .
But now the numbers are among the highest they 've ever been , only recently dipping back below the $ 4.00 mark after a month of average prices at $ 4.06 for a gallon of regular gas in July 2008 [ source : EPA ] .
It seems the record high prices encouraged people to drive less , which in turn drove down demand and subsequently , prices .
As prices rose again in 2011 , President Barack Obama announced the formation of a task force to examine oil markets [ source : Pace ] .
Price increases generally occur when the world crude - oil market tightens and lowers inventories .
We will discuss who controls the crude - oil market later .
Also , growing demand can sometimes outpace refinery capacity .
In the spring , refineries perform maintenance , which can place a pinch on the gasoline market .
By the end of May , refineries are usually back to full capacity .
In the next section , we 'll look at where the money goes when you pay for gas .

Mr Bernanke has been discussing other policy options that may be used US interest rate - setters , led by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , are expected to cut rates from the current level of 1 % on Tuesday .
They are expected to lower it at 1415 EDT ( 1915 GMT ) to 0.5 % or even 0.25 % .
As they run out of room for further cuts , the policymakers may give details of what other tools they plan to use .
Other possible measures include buying debt backed by home loans , in the hope of halting the dramatic decline in the housing market .
Deflationary threat
It was problems with mortgage - backed debt that set off the problems in the US in the first place , but the Federal Reserve may decide that increasing demand for it could help to stimulate the economy .
A central bank printing money to inject into the markets is a strategy known as quantitative easing , which was pioneered by Japan as a way of battling its own deflationary problems in the 1990s .
Deflation becomes a greater risk as interest rates head towards zero .
It can be a problem because if people believe that prices are going to fall then they have incentives to postpone buying anything they can , which means there is even less activity in the economy .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke discussed quantitative easing in a speech at the beginning of this month .
Fresh weakness " Our nation 's economic policy must vigorously address the substantial risks to financial stability and economic growth , " he said .
The Federal Reserve has already been doing some quantitative easing with the billions of dollars it has been pumping into the financial markets , through emergency loans to banks and other institutions .
The Federal Reserve 's key rate , the target rate for overnight federal funds , has been cut drastically from the 5.25 % where it stood in September 2007 .
There were signs earlier on Tuesday that there is scope for the central bank to cut interest rates without worrying too much about the threat of inflation .
Consumer prices dropped by 1.7 % in November , according to the US Labor Department , following a decline of 1 % in October .
Much of the decline came from continuing falls in oil prices , which are $ 100 a barrel off their July peaks .

Knocking back four beers a day does n't just risk a serious beer gut - it could also be damaging your eyesight , a study of Australian men has found .
Melbourne research shows men in their 60s who drink alcohol heavily are about six times more likely to develop the most debilitating form of age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
About 15 per cent of Australians are affected by the disease - where sight fades in the centre of the visual field - and one per cent will have the advanced or end - stage form that eventually steals sight .
Smoking and genetics have been linked to the condition but Dr Elaine Chong from the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital decided to study the diet and eye health of almost 7,000 people over a period of time to determine the contribution of alcohol .
President - elect Barack Obama recently announced an ambitious plan to build up the nation ’s Internet infrastructure as part of his proposed economic stimulus package .
Upgrading the Internet is a particularly smart kind of stimulus , one that would spread knowledge , promote entrepreneurship and make this country more competitive globally .
The United States has long been the world leader in technology , but when it comes to the Internet , it is fast falling behind .
America now ranks 15th in the world in access to high - speed Internet connections .
A cornerstone of Mr. Obama ’s agenda is promoting universal , affordable high - speed Internet .
Mr. Obama , who had notable success with online fund - raising and voter turnout , spoke during the presidential campaign about the transformative power of the Internet to improve Americans ’ quality of life .
He argued that it could , among other things , reduce health care costs , create jobs and make it easier for citizens to participate in government decision - making .
In a speech this month about his economic stimulus plan , he said that he intends to ensure that every child has a chance to get online and that he would use some of the stimulus money to connect libraries and schools .
It is a critical goal .
Children trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide are deprived of a fair chance to educate themselves and to compete for high - skill , high - paying jobs .
Despite the recent surge of attention to the U.S. - Iraqi negotiations over an agreement to keep U.S. troops in Iraq for years into the future , the resulting agreement or lack of agreement is likely to have little actual impact on the occupation .
The negotiations are being conducted by representatives of President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki  neither of whom actually wants the U.S. troops to leave ( Maliki ’s government would not likely survive the withdrawal of U.S. troops , and Bush remains committed to permanent U.S. control of Iraq , its oil , and its strategic location for U.S. military bases ) .
But both Bush and Maliki face political and electoral pressures to posture as if they do want a timetable for troop withdrawal .
As a result , most of the negotiations seem to have focused less on substantive disagreements between the two sides , and more on finding language that disguises the reality of continued occupation and U.S. domination , with politically acceptable language extolling Iraqi sovereignty .
The negotiations are officially aimed at producing a bilateral agreement between the United States and the U.S. occupation - backed Iraqi government that would set the terms for how U.S. and “ coalition ” troops would continue to occupy and wage war in Iraq .
The urgency surrounding the negotiations is based on the looming expiration of the current United Nations mandate for the so - called “ multinational force ” ( diplo - speak for the U.S. - led occupation ) on Dec. 31 , 2008 .
The goal is to create an agreement between Washington and Baghdad that would replace that mandate .
Even the New York Times agrees that if there is no agreement in place after Dec. 31 , and the Security Council has not extended the mandate , the U.S. troops occupying Iraq would have no legal basis for their presence ; legally , they would have to be pulled back to their bases and quickly withdrawn from the country .
In fact , it ’s quite unlikely that any new bilateral agreement , or any extension of the UN mandate , will have any real impact on the fighting .
The U.S. invaded Iraq illegally ; it ’s unlikely that the government would end its occupation because of a technicality like acknowledged illegality .
And those forces fighting against the U.S. - led occupation , both the resistance forces targeting the U.S. occupation alone and those extremists also committing terrorist acts against Iraqi civilians , are unlikely to stop fighting because of a new or renewed legal document ; they are fighting against a hated foreign occupation , and will likely continue to do so regardless of diplomatic niceties .
It should be noted that so far the actual content of the agreement remains unclear .
No version , either in Arabic or English , has been released , though Arabic drafts have been leaked , and informal English translations are all that are available .
So , if the devil is in the details , the devil remains hidden .
Congress and Parliament
The agreement has n’t been submitted to Iraq ’s parliament , as its constitution requires , and has not been submitted to the Senate for ratification , as the U.S. Constitution requires .
In fact , on the Iraqi side , even leaders of Maliki ’s own party have distanced themselves from the agreement , while other political leaders , most notably Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr ( who called a Baghdad protest of tens of thousands over the weekend ) oppose it altogether .
It appears that secular , nationalist , and Sunni forces remain largely skeptical .
Iran opposes the agreement .
Only the main Kurdish parties , Washington ’s closest allies , have apparently endorsed its terms .
And most Iraqis , other than Maliki ’s supporters , are looking to better possibilities from a new post - Bush U.S. president .
The Bush administration has similarly refused to engage Congress , claiming that the agreement is “ merely ” an ordinary status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) , similar to agreements the U.S. has with Germany or Japan .
But of course there ’s no war being fought by U.S. troops in those countries .
In Congress there is strong opposition to the agreement , but it ’s primarily focused on the exclusion of congressional input and approval rather than the substance of the terms .
However , if the agreement fails , it would mean official recognition by governments , inter- governmental institutions , and other international diplomatic entities of the illegality of the U.S. occupation .
That would constitute a huge advance for global antiwar forces , including here in the U.S.
So challenging the legitimacy of any new agreement is a continuing obligation .
Time Horizon
Article 25 of the draft agreement describes “ withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , ” and the first paragraph states that “ the U.S. forces shall withdraw from Iraqi territories no later than December 31 , 2011 . ”
Later in the same article , there are references to “ combat troops ” being withdrawn from Iraqi cities and regrouped in U.S. bases by June 2009 , but the initial commitment to the Dec. 31 , 2011 , withdrawal does n’t specify “ combat ” troops .
It appears this was likely one of the demands of the Iraqi government , aware that the Iraqi parliament , let alone the population , would certainly reject the kind of partial withdrawal , of “ combat troops ” only , that is being defined as ending the war in U.S. electoral discourse .
But the existence of that text does n’t indicate a serious U.S. commitment to a timetable for full withdrawal of all troops , even by the end of 2011 .
Paragraph 5 of the same article explicitly authorizes the Iraqi government to request U.S. forces to remain in Iraq  for “ the purposes of training and support of the Iraqi security forces . ”
Such “ support ” of the U.S. - trained , U.S.- armed , and still U.S. - dependent Iraqi military could in practice mean any military action the Pentagon wants to carry out .
Paragraph 5 goes on to say that “ the Iraqi government might ask for an extension of paragraph 1 of this article ”  an extension of the 2011 withdrawal deadline .
So the whole idea of a deadline is a politically driven fraud .
It ’s not coincidental that when the Bush administration appeared to give in on the once - rejected idea of a timeline , the actual description was that of a “ time horizon ”  very beautiful , perhaps , but you could never get there .
There are similar wiggle - word descriptions of how U.S. troops would have to get approval from the military Iraqi in a joint coordination committee for military operations .
As to the detention of Iraqis , U.S. troops are required to hand over detainees to the Iraqi authorities within 24 hours  unless the detention “ was based on an Iraqi decision in accordance with Iraqi law . ”
U.S. Military Immunity
As to the hot - button issue of immunity vs. accountability for U.S. troops committing crimes against Iraqis , immunity largely wins the day .
There does seem to be a claim of Iraqi sovereign control over U.S. contractors who commit crimes against civilians  according to Article 12 , “ Iraq has the primary legal jurisdiction over contractors with the U.S. and their employees . ”
We ’ll see how Blackwater and other mercenary companies deal with that .
But as to U.S. troops , the U.S. maintains “ primary legal jurisdiction over U.S. armed forces members and civilian members . ”
Iraq ’s government can now brag to its people that it will have “ primary legal jurisdiction over armed forces members and civilian members in cases of major and intentional crimes ” that occur outside of U.S. bases and “ while troops are off duty . ”
But how convenient  U.S. troops essentially never leave their bases except for military activities , and several paragraphs later the text gives the U.S. the explicit right to determine whether the troops involved were off - duty or not .
U.S. bases also remain unchallenged .
The U.S. is to submit a list of all “ installations and areas used by the U.S. forces ” for the purpose of “ being reviewed and agreed upon by both sides ” by June 30 , 2009 .
There are references to the U.S. returning to the Iraqi government military bases “ that were constructed , remodeled , or modified under this agreement , ” but no reference to bases that pre-date the agreement or may not be among the “ installations and areas agreed upon . ”
The text is replete with references to Iraq ’s sovereignty , respect for the Iraqi constitution and laws , etc .
But there is no enforcement capacity and given the unequal balance of power between the two sides , there is little doubt that those references are designed to placate Iraq ’s overwhelmingly anti-occupation population , and even much of the parliament .
Oil
The agreement does nothing to end or even curtail U.S. efforts to control Iraqi oil .
It states the U.S. will continue its current role in “ protection arrangements ” for Iraq ’s oil and gas production “ and their revenue . ”
Given Bush ’s signing statement two weeks ago rejecting Congress ’ law requiring an end to U.S. efforts to control Iraq ’s oil , such continuation remains very dangerous .
So What Is Likely to Happen ?
It ’s very unlikely that the Iraqi parliament , veering between skepticism and outright rejection of the agreement , will come to accept it in the next two months .
It is certainly possible that Prime Minister Maliki will simply assert , as he has before , that his government does n’t need parliamentary approval ; but with important provincial elections looming in Iraq early in 2009 , that ’s probably a recipe for political suicide .
In the United States , Bush faces a similar problem .
Rejecting claims that their approval is n’t required , Congress is beginning to react  primarily by demanding a say in the process .
Some members are targeting the idea of U.S. forces ever being held accountable in the Iraqi judicial system , despite the clear reality that the text itself provides a myriad of ways to prevent such an occurrence .
There ’s already a move in Congress , led by Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) , to challenge the legitimacy of the exclusion of Congress from approval of the agreement , but urging the Security Council to extend the UN mandate after Dec. 31 instead .
This would mean repeating the common tactic of using the UN to provide political , and in this case legal , cover for illegal U.S. actions  potentially even for war crimes that may be committed by U.S. troops following illegal orders .
If the Dec. 31 expiration of the UN mandate looms closer , and the U.S. - Iraq agreement is not accepted by both sides , and Bush and Maliki fail to win political support for their claim that congressional / parliamentary approval is not necessary , three possibilities are likely :
An effort to win Security Council agreement for a short - term extension of the mandate .
A Bush - Maliki “ handshake ” agreement to maintain the status quo for three or six months , perhaps longer , the equivalent of Congress ’ frequent “ continuing resolutions ” that maintain current funding and activity levels .
Agreement by Congress and the Iraqi parliament to accept a shorter - term and perhaps stripped - down version of the agreement , essentially endorsing a “ handshake ” agreement between the governments .
So What Does the Peace Movement Do ?
The Dec. 31 , 2008 , expiration of the UN mandate should lead to an immediate recognition of the illegality of the U.S. occupation .
That acknowledged illegality should be seen as an opportunity to implement the clear will of the Iraqi people and a majority of the American people .
The result should be immediate steps to return all U.S. troops to their bases , and begin the process of immediate withdrawal of not only combat troops but also U.S. - paid non-Iraqi contractors , and closure of the U.S. bases .
Although much of the nation ’s attention is captive to the current elections , there ’s an immediate need for a strong response against the latest round of negotiations that includes :
Opposing any U.S. - Iraq agreement to maintain the U.S. occupation , whether it ’s for one month or three years .
Opposing any such agreement being negotiated or signed without U.S. congressional and Iraqi parliamentary approval .
Rejecting interim measures designed to continue the occupation .
Standing against any Security Council decision to extend the current mandate authorizing the U.S. - led occupation in Iraq ; we call on the United Nations to stand with global civil society in defense of international law and its own charter , to oppose the continuing occupation of Iraq .

As is The Ticket 's custom , a post listing the entire roster of appearances on this Sunday 's interview programs will pop up Saturday at noon PDT ( 3 p.m. EDT ) .
But here 's an advance heads up , in part because of who WON'T be found on any of the chat shows .
Three of the four now - official candidates on the major - party presidential tickets are scheduled to sit down for questions : Democrat Barack Obama on ABC's " This Week , " his running mate , Joe Biden , on NBC's " Meet the Press " and Republican John McCain on CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
Absent from this list , of course , is the GOP 's star of the moment , the not - so - long - ago obscure governor of Alaska who is McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin .
Since she was thrust onto the national stage a week ago , her appearances on it have been tightly regulated by the McCain campaign : a few side - by - side campaign stops with him and , of course , her big speech to the GOP 's convention Wednesday night .
Today , top McCain aide Rick Davis indicated the campaign is n't in any hurry to slot Palin for a Sunday show appearance -- and will do so only if he and other strategists determine it serves the ticket 's purposes , not because some may view it as a required initiation for a major political player .
Appearing on MSNBC's " Morning Joe " show , Davis said , " I 'd never commit to anything in the future .
...
Our strategy is in our hands , not the media's .
We 're going to do what 's in our best interests to try to win the election .
If we think going on TV news shows are [ sic ] in our best interests , we 'll do it .
If we do n't , we wo n't . "
Palin still will be busy this weekend .
She 'll campaign Saturday with McCain in two key states -- Colorado and New Mexico -- and she 'll deliver his campaign 's weekly radio address .
That 's one of those trappings of the presidency McCain has borrowed ( notwithstanding the barbs his forces like to sling at Obama along these lines ) .

A man jumped into the Berlin zoo enclosure of famed polar bear Knut this morning , police say , but officials were able to keep him away from the animal .
The 30 - year - old jumped over a fence into a water - filled ditch at the edge of the enclosure .
Zoo officials managed to distract two - year - old Knut and lured him into his cage .
Officers later led the man away unharmed .
Police said the intruder told them that he felt lonely and that Knut also appeared to be lonely .
The man did not give the impression of being mentally disturbed , police said .
Knut was hand - reared after his mother rejected him at birth .
He rose to fame early last year as a cute little white ball of fluff , but has since grown rapidly into a 440 lb ( 200 kg ) predator .
Zookeepers have become increasingly worried about the bear 's psychological health – the rejection by his mother and human hand - rearing have left him addicted to human laughter and applause .
One keeper said Knut had become so used to attention that he cried when no one was near his enclosure .
Thomas Dorflein , the keeper who reared Knut , was found dead in his Berlin flat in September .

wchar_tは決し てUnicode( UCS2/4)ではないよというお話の第1回目。
そんなん 仕様を読めば一目瞭然です罠 。
wchar_t
Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct wide - character codes for all members of the largest character set specified among the locales supported by the compilation environment : the null character has the code value 0 and each member of the portable character set has a code value equal to its value when used as the lone character in an integer character constant .
読めば判るとおり、wchar_tの決まり事は
数値型であるこ と wchar_t1文字でその文字集合の全ての文字を表せること nul文字 は( wchar_t ) 0であること PCS の 文字はwchar_t == charであるこ と( つまり L'A ' == ' A'であるこ と )
これだけしか決まってません。
ふつ ーC言語で「未定義」といやー「実装依存」であるわけで、これ以外の挙動
例えばwchar_tの値を直に参照( 例えば if ( wc == 0x1234 ) とか ) するとそれはすなわち
死亡フラグちゅーことです。
そもそもこの4.の条件があるので、EBCDICなどISO646と互換性の無い
文字コードを使用する 夜王 ホストなどの世界においては、wchar_t == UCS2/4を採用すると
たちまちwchar_t == charの仕様を満たせなくなりますやね( UCS2/4はISO646-US互換なので ) 。
つまりは元々wchar_tをUCS2/4のコードポイントとして実装すること自体無理があるわけで
* 1 。
しかーし一方 でC99には事前定義マクロ__STDC_ISO_10646__というものがネジ込まれております。
__STDC_ISO_10646__
An integer constant of the form yyyymmL ( for example , 199712L ) .
If this symbol is defined , then every character in the " Unicode required set " , when stored in an object of type wchar_t , has the same value as the short identifier of that character .
The " Unicode required set " consists of all the characters that are defined by ISO / IEC 10646 , along with all amendments and technical corrigenda , as of the specified year and month .
この事前定義マクロが定義されている場合は常に
wchar_t == ISO10646 ( =Unicode ) codepoint
を保証するというとってもアレなシロモノです。
ちゅーわけでこのエントリは正確には
wchar_t != Unicode ( UCS2/4 ) ※但し事前定義マクロ__STDC_ISO_10646__が定義されていない場合
ですな、まぁでもwchar_t == Unicodeを期待したコードは移植性が無いちゅうことには何ら変わりはないんだけど。
んで移植性のないコードを書いたのなら
# if !defined ( __STDC_ISO_10646__ ) #error " U.C.S !! U.C.S !! " #endif
とでも書いといて 「 お前の姉ちゃん次世 代CCSだな」でないプラットフォームでは
エラー出すようにするのがマナーでございます。
ユージュアリーフォースユニコード 非__STDC_ISO_10646__環境でも常にwchar_t == Unicodeを想定したコードを書いて Linux / Windowsでは動く がSolarisや*BSDでは確実にクラッシュし、あのOSは不安定だと 初心者に思わせるキラーアプリ。ports/pkgsrc developerは死ぬ
まぁ具体的にそれぞれのOSがwchar_tをどーゆー実装してるかはまた次回以降で。
話を戻してじゃぁ__STDC_ISO_10646__の場合、前述のEBCDICはどうすんのよ？
ちゅう疑問が沸いてきますがそこは技術力より政治力(笑)
4.の条件について DR#279ちゅーバグレポが上がってきた際、どーどーと改悪しとりやすね。
これTC 2を読むと上記の4.の条件は削除され以下のよなコメントが書かれておりやす。
C90 specifies the rule that L'x ' == ' x ' for any member x of the basic character set .
The Committee discussed whether to relax or tighten this rule .
In AMD1 , this rule is preserved without any changes .
Applying the rule to all single - byte characters , however , imposes an unnecessary constraint on implementations with regard to wide - character encodings .
It prohibits an implementation from having a common wide - character encoding for multiple multibyte encodings .
It also prohibits an implementation from having a wide - character encoding based on a different standard than its single byte encoding ( e.g. , ISO 10646 and EBCDIC ) .
これ困ったことにソース互換性がC90AMD1
→C99で失われちまうのだけどね。
wchar_t wc = L'A ' ; int c = ' A ' ; if ( wc == c ) { ... }
みたいなコードを書いた場合、C90AMD1まではPCSの範囲ならこの条件分岐はOKだったのに
C99TC2以降はこのコードはnul文字以外では場合は未定義動作となってしまったという。
これコンパイラでも警告だせないような変更だし困るのですが…にんともかんとも。
( 追記 ) DR # 321の件を忘れてました、 ここ参照。
まぁさらっと見ただけでも__STDC_ISO_10646__って技術的に無理を通してるのが判りますが
問題点はこれだけにはとどまりません。
そのへんの話は既にitojunさんの paper で
「 なぜUnicodeでは足りんの か ？( Why Unicode is not enough ? ) 」として語られていますので
今更私が書いても 「 余計なもの(-1)」になる気もしますが、これも次回以降にて説明したいと思います。
Earlier this week Apple announced it had sold a staggering 6.9 million iPhones in Q3 2008 , beating RIM ’s 6.1 million BlackBerry sales and crowning Apple as one of the top three mobile vendors worldwide .
And thanks to the company ’s “ Think Different ” bookkeeping , their $ 4.6 billion profit for the quarter is n’t just gross handset sales , but a mere portion of a typical AT&T 24 - month contract .
With every other handset manufacturer rushing to market with a touchscreen mobile of their own you cannot deny that Apple has hit an out - of - the - park home run with the iPhone 3G .
So why am I not using one ?
Even though I ’m a Mac user of thirteen years I ’ve also eight years of smartphone experience under my belt , going back to the infamous VisorPhone , in fact .
And for me there are still four major ways in which Apple ’s monster handheld comes up short :
1. The Keypad – With a growing number of iPhones around me I ’ve had lots of opportunities to play with the virtual keypad .
It ’s definitely quicker and more intuitive than using T9 — particularly with one hand — but still ca n’t match the speed of a physical QWERTY .
And I know a thing or two about physical QWERTY keypads .
2 . The Contracts – I remain fundamentally opposed to carrier contracts for GSM - based devices .
And while Apple has certainly revolutionized the mobile handset interface , its dealings with telcos worldwide have been anything but .
I ’ll let this excellent IntoMobile editorial explain .
3 . The Camera – How can you possibly argue that a 2 megapixel fixed - focus camera with no flash or video is better than a 5 ( or even 8 ! ) megapixel auto - focus camera with both ?
4 . The Killer App – I ’ve been combing through the iTunes App Store since it became available in Canada and I ’ve yet to see that one program that makes the iPhone a must - have device .
With all the smart developers out there embracing the platform I ’ve a strong feeling that it ’s on the way , but from what I ’ve seen the iPhone ’s killer app is still iTunes , as it has been since day one .
If anyone out there has a killer app for the iPhone , by all means let me know !
With the presidential election only a week away , the financial crisis has been dominating the news , but behind it is an even larger question of war vs. peace .
This article will appear in a forthcoming issue of Eurasia Critic magazine .
INTRODUCTION
World war or world peace is the blunt choice that will face either Barack Obama or John McCain when one of them is elected president of the United States on Tuesday , November 4 , 2008 .
For a major eruption of violence to be averted , the new president must deal positively with the reappearance of Russia on the world stage , the emergence of China as an economic force , and the aspirations of all the nations on earth for a decent and secure way of life .
Making matters much more dangerous are the ongoing financial crisis , along with what appears to be the start of a worldwide economic recession of as yet undetermined depth and duration .
It is Europe , not the U.S. , from which proposals are emerging for a transformative approach to the most compelling issues .
But will it be enough ?
THE DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY OF GEORGE W. BUSH
In December 2000 , at the time the U.S. Supreme Court was intervening in the disputed vote count in Florida to name Republican George W. Bush president over Democrat Al Gore , the stock market began to crash .
The “ dot.com ” bubble , based largely on foreign investment in internet companies and technology stocks , deflated .
By the time Bush was inaugurated in January 2001 , signs of a recession were appearing .
This did not prevent the Bush administration from initiating a $ 450 billion tax cut for the upper income brackets that Congress approved in March 2001 .
A similar cut was subsequently enacted in May 2003 .
On September 11 , 2001 , the World Trade Center ’s Twin Towers in New York City were attacked by airplanes flying into them , followed that morning by an air attack on the Pentagon in Washington , D.C .
Terrorists from Al Qaeda , an organization of Islamic extremists associated with the Afghan mujaheddin , and a Saudi figure , Osama bin Laden , alleged to be their leader , were blamed .
The wealthy bin Laden family had close ties to the U.S. and the Bush family .
Within a few weeks , the Bush administration pulled a battle plan from the shelves of the Pentagon and invaded Afghanistan .
The object was to wrest control of that nation from the Taliban , supposedly Al Qaeda collaborators .
A new U.S. Asian land war had begun .
In March 2003 , the Bush administration added to the Afghan action the second invasion of Iraq in the past thirteen years , following the “ Shock and Awe ” aerial attack .
The assaults on Afghanistan and Iraq , with torture of prisoners , use of depleted uranium weapons , and killing of civilians , was methodical and brutal .
Americans who had opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s were appalled at how history was repeating itself .
The public was subjected to a relentless barrage of pro-war propaganda by square - jawed military talking heads
Behind the scenes were the international financial and oil interests who stood to benefit from the removal of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein as an independent actor in the Middle East .
Financiers like David Rockefeller , who had founded the Trilateral Commission and was one of the “ internationalist ” leaders of what had come to be called the “ New World Order , ” tended to remain in the shadows , but their presence was palpable .
Rockefeller had reportedly expressed his world view in a statement at a 1991 meeting of the Bilderberg Group :
“ The supra-national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto - determination practiced in past centuries . ”
With respect to most of the U.S. military actions after World War II , especially the ones after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 , an argument could be made that the internationalists were using the U.S. military as their personal global police force .
Even so , the Neocons — “ new conservatives ” — who had rushed to the forefront after September 11 , 2001 , working chiefly through Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice - President Richard Cheney , seemed to be a more radical element than the officials who had been in charge during the Clinton years , when the U.S. and NATO went to war against Serbia .
Many of the Neocons were Jewish , with strong ties to Israel .
In 1997 the Neocons had created the Project for a New American Century , which advocated a new invasion of Iraq , and published a statement that positive change might result from a “ catalyzing event — a new Pearl Harbor . ”
Later this was interpreted as possibly having foreshadowed the 9/11 attacks .
President George W. Bush justified the Iraq invasion by claiming that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction .
Later this claim proved to be a lie .
To many the attack was a simple act of aggression .
Kofi Annan , Secretary General of the U.N. said of the invasion on September 16 , 2004 , “ I have indicated it was not in conformity with the U.N. charter .
From our point of view , from the charter point of view , it was illegal . ”
The U.S. paid no attention to Annan ’s misgivings .
The U.S. attack on Iraq was not without controversy , even among the international elite .
According to Daniel Estulin , writing in his breakthrough book , The Bildergerg Group , the Europeans at the 2001 Bilderberg Conference summoned Donald Rumsfeld and blasted him for prematurely planning an attack on Iraq that year .
But by 2003 , says Estulin , they were prepared to endorse it .
Still , the U.S. had far less active support from other nations than with the 1991 invasion of Iraq under George W. Bush ’s father .
WARS ARE NOT CHEAP
Starting in 2001 , the Bush administration had increased the frequency of White House meetings with Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Federal Reserve , who lowered interest rates by 550 basis points from January 2001 to June 2003 .
This succeeded in floating the U.S. economy through injecting a huge amount of cash into what came to be called the “ housing bubble . ”
It ’s consumer spending that keeps the U.S. economy running , but ever since the 1980s , when we began to export so many of our manufacturing jobs , family income had stagnated .
It has been established by researchers , and documented as well by Daniel Estulin , that at a certain point the financial elite made the momentous decision that the U.S. would be de-industrialized .
According to one account , this decision had been a topic of discussion in meetings in China , after Nixon ’s visit there in 1972 , that were held among David Rockefeller , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , and Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai .
When Rockefeller and Columbia University professor Zbigniew Brzezinski—later President Jimmy Carter ’s national security adviser — formed the Trilateral Commission in 1973 , the plan to turn the U.S. into a financial / service economy instead of the world ’s greatest industrial democracy seemed to become a key objective .
How well this program succeeded is shown by statistics from the website Economy in Crisis :
· From 1978 to July 2008 , more than 16,613 U.S. companies were sold to foreign corporations .
· The steel , publishing , textile , machine tool , automobile , and electronics industries declined sharply .
· By 2006 American manufacturers suffered a twenty - two percent structural cost disadvantage compared to overseas competitors through taxes , health and pension benefits , litigation , regulation , and unequal environment protection .
· In 2006 , $ 1 in $ 4 of US consumption on manufactured goods went immediately and directly to imports .
· In 2007 China alone exported over $ 321 billion in goods to the United States compared to the $ 62 billion in goods we exported to them .
The U.S. trade deficit , estimated to exceed $ 800 billion in 2008 , is costing $ 1.5 million per minute in remittance to foreign companies .
· Three million high - paying manufacturing jobs were lost between 2000 and 2005 alone .
The U.S. lost 63 thousand jobs just in February of 2008 .
· Foreign manufacturers operating in the U.S. accounted for over twenty percent of our exports and manufacturing assets , and a large percentage of our employment in 2006 .
· As of December , 2007 , the U.S owed fifty - three percent of its debt to foreign countries and other international interests .
This is 25.5 percent of our total national deficit , and we finance nearly 100 percent of all new borrowings from foreign interests .
Our competitors are now our bankers .
· High - paying goods - producing industries have lost net employment over the past twenty - seven years , while lower paying non-tradable services - providing employment has doubled .
· In 2004 , China and India graduated a combined 950,000 engineers versus 70,000 in the U.S. The United States ranks near the bottom of science / math proficiency
Beginning around 1991 - 92 , with cheap credit now flowing from the Federal Reserve System , home prices soared .
The money from new mortgages and home equity loans became a virtual “ cash cow ” for families strapped for cash .
The federal government had already been taking steps during the 1990s to ease mortgage credit so that more families could purchase homes .
But after 2001 , many more loans were based on fraudulent mortgage applications , where brokers exaggerated borrower incomes .
ABC
News later reported that during this period risk analysts at Washington Mutual , one of the nation ’s largest banks , were told to ignore high risk loans because lending had to be maximized .
Those who objected were disciplined or fired .
On Wall Street , banks that wrote mortgages began to offload them by packaging them into mortgage - backed securities that were sold around the world as bonds to banks and investors .
Risk analysts at the leading credit - rating agencies , such as Standard and Poor ’s , Moody ’s , and Fitch , gave their highest ratings to mortgage - backed securities whose risks were later acknowledged to be grossly underestimated .
Also , mortgage companies , with Alan Greenspan ’s endorsement , began to offer more Adjustable Rate Mortgages ( ARMs ) , loans that would reset at higher rates in future years .
Mortgage brokers fed the growing bubble by telling people they should buy now , because housing prices would keep going up and they could resell at a profit before their ARMs escalated .
As a result of the bubble , large amounts of money began to flow into the economy , not only from mortgages and home equity loans , but also from capital gains on the resale of inflating property .
Meanwhile , in the world of investment securities , the Securities and Exchange Commission reduced the amount of their own capital investors were required to bring to the table , resulting in a large increase in bank leveraging of speculative trading .
This fed additional bubbles in the equity , hedge fund , derivatives , and commodities markets .
The SEC also eliminated most of its Office of Risk Management through budget cuts .
According to an April 2008 Washington
Post article by New York governor Elliot Spitzer , state attorneys - general who wanted to investigate allegations of mortgage fraud were blocked from doing so by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within the U.S. Treasury Department .
There was no federal agency charged with regulating mortgage fraud to take up the slack .
Spitzer made these charges just before he was forced to resign from office over a sex scandal disclosed by a leak of FBI investigative documents .
Thus it appeared that a major part of U.S. economic growth was tainted by outright criminality , with collusion from the highest levels of the U.S. government , the Federal Reserve System , and the financial industry .
But the housing and investment bubbles generated enough economic activity and tax revenues through 2006 to allow the Bush war policy to be implemented .
George W. Bush was reelected in 2004 at the height of the bubbles .
By 2005 , the housing bubble alone was accounting for half of all U.S. growth and yielding substantial tax revenues to all levels of government .
Still , the Bush administration was running huge budget deficits from expenditures on the increasingly - expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Congress approved funding for the Afghan and Iraqi wars even after the Democratic Party regained majority control in the 2006 elections .
The funding also allowed for the start of construction in Baghdad of the world ’s largest U.S. embassy , as well as permanent military bases in Iraq .
During this time , an internal battle raged between the U.S. State Department , which wanted to implement a plan to rebuild Iraq ’s civilian infrastructure , and the Defense Department , which was mainly interested in military occupation .
Defense won out .
L. Paul Bremer , former U.S. foreign service officer and managing director of Kissinger and Associates , was named occupation director .
But the Iraqi economy and physical infrastructure were shattered .
Two to three million Iraqi civilians were killed , injured , or driven into exile .
The housing bubble began to collapse when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 425 basis points from June 2003 to June 2006 .
In January 2006 , Ben Bernanke replaced Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman .
Greenspan had been chairman for nineteen years during which the largest financial bubbles in world history were created .
This sequence of events led some to contend that the Federal Reserve had both deliberately created the housing bubble , then deliberately destroyed it .
Hundreds of millions of people around the world , including U.S. homeowners and foreign investors , ultimately were trapped in the Greenspan / Bernanke pincers .
By 2007 , the federal government ’s debt was over $ 9 trillion and reached $ 10.3 trillion by October 2008 .
It was now obvious that a serious economic downturn lay ahead .
By 2007 , signs of a recession loomed , as homeowners who had signed up for “ subprime ” and ARM mortgages began to default .
By 2008 the number of home foreclosures would exceed four million .
The mortgage - based bonds sold through Wall Street brokerage houses to U.S. and foreign investors , began to prove worthless .
They had proliferated around the world as virtual time - bombs in investment portfolios .
By August 2008 , foreign investors , such as the Bank of China , were becoming increasingly involved in the crisis .
Reuters ran a story that Chinese banks planned to stop investing in U.S. markets , which the Chinese government denied , but the threat remained .
If the Chinese and other Asian exporting and petroleum - rich nations pull out , the days of “ dollar hegemony , ” where the dollar constitutes the world ’s reserve currency , providing almost unlimited funding for the U.S. commercial and military empire , will be over .
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HITS A WALL
By the first presidential primary elections of 2008 in Iowa and New Hampshire , the campaign to select the next president of the United States was underway .
The eight - year George W. Bush presidency would be ending within a year .
By now the Bush years seemed to exemplify the most grievously wrong - headed aspects of U.S. foreign and domestic policy since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 .
The 2008 election will mark the end of an era , though no one knows for sure what will come next .
What has to be questioned are an economy that has been downgraded from one based on industry to a service economy structured around finance , an aggressive military policy with U.S. forces engaged around the world , and trade and fiscal deficits as far as the eye can see .
With all this going on , the Bush White House has brought the world ’s most powerful nation to a point of crisis , possibly even to the brink of catastrophe .
In retrospect it can be seen that U.S. military occupation of the Middle East , focusing on Iraq and involving extensive collaboration with Israel , was an extension of the century - long attempt by the Anglo - Americans to control the region ’s fossil fuel resources .
But the nation of Iraq and its people had been crushed in the meantime .
Even if the U.S. were to withdraw combat forces at some time in the future , the permanent military bases it plans to leave behind will be islands in a sea of hostility .
Today even these bases are in jeopardy , as Iraq ’s elected government pressures the U.S. to commit to a complete withdrawal by 2011 .
Iran has clearly been strengthened by U.S. action to destroy Sunni power in Iraq and has been emboldened by the successes of Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon in standing up to the Israelis .
U.S. intentions to attack Iran have evoked strong opposition among Europeans and can be seen to have enhanced the influence of Russia and China , since Iran is now an observing member of the Shanghai Cooperative Organization .
After initial successes in Afghanistan , U.S. forces have become bogged down in protecting the capital of Kabul , where President Hamid Karzai rules under virtual siege , while the Taliban have come back to contest control of the countryside .
The U.S. has resorted to bombing sorties which often kill civilians and has begun to escalate the war by sending raiding parties into neighboring Pakistan .
After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union , the U.S. , acting through NATO , moved aggressively to extend its influence into the former Soviet republics and surround Russia with nations friendly to the West .
The former Soviet Union and Soviet satellite states that joined NATO were Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , the Czech Republic and Slovakia ( formerly part of Czechoslovakia ) , Bulgaria , and Romania .
The European members of NATO have not yet agreed to extend invitations to the Ukraine and Georgia after those nations expressed interest following establishment of pro-Western governments , though a communiqué after the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest indicated membership would be forthcoming .
But the NATO façade may have cracked , as shown by a recent trip by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to St. Petersburg for meetings with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev .
According to a report by George Friedman :
The central question on the table was Germany ’s position on NATO expansion , particularly with regard to Ukraine and Georgia .
Merkel made it clear at a joint press conference that Germany would oppose NATO membership for both of these countries , and that it would even oppose placing the countries on the path to membership .
Since NATO operates on the basis of consensus , any member nation can effectively block any candidate from NATO membership .
The fact that Merkel and Germany have chosen this path is of great significance .
Merkel acted in full knowledge of the U.S. view on the matter and is prepared to resist any American pressure that might follow .
Also by 2008 the U.S. was losing influence with the former Soviet republics of Central Asia — Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan — which had joined with Russia and China in the SCO .
In central and south Asia , as well as Africa , nations have been unwilling to act as hosts for new U.S. military bases .
The U.S. had been losing ground in Central Asia and elsewhere even before Georgia invaded its former province of South Ossetia on August 8 , 2008 .
The invasion of South Ossetia by Georgia ’s forces , armed and trained by the U.S. and Israel , was crushed so decisively by the Russians as to be a major embarrassment to the Bush administration .
According to Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili ’s former defense minister Irakly Okruashvili , Saakashvili carried out the attack despite warnings from the U.S. that they could not come to his aid militarily .
Okruashvili faulted the U.S. for not being sufficiently critical of Saaksashvili in the months leading up to the attack .
From this report it is unclear whether the U.S. , while trying to keep Georgia in its orbit as a pathway for natural gas pipelines , was trying to goad Russia into a major military confrontation , though such a scenario seemed possible .
Of course the U.S. media and politicians blamed only Russia for the conflict .
In Latin America , the Hugo Chavez regime in Venezuela has begun to forge an alliance with Russia , even to the point of announcing a plan for joint naval maneuvers in the Caribbean .
Chavez is also acting as an inspiration to populist movements elsewhere in South America , including those in Bolivia and Ecuador .
Announcements by Vladimir Putin , now the Russian prime minister , that Russia is opposed to a unipolar world were reminiscent of the 1970s , when President Richard Nixon and Russian General Secretary Leonid Brehznev met as equals to forge the policy of détente .
Putin created a sensation on February 10 , 2007 , at the 43rd Munich Conference on Security Policy , when he said :
“ What is a uni-polar world ?
No matter how we beautify this term , it means one single center of power , one single center of force , and one single master . ”
Speaking of the U.S. , Putin said :
The United States has overstepped its borders in all spheres — economic , political and humanitarian — and has imposed itself on other states .
… Local and regional wars did not get fewer , the number of people who died did not get less but increased .
We see no kind of restraint – a hyper - inflated use of force .
…[ The U.S. ] has gone from one conflict to another without achieving a fully - fledged solution to any of them .
Putin clearly has rejected the one - world aspirations of the Western financial elite which acts through U.S. military power .
After the Georgian crisis , Dmitry Medvedev , Putin ’s successor as president , reiterated :
The world must be multipolar .
Single polarity is unacceptable .
Russia cannot accept a world order in which any decisions will be made by a sole nation , even such a serious one as the United States .
Such a world order will be unstable and fraught with conflicts .
Where did the European Union ( EU ) fit in after the Georgia debacle ?
Clearly the Europeans were not passive spectators to a U.S. - Russian standoff .
European leaders moved quickly to negotiate a cease - fire in Georgia followed by withdrawal of Russian troops .
The more the EU acts as a bloc , the more it seems that a new nationalist entity has come into existence , complete with its own Euro - based currency .
The European population wants peace , prosperity , justice , and to be left alone .
They particularly do not want to be dragged into America ’s wars .
The EU has also taken the lead economically with a 2007 GDP of $ 16.8 trillion vs. $ 13.8 for the U.S. ( IMF figures )
In the Middle East times are changing too .
Israel , for instance , seems to be in social crisis .
Though Jews are both leaving Israel and moving in , the population is stable but small .
Of a population of 7.3 million , 5.5 million are Jewish Israelis .
A substantial minority of non-Jews are imported laborers .
But Israel has a poorly - formed middle class .
The gap in Israel between rich and poor is growing , as in the U.S. , often with only minimum wage jobs available , even to military veterans .
Also , common lands in the kibbutzim are being privatized , and residents reportedly are tending to withdraw from peripheral areas to settle around Tel Aviv for safety from strife with the Palestinians .
Some Israeli politicians say that Iran , with its supposed nuclear ambitions , poses an “ existential threat ” to the nation .
But there are reports that the U.S. has told Israel they will not be permitted to attack Iran on their own .
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE
If the Bush administration is being challenged in the foreign policy arena , in the area of macroeconomics it may have been checkmated .
As stated previously , the financial crisis deepened in the late summer of 2008 when China and the other nations of the world that had been floating the U.S. fiscal and trade deficits by their purchase of public and private securities became alarmed .
This was in reaction to Wall Street ’s issuance of the huge amount of “ toxic ” debt from mortgage - backed securities that were now collapsing in value as the housing bubble imploded .
Analyst William Engdahl has stated that the financial meltdown was secretly planned in order to weaken the European banking system .
Engdahl wrote :
“ As one senior European banker put it to me in private discussion , ‘ There is an all - out war going on between the United States and the EU to define the future face of European banking . ’ ”
The start of the recession and the decline of purchasing power by consumers who can no longer borrow quantities of money also means that the U.S. will cease as the customer of last resort whose purchases conveniently float the world economy .
The Japanese , sitting on billions of U.S. dollars in their bank accounts , are reportedly furious that U.S. consumers might no longer support the abundant lifestyle of the world ’s richest nation .
The dollar is so shaky that some nations are reducing their dollar reserves and turning to other currencies .
Talk has been rampant about a worldwide shift to a multi-currency regime , possibly including the Euro , the Yuan , the Yen , and even the Ruble .
In March 2007 the Governor of China ’s Central Bank Zhou Xiaochuan announced :
“ China will diversify its $ 1 trillion foreign exchange reserves , the largest in the world , across different currencies and investment instruments , including in emerging markets . ”
The U.S. Council on Foreign Relations is supporting the movement to a multiple currency regime in its journal , Foreign Affairs .
Though the federal government denies any concrete plans , the so - called Amero has been mentioned as the currency of a hypothetical North American Union made up of the U.S. , Canada , and Mexico .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration , led by Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson , working in league with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , has begun to introduce gigantic amounts of publicly - backed credit to rescue the exploding financial system .
As recently as 2006 , the U.S. financial industry earned over $ 500 billion in profits — an astronomical sum .
Some hedge fund managers were earning $ 1 billion a year .
Now Wall Street is a disaster scene , with financial firms losing over 200,000 jobs in a year and major investment banks going bankrupt .
Also , the two quasi - governmental mortgage guarantee agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , have failed .
Despite their lavishing $ 175 million in the last decade on buying influence from Congress , the government has fired their executives and is taking the two agencies over in a conservatorship .
The government also took over insurance giant AIG .
When , on September 23 , 2008 , Henry Paulson asked for $ 700 billion dollars to purchase bad debt from U.S. and foreign banks without any oversight or guarantee of success , Congress revolted , with the House of Representatives rejecting the proposal in an initial vote .
They did so because their constituents were enraged with the terms proposed by the Bush administration for a gigantic giveaway of taxpayers ’ money .
U.S. taxpayers could now be finding themselves on the hook for possibly trillions of dollars of debt liabilities due to Wall Street mismanagement and fraud .
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have begun belated criminal investigations .
Americans on “ Main Street ” and their representatives in Congress remain horrified .
Some say the capitalist era is over .
The financiers and stock brokers have run rampant in the 2000s under President George W. Bush .
They ’ve been called , only half - jokingly , “ The Masters of the Universe . ”
But their excesses have been encouraged by the Bush administration , the Federal Reserve , and the government ’s regulatory agencies , which have combined to facilitate an explosion of leveraged speculation in the housing , hedge , equity , commodity , and derivative markets .
More shocks undoubtedly lie ahead .
By September 2008 , as the bubbles were starting to blow up , the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression was underway .
Despite initial opposition , Congress caved in to pressure from Bush and the bank lobbyists and approved a revised version of Paulson ’s plan .
According to reports , including a statement on the floor of the House of Representatives by Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) , members of Congress were threatened with a declaration of martial law to keep public order if the measure failed .
The Treasury Department has started to float new bond issues to raise money to buy the bad mortgage debt , not only from U.S. banks but from foreign investors as well .
Meanwhile the stock market is continuing to decline and by October 10 had lost almost forty percent of its value in a year .
Over $ 8 trillion in wealth had vanished from U.S. markets , including the retirement savings and dividend income of tens of millions of people .
On October 24 , the Dow Jones closed at 8,378.95 vs. 14,198.1 on October 11 , 2007 .
At the same time , rising prices of oil , food , and other commodities have begun to produce another era of global stagflation , similar to the 1970s , though oil prices have fallen recently .
Still , the U.S. financial collapse is resulting in the onset of a worldwide recession that most commentators , including economists at the IMF , said could only get worse — possibly much worse .
Has the New World Order proved to be a parasite that killed its host ?
Maybe in the U.S. it has .
By early October 2008 , millions of Americans had been crushed by debt and were losing their homes to foreclosure , tent cities of the homeless were springing up , unemployment claims were soaring , and factory orders were plummeting .
The credit crisis is combining with shortage of consumer purchasing power to cause commerce to shut down at a time when stores should be increasing inventory for the Christmas season .
Most of the major chain stores are closing unprofitable retail outlets , throwing thousands of employees out of work .
With the financial system crashing it was only a month from the presidential election , when it would be up to the next president — either Barack Obama or John McCain — to deal with these calamities .
Other than a small “ stimulus ” tax rebate in the spring of 2008 , nothing had been done by the Bush administration to rebuild the weakened U.S. producing economy or help the rank and file consumer .
Whose fault was it ?
David Rockefeller had clearly been the leader during past decades of the “ intellectual elite and world bankers ” who would replace the old - fashioned nation - state and whose legacy the U.S. was now reaping .
Rockefeller had been quoted as saying at the United Nations on September 23 , 1994 :
“ This present window of opportunity , during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built , will not be open for too long .
We are on the verge of a global transformation .
All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . ”
Intended or not , the “ major crisis ” had arrived .
Rockefeller may have been a kind of “ Emperor of the West , ” but he is now 93 years old .
Yet he has successors who are now running things .
Henry Paulson is the most visible .
Also prominent are the heads of the largest banks who are being featured regularly in news reports , such as Jamie Dimon , CEO of the banking colossus J.P. Morgan Chase .
Washington Mutual Bank had run short on ready cash during the credit crisis , so Dimon ’s bank was able to acquire its $ 307 billion in assets for only $ 1.9 billion .
Commentators said it was a “ fire sale . ”
William Engdahl writes :
The Paulson plan is now clearly part of a project to create three colossal global financial giants —
Citigroup , JP MorganChase and , of course , Paulson ’s own Goldman Sachs , now conveniently enough a bank .
Having successfully used fear and panic to wrestle a $ 700 billion bailout from the U.S. taxpayers , now the big three will try to use their unprecedented muscle to ravage European banks in the years ahead .
THE 2008 ELECTION
When the financial crisis struck during the week of September 22 , it was only six weeks before the presidential election .
Democrat Barack Obama shot up in the polls , because voters perceived him as more likely than Republican John McCain to deal effectively with the situation .
Obama , with a Kenyan father and a white American mother , was the first African - American to run for the presidency of the U.S. on a major party ticket .
To many it was a shock that Obama had defeated such a formidable opponent as Hillary Clinton , wife of former president Bill Clinton , in the Democratic primaries .
Now Obama was the beneficiary of the bad economic news .
In American politics , Democrats , with their New Deal heritage and the semi-prosperity under Clinton in the 1990s , are viewed as being more in touch with the economic problems of ordinary citizens .
Also , the Democrats ’ income policies have generally favored the working and middle classes more than the rich , and Obama was promising to repeal the Bush tax cuts that benefited mainly the upper brackets .
Further , the incumbent party — in this case the Republicans — is more likely to be viewed as responsible for the current economic situation , good or bad , and McCain had consistently allied himself during his long Senate career with the financial deregulation dating from the Reagan years that was now proving disastrous .
McCain had just finished saying in a speech , “ The fundamentals of our economy are strong , ” but on Wednesday , September 24 , he changed his tune .
Now , he said , he was suspending his campaign and would return to Washington , D.C. , to help solve the crisis .
The Democrats howled with derision at this seeming act of political hypocrisy which showed , they said , how desperate McCain had become to maintain credibility .
Clearly the campaign had now changed — or had it ?
Until the financial crisis , both Obama and McCain had been extremely cautious in putting forth proposals , trying more to avoid saying anything the media could criticize than to suggest fundamental economic changes .
Also , Obama ’s presidential campaign had received huge contributions from Wall Street .
Both men had been presenting themselves as populists , the friends of the middle class .
McCain emphasized tax reduction and limitations on government spending as means of economic growth .
Obama spoke in favor of job creation , including five million new jobs from “ green energy ” — solar and wind power , etc .
He also promised to cut taxes for those earning less than $ 250,000 a year .
But neither had been convincing as signs of an economic recession began to accelerate .
Obama ’s five million new jobs , for instance , were an intention , not a plan .
But they were obviously needed .
The financial emergency hit after job losses of 60,000 for August were announced .
Nor did either offer many specifics or explain how they could implement new federal programs in the face of the gigantic budget deficits being projected .
CNN news commentator Lou Dobbs blasted them for delivering “ poll - driven sound bytes ” and failing “ to even mention real economic issues , ” like the overseas outsourcing of jobs .
Washington Post columnist David Broder accused the pair of “ running from reality . ”
Broder added :
“ The frustration that is growing stems from their mutual reluctance to talk candidly about the situation one of them will inherit .
If either of them has a clue what to do to help stabilize this tottering economy , he is keeping it to himself . ”
What was most clear about events was that the deregulation of the financial system that began in the 1980s now could be seen to have wrecked the U.S. economy .
But neither Obama nor McCain proposed regulatory changes or sought in any way to challenge the machinations of the financial titans .
THE CANDIDATES TAKE NOTICE OF THE DEEPENING CRISIS
Housing and home ownership are among the key issues .
During the housing bubble , the prices of homes inflated to two or three times their previous value .
Now these prices have been collapsing , though homeowners still have to make payments in excess of what the homes were now worth .
Critics have pointed out that the Wall Street bailout plan both Obama and McCain voted for was intended to keep home prices high , even if families have trouble making their mortgage payments and continue to lose their homes to foreclosure .
And mortgage payments are going up due to rising interest costs and the resetting of adjustable rate mortgages .
On October 8 , with the stock market still in free fall , the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the banking system , but the rise in mortgage interest rates for consumers continued .
It will be difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further because this weakens the dollar and makes investments in the U.S. economy less attractive for China , Japan , and other foreign dollar holders .
Up to this point there has been scant mention of the fact that there had been no increase in the level of investment in the U.S. producing economy in thirty - five years .
It is also a fact that with the rising level of unemployment and continued decline in the manufacturing job base , U.S. consumer purchasing power has caved in .
And despite the financial bailouts , there is still no new economic engine to lead a recovery .
During the week of October 6 , Obama continued to surge in the polls .
Both McCain and his vice - presidential candidate , Alaska governor Sarah Palin , had performed poorly in the televised debates , and the projections of state - by - state counts in the electoral college showed Obama approaching enough votes to ensure victory .
The election was now only a month away .
At this point the McCain campaign decided to “ go negative ” in criticizing Obama on “ character issues , ” with an unnamed “ high - ranking campaign official ” making the incredible admission to the New York Post that “ if the campaign focused on the economy we would lose . ”
McCain ’s team had already announced they were halting their campaigning in Michigan , perhaps the industrial state hit hardest by the economic downturn .
On the evening of Monday , October 13 , Obama tried to seize the initiative through a major address in Toledo , Ohio , on a new economic recovery plan which included the following provisions :
A tax credit of $ 3,000 per job for companies adding jobs in the U.S .
Elimination of capital gains taxes on investments in small and start - up businesses .
$ 25 billion of federal money for infrastructure projects .
Tax cuts for workers , middle - class employees , and senior citizens .
Extension of unemployment benefits .
Penalty - free hardship withdrawals from retirement accounts .
Allowing bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms for distressed consumers .
A ninety - day foreclosure moratorium for financial institutions that participated in the congressional bailout plan .
But there was a glitch .
Despite the variety of provisions and the obvious voter appeal , the plan would only provide a $ 50 billion stimulus to the economy , less than $ 175 per capita .
The amount would be dwarfed by the estimated total of $ 1.5 trillion the federal government had committed to between March 16 and October 3 to rescue the financial system .
The rescue included financial institution bailouts and takeovers , costs due to bank failures , new mortgage insurance , and tax breaks added to the bailout bill .
This largesse would have to be paid for by yet more government borrowing , with an unprecedented $ 1 trillion deficit looming for fiscal year 2009 .
Obama made a serious misrepresentation about the nature of the additional deficit by claiming that the government ’s $ 700 billion outlay in purchasing bad bank debt would be paid back when the loans the debt was based on were redeemed .
But the reason the debt was bad in the first place was that it came from mortgages that homeowners were expected to default on .
Not even the power of the federal government was going to squeeze blood from this turnip .
In Obama ’s wake came a host of progressive commentators offering their own stimulus proposals to be financed by government debt as though it would be as easy as turning on a garden hose .
An example was the $ 300 - $ 400 billion plan put forth by Rutgers University professor Eileen Appelbaum who , like Obama , never mentioned the possibility of increasing overall tax revenues or curbing military spending as funding sources .
The day after Obama put forth his plan , McCain said he would offer $ 52 billion in tax cuts but no stimulus spending .
He had campaigned against congressional “ earmarks , ” which were a type of budget appropriation for infrastructure projects proposed by representatives for their home districts .
McCain viewed federal infrastructure spending as “ pork , ” making it a taboo which he could not break at this late stage of the game .
The day McCain made his proposal , the government announced that $ 250 billion of the Wall Street bailout would be used for the Department of the Treasury to buy shares in the nation ’s largest banks .
This followed similar action announced for British banks by Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
The measure would restore some of the bank capitalization lost through loan defaults .
U.S. banks would now be partially nationalized .
A few days later , the Federal Reserve announced it would take over a critical function of the commercial banking industry by using its emergency powers to fund day - to - day operations of U.S. businesses through the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
In spite of all this , the Federal Reserve , the IMF , and every commentator writing on the subject was still predicting a long and deep recession for both the U.S. and world economies .
Around the world stock markets continued to fall .
Meanwhile , in foreign affairs , there has been a subtle movement among the U.S. establishment over the last three years away from Israel .
Former president Jimmy Carter ’s book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , was a milestone .
Also , Obama ’s vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden reportedly told Israel they would have to live with a nuclear Iran .
The candidates made the required nods in the direction of Israel as a valued ally , but none spent much valuable air time on the topic .
Jewish voters typically voted with the Democratic Party and were not seeing any reason to switch .
Obama still had a credibility problem , except it was with progressive voters .
In running after having served in the U.S. Senate for only four years , Obama had come out of nowhere to capture the imagination of younger and highly - educated voters sick of Bush ’s wars .
But far from being the peace candidate he seemed to be early in his election bid , now when he said he had opposed the Iraq War from the start , he clarified his position to mean that he only opposed it because the U.S. should have been focusing its military efforts more on Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He talked about “ taking out Osama bin Laden , ” referring to the 9/11 attacks seven years ago .
But bin Laden had n’t reliably been seen or heard from for years , and some doubt he is even still alive .
Obama also said , in accepting the Democratic Party nomination for president in Denver on August 28 , that he would “ truly stand up for Georgia ” and “ curb Russian aggression . ”
Later Obama called Russia ’s actions “ evil . ”
Biden referred in his acceptance speech to “ Russia ’s challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia . ”
Obviously , these aggressive positions , based on falsehoods , could trigger a U.S. - Russian confrontation if pushed to their logical extremes .
McCain has been serving in Washington , D.C. , in the House or the Senate , since 1983 .
He is a former Vietnam prisoner of war and the son and grandson of Navy admirals .
He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 with a dismal ranking of 894 out of 899 .
McCain is the favored candidate of the military - industrial complex and , with Alaska governor Sarah Palin as nominee for vice - president , the religious right - wing .
He is also the one who would likely ensure continued record - setting oil company profits .
While Obama called for an oil windfall profits tax that could yield $ 15 billion a year in new federal revenue , McCain ’s proposals “ would deliver a $ 3.8 billion tax cut to the five largest American oil companies , ” according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund .
$ 1.2 billion of the cut would go to Exxon - Mobil , largely associated with the Rockefeller family .
McCain had tried to appeal to the Christian fundamentalist constituency by picking Sarah Palin as his vice - presidential running mate , though no candidate for that office ever had less experience at the national level .
She said that the Iraq War was “ God ’s task , ” while British Petroleum reportedly was a sponsor for her inauguration .
Many thoughtful people , including conservative commentator George Will , have been dissconcerted at the prospect of a McCain / Palin presidency .
Will , with his typical patrician understatement , said McCain ’s reaction to the economic crisis was “ un- presidential ” and “ made some of us fearful . ”
McCain also has a reputation for a bad temper and making snap judgments .
The selection of Sarah Palin seemed like an example of the latter .
McCain is the oldest presidential candidate in history and not of the best health .
People have been looking at Sarah Palin in light of the terrifying prospects that such a seemingly clueless person could occupy the White House if McCain died in office .
If Obama had been in danger of losing the progressive wing of the Democratic Party by his unwillingness to separate himself sufficiently from the Bush administration ’s militant foreign policy , events were still in his favor .
By early October , with the highly unpopular bailout having been approved and the stock market continuing to sink , Obama remained calm in the televised debates and in campaign speeches .
For an outdoor speech in St. Louis , Obama drew 100,000 spectators .
He has begun to look like a president - in - waiting , while McCain seems increasingly the man time has passed by .
But the next president could be faced with momentous decisions if he cares to make them .
Events since the late 1970s showed how much the philosophy in U.S. ruling circles had moved away from President Richard Nixon ’s concept of a multilateral world based on a balance of power to one of world conquest by an international order headed by the global financiers and enforced by a militant U.S. government .
Therefore it is difficult for many observers to be hopeful about seeing the U.S. take its place among a peaceful family of nations .
Both candidates promised “ change . ”
But would they change anything that really made a difference ?
Or would they just follow orders ?
As the campaign entered its final month , it was Obama ’s to lose .
Still , many people believed that the real reason George W. Bush had won the 2000 and 2004 elections was due to campaign fraud in Florida and Ohio respectively and feared that something similar could happen in 2008 .
Would the Republicans steal what was arguably one of the most important presidential elections in U.S. history ?
The New York Times reported on October 9 :
“ Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law . ”
The Obama campaign was even calling for appointment of a federal special prosecutor to investigate allegations of illegalities .
As Obama continued to rise in the polls and McCain fell further behind , some said that if McCain did win the election , it could be done only through dishonest means .
If the Republicans do steal the election and elect McCain / Palin , a coalition of progressive activists led by David Swanson has pledged to take action .
Swanson wrote :
If your television declares John McCain the president elect on the evening of November 4th , your television will be lying .
You should immediately pick up your pre-packed bags and head straight to the White House in Washington , D.C. , which we will surround and shut down until this attempt at a third illegitimate presidency is reversed .
Then there were those who suspected that the 9/11 terrorist attacks had been carried out by elements within the Bush administration — or that they looked the other way and “ allowed ” the attacks to happen — and were afraid the Republicans would do something similar to arouse the fears of voters while McCain was staggering to apparent defeat .
Rumors that such an event was planned have been swirling for over a year .
Such speculation , along with the fears about election fraud , shows just how much eight years of Bush and Vice - President Richard Cheney has alienated the public and how little the president and his party are trusted .
EUROPE WEIGHS IN
But no matter whether Obama or McCain is elected , the U.S. is part of a larger world where its credibility is in the gutter and where economic weakness has begun to remove its power of choice .
It has already been noted that it was foreign creditors , especially China , that appeared to be threatening to pull the plug on the U.S. government ’s incessant borrowing which may have been the trigger that forced Henry Paulson to admit a crisis had hit by going to Congress for the financial rescue package .
Then with the election only two weeks away , it became clear that Europe had something different in mind than letting the U.S. return to its old ways of what might be called “ Wild West ” economics .
After all , for several decades , U.S. politicians and businessmen had run all over the globe grabbing whatever they desired in order to support the world ’s most wasteful and resource - intensive lifestyle .
At the same time as the U.S. was trying to shore up its failing — and flailing — financial industry , the nations of the EU have been taking actions to protect themselves .
Except that the EU was focusing more on assuring solvency by increasing government control rather than the mindless “ free - market ” cash bailouts that Paulson and Bernanke were engineering .
When in mid-October the Europeans weighed in , the U.S. stock market staged a single - day rally , with a gain of over 900 points in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average .
Over the past few years the sense has been building that the Europeans were becoming alarmed at the threat which U.S. misrule was posing to the world on a number of fronts , including 1 ) the breakdown of the world ’s largest economy triggered by gross irresponsibility on the part of both the U.S. public and private sectors ; 2 ) the overly - aggressive and failing U.S. military posture in the Middle East ; and 3 ) U.S. refusal to address overriding international issues like resource conservation and global warming .
On October 18 , the Canadian Globe and Mail reported on a recent meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The report said , “ Nothing would be truly fixed , they believed , until there was a new world financial system in place , a new economic watchdog supervising the world ’s economies . ”
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had written as much in a memo to the French and German leaders .
The Globe and Mail report continued :
Europe had reached a consensus , at least superficially , on a solution that had not been attempted in sixty - four years : a major global meeting that would attempt to redesign the world - finance system .
It was an acknowledgment , at a high level , that with the current crisis , the entire postwar economic system may have come to an end … .
By Tuesday morning , the Americans were on board , at least as far as attending the proposed meeting — expected to be held in New York shortly after the November 4 presidential election .
[ Canadian ]
Prime Minister Stephen Harper , fresh from his re-election , said Friday he also supports holding the meeting .
All the G8 industrialized nations have agreed to attend , at least on paper , and it is expected that China , Brazil and India will take part .
While there ’s no consensus on what the new financial order should be and there are signs of deeply divergent views , these countries appear at least willing to talk about a new international order at a meeting the three European leaders are calling Bretton Woods II , after the 1944 meeting that started it all .
The day before the Globe and Mail report , an article by Brown appeared in the Washington Post , where he wrote :
This is a defining moment for the world economy .
We are living through the first financial crisis of this new global age .
And the decisions we make will affect us over not just the next few weeks but for years to come .
The global problems we face require global solutions .
Brown added that , “ The next stage is to rebuild our fractured international financial system ” and mentioned that the purpose was to “ root out the irresponsible and often undisclosed lending at the heart of our problems . ”
Perhaps what Brown has in mind was to act on behalf of Europe in rescuing the Western financial system from the excesses of those in the U.S. who have wrecked it .
Brown concluded diplomatically :
“ There are no Britain - only or Europe - only or America - only solutions to today ’s problems .
We are all in this together , and we can only resolve this crisis together .
Over the past week , we have shown that with political will it is possible to agree on a global multibillion - dollar package to recapitalize our banks across many continents .
In the next few weeks , we need to show the same resolve and spirit of cooperation to create the rules for our new global economy .
If we do this , 2008 will be remembered not just as a year of financial crisis but as the year we started to build the world anew . ”
The Globe and Mail article provided additional detail on the topics the summit would cover :
The document that Mr. Brown first made public on Wednesday morning … proposes a set of organizations — a ‘ new international financial architecture for the global age ’— that will monitor risks in the financial system and provide an early - warning system ; determine global standards of regulation ; supervise international corporations in their cross - border activities , protect markets from excessive activities of speculators ; stamp out major conflicts of interest and set standards for pay and bonuses ; internationalize accounting standards , and provide transparency in complex financial transactions .
Over the weekend , Sarkozy and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso met with President Bush at the presidential Camp David retreat in Maryland where they announced “ a series of summits on addressing the challenges facing the global economy , ” starting with one in the United States “ soon after the U.S. elections . ”
But Sarkozy sounded much more aggressive than Bush or other U.S. officials had been in curbing reckless “ free - market ” abuses .
He told the press :
The president of the United States is right in saying that protectionism and closing one ’s borders is a catastrophe .
He is right to say that it would be wrong , catastrophic , to challenge the foundations of market economics .
But we cannot continue along the same lines because the same problems will trigger the same disasters .
Sarkozy mentioned several areas where he might want to negotiate new regulations exceeding what the U.S. and Britain were looking for , including more stringent regulation of international banks , hedge funds , and credit - rating companies .
According to press reports , he also said that world leaders should reconsider the rules governing offshore tax havens such as the Cayman Islands .
Sarkozy has also been reported as saying , “ We want a new world to come out of this .
We want to set up the basis for a capitalism of entrepreneurs , not speculators . ”
Another topic Sarkozy and other European leaders have mentioned is restoring the system of fixed currency exchange rates that the U.S. abandoned in 1972 , an action which introduced an era of worldwide currency anarchy .
He said that fixed , but flexible , exchange rates “ should definitely be on the table . ”
Regarding any potential conflict with the U.S. over the upcoming summits , Sarkozy said after a meeting in Europe : “ Europe wants it .
Europe demands it .
Europe will get it . ”
Finally , on October 23 , the White House announced that President Bush would host the first summit on November 15 in Washington , D.C. The Washington Post reported that :
Sarkozy , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , and others have signaled a desired to go much further in regulating markets than Bush seems inclined to do .
Brown said yesterday that he wants greater cross - border oversight of banks and other financial firms , while Sarkozy called for much stricter government supervision of financial markets .
By now attendance had been expanded to include the entire G - 20 which represents two - thirds of the world ’s population .
The G - 20 includes Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom , the United States , and the European Union .
Finally , at a meeting hosted by the Chinese on October 25 in Shanghai , Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao confirmed the need for far - reaching measures .
With Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso , German Chancellor Merkel and French President Sarkozy in attendance , the attendees issued a statement which said they recognized “ the need to improve the supervision and regulation of all financial actors , in particular their accountability ” and agreed “ to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems . ”
Prior to this meeting , said Reuters :
The front - page commentary in the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily said that Asian and European countries should banish the U.S. dollar from their direct trade relations for a start , relying only on their own currencies .
The era of American unilateralism is clearly on the verge of ending , but are we seeing the same configuration of nations that run the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group taking advantage of the crisis to further the New World Order agenda of total domination of the world by Western international finance ?
And is this why smaller nations such as Iceland are seeing their currencies under attack from unknown sources ?
Other nations with shaky currencies are Poland , Hungary , Ukraine , Serbia , the Baltic states , Kazakhstan , Indonesia , South Korea , Argentina , Russia , Pakistan , and Brazil .
Is someone trying to stampede these nations into seeking shelter under an umbrella belonging exclusively to the big Western banks ?
And will such measures simply bind every nation on earth more stringently to the worldwide debt - based monetary system that has failed so spectacularly ?
Are we in fact seeing the stage now being set for the complete and final triumph of the global reign of usury ?
And if the U.S. financial system is completely controlled by whatever supranational infrastructure is devised , will it then be subjected to the same type of neoliberal regime of austerity and privatization the IMF imposes on the nations it dominates ?
Will the “ Washington Consensus ” turn and devour its originator ?
In a 1998 paper , World Bank analysts stated , “ Crises are a window of opportunity . ” ( Dr. Richard Werner , Gang8 Yahoo Group )
So was the financial crisis engineered at this stage of the U.S. political process to create what could be a global financial coup d’etat before the next president takes office ?
Or is there a more benign interpretation of events ?
Is the older , wiser , and more mature civilization of Europe riding to rescue a world the U.S. has brought to the brink of destruction ?
Whether it ’s Obama or McCain who is elected president on November 4 , that person will sit in attendance at the planned summits with the rest of the world presenting its case for change .
Of course change there has to be .
The U.S. owes the world a mountain of debt , as well as redress for its lawlessness .
Also , the possibility of a federal government debt default in 2009 is looming for a nation that has never been in such a precarious financial position .
The days of the Wild West are indeed over .
But what will come next ?
WHAT SHOULD THE NEXT PRESIDENT DO TO FACE THE CRISIS ?
Senior White House correspondent Helen Thomas said of Bush , “ He is the worst president in all of American history . ”
The public shares Thomas ’s view .
By mid-October 2008 , ninety percent of those polled said the nation was headed in the wrong direction .
Former President Jimmy Carter said something similar in the area of foreign policy : “ I think , as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world , this administration has been the worst in history . ”
One thing is certain : the legacy left by President George W. Bush is indeed a kind of Armageddon .
The challenges that will face the next U.S. president are almost beyond comprehension .
They include war vs. peace and the ability of the world economy to function .
But with so many changes in the world , should n’t we have not just an economic “ summit , ” but a general framework for peace that would end hostilities in Afghanistan , Iraq , and the Eastern Mediterranean ?
With respect to Russia , China , India and even the EU , the new president will doubtless be expected to embrace the politics of multilateralism in order to maintain a balance of power among the nations of the world .
But should n’t a strong voice also be given to the nations of the Islamic region , as well as Africa , Latin America , and Australia / New Zealand ?
By now it is abundantly clear that global finance capitalism cannot replace the nation - state .
It should be just as clear that only a world of functional and prosperous nations can create an effective international federation as contemplated by the U.N. charter .
The Europeans seem to have an inkling of this , but will the world arrive at stability if Western bank - run finance is seen as the only viable economic system ?
How about a broader approach to prosperity that would help the people of every nation on earth , not just those who live off lending and interest ?
Is our planet condemned to the misrule of various forms of “ trickle - down ” economics forever ?
The organization that should be the most concerned is the U.N. , but where is the U.N. today ?
Obviously it is nearly dead as a positive and active force in the world .
In a farewell address preceding his 2006 retirement as secretary - general , Kofi Annan discussed three major problems of “ an unjust world economy , world disorder , and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law , ” which “ have not been resolved , but have sharpened ” during his service .
This disintegration has taken place during the George W. Bush presidency .
In a December 11 speech , Annan asked for the U.S. to return to President Harry Truman ’s multilateralist foreign policy and to follow Truman ’s belief that “ the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world . ”
Anther matter the new president should deal with is to get control of the U.S. military - intelligence network .
He must reverse the Neocon takeover of the State Department engineered by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and halt the militarization of U.S. embassies resulting from escalation of the number of military staff assigned from the Department of Defense .
Another major question is whether the danger of U.S. government bankruptcy will result in reduced military expenditures .
But will the war - mongers surrender the enormous portion of the U.S. government budget they are accustomed to consuming ?
While the furor over the financial meltdown was raging in October , Congress quietly passed a staggering $ 611 billion defense authorization on top of $ 189.3 billion in “ supplemental ” funding for the Iraqi and Afghan wars .
The Pentagon says its budget will increase by $ 450 billion over the next five years .
Both Obama and McCain voted to approve the defense authorization bill .
Among the projects they funded was a truck - mounted microwave crowd - control weapon being developed by Raytheon for 2010 deployment .
To be used to control civilian demonstrators , each weapon will cost $ 5 million .
Would n’t it be reasonable to ask the next president to explain why he thinks this weapon is needed ?
Under another program the Defense Department will pay contractors a staggering $ 300 million “ to produce news stories , entertainment programs , and public service advertisements for the Iraqi media in an effort to ‘ engage and inspire ’ the local population to support U.S. objectives and the Iraqi government , ” according to a letter from Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA ) to defense secretary Robert Gates .
This is enough money to pay 6,000 employees $ 50,000 per year .
Maybe Obama and McCain should explain why they voted to approve this outrageous expenditure .
Neither is NATO expecting a benign outcome to the world crisis .
Author Michael Collon reported in an article on “ What Will the U.S. Foreign Policy be Tomorrow ? ” :
In January 2008 , five former NATO generals presented a preparatory document for the NATO summit meeting at Bucharest .
Their proposals reflect a terrifying possibility .
And what gives weight to their document is that , up until recently , all of them held very high positions .
General John Shalikashvili was U.S. Chief of Staff and Commander in Chief of NATO in Europe , General Klaus Naumann ran the German army and was president of the military committee of NATO in Europe , General Henk van den Breemen was Dutch Chief of Staff and Admiral Jacques Lanxade held the same post in France , while Lord Inge ran the General Staff and was also Chief of the Defence Staff of Great Britain .
Collon described the document in a section entitled , “ Five NATO Generals Prepare a World Government . ”
The document stated , “ What the Western allies expect is the pro-active defense of their societies and their way of life maintained over the long term . ”
It continued , “ The objectives of our strategy are to preserve the peace , our values , economic liberalism , and stability . ”
“ Economic liberalism ” means market - oriented global finance capitalism under the control of the Western banking system .
The document also identified enemies , the chief one being China :
China is in a situation to wreak great harm on the US and the world economies , based on its enormous reserves in dollars … .
China is in a position to use finance to impose itself on Africa and acquire the capacity to utilize it on a much greater scale — if it so decides .
This statement by the general is mind - boggling .
Has n’t it been U.S. government policies that resulted in these dollars being paid to China ?
And is n’t the West talking out of both sides of its mouth in planning a world economic summit that includes China , while contemplating war against that nation ?
Indeed , the rise and fall of the U.S. bubble economy cannot be understood unless the role of China is taken into account .
This role is increasingly problematic in light of statements such as one made recently by Shi Jianxun , a professor at Shanghai ’s Tongji University :
“ The grim reality has led people , amidst the panic , to realize that the United States has used the U.S. dollar ’s hegemony to plunder the world ’s wealth . ”
Whatever agreements U.S. bankers and politicians may once have made with China for them to take over our manufacturing while we lived off financial profits have grievously backfired .
Solving this conflict with China peacefully may be the next president ’s greatest challenge .
But decisions to the contrary may already have been made , with the president ’s job being merely to carry them out .
FACING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS
Assuming that peace may yet prevail , we may hope that in facing the economic crisis , the next president will go beyond working with other nations in attempting to fix the financial system .
No financial fixes will change the fact that a severe economic repression has arrived and that the producing economy of the U.S. and other nations have begun to spiral downward .
The possibility exists of enormous human suffering .
In fact the suffering has already started , with bankers filing court actions that have led to uniformed policemen or even SWAT teams evicting large numbers of innocent people , often elderly , from their homes around the country .
With the stock market crash , tens off millions of people are losing their hard - earned savings and retirement nest eggs .
The downward path to further human suffering is being prepared by mass media propagandists like the Washington Post ’s Robert Samuelson , who argues that the hard times mean we must slash programs for the elderly and poor like Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
In an October 22 article Samuelson wrote :
I wish everyone a pleasurable retirement .
But we need to overhaul our government retirement programs for the common good and not just the good of the elderly .
We have already waited so long that there ’s no way to do this without being unfair to someone — overburdening the young or withdrawing promised benefits from older Americans .
The present financial crisis , by reducing retirement savings , has made a hard job even harder .
Still , these federal programs began as safety nets for the needy ; now they ’ve become subsidies for living long , regardless of need .
“ Subsidies for living long ” ?
With columnists for prestigious newspapers advocating policies that border on genocide , it ’s time to talk about real solutions .
The first thing to realize is that the money raised through taxes and borrowing from the future , which the politicians have thrown at their wars and financial bailouts , exists as real economic purchasing power .
This means that it can be used for other purposes — for purposes that directly benefit the people of the nation who work for a living , send their children to school , and want to save for their old age .
The key to having money available for beneficial social purposes , rather than war and profits from lending , is that it should be issued directly by the government , not lent through the banking system which uses public debt as collateral .
The Democrats mention investment in U.S. infrastructure , though they do not provide details about how to pay for it except through more government deficit spending funneled through the Federal Reserve System .
But what if we left the banks out of it for a change ?
What would really help repair the damage to the collapsing U.S. domestic economy would be an uncompromising program of interest - free lending and grants for infrastructure development and an effort at restoring the nation ’s manufacturing base , along with decent , well - paying jobs .
Such a program would constitute a “ New Deal for the 21st Century , ” as spoken of by 2008 presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
Kucinich has introduced legislation for zero- interest infrastructure lending in the last two sessions of Congress .
The economic recovery program proposed by Barack Obama may be a step in the right direction , but the $ 25 billion infrastructure provision is pathetically small .
Obama should be listening to Congressman Kucinich as much as to his own advisers and Wall Street campaign contributors .
Recently Kucinich released a sixteen - point plan that included infrastructure development , as well as implementation of the American Monetary Institute ’s American Monetary Act , the most progressive piece of monetary reform legislation in U.S. history .
It ’s in the area of monetary reform that Obama could have the greatest impact , though there ’s no indication it has crossed his mind .
One feature of the American Monetary Act is nationalization of the Federal Reserve , as was done with the Bank of England in 1946 .
The act would also provide for direct government expenditures for public purposes as took place in the 19th century with the Civil War Greenbacks .
The Greenbacks helped fuel the U.S. economy until the early 20th century .
Contrary to bankers ’ propaganda , they were non-inflationary .
By comparison , under the Federal Reserve System , the dollar has lost ninety - five percent of its value , most of this loss taking place since 1965 .
An area of economic recovery that has been ignored is the disappearance in the U.S. of family farming .
During the Great Depression , a majority of Americans still lived on farms , so at least could grow food in times of trouble .
Today , the dominance of agribusiness , inflated land prices , the high cost of credit , “ free trade , ” and NAFTA have taken away that ability .
A nation that cannot feed itself locally is playing with fire .
Who can say that famine could not arise even in developed nations during a general economic collapse ?
DIVIDEND ECONOMICS
The one economic measure that has made a positive difference in 2008 was the federal government ’s issuance to taxpayers of a tax rebate averaging $ 600 per recipient .
The stimulus measure demonstrates how easy it is to spend money directly into the economy if the politicians want to do so .
Along these lines , the new president could institute ongoing cash stipends to citizens similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund .
This year the Alaska state government made a payment to each resident of $ 3,269 from resource revenues .
The American Monetary
Act also contains a dividend provision , as does the platform for the Green Party .
But $ 3,269 is not enough .
An annual citizens ’ dividend of $ 1,000 per month has been proposed by Washington , D.C. , analyst Stephen Shafarman , in his new book , Peaceful , Positive Revolution ( Tendril Press , 2008 ) .
A similar program leading to an annual basic income guarantee has been enacted by Brazil and was used in modified form by Argentina to recover from its economic collapse of 1999 - 2002 .
Shafarman is part of the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network , which has ties to its European counterpart , the Basic Income European Network ( BIEN ) .
For the author ’s own description of a dividend - based economic model , see “ An Emergency Program of Monetary Reform for the United States , ” Global Research .
.
A citizens ’ dividend could work wonders in rebuilding the economy from the bottom up , including small business and local agriculture .
To assure that dividends are spent for necessities , they could be issued as tax - free food , fuel , and housing vouchers from a government recovery account not dependent on taxation or borrowing .
Rather the backing for the vouchers would be the productive potential of the economy .
This way , new economic production could be generated without bank loans .
The vouchers , when spent , could be funneled into a network of community savings banks that would re-lend the money locally .
( Richard C. Cook , “ How to Save the U.S. Economy : The Cook Plan , ” Global Research . )
By taking such steps to restore economic vitality , the U.S. might eventually overcome the delusion spawned by the New World Order and clung to by all the leaders of the Western nations that financial wealth has meaning apart from a nation ’s producing economy .
In continuing to maintain the fictitious belief in finance - based wealth without a robust producing economy to support it , the nations of the West have wandered down a cul - de-sac .
In 1896 , William Jennings Bryan spoke at the Democratic National Convention , saying to the bankers and their tyrannical gold standard , “ You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold . ”
Today mankind is being crucified on a banker ’s promissory note .
Real wealth is created by human labor and ingenuity applied to the resources of the earth using energy that derives from nature .
It is not created by bank loans .
Credit has a role , but it should be treated as a public utility , like water , electricity , and clean air .
Today a new economic science is needed .
Such a science would build on such historical movements as Distributism and Social Credit , both developed by British thinkers in the early 20th century and current as viable economic schools of thought in Canada , New Zealand , Great Britain , Australia , and elsewhere .
Distributism posits an alternative to both capitalism and socialism by arguing that the best economic system is one that provides ownership and autonomy to the maximum number of people .
When the Social Credit concept of regular dividend payments as a means of monetizing future production potential is introduced as well , an entirely new monetary basis for economic democracy emerges .
A revolution in economics is needed .
The future of the world is now at stake , particularly because it is obvious that the U.S. ’s status as the world ’s superpower is coming to an end .
People know something is drastically wrong with a nation that relies more than any other on “ market economics , ” yet has the world ’s largest prison population , a declining standard of living , decreasing life expectancy , an epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction , overwhelming debt , and so much domestic violence .
This is what turning over the nation to the financial elite has done .
Will the next stage be an economic depression where millions more become homeless and people actually starve ?
If so , it all started when , in 1913 , the financiers took over through the Federal Reserve System and created a monetary system based on usury , debt - based currency , and bank leveraging of speculation , combined with crony capitalism and criminal disregard of all legal and commonsense standards .
The politicians profited from this system which has now failed .
The financiers and their enablers in the White House and Congress have driven a once - great nation off a cliff .
Will the European solution of collective action to shore up the world ’s debt - based monetary system make a difference ?
Or will it just lead to a new era of international financial looting , forced population reduction , and a more sophisticated police state than anything we have seen yet ?
ECONOMICS OF THE SPIRIT
Maybe a New World Order really is needed .
If so , should n’t it be one with a genuine spiritual basis leading to economic justice , not just a modification of the system we have today ?
Such a system based on economic justice was affirmed in a message to the author by an Australian author , Omna Last , who wrote :
But what if there was a truly representative world government …
I do not mean a coercive world government imposing itself on the peoples of the world , but one that operated exactly as you suggest an American government should operate in helping to fulfill the potential in the lives of Americans ?
A government that provided free no-interest economic dividends to every nation of the world community ?
If the money was embezzled , used for corrupt purposes , or helped to destroy the world ’s eco-system further , then that country would receive no free dividends for a period in the future .
In an article posted on his website on October 26 , Omna Last wrote :
Earth is a temple .
The money - changers have taken over the temple … .
It is time to remove the money - changers from their positions as priests of the new religion of money … .
Governments all over the world should be run by people in tune with their divine selves – their conscience , in tune with God , not in love with money and its power , but in love with the moral laws of the Universe .
Those with eyes to see knew the present crisis was coming long ago .
That vision now has spread to more people .
What is increasingly clear is that positive change , as opposed to the change that is just a drift to disaster , will only happen when people who love freedom demand it , work for it , and sacrifice for it .
Will the next president of the United States facilitate such change or stand in its way ?

Police assault 12 - year - old girl after mistaking her for a prostitute Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday December 19 , 2008

This A girl 's family has filed a lawsuit against Galveston police for their assault on their 12 - year - old daughter after mistaking her for a prostitute .
As the girl , Dymond Milburn , walked in her front yard , three men jumped out of a van and beat her about the face and throat , one of them telling her , " You 're a prostitute .
You 're coming with me . "
Police attacked Milburn despite the fact that she did n't fit the racial description of their suspects : three white prostitutes and a black drug dealer .
Three weeks after Milburn was hospitalized for her injuries , police went to her school and arrested her for assaulting an officer during the incident .
The incident occurred two years ago , and since then , Milburn has suffered behavioral problems , nightmares and post - traumatic stress disorder .
The lawsuit against the officers also alleges that the men thought Dymond , an African - American , was a hooker because of the " tight shorts " she was wearing .
Police have not yet apologized for the incident .
The case has gone to trial , but the judge declared a mistrial the first day and a new trial is set for February .
" I think we 'll be okay , " said Anthony Griffin , Milburn 's attorney .
" I do n't think a jury will find a 12 - year - old girl guilty who 's just sitting outside her house .
Any 12 - year - old attacked by three men and told that she 's a prostitute is going to scream and yell for Daddy and hit back and do whatever she can .
She 's scared to death . "
The officers ' lawyer , William Helfand , said Milburn 's father had also been arrested for attacking the officers after his daughter called for him when the police attacked her .
Helfand said both would face consequences for their actions .
" It s unfortunate that sometimes police officers have to use force against people who are using force against them .
And the evidence will show that both these folks violated the law and forcefully resisted arrest , " Helfand said .
One blogger defended the story from accusations that it was a hoax because it has not been picked up by the national media and many of the facts come from the Milburn 's attorney .
But the blogger points out that neither the Galveston police department nor the Galveston district attorneys office have responded to inquiries about the case .
As for the mainstream press , he asks .
" Why dont 90 percent of the abuses of power we look at on this site get covered by the national media ? "
The old wives ' tale has it that a hot water bottle can relieve pain deep in the body - and now scientists have discovered why .
A hot compress can physically shut down the normal pain response involved in stomach aches , period pain or colic .
" The heat does n't just provide comfort and have a placebo effect - it actually deactivates the pain at a molecular level in much the same way as pharmaceutical painkillers , " said Brian King , a senior lecturer in physiology at University College London , who led the research .
Dr King found that if heat of more than 40C ( 104F ) is applied to the skin near where internal pain is felt , it switches on heat receptors at the site of injury .
These in turn block the body 's ability to detect pain .
He will present his findings today at the annual meeting of the Physiological Society .
" Heat is recognised by a group of receptors called transient receptor potential channels , " said Dr King .
" One of them , TRP1 , responds to heat at around 40C .
It 's known to be on the sensory nerves that supply the internal organs like the gut . "
When someone feels pain in the gut , a separate mechanism is firing .
Receptors called P2X3 have detected ATP , a chemical that pours out of cells when they are damaged .
The heat response appears to shut these receptors down .
" You 've got the heat receptor on one side and the ATP receptor on the other side that will recognise the pain .
Both are present in our cells and yet , when you activate one , it switches off the other , " said Dr King .
" What appears to be something that can sense heat can help you get over visceral pain by switching off the pain mechanism . "
The research was spurred on by a chance conversation Dr King had several years ago with colleagues about why hot water bottles seem to relieve pain .
Dr King hopes his discovery will lead to new pain - relief drugs that could reduce the need for opiates such as morphine .
He said : " The opiates have a broad spectrum of action , they 're good when you really require pain relief , but it comes at a price .
They are very harsh on the body so you only give them as a last resort .
We were looking for something that would be less aggressive . "
He added : " The problem with heat is that it can only provide temporary relief .
The focus of future research will continue to be on the discovery and development of pain - relief drugs that will block P2X3 pain receptors .
Our research adds to a body of work showing that P2X3 receptors are key to the development of drugs that will alleviate debilitating internal pain . "
