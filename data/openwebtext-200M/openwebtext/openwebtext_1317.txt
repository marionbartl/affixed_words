British polygraph operator Bruce Burgess , who conducts lie detector tests for tawdry TV talk shows in the UK , has been caught attempting to lie his way out of a speeding ticket by falsely claiming that he was not the driver .
According to the UK Press Association , Burgess has been given a suspended 24 - week prison sentence , ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service , fined £ 250 , and “ ordered to pay £ 1,250 in costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge . ”
And Clare Semke reporting for the Portsmouth News , quotes Portsmouth ’s transport chief , Councillor Lynne Stagg , as saying of Burgess , “ He ’s a very silly man .
Anybody who falsifies information is incredibly stupid .
I can imagine , being in his position , if he had made his career based on telling the truth and he has suddenly found himself in this situation it could have been pure panic . ”
It would appear that Burgess is indeed in panic mode .

Joining the ignominious ranks of LG , Sharp , Hitachi and Chungwa Picture Tube , Taiwanese manufacturer Chi Mei is refunding the US state for the pecuniary impact of its collusive practices , which were primarily related to keeping prices artificially high and profits proportionately inflated .

For a couple of precious hours Monday , the Chinese government ’s Web censoring system , popularly known as the Great Firewall , was lifted .
Suddenly , Internet users had access to websites that had been banned for months , including YouTube , Facebook and Twitter .
Cautious excitement spread on some social - networking platforms that authorities were expanding Internet freedoms .
But by the time most Chinese woke up the restrictions were back .
Error messages once again flashed across computer screens for sites blocked by the nation ’s censorship filter .
“ It seemed just like a dream , ” said Michael Anti , a social critic and one of hundreds who tweeted about the development on Twitter .
In many respects , it was .

Savvy computer users have found ways to scale the Great Firewall .
But the vast majority of China ’s netizens face limits on their Internet wanderings , and that ’s likely to continue .
“ The government is n’t showing any signs of giving up on censorship , ” said Jonathan Zittrain , co-founder of Harvard Law School ’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
“ If anything , they ’re innovating and exploring other avenues . ”
Rumors abounded that Monday ’s Great Firewall outage was caused by maintenance work administered by Internet provider China Unicom .
China Unicom did not respond to requests for an interview .
Neither did Chinese officials overseeing online security .
It was unclear if all of China experienced the outage or just some regions .

Chinese authorities have been ramping up Web censorship for months .
Primary in this push is a crackdown on pornography .
But critics claim that effort is just a cover for tightening controls on the world ’s largest Internet community .
Authorities announced last week that 5,400 people were arrested last year for crimes related to online porn , though they did not say how many were charged .
Hundreds of websites have been shut down , including file - sharing destinations for pirated movies and music , as well as personal blogs .
One government ministry released a pronouncement last month that the local press interpreted to mean that foreign websites may one day have to register with the government before being allowed inside the Great Firewall .

As part of a new decree to screen out smut , individuals have been banned from registering personal websites using China ’s national domain name : .cn .
The address is reserved for government entities and registered businesses .
In China ’s restive Xinjiang province , Internet access has been blocked since July , when deadly ethnic riots erupted in the capital of Urumqi .
Residents in the region have access to only two websites , both run by state media .
However , the most sweeping proposal for Internet controls last year , a government plan to install filtering software called Green Dam Youth Escort on all computers sold in China , was shelved indefinitely in response to widespread criticism .

At some point in our lives , we all have to buy a car .
Whether it be brand new or second hand , we usually end up going through a dealer .
This list is designed to help you save money by not being ripped off by the little tricks that dealers use to maximize their profit and your loss .
Be sure to give other tips for saving on a new car in the comments .
10 Mark - Up
This is the most obvious of ways a car dealer makes a profit .
The difference between the dealer cost ( invoice ) and MSRP is typically 5 - 10 % .
This may not sound like a ton of mark - up , but when you consider that you ’re dealing with thousands of dollars then the profit margin could be quite significant .
For example , a car that a dealer pays $ 30,000 could generate a profit of around three - thousand dollars .
And then multiple that times a few hundred cars a month , and a car dealer could make almost a million dollars a month on mark - up alone .
9 Hold Back and Advertising
When a dealer sells a new car ( not a pre-owned ) , the sale is RDR’d to the manufacturer ( basically informing the manufacturer that one of their units has been sold ) .
Once this sale has been verified , the manufacturer pays the dealer a set amount of money for “ hold - back ” and advertising .
This amount is listed on the invoice in a less - than - obvious location and is often abbreviated / written in a way that a customer will be unable to figure out the information in the event he sees the actual invoice .
For example : if an educated customer will only pay a certain percentage over invoice , then that percentage is calculated by the “ invoice ” price before any “ hold - back ” or advertising is deducted .
Once the deal is funded and the contract is RDR ’d , the manufacturer will send the dealer a pretty substantial amount of money ( I ’ve seen some “ hold - back ” and advertising fees as much as $ 1500 ) .
8 Undervaluing a Trade -In
When a person trades in a car , the dealer will surely attempt to undervalue the trade to make an immediate profit , and then a profit later when the trade is sold .
The immediate profit comes from what is called the ACV ( actual cash value ) .
If a trade is really worth $ 11,500 ( ACV ) and the dealer only shows the customer $ 10 , 500 , then there is an immediate thousand dollar profit from the start .
The trick is to know where a dealer gets his appraisal information ( the most common are Black Book and Manheim Auction Reports .
Dealers will RARELY match Kelly Blue Book and NADA ) and work off that number to get a fair value for your trade .
The other means the dealer will make a profit is when he sells your trade in .
There are many financial and credit factors that can generate a profit from your trade .
Simple example : your trade is bought from the dealer for $ 10,000 .
The dealer will then send your car through service and detail and make sure it is prepped for retail and safe to drive ( he ’ll also insure the car in most instances ) .
Your old car will now be put up for sale for $ 13,999 .
Now , here ’s where many factors come is based on the potential buyers situation .
The lenders will “ book out ” a car based on a standard process ( typically , a program called Dealer - Track will provide access to NADA for the banks and the dealerships to see how much a car can be sold for ) .
Banks will loan a certain percentage of the cars loan value based on the customer ’s credit worthiness .
Let ’s say the car “ books out ” for $ 13,125 ( this is 100 % ) , and the potential buyer has great credit .
The lender will loan up to 135 % of the cars value for that customer .
Which means the dealer can sell the car to that well - qualified customer for over $ 17,000 and make a nice profit ( $ 7,000 ) .
On the other hand , if a person has poor credit , then the banks will loan less than 100 % and the dealer will have to take the deal at a lesser profit , or the customer will have to put some cash down to generate a profit the dealer will agree to .
7 4 - Pack
New and Used cars are “ packed . ”
This is a number that is immediately added to the car ( in addition to the already existing mark - up ) .
This is typically money that goes to pay the owner .
The amount of pack varies between dealerships , new , used , etc , but I have never seen a “ pack ” less than $ 500 .
I ’ve even seen some cars “ packed ” $ 1500 .
Let ’s say a dealership sell 250 cars in one month , and the average “ pack ” is $ 1000 : the owner makes a nice quarter million dollars a month on “ pack ” alone ( 3 million a year - not a bad salary ) .
6 Customer Service Fee
This is the biggest farce of them all .
This is a dollar amount the dealer says goes to pay for the process of handling your paperwork , tag work , title work , tax work , loaner car , etc .
The doc fees will fluctuate from dealer to dealer ( I ’ve seen $ 299 to $ 699 ) .
This is a legitimate process that does require paying a handful of people for their work , but - in no way does it cost anywhere close to the amount they ’re charging .
Most of the paperwork can be done is a few minutes and over the phone , internet , fax , etc .
The overage naturally goes into management ’s pockets .
5 Bump - Stickers
Bad bad business practice right here .
A “ bump sticker ” is legitimate - looking sticker that the dealer places next to the manufacturer ’s window sticker with a higher priced MSRP than the actual MSRP .
The dealer will try and justify this added cost by suggesting the car had some special product applied to the paint or the fabric , or some window etching was done , or they ’ll try and itemize all the work that needed to be done to get the car prepped for retail ( insurance , gas , detail , service , PDI - [ post delivery inspection ] , etc ) , or they might try and tell you that this car had additional mark up because it ’s a “ hot item ” and people are paying over retail for that car .
It ’s all a joke and educationally insulting .
The theory is once the “ bump sticker ” is negotiated away , then the customer will feel that he got a pretty substantial discount , when - in fact - he ’s simply paid full MSRP for the car : not a very good deal .
4 Service Contract
When a customer agrees to numbers , they will have to go the F and I office ( Finance and Insurance ) to finalize the car deal .
This is where all the legal forms are signed , etc .
However , this is also where a lot of money is made for the dealership .
One of the big money makers in the car business comes from the sale of Extended Service Contracts ( extended warranty ) .
I would say nine out of ten extended warranties will cover things that are never likely to break .
Additionally , you ’ll need to pay a deductible ( on top of the $ 1400 dollars you just paid for the warranty ) each time you try and use the warranty .
The mark up for this product is typically mandated by the state you live in , but you can expect to pay twice its original value .
One good thing about an extended service agreement is that most of them are refundable ( prorated based on what you have n’t used ) .
Additionally , a certified pre-owned model is typically a better bet than an extended service agreement ( because it ’s backed by the manufacturer ’s name .
Extended warranties are typically backed by the private dealer with a lot less public reputation at stake ) .
3 Gap Insurance
Now this is a product that I strongly recommend you buy : it could turn out to worth its weight in gold .
However , you do n’t have to pay $ 599 for it at the dealership when you can get it at your local credit union for $ 150 .
Basically , GAP insurance satisfies the car loan in the event of theft or total loss .
Your insurance company will only pay ACV for your loss , but GAP insurance picks up the “ negative equity ” you have remaining on your loan .
For example :
My car is worth $ 11,000 , but I owe $ 16,000 .
In the event of a total loss of my car , the insurance company will only pay my lender $ 11,000 towards the loan leaving me having to come out of my pocket $ 5000 to satisfy the loan .
However , GAP insurance pays the difference and I ’m off Scott free to go buy a new car free and clear of any additional payment on the lost car .
2 Down Payment
A person with good credit should never have to put a down payment towards the purchase of a new car .
However , there are some instances where it may be a necessary ( too much negative equity in trade , personal need to lower monthly note , etc ) .
But typically , if a customer is satisfied with their payment , and they do n’t have a significant amount of negative equity , then the bank should have no problem lending money to a well qualified buyer .
Sometimes a salesman or sales manager will say ‘ The lender is requiring 20 % down , ” or they might say “ You ’re going to have to pay your taxes in cash .
The bank will finance the car , but they will not finance any taxes or fees . ”
This is a lie .
If you can secure your own financing ( personal bank , credit union , etc ) before you buy , then that would be in your best interest and eliminate a lot of the shenanigans that can happen at the dealership .
Additionally , when the sales managers offer is itemized with a down payment and payment listed , the payment - more times than not - can be retained without the requested money down .
Down payments usually result in sheer profit for the dealership .
1 Holding Points of Rate
This little gem is another reason car dealers get a bad rap .
When a sales manager submits your application to lenders for approval , the lenders will reply with what ’s called a “ call back . ”
The “ call back ” details the requirements for the loan .
Example : let ’s say the sales manager submits the numbers to a prime lender - we ’ll use BB & T- for approval .
BB & T will reply with terms ( 24/36/48/60/72 months ) , maximum amount financed , stip ’s ( proof of income , proof or residency , references , etc ) , and what ’s called a “ buy rate . ”
The “ buy rate ” is the interest rate the lender has approved for the loan - let ’s use 7.9 % .
Well , here ’s where the finance manager can steal from you .
Typically , the lender will allow the dealership to make 2 points of rate if you ’re still ok with the payment .
That means the rate you ’ve earned is 7.9 % , but the dealer can contract you at 9.9 % and the bank will pay the dealer the overage from the rate .
This puts LOTS of cash in their pockets .
Next time you buy a car and finance with one of the dealerships banks ask the finance manager to see the call back from the bank and compare that rate with the interest rate he ’s trying to sign you up for .
If he refuses , then he ’s holding points of rate and he does n’t want you to see that he ’s trying to get you to pay a higher rate .

Relationships among House Dems , Senate Dems and the White House are starting to fray .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Top Dems at war - with each other
President Barack Obama , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will be all smiles as the president arrives at the Capitol for his State of the Union speech Wednesday night , but the happy faces ca n’t hide relationships that are fraying and fraught .
The anger is most palpable in the House , where Pelosi and her allies believe Obama ’s reluctance to stake his political capital on health care reform in mid-2009 contributed to the near collapse of negotiations now .
Advertisement
But sources say there are also signs of strain between Reid and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , and relations between Democrats in the House and Democrats in the Senate are hovering between thinly veiled disdain and outright hostility .
In a display of contempt unfathomable in the feel - good days after Obama ’s Inauguration , freshman Rep. Dina Titus ( D - Nev. ) stood up at a meeting with Pelosi last week to declare : “ Reid is done ; he ’s going to lose ” in November , according to three people who were in the room .
Titus denied Tuesday evening that she had singled out Reid , but she acknowledged that she said Democrats would be “ f— -ed ” if they failed to heed the lessons of Massachusetts , where Republican Scott Brown won Ted Kennedy ’s Senate seat last week .
House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , a Pelosi ally , took his shots at the Senate on Fox radio Tuesday , describing the Senate as the “ House of Lords ” and accusing senators of failing to “ understand that those of us that go out there every two years stay in touch with the American people . ”
On Tuesday , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) told reporters the legislative process in the Senate is “ broken ” — prompting Reid to later quip : “ I could give you a few comments on how I feel about the House . ”
Pelosi and her allies blame the collapsing health reform negotiations , in part , on Obama ’s reluctance to sacrifice political capital to seal a final deal in mid-2009 .
House Democrats also resent that Emanuel and other White House officials forced them to take tough votes on cap and trade and health reform while allowing Reid and Senate Democrats months of fruitless frittering on the details .
“ She ’s mad at them , but she knows it ’s time to move on , ” said one Pelosi friend , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n’t cleared to speak on her behalf .
In recent days , Pelosi and her team have struck a new , tougher tone with the White House , resisting pressure to quickly accept the Senate ’s health bill , even with assurances that it would later be altered .
House Democratic leaders were equally unimpressed by Obama ’s vow to review his political operation and enlist 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe to help them stave off disaster in the midterm elections .
“ I think it ’s a careful dance because , obviously , she wants to stay constructive , at least as far as health care , ” said a Democratic insider close to the House leaders .
“ For them to come around and , all of a sudden , order an ‘ audit ’ of the White House political operation , including the party committees , is laughable .
At least they ’re starting in the right place because the White House political operation is a disaster .
Everybody , including the White House , is acknowledging that . ”
Democrats say they ’ve been completely focused on the danger of a populist backlash for months .
One retiring Democrat — Rep. Marion Berry of Arkansas — told his local paper that Obama dismissed his concerns in a private meeting by saying the party would avoid a 1994 - type debacle because of Obama ’s personal popularity .
“ The president himself , when that was brought up in one group , said , ‘ Well , the big difference here and in ’ 94 was you ’ve got me , ’ ” Berry told the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette .
“ We ’re going to see how much difference that makes now . ”
Emanuel , several Senate and House aides said , has n’t been shy about assigning blame , either .
He ’s been especially critical of moderate senators , including Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , for wasting months negotiating with Republican senators , such as his friend Chuck Grassley of Iowa .
While shouldering some of the blame for the Massachusetts debacle , Emanuel has reportedly criticized Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey — and , on occasion , even Reid himself .
Reid and his staff were infuriated when they got word Emanuel was apparently telling associates the majority leader did too little to force Baucus to accelerate his work , according to two people familiar with the situation .
A White House official said that account “ could n’t be further from the truth , ” adding that the Emanuel - Reid relationship “ could n’t be closer . ”
For their part , Pelosi and Reid remain on good terms personally , aides to both said .
And if there ’s any consolation for Obama , Pelosi and Reid , it ’s that the bonfire of their expectations seems to illuminate the general path ahead : Dispense with health care as quickly as possible to focus on job creation and deficit reduction .
“ They understand that tearing each other down is going to tear the whole party down , ” said a senior House Democratic aide .

ATMs from Absa bank in South Africa have gone hot with their latest means of fighting thieves — they are now equipped with pepper spray .
The cash machines make use of cameras and special software that detect miscreants tampering with the card slots .
The autonomous ATM apparently makes the decision to use pepper spray without the assistance of a human operator .
" But the mechanism backfired in one incident last week when pepper spray was inadvertently inhaled by three technicians who required treatment from paramedics , " according to the The Guardian .
Patrick Wadula , spokesman for the Absa bank , which is piloting the scheme , the Mail & Guardian Online : " During a routine maintenance check at an Absa ATM in Fish Hoek , the pepper spray device was accidentally activated . "
Science fiction fans have been steeling themselves in preparation for this real - world development after reading about the fierce Lucky Dragon ATM in sf writer William Gibson 's 1999 novel " All Tomorrow 's Parties " :

Lucky Dragon ATMs all had this same voice , a weird , uptight , strangled little castrato voice … probably kept people from standing around , [ talking ] with it …

E.COLI Q&A E.COLI Q&A Some frequently asked questions about E. coli :
Q : What is Escherichia coli , or E. coli ?
A : E. coli are common , normally benign intestinal bacteria found in humans and animals , but the O157:H7 strain produces a powerful toxin that can cause bloody diarrhea , abdominal cramps and in some cases death .
The O157 bacteria is virulent and tough and only a few are needed to cause illness .
Q : How is E. coli O157:H7 spread ?
A : The O157 strain is not naturally present in humans , but does occur in cattle .
Infected animals can spread the bacteria through their feces , which can wind up on beef during the butchering process .
Eating undercooked ground beef causes most E. coli-related illnesses .
Feces - contaminated water , vegetables and fruit , as well as unpasteurized milk or juice , can also cause infection .
Q : What illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause ?
A : The O157 strain can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration .
The very young , seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most vulnerable .
In children , O157 may lead to a severe , sometimes fatal kidney disease called HUS ( hemolytic - uremic syndrome ) .
Q : How is E. coli O157:H7 infection diagnosed ?
A : The O157 strain often goes undiagnosed because many labs do n't test for it .
Anyone who suddenly has diarrhea with blood should be tested .
Q : How is the illness treated ?
A : This is an antibiotic - resistant strain of E. coli .
Most people recover without treatment in 5 - 10 days .
Q : What are the long - term consequences of infection ?
A : People who only have diarrhea usually recover completely .
About a third of people with HUS can have kidney problems years later , and some require long - term dialysis .

A Christmas Eve recall of 248,000 pounds of beef linked to an E. coli outbreak in 16 states has focused new attention on an industrial method used to tenderize tough beef and pork .
Oklahoma - based National Steak and Poultry recalled boneless steaks , bacon - wrapped beef fillets , steak tips and skirt steaks .
The Department of Agriculture says the meats are suspected in 21 cases of illness from E. coli O157:H7 .
No victims died , but several were hospitalized .
The USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a link between eating these blade - tenderized steaks and several cases of the illness .
Mechanical tenderization , or " needling , " is done on tougher cuts such as strip and T - bone steaks , as well as sirloin , loin and rib steaks , says the American Meat Institute 's Scott Goltry .
It involves poking hundreds of thin needles into a large piece of meat to mechanically break down muscle fibers .
It is impossible to see the channels made by the needles after the steaks have been cut , Goltry says .
With pork , the needles often are used to inject a marinade .
In beef , no liquid is generally added .
This type of treated beef is typically sold to restaurants , not supermarkets , Goltry says .
The process raises the risk that E. coli bacteria on the surface of the steak might be transferred to its interior , where cooking would be less likely to kill them .
The Safe Food Coalition of consumer groups warned Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack about the dangers of the practice in June .
Because these products are not required to be labeled , there 's slim chance consumers or restaurants would know whether their steak was tenderized using this technique and therefore must be cooked to at least 140 degrees .
If consumers know their steaks have been treated this way , they should n't eat them rare , warns Carol Tucker - Foreman of the Consumer Federation of America .
The USDA reports that in 2008 more than 50 million pounds of mechanically tenderized meat was produced each month .

For good economists , the link between the operation of a fractional - reserve banking system and the recurrence of boom - bust cycles is of little doubt .
One of the paramount figures who has contributed to the intellectual elaboration of this relationship and to its transmission to young economists , among which the present writer has had the pleasure to count himself , is Professor Hans - Hermann Hoppe .
Professor Hoppe has embedded the economic analysis of banking within a fairly general and carefully constructed theory of property rights .
Hans -Hermann Hoppe , " Banking , Nation States and International Politics : A Sociological Reconstruction of the Present Economic Order , " Review of Austrian Economics 4 ( 1990 ) : 55 – 87 ; idem , " How is Fiat Money Possible ? — or , The Devolution of Money and Credit , " Review of Austrian Economics 7 , no. 2 ( 1994 ) : 49 –74 ; Hans -Hermann Hoppe , Jörg Guido Hülsmann , and Walter Block , " Against Fiduciary Media , " Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics 1 , no. 1 ( 1990 ) : 19–50 .
In this way , he has further substantiated the relationship between an inflating banking system and the growing , illegitimate government invasion of property rights that Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard have exposed .
Furthermore , he has demonstrated the consequences of state monopolies of money production ( fiat paper monies ) on international politics .
While central banks , which provide fractional - reserve banks ( FRBs ) and financial markets with liquidities created ex nihilo , have been systematically shown as the driver of inflation and of business cycles , other financial institutions have received significantly less attention in this respect .
The purpose of this article is to investigate the extent to which securitization has played a role similar to that of central banks .
Securitization has been growing for the last few decades and , like the use of derivatives , it has become a salient feature of present - day financial systems .
Despite lawyers ' , economists ' , and practitioners ' analyses , and the renewed interest it has sparked since the 2007 subprime debt crisis , securitization 's broad macroeconomic effects have not been fully expounded yet .
The goal of this contribution to Professor Hoppe 's Festschrift is to suggest an economic interpretation of securitization .
The first section defines this financial technique , presents a short history thereof and broadly quantifies its significance .
Section two details its operational aspects when used by FRBs .
Section three systematizes the main economic features of securitization by banks and offers a broad assessment of the technique .
Definition , Rationale , and Score of Securitization
In the course of production for exchange , economic actors obtain rights to future payments of money .
For instance , a car dealer that sells his cars on credit for five years gets a claim on future receivables in exchange of his cars .
Such credits are relatively illiquid because their characteristics tend to be sector and client specific .
In some cases , nonfinancial companies may want not to get involved in the business of making credit .
For these , and other possible reasons , economic actors who own claims on future payments may prefer to exchange them for an amount of money that is available now .
Each of these claims can be individually passed to an economic actor that has just the opposite preferences .
Or , relatively similar claims , possibly coming from different owners , could be grouped together within a single holding entity that could then create standardized claims on them to be sold to interested investors on the financial markets .
This process of putting together relatively illiquid assets , of using them as collateral for backing new securities , and of using the proceeds from the sale of the securities to fund the owners of the illiquid assets is called securitization : " Securitization is the process of pooling and repacking loans into securities that are then sold to investors . "
The general features of securitization can be presented by means of ordinary T - accounts ( Table 1 ) .
In aggregate , firms A , B , and C have total liabilities of 700 ( 350 in owned capital and 350 in debts ) , out of which 550 are invested in production and 150 are lent to clients .
In case all three firms securitize their credits to clients , economic relations can be summarized in the following way ( after consolidation of A's , B's , and C's books ) :
Firms sell their credits to a Special Purpose Vehicle ( SPV ) which makes the purchase with proceeds obtained through the issuance of securities bought by investors .
The firms can use the reserves of 150 for consumption , investment or repayment of existing debts .
The SPV is a separate legal structure , also referred to as a conduit , that issues asset - backed securities ( ABSs ) .
These securities can be structured in a variety of ways .
Some of them may be actual ownership titles in the SPV that give a pro rata property title on the credits held ( pass - through ABSs ) .
Others can be debentures that promise a rate of return that is only collateralized by the credits held ( pay - through ABSs ) .
Any of these types of ABSs can be issued in different tranches ( three in our example ) , in which case the payment of income on a more junior tranche , i.e. , with lower rating , is conditioned on the prior payment of income on the most senior tranches .
For investors , ABSs represent an additional opportunity for their savings .
On a technical level , other actors are involved also .
The collection of the future receivables ( repayment of the credits A , B , and C ) may be fulfilled by a specialized servicer .
The servicer 's activities may be monitored by a trust that defends investors ' interests .
More importantly , the very issuance of ABSs , especially when they are structured , requires the involvement of banks and rating agencies .
Banks provide various degrees of liquidity facilities and credit - enhancement schemes that are crucial , together with tranching , for the evaluation of ABSs by rating agencies .
In turn , this evaluation assesses the expected risk of investment in the ABSs , and determines the interest rate at which they could be issued .
Analysts observe that securitization depends crucially on the rating process , " Rating agencies may be the single most important players in the securitization process . "
However , to obtain a good rating seems to be a rather weak constraint for the success of an ABS issuance , " A securitization sponsor can theoretically structure the securitization to get any rating ( s ) it wants . "
From an economic point of view , securitization merely intermediates savings .
One intuitive rationale for this rather roundabout technique is that competition between firms pushes them to accommodate clients with the financing of their purchases .
Securitization then is the way to provide the funds , whose ultimate beneficiaries are the firms ' clients .
Clients , i.e. , the ultimate debtors , may well appreciate and therefore remunerate that additional service enough for the ABSs to offer attractive yields to the investors .
Firms may find this arrangement the best way to expand their turnover , rather than financing a more aggressive sales policy through additional fund raising that would become ever more expansive as it deteriorates their equity - to - debt ratio .
There may be even a direct financial advantage for them , to the extent that market participants judge their activities riskier than the default risk of their clients .
Under all circumstances , firms pass the credit risk of their assets to other market participants that are more willing to bear it .
It is commonly admitted that securitization was created in 1970 , when the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) issued a mortgage - backed security ( MBS ) in the form of a pass through .
If the contemporary rise of this technique is indeed rooted in mortgage loans , securitization first occurred in the eighteenth century as a means for financing the West Indies plantations .
Deon Deutz , a Dutch businessman , issued bonds with the proceeds of which he financed mortgage loans to plantation owners in Suriname .
The bonds ' yield was dependent on the return of the plantation loans , themselves guaranteed by the plantations and crops .
These plantation loans " can be viewed as the forerunners of modern mortgage - backed securities . "
Present - day MBSs developed in the United States under the patronage of government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that aim at creating a secondary market for home mortgage loans .
MBSs went through some innovations , such as the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) in 1983 and of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits ( REMICs ) that facilitate the issuance of CMOs .
CMOs are specifically designed to address the prepayment risk in the event of falling interest rate , through the cushion system of the tranches .
Based on the model of MBSs , banks started issuing ABSs in the 1980s .
Besides mortgage loans , ABSs use automobile , credit card , and student loans as underlying assets .
They are offered on the market either as long - term corporate bonds or as short - term commercial paper , better known as asset - backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) .
Securitization has had an exponential growth ( Chart 1 ) .
Securities issued by GSEs reached $ 7.5 trillion in the beginning of 2008 , ABSs rose to $ 3.6 trillion , while the amount of ABCP stood at $ 0.8 trillion .
If securitization represented only 2.5 percent of credit - market debt owed by all sectors in 1970 , that ratio reached 24.0 percent in 2008 .
Home mortgages , which are almost the exclusive asset held by GSEs , have been in the portfolio of ABS issuers , varying from 35 percent of total assets in 2000 to 64 percent in 2006 ( Chart 2 ) .
Evidence shows that securitization concerns mainly loans granted by banks , and not credits made by producers or distributors of commodities .
The next question that needs to be addressed , therefore , is how the general principles of securitization change when this financial technique is carried out by modern banks .
Fractional - Reserve Banks and Securitization
Contemporary commercial banks combine two essentially different functions .
First , they serve as intermediaries between saver - capitalists and investor - entrepreneurs .
Banks issue a debt instrument ( bonds or commercial paper ) only in order to lend the funds thereby collected to economic agents that need financing .
As financial intermediaries , banks transform the maturity , risk , and currency profile of existing savings .
This activity itself implies specific risks ( credit , interest , currency , etc. ) that banks may be willing to bear wholly , to manage partially or to hedge completely .
Whatever their position toward these transformation - induced risks , their activity qua intermediaries consists in pooling and channeling existing savings .
Because the loans that banks make come from actual wealth that is only transferred from one individual to another , one can speak of real credit .
Real credit is the very foundation of capital accumulation and economic growth .
Second , banks act as fractional - reserve depository institutions .
This means that they are legally obliged to keep in reserves only a ( very small ) fraction of any amount of money that is deposited with them .
The part of the money in excess of that fraction can be used for granting credits , i.e. , for creating an additional deposit that is made available to the receiver of the credit .
It follows that contemporary banks , in addition to channeling existing savings , are also creating deposits that they lend out .
Since such deposits are not brought about by existing savings , one can speak of bank ( as opposed to real ) credit .
It is precisely their ability to create bank credit through new deposits that makes banks specific and different from other companies , financial or not .
The capacity to create deposits implies the capacity to increase the supply of media of exchange , for deposits are used as media of exchange .
Since this is the particular feature of contemporary banks , we have to analyze securitization by banks especially in relation to its possible monetary impact .
In order to do this , let us first briefly outline the operation of a fractional - reserve banking system .
( Table 3 )
Bank A has to comply with two basic regulations .
It must keep reserves equal to 2 percent of its overall deposits and its capital ( equity ) should represent at least 8 percent of its credits .
Bank A's total assets include its liquidity reserves in the form of a deposit at the central bank ( 200 ) , its credits to economic agents ( 12,500 ) and its investments in real estate and securities ( 900 ) .
Bank A has obligations towards its creditors ( 600 ) and towards depositors ( 12,000 ) .
The net difference between assets and liabilities is equilibrated by A's capital ( 1,000 ) .
The typical central bank 's balance sheet also reports some of these asset and liability elements .
Deposits held at the central bank ( 350 ) contain
A's reserves among deposits from other institutions ( other banks and government ) .
The central bank 's lending ( 550 ) is partly reflected in A's debt ( as well as in the debt of government and of other financial institutions ) .
The central bank 's investments ( 200 ) represent holdings of securities , some of which may have been issued by A , as part of its debt .
The other figures have been adjusted in order to equilibrate the balance sheet .
It appears that A does not respect the liquidity reserve requirement .
Assuming that it does not want to lose its shares on the deposit market , it needs to increase its reserves by 40 , i.e. , to replenish its account at the central bank .
One means to achieve this consists in obtaining a credit by the central bank through open - market operations .
A cedes a total of 40 worth of assets to the central bank , which creates a corresponding liquidity that is credited to A's account .
The central bank 's total liabilities increase by that same amount , while A's total assets remain constant , due to the substitution of reserves and other assets .
An alternative means for A would be to obtain liquidity from economic agents that have excess liquidity .
Securitizing 40 of its credits is the proper way to capture that liquidity .
This would also improve the capital - adequacy ratio .
There is a substitution between different assets on A's balance sheet , while the central bank 's total liabilities remain unaffected .
From the standpoint of an individual bank , securitization appears , therefore , tantamount to refinancing at the central bank , the difference being that it does not imply an increase of total liquidities in the economic system , but only redistribution thereof among banks .
The question then arises as to how securitization functions from the standpoint of the entire banking system .
From a systemic viewpoint , we must reject the assumption of liquidity shortage or excess .
Let us consider
A's balance sheet from Table 3 , after refinancing at the central bank for 40 in exchange for part of its investments , as the consolidated banking system balance sheet .
The question now is to identify how securitization economically affects the banking system , and how this is translated in accounting terms .
One bank 's mortgages are used to pay house builders , who in turn pay workers , producers of building material , etc .
The latter spend the new monetary units on consumption and investment goods .
Among the variety of goods that the receivers of the new deposits purchase are securities , some of which are ABSs .
When ABSs are purchased , bank checks are written or money order payments are made that de facto transfer ownership of bank deposits to the issuing SPVs .
The SPVs then pass the ownership of the deposits on to the banks , from which they acquire mortgage or other type loans .
The credit - selling banks thereby obtain claims on customers ' deposits held by themselves or by other banks .
After compensation , the system 's deposits decrease exactly by the amount of credits sold to the SPVs , i.e. , purchased by banks ' customers .
From the standpoint of the entire banking system , securitization implies , therefore , a simultaneous reduction in credits and deposits .
If we turn back to our numerical example now , if 10 percent of all credits are securitized , credits that remain on the banks ' books amount now to 11,250 , while their obligations to depositors decrease concomitantly to 10,750 .
At this stage , total deposits of 10,750 are backed by reserves of 240 , while total equity of 1,000 guarantees credits of 11,250 .
The liquidity reserve ratio increases from 2 percent to 2.23 percent , while the capital adequacy ratio rises to 8.89 percent .
Securitization leads to excess liquidity and to improved compliance with capital provision regulations despite the fact that the central bank has not increased its total liabilities and additional savings have not been channeled into the banking industry .
What will then be the next step of the banking system , given the excess liquidity ?
Banks will grant new credits until the existing excess reserves ( 25 , i.e. , the existing 240 minus 2 percent of 10,750 of deposits ) are just enough to cover the new deposits created through bank credit .
Ignoring liquidity outflows driven by a higher demand for banknotes and by purchases abroad , it is straightforward that banks can grant as much new loans as credits have been securitized .
Then the process can be repeated again and again , as long as there is demand for asset - backed securities , without ever returning to the central bank for refinancing .
Securitization allows fractional - reserve banks to grant more loans , while keeping total deposits , i.e. , the money supply in the broad sense , constant in the economy .
This is explained by the fact that the securitized credits are purchased by the SPVs by means of those same deposits that were created by banks in the very process of granting the credits .
As a matter of fact , banks create both the object to be sold ( credits ) and the means by which it can be purchased ( deposits ) .
It is this aspect of FRBs that makes their use of securitization special .
The operational aspects of securitization having been outlined , let us now address its economic characteristics .
The Illusion of Savings - Driven Growth and the Spread of Securitization
Securitization allows FRBs to withdraw from the market the liquidities they have created and lent out .
It reduces the money supply by the amount of liquid assets used to purchase the asset - backed securities .
Therefore , it hides the reverse side of bank credit — the increase in the money supply , i.e. , inflation .
It makes the economic environment appear less inflationary than it should be , given individuals ' growing indebtedness to banks .
Securitization portrays a bank - credit driven boom as noninflationary , savings driven growth .
It contributes to the widespread illusion that more factors of production are available than in reality , and becomes thereby a factor in the generation of the error - induced boom - bust cycle .
To a certain extent , economists have already recognized that securitization restrains the money - supply growth during a credit boom .
From a different approach , central bank economists have come to the conclusion that securitization decreases the power of monetary policy : " securitization has likely weakened the impact of any policy move . "
This , of course , means that securitization insulates banks ' lending activity from the central bank 's liquidity policy , which confirms our main conclusion and is even overtly stated by other economists , " Using a large sample of European banks , we find that the use of securitization appears to shelter banks ' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy . "
The central bankers ' perspective is that of growing concern about loosening their grasp of the money supply .
Such a concern implicitly admits that securitization disconnects the money - supply growth from bank - credit growth .
To a certain extent , our analysis is in conformity with the increasingly common view among economists , at least as far as the outer description of the phenomenon is concerned .
However , when it comes to understand what contributes to the spread of securitization , we must part with the traditional approach , which mentions three main factors .
First , securitization is presented as a way to circumvent capital adequacy regulations , because it transfers the credit risk of the loans from banks ' books to the investors in the asset - backed securities .
Second , the " originate and distribute model , " according to which credits are only originated by banks and then distributed to investors who fund them , appears more attractive than the " originate and hold model " because of higher frequency of banking fees .
Third , asset - backed securities add to the choice of investment opportunities and contribute to the efficiency of financial markets .
While these assertions may be true in themselves , it is not true that they systematically render securitization the best solution for FRBs .
Indeed , securitization improves banks ' capital - adequacy ratio , as shown in our numerical example .
However , given that banks have to raise capital only up to 8 percent of their new credits , it is never too expensive for them to pay dividends to new capital in order to grant 12.5 times more loans .
In addition , the interest on the securitized loans is lost for the banks .
Securitization , therefore , is not really saving the cost of capital raising , for expenses on capital are not an obstacle to the expansion of banks ' activity .
The " originate and distribute " model does have the advantage of increasing banks ' fees , but it has also the inconvenience of depriving the originator of the credit of the interest yield , which is transferred to the buyers of the asset - backed securities .
There is no guarantee that the accumulation of servicing fees from securitized loans would be higher than the interest rates received on even a smaller amount of credits kept on the balance sheets .
Finally , the assets - backed securities allow investors to obtain the same risk - revenue exposure as the one they would have obtained if investing in the banks and if banks have kept the loans on their books .
It is therefore not clear in what sense there are new investment opportunities offered on the market .
All three traditional explanations of securitization assume that origination and funding of the securitized loans are two unrelated processes .
Our analysis shows that , to the contrary , they are two analytically inseparable aspects of FRBs ' operation .
As a matter of fact , securitization is of interest for economists only insofar as it is used by FRBs to dissimulate the inflationary impact of credit expansion .
From this perspective , a full assessment of securitization needs , indeed , to explain how it became a widely used technique .
The crucial point , from bankers ' points of view , is to create a demand for part of their loans , repackaged as structured securities .
It follows that securitization relies critically on the ABSs ' quality as perceived by investors .
Securitization by FRBs can work only if securitized loans are presented to the public as actually different from what they are .
Hence , factors that change investors ' preferences favorably toward these financial assets are the real determinants of the success of this technique .
In a sense , securitization is based on institutions that create and maintain an illusion .
Three illusion - creating institutions can be identified : government , rating agencies , and credit default insurers .
All three contribute , in different ways , to change investors ' perceptions of the ABSs ' risk - return profile .
Government , which was historically related to the modern inception of securitization in the United States , was providing an implicit guarantee of refinancing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Rating agencies grant quality labels to privately issued ABSs .
Credit insurers help enhance these labels through promises , namely to pay for defaulted creditors , that objectively cannot be carried out in the event of a systemic crisis .
All three contribute to an over - valuation of ABSs relatively to other financial assets .
Conclusion
Securitization is a financial technique that permits the exchange of relatively nonmarketable credit claims for liquidities .
As such , it exploits an exchange opportunity between individuals with opposite liquidity valuations in their preference scales .
Its modern usage by fractional - reserve banks has dissociated the growth of credit expansion from the growth of the money supply .
Securitization has provided banks with an alternative source of liquidity , different from central banks ' open - market operations , thereby weakening the latter 's control of the total amount of credit in the economy .
It has contributed to de-monetizing bank credits , thereby containing inflation under conditions of growing indebtedness .
Securitization has therefore become a tool for spreading the illusion of savings - driven economic growth and for creating the economic cycle .

A deal between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry is holding up a bipartisan amendment to allow the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from abroad , according to a member of the Senate Democratic leadership .
The Senate has been debating the amendment , sponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) , since Tuesday but has not held a vote , which is contributing to a stall in the floor action on healthcare reform .
ADVERTISEMENT
Dorgan ’s measure , which would permit bulk exports of medicines from countries such as Canada , enjoys broad and bipartisan support and likely has the backing of more than 60 senators , which would guarantee its adoption on the healthcare reform bill .
Tension between the White House and Democratic supporters of the so - called drug reimportation amendment is primarily behind the delay , Senate Majority Whip ( D - Ill . ) said Thursday .
“ There ’s a political subtext here , ” Durbin said .
“ It has to do with whether or not we can do it as part of the impact on pharma in this bill and whether or not there are other things that are higher priorities .
” The White House and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) struck a deal this summer to limit the drug industry ’s financial exposure under reform to $ 80 billion over 10 years , though its terms have never been fully disclosed .
Presidentwas one of the 35 co-sponsors of Dorgan ’s drug reimportation legislation when Obama served in the Senate .
In addition , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel was a leading supporter of the House version of the bill when he served in the lower chamber .
“ Many of us support it but wonder if this is the right venue , ” Durbin said , but “ we do n’t want to slow down this bill or stop it over what is an important issue but , I think , takes second place to the overall healthcare reform .
” Asked Wednesday whether the Democratic leadership was whipping its members to support or oppose the Dorgan amendment , Durbin said , “ Well , we asked .
There was a question asked of members through staff as to how they were inclined but it is n’t like we ’re buttonholing people , yes or no , and saying , ‘ Vote the other way . ’
” Several Democratic senators are objecting to moving ahead with the vote because they believe the amendment has enough support to prevail , said Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , Dorgan ’s lead co-sponsor .
“ I suspect we have n't had a vote yet because they know it has the votes to pass , ” she said .
Democratic senators from states home to pharmaceutical companies , including ( Del. ) , Frank Lautenberg ( N.J. ) and ( N.J. ) , object to the amendment , citing concerns about ensuring the safety of medicines entering the U.S. supply chain from foreign sources .has reported that Carper placed a hold on the amendment , but his office refused to comment to The Hill .
The Dorgan amendment is co-sponsored by 19 senators , including Snowe and ( R - Ariz . ) , who have been leading the floor debate .
On Thursday evening , Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) said Lautenberg had offered an alternative to the Dorgan amendment ; both amendments will come to a vote at the same time , Reid said .
The Obama administration has sent out mixed messages about drug reimportation this week .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insisted Tuesday that Obama has not changed his stance .
“ The president said during the campaign that he did .
[ He ] said so in his first budget , assuming that safety concerns … could be addressed .
And I think that ’s the key .
” The same day , however , Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Commissioner Margaret Hamburg , an Obama appointee , issued a letter to senators saying her agency believed Dorgan ’s amendment would endanger the U.S. medicine supply and be difficult to enforce .
“ There are significant safety concerns , ” Hamburg wrote .
The Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA issued similar cautions during the George W. Bush and Clinton administrations .
The message did not seem mixed to McCain , whom Obama defeated in the race for the White House last year .
“ The fix is in , ” he said .
The White House ’s unusual alliance with PhRMA has proved a mixed blessing for Democrats .
At a minimum , the arrangement between the White House , Senate Finance Committee Chairman ( D - Mont . ) and PhRMA neutralized a powerful potential opponent .
At best , the partnership could provide Democrats with a deep - pocketed ally as their quest for healthcare reform reaches its final stages .
But the handshake deal between the White House and PhRMA also angered powerful congressional Democratic committee chairmen and rank - and - file lawmakers who want to take aim at the drug industry on issues such as drug reimportation and Medicare payment rates for pharmaceuticals .
Campaign groups allege Marcela Noble 's mother was a political prisoner Lawyers for heirs to an Argentine media empire say police raided their homes amid suspicions they were victims of state - organised forced adoption .
The alleged raid took place a day after Felipe and Marcela Noble complied with a court order and gave blood samples .
They were adopted by Clarin media mogul Ernestina Herrera de Noble in 1976 .
Campaigners allege that they are the offspring of political prisoners who gave birth while in custody during the country 's period of military rule .
They believe the biological parents of the siblings were killed in prisons and their babies were then taken by the state .
Under the country 's former regime , babies were often given to families considered loyal to the military .
' Surprised '
The Noble family 's lawyer , Jorge Anzorreguy , said that both toothbrushes and hairbrushes were seized during the raid at their homes on the outskirts of Buenos Aires .
The raid , he alleges , was carried out under an order of a judge .
Argentine officials have refused to confirm or deny that the raid took place .
Felipe and Marcela Noble are heirs of the Clarin media group , considered to be Argentina 's most important .
Mr Anzorreguy described 33 - year - old Ms Noble as " surprised " at the raid .
" Bearing in mind that she voluntarily provided a sample yesterday , she was n't expecting this , " he said .
Groups for the murder victims of Argentina 's military era say Tuesday 's blood samples are not reliable enough .
They were taken at a federal agency rather than the state - run National Bank of Genetic Data - which holds DNA samples of families of the disappeared .
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo group , which seeks to find some 500 children born to prisoners or abducted along with their parents during the 1976 - 1983 dictatorship , has demanded that the DNA be collected at the data bank .
Last month , the Congress backed a proposal from the group , allowing the forced extraction of DNA from adults who may be the children of political prisoners - even when they do not want to know .

I remember arguing with Democratic strategists about the Alito and Roberts nominations to the Supreme Court .
I said instead of focusing on abortion rights , a divisive issue , we should sound the alarm about their strongly pro-corporatist rulings .
But hey , what do I know ?
And now , the predictable results .
I can't tell you how depressed I am about this :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
The Supreme Court has ruled that corporations may spend freely to support or oppose candidates for president and Congress , easing decades - old limits on their participation in federal campaigns .
By a 5 - 4 vote , the court on Thursday overturned a 20 - year - old ruling that said corporations can be prohibited from using money from their general treasuries to pay for their own campaign ads .
The decision , which almost certainly will also allow labor unions to participate more freely in campaigns , threatens similar limits imposed by 24 states .
It leaves in place a prohibition on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions .
Critics of the stricter limits have argued that they amount to an unconstitutional restraint of free speech , and the court majority apparently agreed .
" The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach , " Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his majority opinion , joined by his four more conservative colleagues .
However , Justice John Paul Stevens , dissenting from the main holding , said , " The court 's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions around the nation . "
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined Stevens ' dissent , parts of which he read aloud in the courtroom .
The justices also struck down part of the landmark McCain - Feingold campaign finance bill that barred union - and corporate - paid issue ads in the closing days of election campaigns .
Advocates of strong campaign finance regulations have predicted that a court ruling against the limits would lead to a flood of corporate and union money in federal campaigns as early as this year 's midterm congressional elections .

OK , it 's a naughty headline , but no less true than the one put on this survey at the aggressively atheist Sandwalk blog , which said " Atheists are smarter than agnostics " .
Both readings are justified .
A large - scale analysis of the religious allegiance and measured IQ of a representative sample of 3,742 American adolescents found a clear trend : the more fundamentalist denominations had the more stupid believers , so that the bottom four places were occupied , from the bottom , by Pentecostalists , Baptists , Holiness churches and " Personal Philosophy " , which I presume means a new - age - ish syncretism , while the top four places , again in ascending order , were taken by agnostics , atheists , Jews , and Episcopalians ( Anglicans ) .
So , atheists are smarter than agnostics , Jews are smarter than atheists , and Anglicans the smartest of the lot ...
But we should always be careful about science which tells us what we think we already know .
The research was done by a retired Danish professor of psychology , Helmuth Nyborg , and he really does believe that he has found the explanation for the persistence of religious belief in the modern world : believers are measurably more stupid than atheists .
His tone of elevated scorn will be familiar :
The study begins with two sets of a priori assumptions .
First , [ intelligent ] people have a brain based biological capacity for solving complex problems , and for acting rationally when confronted with fundamental questions about existence , human nature , underlying causes , or the " slings and arrows of outrageous fortune " .
Second , [ unintelligent ] people lack this protection and are therefore unfairly ordained to live in a pre-rational world based on poorly validated evidence and little accumulated insight .
They accordingly often ﬁnd themselves in cognitively , emotionally , or morally challenging situations and have to use plan B , that is , to call upon easily comprehensible religious authoritative guidance and to submit more or less uncritically to culturally given stereotyped rituals .
Frustration with their life may also make them seek redemption or faith in an after life .
High - IQ people are able to curb magical , supernatural thinking and tend to deal with the uncertainties of life on a rational - critical - empirical basis , and to become prosperous servants of society , whereas low - IQ people easily become trapped in religious magical thinking , in addition to achieving , earning and serving less well .
How nice to have this intuition validated by modern science and the results published in a respectable , peer - reviewed journal ( Intelligence ) .
But is there not an overtone perhaps distressing to progressive opinion in professor Nyborg 's thought ?
Should we really be quite so smug at his scientific discovery that Baptists make rotten servants ?
Should we really be quite so confident about the conclusions of a man who puts so much weight on IQ and its hereditary nature ?
So I did a little digging around .
I downloaded the paper , which costs , alas , $ 37.50 with VAT , and read it carefully through .
It turns out that Nyborg is an enthusiast for scientific racism .
It 's not just believers who are more stupid , in his world : it 's black people and women , too .
In a collaboration with Richard Lynn of the University of Ulster , he measured religiosity against IQ in 137 countries , and concluded that low IQ countries always had higher rates of religion .
It 's not religion that makes you stupid , he told a Christian paper at the time : but if you live in a very religious country , you are very likely to be stupid .
And of course the correlation of religion and poverty is in global terms very clear , while the most religious continent of all is Africa .
In the paper under review , he writes ,
The ultimate causal level presumes that geographically separated peoples were subjected to different evolutionary pressures over extended time - periods .
Those living under the hardest of evolutionary pressures , in cold or arctic areas , were gradually and over many generations selected for enhanced g ( for details of the Climate Theory , see Lynn , 2006 ; Rushton , 2000 ) .
They had to replace ancient pre-rational supernatural beliefs with more effective rational approaches in order to survive under the harsh conditions given .
People living in warm or tropical areas enjoyed in general more relaxed selective conditions , and low g individuals were not severely punished , as their survival was not seriously compromised by uncritical reference to ancient supernatural thinking , irrational beliefs in souls , invisible worlds , Gods , forces , angels , devils , hell , or holy spirits .
A contemporary belief that supernatural forces control behavior , feelings and thinking is accordingly seen as a reminiscence of pre-historic animism and magical thinking .
Oops !
( In case anyone is tempted to take this seriously , it 's worth pointing out that one of the most demographically successful populations in human history were the New England puritans , many of them descendants of Vikings , who managed to combine life in a very cold climate with fervent religiosity . )
But Nyborg is entirely serious .
He argues – in the spirit of Murray and Herrnstein 's Bell Curve – that intelligence is IQ ; IQ is biological , and biology is destiny :
High g individuals will gravitate towards atheism or science , will discard supernatural phenomena , and will learn fast and prosper .
Average g individuals will ﬁnd one of several moderate liberal denominations more to their taste , will display average learning , and will accordingly assume an intermediate socio-economic standing .
Low g individuals will to submit to one of the many dogmatic denominations , will be slow learners , and will attain a low socio- economic status that accord with their limited cognitive
complexity and closed mind .
Variations in disbelief , denominational complexity , educability and income are accordingly expected to follow from essentially heritable g differences , and to manifest themselves as today 's mainly biologically brain based religious class differences .
By now I imagine that you are recoiling from these ideas .
The belief that religion can simply be explained by stupidity suddenly looks a lot less attractive when it is presented scientifically by an intelligent man who also believes that poverty , too , can be explained by stupidity , and stupidity in its turn by race .
All of a sudden , people start remembering that IQ does n't measure anything at all except IQ , and so on .
The trouble with this is that IQ , whether or not it measures intelligence , does measure qualities that are important for success in the modern world .
Scientific racism is wrong and wicked , but to prove it so is not as simple as one might like .
The Flynn Effect
Just about a year ago , I went to a lecture in Cambridge by James Flynn , the American - born New Zealand psychologist who discovered the " Flynn effect " , which shows that IQ scores everywhere have risen astonishingly throughout the 20th century .
He is one of the most interesting and passionate social democratic thinkers I have ever come across .
He does not think that IQ scores are meaningless .
But his careful unpicking of the possible reasons for the Flynn effect – essentially that modern , urban life rewards and stimulates the kind of thinking which some components of a modern IQ test measure – offers another way to look at these correlations .
The thing that I found really fascinating in Flynn 's lecture was his discussion of what makes for very low IQ scores .
It is one of the paradoxes of the Flynn effect that it implies not only that our children will be smarter than we are , but that our recent ancestors were extremely stupid .
Extrapolating back to 1900 on the two fastest - improving components of the IQ tests suggests that schoolchildren then would have had a mean IQ of either 50 or 70 .
" How did Englishmen play cricket in 1900 " asked Flynn .
" Taking their mean IQ at face value , most of them would need a minder to position them in the field , tell them when to bat , and tell them when the innings was over . "
The answer , he says , is that one of the things that IQ tests measure is " post - scientific operational thinking " .
This is not the same as scientific thinking .
But it is thinking about the world in terms of the categories by which science understands it .
For instance , if you ask , " What do dogs and rabbits have in common " , the post - scientific answer , that we would now regard as evidence of intelligence , is that they are both mammals .
The pre-scientific answer is that you use a dog to hunt a rabbit .
That 's what matters about the two animals , not what class they belong to .
It is that kind of difference in reasoning which accounts for the huge measured IQ differences between urban and rural Brazil , and , of course , the fantastically low IQs measured in African countries .
But could something similar be true of religion ?
In particular , could dogmatic and fundamentalist religion be more useful to the poor and wretched ?
Could it lift them to the stage where they could experiment with doubt , with nuance , with novelistic thinking ?
The history of the early Methodists suggests exactly this .
Remember John Wesley 's reflection on his own success :
The Methodists in every place grow diligent and frugal ; consequently they increase in goods .
Hence they proportionately increase in pride , in anger , in the desire of the flesh , the desire of the eyes , and the pride of life .
So , although the form of religion remains , the spirit is swiftly vanishing away .
This was a very much longer post than I set out to write .
But I have been ill all week , and have not the strength right now to make it shorter .
It might provide at least some matter for reflection .
How 's this for a Christmas miracle :
We 've been saying that if Opera wants to get back in the game -- if it truly wants to earn a place among the Top 5 positions on Europe 's forthcoming " Choice Screen " -- then it has to pick up the pace in the performance department .
Apparently while we were writing that , the developers at Opera Software were a little ahead of us on that count .

It 's rare that any company should release a product for the public 's inspection under the guise of " pre-alpha , " but what we expect it to mean for now is , " Do n't use this as a browser yet . "
So we wo n't :
For now , we wo n't consider the pre-alpha build of Opera 10.5 -- leaked earlier this week , but officially released this morning -- as a browser that is ready to be tested in real - world scenarios .
Opera is testing yet another completely new chassis , one which borrows a few ideas from Google Chrome and a few others from its own Opera Mini and Opera Mobile products .
And as we discovered for ourselves -- not shockingly -- it 's not a complete product , quite capable of bizarre behavior .
That 's what the " pre - " means , apparently .
However ... What 's brewing under Opera 's new hood is something astonishing : three replacement libraries including a new rendering engine and a new JavaScript engine .
One wonders why they 're not calling this " Opera 11 . "
The new look of Opera 10.5 ( if this is indeed representative of the first test build 's appearance ) is handsome .
The menu bar has completely disappeared , having been absorbed into the " Big - Red - O " button in the upper left corner .
Service windows such as Bookmarks , Downloads , and History are accessible from this button .
You can bring the menu bar back from here , if you wish ; if you do that , the " Big - Red - O " disappears .
Tabs take over the top title bar , and the sliding thumbnail previews introduced in Opera 10 appear here too .
You can also adjust the tab / thumbnails bar to appear along the left side , and in 10.5 , the glassy background applies here as well for Windows 7 .
In our tests , playing around with the title / thumbnails area too much , crashes the browser .
That 's to be expected from this very early build .
Opera Software is advising curious testers to use extreme caution : " Do not run in hydroelectric power plants . "
It 's a handsome environment for the new browser , and if they get it working and clear up some of the loose ends , it could be a functional one as well .
The original left - hand optional sidebar concept appears to be missing in this build , but in its place is a system where the user can create fully customizable toolbars , thus fulfilling the same purpose .
This is the level of customization and functionality that Google Chrome users have been aching for -- the possibility of a lightning fast browser that runs in something other than a plain blue box .
If Google does n't watch out , Opera is going to answer Chrome 's users with what they 've been asking for all year .
Next : Opera 's last - second Christmas present ...
The First Algae Fueled Car Travels from San Francisco to Washington , DC
September 11th , 2009 by Beth Graddon - Hodgson
The Veggie Van Organization unveiled the first algae fuel powered car this week in San Francisco .
It ’s actually a plug - in Prius that has been converted with the nickel - metal hydride battery .
The green vehicle does n’t run strictly on algae , but rather a 5 % algae / 95 % gasoline blend .
Since this vehicle uses a standard engine without any modifications , it demonstrates the opportunity to use alternative fuel sources like algae in a vehicle , and only 5 % algae might be used today , but it gives some hope for the future .
The algae - based fuel is is produced by Sapphire Energy , one of the leading providers of alternate fuel sources .
They ’re currently working to produce two million gallons of algae fuel per year for the next two years , so that they can release the green alternative as a competitor against traditional fuel at $ 60 to $ 80 a barrel .
The algae fuel powered car is currently making its journey from San Francisco to to Washington , DC .
A trip that ’s expected to take 10 days and use only 25 gallons of fuel .
It ’s part of an initiative to promote the alternative fuel source as well as to raise awareness about the new film FUEL which talks about the American reliance upon foreign oil and provides solutions .

David Letterman has been all but begging Sarah Palin to grace his couch with a visit , but it was his competition , Conan O’Brien , who was granted the favor of a drop - in from the former vice - presidential candidate Friday night .
Mrs. Palin made a surprise walk - on appearance with Mr. O’Brien on NBC ’s “ Tonight ” show , as a counterpoint to a dramatic reading — complete with bongos — by the actor William Shatner , from her autobiography , “ Going Rogue . ”
Mrs. Palin , the former Alaska governor , walked out in front of a stunned and delighted audience and performed a dramatic reading of her own — also accompanied by bongos — from Mr. Shatner ’s autobiography , “ Up Till Now . ”
She included passages dealing with Mr. Shatner ’s days on the show “ T.J. Hooker ” and a reminiscence of the night he visited Johnny Carson and thought the host looked like Mr. Spock on the “ Star Trek ” episode when his brain fell out .
" I believe good writing can save bad art , " says Ryan North about his Dinosaur Comics -- a crudely illustrated Web series that has become an international sensation .
The Toronto - based North began his unusual strip in 2003 .
It differs from most comics in that it uses the same set of images for every strip -- which just so happens to centre on dinosaurs -- though the musings and worldly insights of the main character , " T - Rex , " vary from strip to strip .
The end result is a comic that reads like a conversation between different aspects of North 's brain , highlighting the lives of numerous dinosaurs and off - panel characters ( some too small to be seen , though they can be heard ) .
The series attracts a readership of more than 100,000 people a day .
North 's approach allows him to experiment with a wide array of techniques and topics , ranging from philosophy to computer science , biology and Shakespeare .
" I read a lot and do a fair bit of research , " North says .
" It 's funny because people will say , ' What did you study ?
You must have a degree in philosophy . '
Sometimes I feel like I must be hinting at this deep well of knowledge when really I just skim off the surface . "
North grew up in Ottawa , attending Carleton University as a computer science student .
In 2003 , he moved to Toronto to pursue a Master 's degree in computational linguistics at the University of Toronto .
" I feel like that degree almost gave me a licence to break the rules in English , " he says .
" It 's like jazz :
You learn the rules to break them -- as long as you can break them in a meaningful way . "
In 2003 , North began his comic strip , employing a cheap , royalty - free computer clip - art CD he had originally bought circa 1995 .
After deciding that the interchangeable pictures of dinosaurs were by far the funniest ( and simplest ) way to shape his comic , he created the strip , not realizing that he would wind up staring at the same images every day for the next six years .
" When I graduated , I sort of went from school to being a cartoonist , and I could n't draw , " he says .
" I think the luckiest thing I 've ever done in my life was laying out the comic as I did . "
Dinosaur Comics has made North one of the few self - sufficient Web-comic artists in the world , with 90 % of his income coming directly from merchandise he designs and 10 % from advertising .
" When I started full - time after I graduated , I basically determined that if I sold three shirts a day I could sustain my fabulous student lifestyle , with Kraft Dinner for lunch , " North says .
" I remember trying to imagine three separate individuals who were topless , but then bought a shirt because of me -- and it has to happen every day .
It 's kind of nuts . "
North releases a new strip five days per week at his website , qwantz.com , working hard to keep the material fresh .
The cartoonist says he 's still surprised that his quirky sense of humour is enjoyed by anyone but himself .
" It impacts people in ways you would n't expect , and the nice thing is when it impacts somebody in a positive way they tend to write in , but if I 've somehow ruined someone 's life with the comic they have n't told me yet . "

William Steiger had cold feet .
But he also had a length of india - rubber tubing .
So he snaked the latter down to the former , blew through the tube , and invented the “ pedal calorificator , ” a discreet way to breathe on one ’s own feet .
Steiger ’s 1877 patent application is quaintly charming — apparently he had built a working model and worn it around Maryland for some time , finding that his body warmed the tubes so that his breath arrived in his shoes at 84 °F .
It was necessary only to exhale through his mouth , “ an easy process , which I have ascertained practically may be kept up a long time , as , for example , for miles on a railroad - car , without much personal inconvenience . ”
Two of the scientists involved in " Climategate " – the e-mail hacking incident at the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia , UK – have been emailed death threats since the contents of their private e-mails were leaked to the world .
No further information can be revealed about these particular threats at present because they are currently under investigation with the FBI in the United States .
Many other CRU scientists and their colleagues have received torrents of abusive and threatening e-mails since the leaks first began in mid-November 2009 .
Tom Wigley , previous Director of CRU and now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) , Boulder , US , has been horrified by the e-mails he and other colleagues have received .
" They are truly stomach - turning and show what sort of venomous monsters we are up against , " he told environmentalresearchweb .
The scandal , dubbed " Climategate " , broke on 19 November this year when hundreds of messages between scientists from CRU and their colleagues around the world were posted onto websites .
Since then , segments of the messages have been used by climate - change sceptics to undermine the scientific case for climate change being caused by humanity 's greenhouse - gas emissions .
In the UK a police investigation is underway to uncover how the material was hacked or leaked .
Meanwhile , the University of East Anglia has ordered an independent review into the allegations against CRU and Phil Jones has temporarily stepped down as director of CRU , until the investigations are completed .
Many of the accusations being made by climate - change sceptics are based on fragments and selected phrases from e-mails sent by eminent climate scientists , dating back to 1996 .
The scientists involved are confident that they can counter all of the claims against them .
" None of it affects the science one iota , " said Wigley .
" Accusations of data distortion or faking are baseless .
I can rebut and explain all of the apparently incriminating e-mails that I have looked at , but it is going to be very time consuming to do so . "
In particular Wigley vigorously denies that any data was ever destroyed .
" We did not destroy any primary records , " he said .
" All these data came from National Meteorological Services , and the originals are still there for anyone to access .
Indeed other groups such as GISS and NOAA have independently accessed these data and independently reproduced our results . "
Climate scientists not caught up in the scandal agree that the independent investigation is necessary , but do n't believe that the CRU science will be discredited or any misdoings uncovered .
" CRU is just one of many climate - research institutes that provide the underlying scientific basis for climate policy at national and international levels , " said Dave Reay , a climate scientist at the University of Edinburgh , UK .
" The conspiracy theorists may be having a field day , but if they really knew academia they would also know that every published paper and data set is continually put through the wringer by other independent research groups .
The information that makes it into the IPCC reports is some of the most rigorously tested and debated in any area of science . "
And some scientists express little surprise at the tactics being used to try and undermine the science .
" We have always had a very vocal minority of people who have long since decided to ignore the science and the data and take a deliberately and completely contrarian view , and who have always and constantly accused ( all ) climate scientists of falsehood and being in it for the money , " said Andy Ridgwell , a climate scientist at the University of Bristol .
" They have been playing Chicken Little and claiming the sky is falling in on climate science for a decade .
There is nothing left that is new or different that they can ( falsely ) claim or accuse us of . "
Nonetheless there are now concerns that the e-mail leaks could derail some of the objectives due to be set at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark , next week .
On Friday 4 December Saudi Arabia 's lead climate negotiator , Mohammad Al - Sabban , told BBC news that the hacked e-mails suggest climate change does not have a human cause , and that he thought it could have a huge impact on agreeing limitations of greenhouse gases at the summit .
Meanwhile , Rajendra Pachauri , head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , was reported by the BBC as saying that the claims were serious and needed to be investigated .
For now the scientists involved in the scandal are anxious to get back to doing their research .
" We must continue to do the science , " said Wigley .
" As time goes by the evidence mounts – it is already overwhelming – and we must continue to report this through normal channels in peer - reviewed scientific journals .
We must continue to strive to understand the complexities of the climate system better and to improve climate models so that we better know how to respond to future climate changes . "
But Wigley fears that time may be running out .
" As time goes by , however , we are approaching the point where any actions we might take will be inadequate to protect humanity and the planet from dangerous climate change , " he said .
" Those people – the hackers , the sceptics , the luddite bloggers – who are hindering and slowing down the process of response will , I hope , eventually be held accountable .
They already have much to answer for . "
It turned out that children who received conditional approval were indeed somewhat more likely to act as the parent wanted .
But compliance came at a steep price .
First , these children tended to resent and dislike their parents .
Second , they were apt to say that the way they acted was often due more to a “ strong internal pressure ” than to “ a real sense of choice . ”
Moreover , their happiness after succeeding at something was usually short - lived , and they often felt guilty or ashamed .

In a companion study , Dr. Assor and his colleagues interviewed mothers of grown children .
With this generation , too , conditional parenting proved damaging .
Those mothers who , as children , sensed that they were loved only when they lived up to their parents ’ expectations now felt less worthy as adults .
Yet despite the negative effects , these mothers were more likely to use conditional affection with their own children .
This July , the same researchers , now joined by two of Dr. Deci ’s colleagues at the University of Rochester , published two replications and extensions of the 2004 study .
This time the subjects were ninth graders , and this time giving more approval when children did what parents wanted was carefully distinguished from giving less when they did not .
The studies found that both positive and negative conditional parenting were harmful , but in slightly different ways .
The positive kind sometimes succeeded in getting children to work harder on academic tasks , but at the cost of unhealthy feelings of “ internal compulsion . ”
Negative conditional parenting did n’t even work in the short run ; it just increased the teenagers ’ negative feelings about their parents .
What these and other studies tell us , if we ’re able to hear the news , is that praising children for doing something right is n’t a meaningful alternative to pulling back or punishing when they do something wrong .
Both are examples of conditional parenting , and both are counterproductive .
The child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim , who readily acknowledged that the version of negative conditional parenting known as time - out can cause “ deep feelings of anxiety , ” nevertheless endorsed it for that very reason .
“ When our words are not enough , ” he said , “ the threat of the withdrawal of our love and affection is the only sound method to impress on him that he had better conform to our request . ”
But the data suggest that love withdrawal is n’t particularly effective at getting compliance , much less at promoting moral development .
Even if we did succeed in making children obey us , though  say , by using positive reinforcement  is obedience worth the possible long - term psychological harm ?
Should parental love be used as a tool for controlling children ?
The findings show women are much more likely to believe in God and other phenomena than men , with the exception of UFOs : while 34 per cent of Australians believe UFOs exist , men are more likely than women to do so .
The research shows that Australians are more religious than we might have thought - 68 per cent of us believe in God or a universal spirit , and 50 per cent say religion is important or very important in their lives .
But atheists and agnostics also had a strong showing in the national survey of 1000 respondents , taken early this week .
Almost one in four Australians ( 24 per cent ) do not believe in either God or a universal spirit , and 7 per cent are not sure or say they '' do n't know ' ' .
Women have more faith than men , with 56 per cent saying they believe in God and 13 per cent saying they believe in a universal spirit , compared with 43 per cent and 11 per cent of men , respectively .
Most people with faith hold it strongly , with 88 per cent saying they were either absolutely or fairly certain in their belief .
Christianity , generally considered to be on the decline , was still the largest faith , with 64 per cent of believers nominating it as the religion they most identified with .
The next biggest was Buddhism , at 2 per cent , followed by Hinduism and Islam , which each had 1 per cent of believers .
Judaism accounted for less than half of 1 per cent of believers .
But God is not the only thing Australians believe in .
They place their faith in a range of other phenomena .
For example , 63 per cent believe in miracles , and 53 per cent believe in life after death .
Angels are also popular , with 51 per cent of respondents saying they believe in them , slightly more than the 49 per cent who hold faith in psychic powers such as ESP .
Forty - one per cent of people believe in astrology .
Some beliefs seem to be contradictory .
While 56 per cent of people believe in heaven , only 38 per cent believe in hell , and belief in God is much more popular than faith in the devil , with only 37 per cent of respondents believing in Satan .
Thirty - four per cent of Australians believe in UFOs and 22 per cent think witches exist .
But the difference between the sexes is stark .
Men ( 32 per cent ) were almost twice as likely as women ( 17 per cent ) to say they did not believe in God or a universal spirit , and women were far less likely than men to classify themselves as atheists - 12 per cent of women compared with 20 per cent of men .
The 50 per cent of the population classified as ' ' Christian ' ' were also asked about their specific beliefs in Jesus .
Ninety - four per cent believed he was a real person who lived 2000 years ago .
And although 91 per cent believed he was the son of God , only 72 per cent think the mother of Jesus Christ was a virgin .
Nearly a quarter of us believe the biblical account of the origin of human beings over the Darwinian account taught in schools and universities .
Forty - two per cent of people believe in a wholly scientific explanation for the origins of life and 32 per cent believe in an evolutionary process '' guided by God ' ' .
The Anglican Archbishop of Sydney , Peter Jensen , said the poll results showed the religious instinct was universal .
'' That faith is important or very important to at least half of the population is what we have always suspected - an ' iceberg effect ' that people may not necessarily speak up about their faith but it is very significant to their lives , '' he said .
The fact that the Christian faith was in the clear majority among believers was '' no cause for triumphalism ' ' .
'' I would reflect rather on why this is not translating into church membership . ''

There was no denying that increased numbers of people described themselves as non-believers , but this was no boon to the atheist cause , he said .
'' The decline of Christian faith does not lead to lack of religious belief ; it just opens the way for superstition . ''
It looks like an ordinary bicycle wheel with an oversized center .
But packed inside that unassuming hub is a veritable Swiss army knife ’s worth of electronic gadgets and novel functions .
The new wheel , developed by researchers at MIT , can store energy every time the rider puts on the brakes , and then give that power back to provide a boost when going uphill or to add a burst of speed in traffic .
But there are also a variety of extra functions hidden within the hub of this new wheel , which is designed to be easily interchangeable with any standard bicycle ’s rear wheel .
By using a series of sensors and a Bluetooth connection to the user ’s iPhone , which can be mounted on the handlebars , the wheel can monitor the bicycle ’s speed , direction and distance traveled , as well as picking up data on pollution in the air , and even the proximity of the rider ’s friends .
The resulting data can both help the individual rider — for example , by providing feedback on fitness goals — and help the city ( if the user opts to share the information ) by building up a database of air quality , popular biking routes or areas of traffic congestion .
All of the generating , power assisting , sensing and communications equipment fits inside a plastic housing in the hub of the wheel , connected to the standard rim by a novel system of spokes .
Dubbed the Copenhagen
Wheel , it was developed by Carlo Ratti , associate professor of the practice in MIT ’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning ( DUSP ) and director of the SENSEable City Laboratory , and his team .
The whole generating and power - assisting system can be controlled through the pedals , requiring no switches or dials .
Pedal backwards , and the regenerative braking is engaged , helping to recharge the system ’s batteries ; pedal fast , and you get the extra boost of power .
“ Everything is controlled by your feet , ” Ratti explains .
In addition , “ The wheel , thanks to the energy it harvests , becomes something that helps you keep track of your fitness , ” he says , by recording the mileage that you travel .
That information could also be shared , for example , with employers , who might get credits for the avoided pollution for employees who commute by bike .
It also contains sensors that can monitor levels of carbon monoxide , nitrous oxides , temperature , humidity and noise , and a GPS that can track position .
There are a variety of bicycles on the market now that can provide an electrical boost , but Ratti says his team ’s is different because of its extra functions , modern design and ease of use .
The city of Copenhagen , site of the UN Conference on Climate Change , has been a sponsor of the research ( along with the Italian company Ducati , and the Italian environment ministry ) , and the city has already placed an initial order for some of the innovative bicycle wheels , to be used by city workers .
The system was demonstrated in Copenhagen on Dec. 15 for the benefit of conference attendees , and for a gathering of 400 city mayors from around the world .
‘ Biking 2.0 ’
Assaf Biderman , associate director of the SENSEable City Lab , says that Copenhagen makes a perfect testbed for the system because of its heavy bicycle usage .
“ It ’s a city with 500,000 people and 600,000 bicycles , ” he says .
“ This device can change your experience of riding , and change your experience of the city . ”
Moreover , data about the daily routes bicyclists use could help city planners determine where more bike paths are needed , and fine - grained data on pollution might help officials pinpoint its sources .
“ Over the past few years we have seen a kind of ‘ biking renaissance , ’ which started in Copenhagen and is now transforming the urban experience in many cities from Paris to Barcelona or Montreal , ” says Ratti .
“ We could also call it a ‘ Biking 2.0 ’ revolution , whereby cheap electronics allow us to augment bikes and convert them into a more flexible , on - demand system . “
Ritt Bjerregaard , the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen , says the wheel may well help her city achieve its goal of getting half of its citizens to bike to work or school every day .
“ For us , this project is part of the answer to how can we make using a bike even more attractive , “ she says .
But some experts are more circumspect .
Rob Sadowsky , executive director of the Active Transportation Alliance , a Chicago - based organization that promotes increased use of bicycles in urban areas , says that some elements of the Copenhagen Wheel — the ability to track and post on social networks , for instance — differentiate it from other add - on devices already on the market .
However , he questions whether electric bikes and related technologies can boost the number of cyclists on the roads .
“ While electric bikes have a role to play , in communities such as Chicago , I 'd say that it would very minimal , ” he says .
Christine Outram , a research fellow in DUSP who has been working on the project , explains that the two - way link to a user ’s iPhone , which can be mounted to the handlebars , can also be used to control some functions , as well as to display information .
The extra functions could provide a wealth of data to help the city analyze a number of environmental factors .
Outram says that at present , the whole city of Copenhagen has just three sensors monitoring pollution , all mounted on tops of buildings .
If the new bicycle wheel becomes widely adopted , there could be thousands of sensors all over the city at street level .
“ Now , through a small amount of technology , we could have an incredible amount of information , ” she says .
Ratti says the team expects to have the wheel in production by the end of next year .
The retail price has not yet been determined .
Though the prototypes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each because of all the research involved , their analysis shows that a regular production model can be “ competitive with existing electric bicycles , ” he says .
“ We ’re showing that biking can really help some of today ’s problems in cities — congestion , pollution , climate change , ” says Ratti .
For the bicycle user , there ’s another advantage to the embedded electronics : security .
Because of its built - in Bluetooth connection to the user ’s cellphone , the wheel can be set so that the bicycle will only function if the user ’s cellphone is within range .
“ The bicycle will recognize the presence of the phone and unlock , ” Ratti explains .
“ When you leave , it locks , ” without requiring any specific action by the user .
There are still plenty of rumours swirling around the future of Renault with the Prodrive and Lopez bids apparently not the only ones under discussion .
According to French sources there has also been interest from Addax , the GP2 which is owned by Alejandro Agag , the well - connected Spaniard who has been a little too close to Flavio Briatore for comfort in the past .
He is also the son - in - law of former Spanish Prime Minister ( 1996 - 2004 ) José María Aznar .
There has even been talk of Craig Pollock making a comeback .
The Scot , who ran BAR for some years , is often rumoured to be thinking about a return to the sport but seems to be happy enough doing business in other spheres and has not been seen in the paddock for some time .
The latest rumour , however , is more interesting as it suggests that one of those sniffing around Renault is none other than Anthony Hamilton , father of you - know - who .
Long gone are the days when drivers were able to start their own teams – as happened a lot in the 1960s – of those original teams only McLaren remains today but Brabham and Eagle both won races and the former championships as well .
There were also the likes of Amon , Hill , Fittipaldi and Prost , which were less successful and even the likes of Merzario and Rebaque .
In the modern era Jacques Villeneuve ( it is said ) and Gerhard Berger also owned shares in teams but the Austrian bailed out when he was asked to put in money .
Over in America driver ownership is fairly normal with the likes of Michael Andretti , Bobby Rahal , Chip Ganassi , Roger Penske , Adrian Fernandez and , more recently Gil de Ferran going down that route in open wheelers and in stock cars great traditions with the Petty Family , Richard Childress , Dale Earnhardt and , most recently , Robby Gordon and Tony Stewart .
Nothing is impossible is there is ambition and money .
Given the amount of cash that racing stars have been able to generate in recent years the idea is not ridiculous , particularly now as the price of F1 teams is currently low .
Drivers are rarely the right people to run F1 teams ( as history relates ) but this does not mean that their relatives cannot give it a go .
Nor for that matter does a team owned by a driver have to employ that driver .
In America we have seen Dale Earnhardt Inc for many years NOT employing Dale Earnhardt Sr , and more recenty even Dale Jr jumped ship …
Iapetus is often called Saturn 's most bizarre moon , due to its starkly contrasting hemispheres -- one black as coal , the other white as snow .
Images taken by the Cassini - Huygens spacecraft , orbiting Saturn since 2004 , offer the most compelling evidence to date of why and how the moon got its yin -yang appearance , as well as clues to how other such satellites might have formed in the early universe .
Analyzed by a research team that includes Cornell scientists , the images are detailed in the Dec. 10 online edition of the journal Science .
" This is not the most fundamental problem in the world , " said research team member Joseph A. Burns , Cornell 's Irving Porter Church Professor of Engineering and professor of astronomy .
" But it 's an enigma that 's been puzzling astronomers for centuries . "
Since pictures of Iapetus from the Voyager mission 30 years ago confirmed its intriguing color scheme , scientists have puzzled over whether Iapetus ' dark - light contrast was the result of external debris hitting some of the moon , or whether the dark dust was the result of internal activity .
Now they know the dust came from elsewhere .
Using pictures taken by Cassini , particularly during a September 2007 close fly - by , the scientists assert that Iapetus ' darker half , called Cassini Regio , is the result of the planet 's leading side getting bombarded by dusty debris from another Saturnian moon , Phoebe , which orbits in the opposite direction beyond Iapetus .
It is a longstanding theory , but in a paper published in the journal Nature in October , three Cornell - trained astronomers announced the discovery of an enormous ring of debris ¬- 10,000 times the area of Saturn 's famous main ring system -- around Saturn , near Phoebe 's location , pointing to it as the ring 's source .
Burns calls this ring the " smoking gun " supporting dust hitting Iapetus and other moons around Saturn .
" The ring of collisional debris that has come off Phoebe and its companion moons is out there , and now we understand the process whereby the stuff is coming in , " Burns said .
" When you see the coating pattern on Iapetus , you know you 've got the right mechanism for producing it . "
Small , white craters that dot Iapetus ' darker half indicate a veneer of dark dust , only meters deep , covering a white , icy surface that matches the rest of the satellite .
The imaging data also revealed that all the materials on the leading side are much redder than the shielded and brighter trailing side -- another indication that the leading side 's dust came from elsewhere .
Other pictures revealed that the transition from the dark to light hemispheres is not a solid line , but rather a mottled , patchy array of bright and dark spots .
The pattern , the scientists say , supports a theory described in a companion paper in Science that the darker parts of the moon tend to heat up when struck by sunlight , encouraging the ice to evaporate underneath .
This causes any dark spots to get even darker , creating the mottled look .
The research team includes Paul Helfenstein and Peter C. Thomas , both senior research associates at Cornell .
The paper 's first author is Tilmann Denk , Cassini imaging scientist at the Free University in Berlin , Germany .
The Cassini program is an international cooperative effort involving NASA , the European Space Agency , and the Italian space agency .
Questions and Answers
How do lasers work ?
Wow , great question ... but to answer it completely I would have to take you all the way through college physics .
Let me try anyway , but first let 's define what a laser and laser light are .
Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation .
The next thing to consider is why laser light is different than other light .
You know that laser light travels in straight lines and stays in a small beam instead of spreading out like regular light , right ?
The trick there is that laser light is only one color .
You 've seen rainbows I am sure .
What we call white light ( like sunlight ) is actually a mixture of a whole range of colors from blue to red .
All of those colors travel together all mixed up .
When the colors hit something that makes them bend , like raindrops , prisms or almost anything for that matter , those colors separate .
Imagine a race track jammed full of cars all going different speeds .
They travel in a bunch until they come to a curve .
The cars going faster cannot turn sharply so they go to the outside of the track .
The slower cars can turn sharply so they move to the inside of the track .
When the cars come out of the curve the cars are arranged from fastest to slowest .
The same thing happens with light although it 's the lights energy level or color that separates them .
Now imagine that every single car is going exactly the same speed .
The cars go into the curve in a line , go through the curve and come out of the curve still in a straight line .
That 's how laser light works .
It does bend when it hits something , but all the light gets bent the same amount , so the light does not spread out .
So again , a laser generates a light that is rigorously one color .
How that is done is both extremely simple and very complex at the same time .
A property of electrons ( check out Jefferson Lab 's Tour of the Atom ) is that , after being excited or energized to a higher than normal state , they will eventually fall back to their original state .
The energy that they had at that higher level leaks away as light of a specific color .
If we excite a lot of electrons they leak off a lot of light all of one color .
We do this a number of ways .
A very simple way is to take material that has the right electrons and flash a strong light on it .
The electrons in that material will absorb the energy and spit it back out as a single color light .
We use devices like mirrors and lenses to get all of the light traveling in the same direction and off it goes in straight line .
Since laser light does not scatter very much you usually cannot see it until it hits something .
Here at Jefferson Lab we are building one of the coolest lasers in the world .
Usually it takes a lot of energy to raise the energy of electrons and is therefore expensive to do .
The electrons we use here to study the nucleus of the atom are energized relatively economically because we use a superconducting accelerator ( we 'll save that for another discussion ) .
The electrons we use can be used as a source of laser light just by wiggling them as they fly through a tube .
Wiggling the electrons makes them give off some of their energy as light that again is all the same color , a color that we can select .
There are all sorts of uses for this very powerful laser , for instance it can be used to make very hard steel very smooth .
There are lasers in use all around us , probably several in your house .
There are lasers in your CD player and the CD ROM in your computer .
Lasers are used in smoke detectors .
Very powerful lasers are used in machine shops to cut and weld metal .
Because laser light travels straight , lasers are used for many types of alignment and measurement .
Construction workers now routinely use lasers to level floors and to insure a stripe painted on a wall is straight .
NASA left a mirror on the moon during one of the Apollo missions , which they bounce a laser off of to measure very precisely how far away from the earth the moon is .

SEATTLE—A push to legalize marijuana on the West Coast is picking up steam as Washington lawmakers and pot proponents in California and Oregon propose separate measures .
The Washington state legislature will hold a preliminary vote Wednesday on whether to sell pot in state liquor stores , though even its authors say the bill is unlikely to pass .
The same day in California , backers of a well - funded ballot measure to legalize marijuana are expected to file more than enough signatures to put the initiative before state voters in November .
Activists have also been busy in Washington state , with one group filing a marijuana - legalization initiative last Monday to put the issue on the November ballot .
Activists in Oregon , meanwhile , say they have collected more than half of the signatures they need by July to allow a vote on whether the state should set up a system of medical - marijuana dispensaries .
The efforts are part of a national marijuana - legalization movement that has lately been emboldened by several factors , including laws allowing marijuana for medical purposes .
The recession may be another reason .
With many states suffering big budget deficits , for instance , legalization advocates say the states could benefit from new taxes on the sale of marijuana .
In addition , the Obama administration appears to have taken a more - mellow attitude on medical marijuana as societal views about the drug evolve .
In a poll last week of 500 adults in Washington state by SurveyUSA , 56 % of respondents said legalizing marijuana is a good idea .
" We 're beyond a tipping point culturally , " said Roger Goodman , a Democrat representing Kirkland , Wash . , and other Seattle suburbs in the Washington legislature who co-authored the legalization bill , known as HB 2401 .
" Now we 're at a point where we 're figuring out the safest way to end prohibition . "
Yes , this actually happened : Dana Hanna , a Maryland computer programmer , whipped out a handheld device ( hey - oh ! ) during his wedding , set his Facebook to " married , " and Twittered .
Just imagine what he has in store for the honeymoon
The whole incident was , naturally , promptly uploaded to YouTube ; you can bask in its full matrimonial glory in the clip above .
Bride Tracy Park had no idea Hanna was going to do this , according to TechCrunch , which is just as well , since now she can claim innocence in this ultimate monument to techno - narcissism .
At least it was intended as sort of parody .
We hope .

Dems are sick of being kicked around and they want to see their Dem leaders KICK some ass .

Right now , Liberals want to lock the Conservatives in a room with Al Franken and Alan Grayson and watch the fall out on CSPAN , cheering our guts out as they finally get what ’s coming to them .
Naturally , this would be followed by indictments and a long spell in Gitmo , kept open especially for the War Criminals and Wall Street Hookers previously ( and many still ) employed on our dime .
And it would n’t hurt if we took away their tax - payer funded healthcare .
And personally , I ’d like to see them all come back as a minority , just to help their souls “ progress ” .
But I ’d be happy with the Gitmo detainment , and OK , just a wee bit of the torture they find so American … after all , there ’s no enemy quite so bad as the traitor .
Oh , ok , one more thing : I ’d love to see Obama cut off the funding for all of the welfare red states who keep lecturing us from on high about pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps and how they ’re “ fiscal conservatives ” and government should stay out of the people ’s business .
And I ’d like John McCain ’s Social Security and Veterans Pay stopped .
The traitor does n’t need it nor deserve it .
I ’d like to see Bush paraded around the world before trial , so everyone can throw a shoe at him .
Just once , I mean , we ’re talking fantasy here …
These are the things I dream of .
I have one more : I ’d like to take all of Wall Street ’s bail out tax payer money and redistribute it to the middle class and the poor .
Yes , I would , you nihilist economic royalist cons , and I do n’t CARE if you call me a “ Socialist ” .
Screw you .
What do you call stealing from the poor to feed the rich ?
We ’ve lost our retirement funds , our jobs , and our health insurance due to these bloodless anti-American corporate feeding vampires posing as Christo - Fascist nationalists and we just want some ( &^ (*&() JUSTICE !
Instead , our President seems to hold no grudges — personally or professionally .
“ Let ’s move forward , ” he says , leaving us holding our bag of nursed rage over the W years .
What ?
Move forward ?
And let those criminals escape ?
They need to be taught a lesson !
How dare you , Obama ?
You betrayed us !
Cool cat Obama .
Oh , it ’s admirable and ultimately , I believe it ’s what we need right now to avoid utter meltdown , but it ’s no fun .
I only wish I could show my fellow liberals a glimpse into the future , after the pain of our current woes have past .
A future where we got healthcare passed ( yes , it will be imperfect , but just you wait and see… it will have long term ramifications ) and job creation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act starts paying off and we ’ve actually managed to be fiscally responsible unlike the “ lower taxes without paying for them and start illegal wars which are kept off of the budget ” Republicans and oh , my friends …
If you could see the world I see , you would funnel your rage and your hatred into helping us pass these things as imperfect as they are .
Because you would see that in doing so , you are kicking some permanent Republican ass .
Not some bar room brawl .
Not a one night shut out .
Not even a season trophy .
No , a full out ten years of championship of progressive politics .
Now , picture that .
Is n’t that satisfying ?
This man can take us there .
You do n’t like the way he ’s doing it , but that ’s because he does n’t work in immediate victories or short term smack downs .
You will like it .
You will be satisfied .
If only we can come together to do this thing , you will be more than satisfied .
Perhaps we need to think of Obama as the lover who courts from a distance or the athlete you do n’t see coming .
It ’s all vague and remotely intellectual .
Bad Obama , following the law and letting congress do their thing , as we wait out 101 Republican filibusters .
“ Shut them down ! ” We want to scream .
“ Use your power ! ” Oh , we hate the label of the weak Democrats and just once … .
But remember during the campaign , when we yelled at Obama to hit them back hard ?
He never did .
He had a few well disguised zingers , but he always appeared in control , calm and unfettered with rage .
This skill played a big part in landing him in the White House .
After Bush , we needed a rational leader , not a reactionary .
But we so want the reactionary , just for a moment … just like we wanted the bad boy or girl we knew was n’t good for us in high school and some of us well past that ( not naming any names ) .
The immediate satisfaction was so tempting then .
But we have grown up , yes ?
What we ca n’t see right now is just how lethal Obama can be .
Instead of screaming at him about what he has n’t done and assuming he is a centrist , look under the hood
Under the hood , I see a liberal who knows how to play the game and is driving mercilessly down the center to win the Big Game .
He knows how to utilize centrism in order to achieve his goals .
He does believe in bi-partisanship , because if we had a loyal opposition who cared about our country , this would presumably lead to better bills .
But he ’s coming for their bad policies and their failed leadership .
He ’s gunning for them in ways that will change our lives ; the ways government can and should help the people .
By winning , by showing how government can and does have a role to play in the lives of the American people , he will drain the power of the modern day heartless Republican corporatists for a good long while .
If you saw the precision of his targets and timing , if you paid attention to his methods , what you would really fear is just how far he could take us – not how far you think he wo n’t take us .
Of course , I would cheer him as he led us into a Social Democracy , so this does n’t scare me … but shhh , do n’t tell the centrists .
It ’s good when liberals get mad at Obama and accuse him of being a centrist ; this only enables him to get more done at times , as clever covert liberals with an eye to strategy will report this , thus endearing him to the many voting centrists .
So maybe I should n’t say anything at all … .
But there are other times when it ’s best if we take a good long look at what we have here , and how to use it to our advantage .
So nurse your wounds and your rage .
We all are .
But funnel them into something productive like winning ….
The Big Game .
Let ’s go kick some Republican Ass .
As the senate debates Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke 's reappointment , it is striking how the media views blaming Bernanke for the Great Recession as being out of bounds .
Of course Bernake bears much of the blame for America 's economic collapse .
He was either in , or next to , the driver 's seat for the last seven years .
Bernanke was a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve since the summer of 2002 .
He served a six - month stint as head of President Bush 's council of economic advisors beginning in the summer of 2005 and then went back to chair the Fed in February 2006 .
This crisis is not a weather disaster like Hurricane Katrina ; it is a man-made disaster that was brought about by seriously misguided economic policy .
And , after Alan Greenspan , Bernanke was better positioned than any other person in the country to prevent this disaster .
The basic argument is very simple .
The US had an enormous housing bubble .
This bubble drove the economy ever since the last recession in 2001 .
It propelled the economy directly through a building boom that sent housing construction to record levels .
Indirectly , it led to a consumption boom as people spent money based on the $ 8 trillion in housing equity that was temporarily created by the bubble .
When the bubble collapsed it was inevitable that it would lead to the sort of disaster that we are now seeing .
We lost close to $ 500bn in annual demand due to the collapse of housing construction .
The building boom created an enormous glut of housing .
There will be little need for new construction for several years in the future .
The disappearance of trillions of dollars of bubble - generated housing equity led to a plunge in consumption .
Annual consumption has fallen by close to $ 500bn .
If we add in a loss in demand of close to $ 200bn associated with the bursting of a bubble in commercial real estate , the collapse of the bubbles led to a fall in annual demand of close to $ 1.2tn .
The Fed has nothing in its bag of tricks that allows it quickly replace $ 1.2tn in demand , which is why the country is now mired in double - digit unemployment .
In spite of the heroic efforts at obfuscation by many economists , there is not really much to dispute in the above story .
Add in the fact that the bubble was both recognisable and preventable , and you have a very solid indictment of Bernanke .
The bubble was easy to recognise , Bernanke just failed to do it .
Nationwide house prices had already experienced an unprecedented 30 % increase by the summer of 2002 .
Since there was nothing in the fundamentals of the housing market to justify this run-up , and no remotely corresponding increase in rents , Bernanke should have already been aware of the housing bubble by the time he joined the Fed in 2002 .
The Fed has a large arsenal with which to attack a housing bubble , but the first weapon is simply talk .
If Greenspan and Bernanke had used their platform at the Fed to educate Congress , the financial industry , and the public at large about the existence of the housing bubble and the risks it posed , this likely would have been sufficient to pop it .
This is not about mumbling " irrational exuberance , " it 's a question of using the Fed 's full research capacities to document the existence of a housing bubble ( they actually did the opposite ) and then disseminating this research as widely as possible .
If this proved inadequate , the Fed also had substantial regulatory powers to curb the deceptive subprime loans that helped inflate the bubble in its later stages .
If talk and regulation failed , then the Fed could have used interest rate hikes .
A policy of raising interest rates with the explicit target of bursting the bubble – for example , a commitment to raise rates until house prices fall , – would almost certainly accomplish its goal in fairly short order .
Bernanke and his sidekick , Greenspan , chose to take none of these measures .
Instead they insisted everything was fine the whole time .
Things were not fine and the country is paying the price .
And yes , it is very much Bernanke 's fault .

Today ’s poll from Rasmussen is very telling in many ways .
The poll , released this morning , suggest that the GOP base IS the liberty movement .
And right now , that base has left the party .
In a three - way Generic Ballot test , the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds Democrats attracting 36 % of the vote .
The Tea Party candidate picks up 23 % , and Republicans finish third at 18 % .
Another 22 % are undecided .
Among voters not affiliated with either major party , the Tea Party comes out on top .
Thirty - three percent ( 33 % ) prefer the Tea Party candidate , and 30 % are undecided .
Twenty - five percent ( 25 % ) would vote for a Democrat , and just 12 % prefer the GOP .
Among Republican voters , 39 % say they ’d vote for the GOP candidate , but 33 % favor the Tea Party option .
This is good for our movement because it proves what we ’ve been saying all along … the two major parties have been courting the wrong crowd .
Especially the Republican Party .
I mean , recent polls make it clear that the dominating ideology in America is conservatism .
This poll makes it clear that the dominating part of the Republican base is the liberty movement , not the moderates .
Many within the movement are not Republican and never have been , but I think it ’s safe to say that the majority of the movement strongly opposes efforts by Democrats to destroy our country .
This was the major problem with John McCain , in my opinion .
McCain is a moderate .
And while many claimed it was for different reasons , I believe he lost because he had nothing significant to offer the liberty movement .
Obama on the other hand promised his base a free ride in life .
It ’s wild that Republicans can’t seem to grasp the simplicity of the situation .
We ’re not asking for freebies , we ’re not asking for handouts … we ’re instead just asking for our right to be free .
We ’re asking for representation that will protect our liberty , not trample it .
So , I think this poll makes a few things clear for us .
First , Republicans can’t win without the movement .
Second , the movement ca n’t win without the party .
At least not in the short term .
If this polling data is correct , then we fail the second we split the vote that opposes Democrats .
This is only my opinion , of course .
And I would certainly love to hear yours .
Where do you think the movement should go in 2010 ?( opinion )
NOTE : In 2010 we need to remain focused .
And our focus needs to be on removing big government thugs from office .
Starting with those who support healthcare , cap and trade , bailouts and other dangerous legislation .
Although the U.S. intelligence community ( IC ) has been stung by failures relating to the Christmas terrorist attack , these failures are symptomatic of far larger problems .
In analyzing the ongoing Iranian and North Korean nuclear weapons programs , both the IC and policy makers are guilty of politicizing intelligence , exactly the behavior harshly criticized during the Bush administration .
Now , however , the politicization threat dwells inside the IC , especially in the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) bureaucracy .

The Episcopal church in the United States has elected a second openly gay bishop .
The move could re-ignite a dispute within the worldwide Anglican movement that began with the first such appointment in the US six years ago .
The Reverend Mary Glasspool was elected assistant bishop in the Los Angeles diocese .
Her appointment has still to be approved by national church leaders .
The choice is controversial .
When a gay man , Gene Robinson , was elected as the first gay bishop in the Episcopal Church in 2003 , it caused uproar among traditionalists .
Conservatives in the US formed a breakaway group and Anglican leaders have struggled to prevent a permanent rift among the global congregation of more than 70 million .
Reverend Glasspool needs the approval of a majority of national church leaders before she can be consecrated , but her election may spark yet another row in an already fractured community .
Temperatures in the region fell to their lowest level since 1995
Overnight temperatures in the south of Scotland have reached their lowest level in more than 14 years .
Figures at the Met Office 's Eskdalemuir observatory in Dumfries and Galloway hit - 14C on Sunday , the coldest since December 1995 .
However , recent freezing conditions meant the region 's rainfall record was not broken in 2009 .
The total for the year was 2213.6 mm ( 87.15 in ) which fell just short of the 2222.6 mm ( 87.5 in ) set in 1928 .
Heavy downpours in November caused widespread flooding across southern Scotland and northern England .
However , December rainfall was below the monthly average meaning the annual record was not exceeded .
The weather focus has now turned to the icy conditions .
Temperatures are forecast to drop well below freezing on Monday night and for the remainder of the week .
FIFA has unveiled the official ball for next year 's World Cup , with the makers billing it as the first perfectly round ball and the most accurate yet .
Aerodynamic bumps on the ball would allow for stable flight and grip under all conditions , makers adidas said at the launch in Cape Town .
FIFA president Sepp Blatter and leading players praised the ball , named ' Jabulani ' , which means ' to celebrate ' in Zulu , one of the official languages in host country South Africa .
" For me , contact with the ball is all important , and that 's just great with this ball , " Brazil 's Kaka said in a statement .
The ball has 11 colours , representing the 11 players in a team and the number of languages spoken in South Africa , the first African country to host the world 's most - watched single - sport tournament .
It was launched hours ahead of the World Cup draw that put the 32 qualifying teams into groups .
" It 's the tool of our trade and we want the best , " former England captain David Beckham said .
" Any good football player would be able to control any ball , but it 's good to have a little bit of help . "

An amazing new study in the journal Evolutionary Psychology has found that the countries with the highest levels of happiness and prosperity are also the least religious and most secular :
From Dostoyevsky to right - wing commentator Ann Coulter we are warned of the perils of godlessness .
“ If there is no God , ” Dostoyevsky wrote , “ everything is permitted . ”
Coulter routinely attributes our nation ’s most intractable troubles to the moral vacuum of atheism .
But a growing body of research in what one sociologist describes as the “ emerging field of secularity ” is challenging long - held assumptions about the relationship of religion and effective governance .
In a paper posted recently on the online journal Evolutionary Psychology , independent researcher Gregory S. Paul reports a strong correlation within First World democracies between socioeconomic well - being and secularity .
In short , prosperity is highest in societies where religion is practiced least .
Using existing data , Paul combined 25 indicators of societal and economic stability — things like crime , suicide , drug use , incarceration , unemployment , income , abortion and public corruption — to score each country using what he calls the “ successful societies scale . ”
He also scored countries on their degree of religiosity , as determined by such measures as church attendance , belief in a creator deity and acceptance of Bible literalism .
Comparing the two scores , he found , with little exception , that the least religious countries enjoyed the most prosperity .
Of particular note , the U.S. holds the distinction of most religious and least prosperous among the 17 countries included in the study , ranking last in 14 of the 25 socioeconomic measures .
Five powerful car bombs rocked Baghdad on Tuesday , killing 112 people , including women and students , and wounding 207 in the third co-ordinated massacre to devastate the capital since August .
The attacks shattered a month of calm in the city and come as the war - torn country 's leaders prepare to announce the date for a general election early next year , the second since the US - led ouster of dictator Saddam Hussein .
Three car bombs exploded near offices of the labour , interior and finance ministries and a suicide attacker in a car struck a police patrol in Dora , in southern Baghdad , causing 15 deaths , an interior ministry official said .
The first explosion in the centre of Baghdad was heard at 10:25 am ( 0725 GMT ) , another came within seconds and a third one minute later .
Although no group has yet admitted responsibility , the timing of the blasts and the fact that three of them targeted government buildings bears all the hallmarks of an Al - Qaeda operation .
The towering red sand dunes of Sossusvlei in the Namib Desert are one of the most spectacular sights to be seen in Namibia .
Sossusvlei itself is a clay pan fed by the Tsauchab River .
In addition to the sea of red sand dunes , Sossusvlei is also home to the Dead Vlei , meaning “ dead marsh ” , an eerie white clay pan filled with dead Camelthorn trees .
This area is contained within the Namib - Naukluft Park which is in turn a part of the Namib Desert , the oldest desert in the world .
The best time to visit Sossusvlei is at sunrise or sunset when the colors are the most vivid and the sun is not too hot .
Accommodation near the area ranges from luxury resorts , to mid-range lodges , to numerous campgrounds .
In the decades she spent honing her craft , Doris Payne employed classic elegance , refined taste , Southern charm and a sleight of hand that could earn the envy of a talented magician .
Like the best illusionists , she had a knack for making things disappear .
Payne ’s life as an international jewel thief is the subject of an upcoming movie , “ Who Is Doris Payne ? ” starring Halle Berry .
But given the latest events in Orange County , the filmmakers may want to consider a new ending .
The 79 - year - old was arrested Friday on suspicion of grand theft after security guards at the Saks Fifth Avenue store at South Coast Plaza accused her of taking the tags off a Burberry trench coat valued at $ 1,300 and walking out without paying , said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Mark Manley .
She remains in custody without bail because of a parole violation .
Although she has had high - end tastes , the allegation that she took a coat is a departure of sorts for Payne .
In a 2008 article in The Times , Payne told a reporter that she stole her first diamond in her late 20s , hoping to raise money to help her mother leave an abusive husband .
From there , she never looked back .
Payne said she had no idea how many jewels she had stolen but that her career as a thief had spanned the globe from New York to London to Tokyo .
Her formula was simple :
She would pick a jewelry or high - end department store , try on several ornaments , then distract the clerk as she slipped a ring or bracelet into deep pockets .
Eventually , improvements in store security and surveillance caught up with Payne .
In 1999 , she was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison after stealing a 5 - carat diamond ring from a Neiman Marcus in Denver .
While on parole in 2005 , she stole an $ 8,500 ring in Nevada and a $ 31,500 , three - stone diamond ring in Palo Alto .
She eventually was sentenced to two to five years for the crimes .
In the spring of 2008 , Payne completed her sentence in Colorado and returned to California , where she remained on parole until her arrest .

A sticky situation
FATIH BIROL , the chief economist of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , believes that if no big new discoveries are made , “ the output of conventional oil will peak in 2020 if oil demand grows on a business - as - usual basis . ”
Coming from the band of geologists and former oil - industry hands who believe that the world is facing an imminent shortage of oil , this would be unremarkable .
But coming from the IEA , the source of closely watched annual predictions about world energy markets , it is a new and striking claim .
Despite repeated downward revisions in recent years in its forecasts of global oil supply in 2030 , the IEA has not until now committed itself to a firm prediction for when oil supplies might cease to grow .
Its latest energy outlook , released last month , says only that conventional oil ( as opposed to hard - to - extract sources like Canada 's tar sands ) is “ projected to reach a plateau sometime before ” 2030 .
Mr Birol 's willingness to acknowledge that conventional supplies may peak in a decade 's time points to a subtle shift in policymakers ' attitude towards the “ peak oil ” debate .
This debate is not about whether the supply of oil , a finite resource , could some day stop growing .
Rather , it hinges on the timing of an end to increases in global oil production , and on what happens next .
The most pessimistic peak - oil proponents think that global oil supply has peaked or is about to do so .
Given projections of demand increasing well into the future , they fear economic disaster .
By contrast , oil optimists like Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) , an energy - research firm based in Boston , argue that high prices will lead to improved technology that will enable oil firms to find new oilfields ; make it economically feasible to extract oil under more challenging geological conditions or manufacture it from coal or natural gas ; and increase the amount of oil that can be recovered from existing fields .
This , they argue , will allow demand to be met for at least a couple of decades .
After that , CERA reckons , “ supply may well struggle to meet demand , but an undulating plateau rather than a dramatic peak will likely unfold ” .
Until now official estimates from the IEA were far closer in spirit to those from the likes of CERA than the pessimists .
Mr Birol 's statement suggests that the IEA has extended a tentative foot into the other camp .
The reasons are not hard to find .
After analysing the historical production trends of 800 individual oilfields in 2008 , the IEA came to the conclusion that the decline in annual output from fields that are past their prime could average 8.6 % in 2030 .
“ Even if oil demand were to remain flat , the world would need to find more than 40 m barrels per day of gross new capacity — equal to four new Saudi Arabias — just to offset this decline , ” says Mr Birol .
A daunting task .
Peak - oil proponents point out that the average size of new discoveries has been declining since the mid-1960s .
Between 1960 and 1989 the world discovered more than twice the oil it produced .
But between 1990 and 2006 cumulative oil discoveries have been about half of production .
Their opponents argue that long periods of relatively low oil prices blunted the incentives for exploration .
A sustained period of higher prices , they argue , should increase discoveries .
They point out that the first half of 2009 saw 10 billion barrels of new discoveries , an annual rate higher than any year since 2000 .
The pessimists retort that recent discoveries are still not enough .
The IEA expects unconventional sources of oil to take up a lot of the slack , as progressively higher prices make them economically viable .
But these sources are also much dirtier than conventional oil and require significantly more energy to tap .
That sits uneasily with efforts to mitigate climate change , the subject of talks that began in Copenhagen this week .
These negotiations matter hugely for the peak - oil debate .
The IEA reckons that co-ordinated action to restrict the increase in global temperatures to 2 º C will restrict global demand for oil to 89 m b/d in 2030 , compared with 105 m b/d if no action is taken .
That , Mr Birol says , “ could push back the peak of production , as it would take longer to produce the lower - cost oil that remains to be developed . ”
Action on climate change may yet save the world from an early supply crunch .
About quarter of a million Palestinians and Israeli Arabs live in East Jerusalem Israel stripped a record number of Palestinians of their right to live in East Jerusalem last year , an Israeli rights group has said .
Some 4,570 people had their residency rights removed , more than a third of the total number since Israel took control of East Jerusalem in 1967 .
Palestinians fear an attempt to reduce their presence in Jerusalem , which both they and Israel claim as their capital .
Israel says most of those stripped of their rights were living abroad .
Palestinians living in East Jerusalem were offered Israeli citizenship after Israel occupied the area in 1967 and later annexed it .
Many refused , not wanting to recognise Israeli sovereignty , and were instead given residency .
But , according to the Israeli rights organisation Hamoked , if these Palestinians live abroad for seven years , or gain citizenship or residency elsewhere , they lose their Israeli residency .
Hamoked obtained the figures from the Interior Ministry using the Freedom of Information Act .
The organisation said that some of those who had lost their citizenship may now be stateless , or may not even be aware they have lost their residency .
Family visits and students studying abroad would be affected , it said .
The state of Israel pays billions of shekels a year in stipends to people who do n't even live here
Meir Sheetrit
Former interior minister
Obstacles to peace : Jerusalem Hamoked executive director Dalia Kerstein said the phenomenon had " reached frightening dimensions " .
Israel 's interior ministry said it had carried out a " comprehensive check " that people listed as residents of Israel had their lives centred in the country , and many were found to be living abroad .
Former Israeli Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit , who initiated the survey , told the BBC " it is a very normal , regular idea that people who are not living here for a long time " are not supposed to be residents .
He said those who had appealed had been approved to stay .
" The state of Israel pays billions of shekels a year in stipends to people who do n't even live here , " he told Haaretz .
The figures come amid Palestinian fears that Israel is trying to increase its control over East Jerusalem and cut it off from the West Bank , through the building of the West Bank barrier , house demolitions and evictions .
The right - leaning government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that Jerusalem is Israel 's " eternal , undivided capital " .
But it says recent demolitions and evictions are simply issues of law enforcement .
On Tuesday , a draft document leaked to Haaretz suggested the EU was considering hardening its stance on the city .
According to the newspaper , the document called for East Jerusalem to become the capital of a future Palestinian state .
The EU has never recognised Israel 's annexation of the east of the city , which is illegal under international law .
Its formal position has been that the city 's status is to be decided in negotiations , although some EU leaders have called for it to be a future shared capital .
Israel 's foreign ministry reacted angrily to the reports , saying the apparent move by Sweden , which holds the EU presidency , " harms the European Union 's ability to take part as a significant mediator ... between Israel and the Palestinians " .
It said the EU should be pressuring the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table , but the step would have " the opposite effect . "
About a third of Jerusalem 's residents - a quarter of a million people - are Palestinians with Israeli residency or Israeli - Arabs , who have Israeli citizenship .
Israel 's annexation of the east of the city has never been recognised by the international community .

U.S. Parachutists in Haiti .
© US Department of Defense
In publishing " Was the earthquake in Haiti caused by the United States ? " , our purpose was to bring out an issue that is stirring military and media circles in several countries , but which is being ignored in others [ 1 ] .
What matters here is not to take a stand .
In keeping with our approach , though often misunderstood , we maintain that it is impossible to have a good grasp of international relations without studying what the leaders of this planet have at the back of their minds .
Prevailing conformity has led to a situation where , while no one is ruffled when we report on contentious issues kindling in Washington , a general outcry is fueled when the controversy stems from a non-aligned country .
It would appear that Europeans have a preconceived opinion that only " western " concerns are pertinent while all the others should not be taken seriously .
One of our collaborators attempted to trace the origin of the allegation regarding the possible artificial causes of the earthquake in Haiti .
He was concerned that the whole thing might have been a hoax launched by a certain David Booth ( alias Sorcha Faal ) , which then penetrated government circles throughout the world .
In the end , we are not sure exactly who is behind the allegation , but what we know for certain is that this issue is being heatedly discussed at the highest level in several countries in Latin America , Eastern Europe and Asia .
As editor - in - chief of Voltaire Network , I made the decision to research and translate the dispatch from VivéTv , which had been disseminated as a communiqué on the website of the Communications Ministry of Venezuela , and to publish it together with the related video from Russia Today , preceded by the remark : " Oddly enough , the Venezuelan channel designates the Russian Army as the source of these claims whereas the Russian channel attributes them to President Chávez . "
While these elements were faithfully relayed by numerous newspapers , especially in the Middle East , they were distorted by the Atlanticist media which chose to reflect Sorcha Faal ’s article .
Faal pulled certain fragments from the VivéTv text , and by adding inverted commas put them into Hugo Chávez ’s mouth .
What was initially intended as a working hypothesis has been converted into the Government ’s position .
Some of these media outlets went so far as to completely fabricate the context in which President Chávez expressed himself , pointedly implying that the President and his audience suffer from acute anti-american frenzy and that Voltaire Network shares the same ailment .
But instead of yielding to this manipulation , let us go deeper into this hypothesis .
How much do we know about seismic weapons at present ?
During the Second World War , a group of New Zealand researchers attempted to develop a device capable of provoking tsunamis that could be unleashed against Japan .
The research work was conducted by Thomas Leech , an Australian national , at Auckland University behind the code name of " Project Seal " .
Several small - scale test explosions were carried out successfully , between 1944 and 1945 , at Whangaparaoa off the coast of Auckland .
The United States deemed this programme to be as equally promising as the " Manhattan Project " , involving the development of the atomic bomb , and appointed Dr. Karl T. Compton to maintain the liaison between the two research units .
Compton was an American physicist and president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1948 .
The work started by Thomas Leech was pursued during the Cold War .
In 1947 , King George VI elevated him to the rank of Knight of the British Empire for his role in the elaboration of this new weapon .
At the time , Project Seal was still a military secret and it was therefore not disclosed that Thomas Leech had in fact been rewarded for concocting the " tsunami bomb " .
Subsequently , the US intelligence services covered it up by claiming that the research had never really existed and that the whole thing had been an artifice to impress the Soviets .
However , the authenticity of Leech ’s tests was established in 1999 , when the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs declassified part of the documentation .
The research studies are officially back on track and taking place at the University of Waikato . [ 2 ]
It is not known whether the research undertaken by the Anglo - Saxons continued during the 60’s , but it was resumed by force of circumstances when atmospheric nuclear tests were abandoned in favour of sub -marine tests .
The United States was afraid of provoking earthquakes and tsunamis unintentionally .
They preferred to learn how to do it intentionally .
Officially , at the end of the Vietnam War , the United States and the Soviet Union gave up environmental wars ( earthquakes , tsunamis , environmental balance destabilization , atmospheric modification - clouds , rain , cyclones , tornadoes - , modification of the climate , ocean currents , the ozone layer and the ionosphere ) upon signing the 1976 " Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques " .
Nevertheless , in 1975 , the USSR embarked on a new research , this time in the field of Magnetohydrodynamics ( MHD ) for the purpose of studying the earth ’s crust and be able to anticipate earthquakes .
The Soviets examined the possibility of provoking small quakes in order to forestall a big one .
This research was quickly militarized and resulted in the construction of Pamir , the earthquake machine .
After the dismemberment of the USSR , those in charge of this programme decided to go to the United States for lure of money , but the Pentagon refused to pay them since their research was incomplete .
In 1995 , when Russia was governed by Boris Yeltsin and oligarch Viktor Chernomyrdin , the US Air Force recruited the researchers working at their Nizhny Novgorod laboratory .
They built a much more powerful machine , Pamir 3 , that was tested successfully .
At that point , the Pentagon bought the men together with the material and shipped them to the United States , where they were incorporated into the HAARP programme .
" The Earthquake Machine " , excerpt from a French television Channel 5 programme , based on a documentary by Jeff Swimmer " Les colères du climat " ( The wrath of climate ) aired on National Geographic ( 2005 ) .

Various instances where the seismic weapon might have been employed have been contemplated , especially in Algeria and Turkey .
However , the most discussed one is the 12 May 2008 earthquake in Sichuan ( China ) .
During the 30 minutes that preceded the earthquake , the inhabitants of the region observed atypical colours in the sky .
While some interpreted these events as a sign that the sky was repudiating the Communist Party , others reacted in a more rational way .
The same energy used to provoke the earthquake is also likely to have perturbed the ionosphere .
30 minutes before the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China
Back to Haiti
Nothing distinguishes an artificial earthquake from a natural one ; this being said , it should be specified that it is possible to induce only superficial earthquakes , like the one in Haiti .
What is particularly disturbing is the reaction of the United States .
While the Western media are immersed in a controversy over the violation of Haiti ’s sovereignty , the Latin American media are perplexed about the swiftness of GI deployment : as of the first day , more than 10000 soldiers and contractors arrived in Haiti .
This logistical feat can be easily explained since these troops were already pre-positioned in the context of a military exercise .
Under the orders of General P.K. Keen , Military Deputy Commander of U.S. Southern Command ( USSOUTHCOM ) , they took part in an excercise simulating a humanitarian operation in Haiti after a hurricane .
Keen and his staff had arrived a few days earlier .
At the precise moment that the earth shook , they were already sheltered in the US Embassy , built in compliance with anti-earthquake norms ; only two men who were not at the Embassy but at the Hotel Montana have been reported injured .
General Keen has granted several interviews to the US media , which has provided ample coverage mainly focusing on the relief operations .
While Keen ’s presence in Port - au - Prince during the earthquake has been referred to several times , the reasons for his presence were never mentioned .
Among the objectives of the military exercise was the application of a new software enabling the NGOs and the armed forces to coordinate their humanitarian efforts .
In the few minutes that followed the catastrophe , the software was put on line and 280 NGOs readily signed up .
It is legitimate to question whether such coincidences could simply be due to chance .

Snowball the overweight hedgehog is running and swimming his way back to health
With Christmas just around the corner , many of us will pile on a few festive pounds , but it would take a substantial Christmas feast to outdo Snowball the hedgehog .
Too much of a good life eating dog food has taken its toll on the overweight albino hedgehog , whose weight is three times what is normal for his species .
Snowball currently tips the scales at 1.5 kilograms - a normal hedgehog weighs just 500 grams .
Heavyweight hedgehog : Snowball , at 1.5 kg , is three times the size of a normal member of his species
Scales do n't lie : Snowball has been placed on an intensive swimming and running regime and has lost 38g so far
His eating began to threaten his health , and St Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Buckinghamshire was called in to help him shed the extra weight .
Staff at St Tiggywinkles have placed him on a diet of low - fat kitten biscuits and are getting his heart pumping through running and swimming sessions .
Only one in 10,000 hedgehogs is born albino , so Snowball was already quite a rare find even before his weight ballooned .
A member of the public took Snowball to the hospital in October .
St Tiggywinkles founder Les Stocker said Snowball was in for a long rehabilitation .
' He has been eating a lot of dog food , ' he said .
' People put it out for hedgehogs and given half a chance they just eat and eat and eat . '
Snowball has so far shed 38 grams .
He will remain in training at the hospital until the summer , when he will be released into a protected area for other albinos of his breed .

Those who follow various media battles about climate science and policy are undoubtedly familiar with the nonsensical and scurrilous commentary to be found in the Wall Street Journal , and even in major dailies like the Washington Post .
But no other North American daily newspaper can come close to the Canadian contrarian newspaper of record for intellectual dishonesty , factual distortion and sheer volume of misinformation .
I ’m speaking , of course , of the Toronto - based National Post , which provides a home to such climate “ experts ” as Lorne Gunter , Peter Foster and Terence Corcoran , as well as a platform for notable Canadian contrarians such as faux - environmentalist Lawrence Solomon ( of “ The Deniers ” fame ) and economist and climate gadfly Ross McKitrick .
As the Post spews forth ever - mounting volleys of falsehoods on its FP Comment page in its shrieking campaign against the “ Copenhagen Catastrophe ” , it is worth reviewing the history of the Post ’s climate hysteria , whose roots go right back to the newspaper ’s founding in 1998 .
The story involves three notorious figures with a common , if less than lofty , agenda .
The first of course , is newspaper magnate and convicted felon Conrad Black who took over the Canada ’s largest newspaper chain , Southam , in 1996 and founded the National Post as its flagship national newspaper in 1998 :
Black established the Post to provide a voice for Canadian conservatives and to combat what he and many Canadian conservatives considered to be a liberal bias in Canadian newspapers .
Black built the new paper around the Financial Post , an established financial newspaper in Toronto … Financial Post was retained as the name of the new paper ’s business section .
In order to put the requisite ideological stamp on the Financial Post section , Black hired away veteran columnist Terence Corcoran from the Globe and Mail and installed him as editor .
( Today Corcoran oversees the execrable FP Comment pages and writes about three columns a week ) .
The Ryerson Review of Journalism described Corcoran ’s long career back to 1971 :
All that time , he ’s been one of the country ’s most prominent libertarians , advocating for the abolition of the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , criticizing government policies that tried to make Nortel a “ national champion , ” attacking dairy price supports as a “ heist ” and famously denouncing both scientists and policy makers as a skeptic of climate change .
Or as Richard Littlemore at DesmogBlog put it :
As a business columnist in the Globe and Mail in the 1990s , Corcoran was reported to run shrieking into the managing editor ’s office any time a ( well - documented ) science story crept into the pages of what was then the nation ’s only national newspaper .
As a result , the mid-level editors lived in fear and the environment reporters threw up their hands when asked why the Globe was n’t covering the story .
Curiously for someone given to pompous verbosity on any number of subjects , Conrad Black himself has been largely silent on climate science .
Until a week or so ago , that is :
Till now , I have avoided more than very limited comment on the whole global - warming - carbon emissions controversy .
But now that colossal spending and regulating programs impend on these issues , I must say that the Al Gore - David Suzuki conventional - wisdom hysteria is an insane scam .
“ Hysteria ” .
“ Insane scam ” .
Well , that certainly clears up a lot .
With the freedom afforded by a sympathetic owner , Corcoran turned to the remaining member of our story ’s triumverate : an obscure engineer and space technology analyst turned freelance writer named Tom Harris .
In this early period , Harris teamed up with Carleton University geology professor Tim Patterson in a series of articles published in the Post , and other Black properties like the Ottawa Citizen and the Hamilton Spectator , as seen at Harris ’s early web page .
( Patterson is a charter member of the Freinds of Science advisory board , and is now chairman for Harris ’s latest creation , the International Climate Science Coalition ) .
Sure enough , early efforts shared Black ’s animus towards Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki .
A typical example is this early tirade from April 1998 in the Post :
David Suzuki ’s new film , Turning Down the Heat , was aired on CBC - TV last night .
This government - sponsored video explains how alternative , non-fossil fuel technologies can provide solutions to what Dr. Suzuki calls “ the greatest threat to humanity in the modern era ” — the climate crisis .
After smearing the CBC as if it were a government propaganda arm , the duo moved on to a depressingly familiar litany of contrarian talking points :
Suzuki seems to be relying far too much on predictions made by global warming theorists who work with computer models of the future but use little actual data .
With the support of biologists , who generally lack a proper understanding of long - term climate dynamics , environmental groups , mass media and government have treated these theoretical scenarios as credible indicators of future environmental change …
Despite a 0.6 - degree warming that has occurred over the past century ( most of which was in the early 1900s before worldwide industrialization and the period of greatest carbon dioxide buildup ) , overall , temperatures have dropped about three degrees in the past 5,000 years .
Whether short - term global warming is occurring or not ( the data are not clear ) , another ice age will definitely begin within the next few thousand years .
While this is no excuse for continuing to foul our own nest , a gradual greenhouse gas buildup may be a blessing , something that could delay the onset of the next glacial period , or at least reduce its severity .
Shorter Harris : Global warming may or may not be happening , and greenhouse gas emissions may or may not be causing it , but we should worry more about the coming Ice Age in any case .
In 2000 , the Post and Black ’s other dailies , now under the Hollinger imprimatur , were sold to the Asper family ( where they remain today as part of the troubled CanWest media empire ) .
But Harris continued on much as before through to the beginning of 2002 .
In 2002 , Harris parlayed his freelance career into a new political role as aide to Canadian Alliance environment critic Bob Mills under then opposition leader Stephen Harper .
In a few short months , Harris left an indelible stamp on the Canadian Alliance policy , moving it to a more explicit “ skeptic ” position .
A key press release written and issued by Harris on Mills ’s behalf complained bitterly thet “ skeptics ” were being shut out of the Kyoto process by Liberal environment minister David Anderson :
“ David Anderson has just circulated an e-mail to every MP and Senator in the House of Commons debunking the research findings of one of the world ’s leading climate specialists , MIT ’s Professor Richard Lindzen , ” said Bob Mills , Senior Environment Critic for the Canadian Alliance … .
“ Similarly , his Climate Change Secretariat would not allow Kyoto science skeptics such as Professor Tim Patterson , a leading paleo - climatoligist , into the Kyoto public consultations sessions held in June …
How can we possibly make good decisions on Kyoto when the Minister of the Environment hides the full scope of the climate change debate from Canadians ? ”
Later in 2002 , Harris moved on to become a public relations consultant , specializing in the deceptive practices pioneered by APCO Worldwide on behalf of the tobacco industry .
And where better to practice that black art , but in the Ottawa office of APCO .
In this period , Harris still wrote from time to time .
But his attention turned increasingly to the role of behind - the - scenes fixer ; production and follow up promotion of the Friends of Science video kept him quite busy in 2004 - 5 .
Terence Corcoran ’s Financial
Post section continued to give ample space for the Harris stable of hacks associated with the Friends of Science and other groups .
And Harris honed a new technique : the open letter or petition , signed by the usual reliable climate “ experts ” .
No fewer than three of these were run in the Post over the years :
Over time , the rest of the CanWest newspapers distanced themselves from the Post ’s hardline skeptic stance .
For instance , several of the newspapers ran Mike de Souza ’s hard - hitting series on Friends of Science , which extended SourceWatch research on FOS to lay bare the dubious activities of University of Calgary political science professor Barry Cooper .
Along the way , de Souza revealed the key role of APCO Worldwide in the “ research ” projects , and the use of the funds by Conservative activist and lobbyist Morten Paulsen to produce and run targeted anti-Kyoto ads in the 2005 - 6 federal election .
And most of the newspapers , with the notable exception of the Calgary Herald , have moved from “ balanced ” agnosticism to some appreciation of the reality of anthropogenic climate change .
Meanwhile , Corcoran ’s FP Comment , serves up ever more copious amounts of anti-scientific drivel , necessitating a growung cast of regular columnists and rotating guests .
We ’ve only scratched the surface by cataloguing some of Lorne Gunter ’s endless supply of howlers and falsehoods .
Of late , the large volume of climate nonsense resembles ignorant schoolboys cribbing from each other – the same mistakes get repeated by one columnist after another .
For example , both Lawrence Solomon and Ross McKitrick repeated the canard that the slapdash Wegman panel on the “ hockey stick ” controversy had some official connection to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences , implying equivalence to the official NAS / NRC comprehensive report and panel led by Gerald North .
Solomon referred to two “ NAS Panels ” , while McKitrick wrote of “ [ t ] wo expert panels involving the U.S. National Academy of Sciences ” .
Still , for sheer abdication of journalistic ethics , it ’s hard to beat the collaboration of Corcoran and Harris , especially on the Bali open letter project .
Although much of that story can be found at SourceWatch , full details have yet to be released .
It ’s a timely story , too , one that unfolded exactly two years ago during the Bali climate conference .
And a similar story appears about to play out once again in Copenhagen , even as I write these words .
Stay tuned ; you wo n’t have long to wait .
Have any movie directors or producers revealed themselves to be " masters " of science fiction in recent years ?
In this chart , we look at how some of the contenders for SF mastery have fared .
Advertisement
Update : I apologize , I have n't been online much due to the holidays .
I realized that there was an erroneous data point for Andrew Stanton in 2009 that was never supposed to be there .
I missed it when I initially looked over the graph , but it 's been removed now .
As we 've been reflecting on the last ten years , we 've been asking ourselves whether any true " masters " of science fiction and urban fantasy have emerged , especially in film and television .
It 's certainly been a decade of highs and lows , of old masters who 've begun to fade and bright new stars just cresting the horizon .
Advertisement
To that end , I 've attempted to chart the relative " master levels " of various directors and television producers over the several years .
This is an utterly unscientific chart ; I looked at the projects these folks have had since 2000 and assigned each one a " master level . "
The number reflects my understanding of the projects acclaim , its ability to attract an audience ( i.e. box office / Nielsen numbers ) , its awards , whether it succeeded in something unusual ( such as a relatively popular foreign language film in the case of Guillermo del Toro 's Pan 's Labyrinth or Dr. Horrible 's status as a breakthrough web film ) , and the nebulous sense that it add or subtracted from the individual 's " geek cred . "
The numbers themselves are largely subjective and , of course , you should feel free to nitpick .
The greater purpose was to offer a watercolory sense of whether any " masters " have emerged from this crowd .
Certainly , the last year has brought low some of the genres ' promising potentials .
Joss Whedon entered into the decade riding high on a Buffy / Angel cocktail .
Though his name was n't enough to overcome
Fox 's confusing treatment of Firefly , but the show 's eventual cult popularity led to the Serenity feature film , and the Whedon brand helped make Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog an important moment for web - based content .
Perhaps this all made Dollhouse — which has been , by turns , frustrating and brilliant — all the more disappointing , its impeding demise fairly readily accepted , even by Whedon 's fanbase .
Similarly , Ron Moore 's Battlestar Galactica , despite being regarded by some readers as the most overrated scifi of the decade , was regarded by many as a turning point for smart , politically savvy space opera .
But a rocky final season punctuated by finale filled with dei ex machinae left a lot of folks sour on the entire series .
And the Wachowskis , while doing a solid ( though Alan Moore - enraging ) bit of cinema with V for Vendetta , never quite lived up to the promises of The Matrix .

But there have been plenty of masterful bright spots as well .
Bryan Fuller gave us some beautiful urban fantasy with shows with Dead Like Me , Wonderfalls , and Pushing Daisies , even if many of his efforts ( including the truly amazing The Amazing Screw - On Head ) were prematurely axed , or shafted before ever getting off the ground .
Guillermo del
Toro brought us to great heights with Pan's Labyrinth , even if his other eye candy films did n't hit the same heights .

So have we seen any masters ?
Peter Jackson has certainly come close .
Granted ,
The Lord of the Rings movies are high fantasy , but they showcased Jackson 's ability to handle a difficult epic in a way that not only pleased JRR Tolkien 's fans , but also won him mainstream accolades .
And his remake of King Kong , which should have been automatically anathema , proved both profitable and well - reviewed .
The Lovely Bones has been his blip , earning him his worst reviews in 20 years .
But it 's more likely that 2009 will be remembered as the year Jackson introduced the world to filmmaker Neill Blomkamp , demonstrating that he has a good eye for new talent and the Hollywood cache to bring that talent to light .
It 's not for nothing that he made this year 's power list .

It 's our second annual science fiction power list , featuring the 20 most powerful people and teams Read more

Another power list member , JJ Abrams , has also given us a good spate of fun and thoughtful science fiction .
While he did n't give us the decade 's best monster movie , he did manage to reboot the Star Trek franchise in a way that was respectful to what came before and drew in folks who never turned into the TV shows .
Of course , we still have yet to see as Lost will end and whether Fringe will survive .

Chris Nolan is on the list of promising possibilities for eventual masterhood .
Although Memento was n't science fiction , it took a " what if " concept ( here , what if a man searching for his wife 's killer had no short term memory ) and portrayed it in a thoughtful , suspenseful , and ultimately heartbreaking way .
And he not only shot fresh blood into the corpse of the Batman franchise , he made it Oscar - worthy .
And now he 's continuing the science fiction thread with Inception .
And , of course , there 's the question of whether James Cameron will prove the kind of science fiction as much as he claimed to be the king of the world .
His foray into science fiction television , Dark Angel , never fared particularly well in the ratings ; it was eventually canceled in favor of Firefly , and it never achieved the posthumous popularity of the later show .
But perhaps Avatar is the reinforcement of his previous scifi successes , proof that he can still be relevant where other long - time directors have started to fade away .
Hopefully , we wo n't have to wait another 12 years to see his next installment .

Personally , though , after seeing the delightful Monsters Inc. followed by the superb The Incredibles and WALL-E , I have my fingers crossed for Andrew Stanton and Pixar Studios .
Here 's hoping that John Carter of Mars is something phenomenal .
Still , singling out directors and producers as possible masters might be missing the point entirely , even when we 're talking about movies and TV .
Alan Moore might well be your science fiction master , not just because he has written so many fantastic books , but also because those books have captured the imagination of so many directors in the last several years — albeit with varying results .
And in the coming years we 'll see how comic book writer Brian K. Vaughan — who has been working on Lost as well as the Buffy Season Eight comics — translates to the big screen when Y : The Last Man , Ex Machina , and Runaways hit theaters .

So who , if anyone , do you see as your science fiction master ?
Someone from the list above ?
Perhaps Russell T. Davis for reviving and expanding Doctor Who ?
Or maybe writers like Jane Espenson , who have worked on so many of the shows we love ?
And , with filmmakers like Neill Blomkamp and Duncan Jones arriving on the scene , who might prove themselves master of the genre in the next ten years ?

Here 's a bonus chart , with more data :
Like I said before , the first concrete work I ’m doing for Paint .
NET v4 is focused on the installer and updater .
A lot of people have told me that they use Paint.
NET infrequently , or that when they start it up they " just want to get something done really quickly . "
Updates really get in the way of that , and people are starting to get used to Firefox ’s ability to install an update after you ’ve finished your current session .
As a result , many people are still sitting on old versions of Paint.
NET .
Bummer 😦
Paint.NET v4 will support this :
I ’m choosing to not have a " cancel " or " do not install " button in order to better encourage ( trick ? ) people into installing the update .
However , it ’s still possible to skip out on installing the update … just click the ‘ X ’ in the top right corner .
The wording and graphics are still first draft .
I ’ll probably want a separate button icon for each of them .
Unfortunately this all wo n’t be available until v4 ships … which means that a v3.xx -> v4 upgrade , which requires the installation of .
NET 3.5 SP1 in many cases , cannot benefit from the more casual " install once I exit " option .
On another note , the " Optimizing performance for your system … " portion of installing , which uses ‘ ngen.exe ’ to precompile Paint .
NET , is much faster now with .
NET 3.5 SP1 .
I ’ve also made the installer report real progress on this operation instead of using the " marquee " or " indefinite " mode .
Another thing I ’m doing is implementing features in an order such that I could potentially ship a Paint.
NET v3.50 from this codebase if I decided it was necessary .
It might be a good idea to get .NET 3.5 SP1 installed on everyone ’s systems sooner rather than later !
A team of online game developers and boosters told the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday about worries that the big ISPs could fragment the Internet with " pay - for - priority " arrangements , causing economic troubles for the gaming industry similar to those created by mobile access providers .
" Software platform developers like Microsoft and Facebook pose less of a threat to innovation than infrastructure owners , " one developer told the agency , according to notes of the meeting .
He added that " if the Internet were balkanized , and developers had to negotiate separately with each ISP , that would be a substantial drag on innovation because it would divert resources from development . "
The game makers included Asheron 's Call producer Dan Scherlis , Jon Radoff of GamerDNA , Christopher Dyl of online world - maker Tubine , Matthew Bellows of voice chat developer Vivox , and Darius Kazemi of the International Game Developers Association .
Kent Quirk also attended , speaking for himself and not his employer , Linden Lab .
Meeting with four FCC staffers on the agency 's net neutrality docket , the participants were n't of one voice on this question .
In some instances they could see scenarios in which priority access deals or paying more for higher Quality of Service ( QoS ) might be fair .
But overall they seemed pretty nervous about the prospect .
" If developers had to spend time and resources negotiating with ISPs for quality service , that would be a drag on innovation and make the platform less attractive to innovators , " warned Jon Radoff , who took the meeting 's notes .
The conference came on the last day of the FCC 's call for comments on its proposed Internet non-discrimination rules .
As we 've reported , priority access is a big issue in this debate .
AT&T complains that the FCC 's proposals " would completely ban voluntary commercial agreements for the paid provision of certain value - added broadband services , which would needlessly deprive market participants , including content providers , from willingly obtaining services that could improve consumers ' Internet experiences . "
But , judging from the summary of the meeting , the market participants who met with the Commission on Thursday are n't so enthusiastic about these kind of voluntary deals .
Latency , not bandwidth
The big issue for the industry , these gamers told the FCC , is n't so much data capacity as latency — the time it takes data packets to travel to servers and then return .
Latency is a special problem for online games ; if the latency varies , jitter occurs .
So far , most developers have managed to tackle latency difficulties in the United States , one participant noted , many of which stemmed from WiFi router equipment .
But interconnection problems between ISPs can pose huge challenges , noted Christopher Dyl .
Turbine can serve up its games to Australia from servers in the United States without much trouble , while European subscribers have to get their data from game servers based in Europe .
" The problem is not the distance ( the speed of light ) but the different interconnections between the US and Europe , compared to between the US and Australia , " Dyl explained .
As more game graphic rendering gets handled up in the cloud , compensating for the limits of mobile devices , bandwidth will become more important , especially in the case of slow updates .
ISPs can help with this by providing prioritized services for an extra fee .
But " there will be a moral hazard , " Dan Scherlis suggested .
" ISPs will invest less in open access and more in services that they can provide at a premium . "
And that could harm the certainty of the online gaming environment , he continued :
Predictability is extremely important for gaming developers , who must design their games based on the characteristics of the network .
However , once products appear that take advantage of higher - priority QoS offerings by ISPs , new entrants will have to choose between paying for that QoS or foregoing the opportunity to compete in that space .
Thus , higher - priority QoS offerings will become essential to the industry sectors that grow to rely on them , giving the ISPs another form of monopoly power that , as responsible fiduciaries , they would be obligated to exploit , in an unregulated environment .
What these developers told the FCC they definitely do n't want is an environment similar to the mobile game landscape prior to the iPhone and its app stores .
In Europe , subscribers could purchase third party software for most phones , they explained .
But in the US , the big carriers created " walled gardens " where only applications that they sold would work .
As a consequence , carriers could demand huge percentages of developer revenue , in some instances as much as half .
They could also pick a small number of content providers to work with , who , in turn , could charge developers as much as half their revenue , just for opening up a chance to sell to the telco .
They would also like to avoid the choices offered in China , where several ISPs offer customers a " superior QoS " in reaching their subscribers from their servers .
" This is an easy promise to make , " Chris Dyl explained .
" All the ISP need do is ensure that non-ISP - hosted services suffer appreciable degradation as part of interconnection . "
Slotting fees
As a final analogy , the sextet of developers offered the Commission staff an interesting historical parallel : the " slotting fees " that supermarkets and bookstores began charging food makers and publishers in the 1980s for access to market shelves .
Researchers found that slotting fees put these markets beyond the reach of smaller vendors .
Sure , the group conceded — most consumers enjoy competition among grocers , but there 's less so among Internet providers .
" Subscriber choice in wireline Internet access ( and thus in affordable broadband Internet ) is sharply constrained by the choices municipalities have made in granting access to utility poles or to street trenches .
Having been granted this public resource , the ISP should assume some responsibility to the public , " the meeting notes conclude , " even beyond the promises they made while obtaining that access , back before the World Wide Web was invented . "
Lee Celano for The New York Times
House Democrats were thrilled by the passage of their major health care legislation , but perhaps no development on Saturday tickled them more than winning the vote of a single Republican : Representative Anh “ Joseph ” Cao of Louisiana .
Mr. Cao ( pronounced gow ; rhymes with cow ) , a freshman from New Orleans , was elected last year in an upset victory over Representative William J. Jefferson , a Democrat who was under indictment on federal corruption charges at the time and has since been convicted .
“ Tonight , I voted to keep taxpayer dollars from funding abortion and to deliver access to affordable health care to the people of Louisiana , ” Mr. Cao said in a statement posted on his Web site .
“ I read the versions of the House bill .
I listened to the countless stories of Orleans and Jefferson Parish citizens whose health care costs are exploding — if they are able to obtain health care at all .
Louisianans needs real options for primary care , for mental health care , and for expanded health care for seniors and children . ”
In the statement , Mr. Cao also said that he had secured a personal commitment from President Obama on health issues important to Louisiana , including disparities in federal reimbursement rates for Medicaid .
And while many Democrats complained that tighter restrictions on insurance coverage for abortions had threatened support for the bill on their side , Mr. Cao said that those tougher restrictions encouraged him to support the bill .
Mr. Cao ’s vote offered a rare break in ranks for the House Republican minority , which has tried hard to stay unified on major political issues .
On the economic stimulus measure , for instance , the Republicans voted unanimously in opposition .
But it was not the first time Mr. Cao broke with his party .
He was one of 29 Republicans to join Democrats earlier this year in voting to reauthorize the Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
Democrats , teasingly , immediately claimed a mantle of bipartisanship for their health care legislation .
“ This was , as you observed , a bipartisan vote , ” the House majority leader , Representative Steny H. Hoyer , Democrat of Maryland , said at a news conference to celebrate the passage of the bill .
Mr. Cao , who made his decision near the end of the 15 - minute voting period , quickly slipped out of the House chamber and eluded news reporters .
He is certain to enjoy political celebrity in the days ahead , though it is unclear it will help his political prospects .
Democrats are already lining up to challenge Mr. Cao next year , and analysts consistently rate his district is among the most likely to switch to Democrat from Republican control .
Mr. Cao , a lawyer , is a minority in several senses : a Republican amid a crowd of Democrats ; a Vietnamese - American in an overwhelmingly black district .
In his election campaign last year , Mr. Cao promised ethics and integrity .
He was born in Vietnam ( he is the first Vietnamese - American member of Congress ) and he fled with two siblings after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 , moving to live with an uncle in Indiana .
He holds a master ’s degree in philosophy from Fordham University and received his law degree from Loyola University .
His vote in favor of the health care legislation contrasted with the “ no ” vote by Representative Charlie Melancon , a Democrat from southern Louisiana , who is running for the Senate next year .
Senator Mary Landrieu , Democrat of Louisiana , has expressed reservations about the health care legislation , particularly the proposal for a government - run insurance plan or public option .
She is being courted aggressively by Senate Democratic leaders who need all 60 members of the Democratic caucus to advance the health care bill .
The only Republican Senator to vote in favor of the health care legislation during the committee process was Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , but Ms. Snowe has since said she will oppose bringing up the bill for debate because the majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , added a government plan to the bill .
Lots of Americans use unemployment benefits insurance to pay their bills while they ’re looking for a new job .
Many people consider it free money that can help you get by in dire times .
But is unemployment taxable ?
Unfortunately it is , and for that reason , it ’s best not to consider it “ free money . ”
Your unemployment benefits are taxed like income , and you ’ll have to pay those taxes on unemployment during tax season when you file your return .
Sometimes , the Federal government accidentally overpays a huge amount of money in unemployment benefits .
If you were overpaid unemployment , you might have to repay it come tax season .
When it comes to collecting unemployment overpayments , the Federal Government only recovers about a quarter of its losses .
In fact , there ’s even a procedure in place for those who have received overpayments but are n’t able to pay the money back ; they might be able to waive the repayment amount and subsequent fees .
The only criterion is that the recipient must prove that they did not set out to purposely deceive the Federal Government .
Unemployment Eligibility Requirements
The U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance Program provides benefit payments to newly unemployed workers who lost their job “ through no fault of their own . ”
If you ’re an employee of the Federal Government , you may be eligible for unemployment during a Federal shutdown .
States are generally allowed to interpret that condition in their own way .
But , for all intents and purposes , workers who are fired are usually not eligible for unemployment benefits .
You ’ll be eligible for unemployment benefits if you were laid off from your job due to budget cuts or downsizing .
If you lived in one state and worked in another , the laws of your employer ’s state will apply , and not the laws of your state of residence .
It ’s important to understand that unemployment benefits are not supposed to be your primary income .
It ’s only a temporary source of income that ’s meant to help you cover some living costs while you search for another job .
The amount of benefits that you receive is not dependent on your financial needs or lifestyle ; a government formula will determine how much you receive .
If you ’re going to collect unemployment benefits , you must be ready , willing , and able to work , and you must make a genuine effort to find new employment .
There is usually a minimum number of jobs that you ’re required to apply or interview for , so if you ’re going to claim unemployment , it ’s best to spruce up your resume and start scrolling through job sites .
You should keep detailed records of your job search efforts , whether they ’re by phone , email , mail , online , or in - person .
Your state ’s unemployment authorities might demand to see your records at any time for proof that you ’re making an actual effort to find work .
Many states require that you report your job search activities weekly .
Whenever you ’re in a financial bind , it ’s helpful to reign in your spending as best you can and determine what your most minimal living costs can be .
Use a budgeting app to help keep you from running through your unemployment funds faster than you can get a new job .
Types of Unemployment Tax Breaks
In the past , you could deduct a number of expenses related to your job search , like transportation , relocation costs , and seminar fees .
Unfortunately , these deductibles were eliminated by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act .
But there are still certain ways you can find financial relief during unemployment .
EITC Eligibility
The Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) is a tax break for workers who do n’t have a very large income .
If you ’ve earned income during the year ( not including your unemployment benefits ) , you might be able to use that amount to make a credit claim .
Single taxpayers can claim EITC , but workers with dependent children benefit from it the most .
Starting a Business
There are lots of people who , when unemployed , decide that they ’re going to go into business for themselves .
The IRS has three categories of tax deductions for startup businesses :
Creating a business / investigating creation of business : Deductible costs might include surveying markets , analyzing cost of products , exploring potential business locations , and other early costs .
Preparing the business to open : Deductible costs might include employee training , travel expenses , advertising expenses , and consultant fees .
Equipment cost is not deductible , but you may be able to claim future tax deductions on depreciation .
Organizational costs : Deductible costs might include legal fees , state organizational fees , and initial salaries .
You might need to have your business legally established within the end of the first fiscal year to claim these deductions .
Cash - Out Retirement Plan Early
If your unemployment has left you in a dire financial situation , you could consider cashing out your retirement plan and using it as emergency funds .
Typically , there ’s a 10 % early withdrawal fee , but the IRS allows taxpayers to cash out their retirement plan tax - free if it ’s a “ hardship withdrawal . ”
Of course , you should n’t tap into your retirement savings without careful consideration .
You should only do so if there ’s no other sort of financial relief you can get , and if you ’re facing homelessness or illness due to inability to pay medical expenses .
If you do decide to cash your retirement funds , then you should come up with an aggressive financial plan to replenish your retirement fund once you ’re employed again .
How Unemployment Overpayments Happen
The most common reason for overpayment is attributed to clerical errors that qualify an applicant for regular payment when that person would normally not have qualified for unemployment benefits .
That includes people who quit their jobs , were fired for negligence , who are n’t actively looking for work , or who have found another job .
The overpayment amounts are significant , especially when viewed through the lens of strained state budgets : Colorado once overpaid by $ 128 million in a single year , while Indiana paid out more incorrect benefits than correct ones .
Withholding Tax Now vs. Paying It Later
Overpayments are n’t the only concern for the unemployed .
Even though taxes are n’t taken out of your unemployment check , you ’re still expected to pay taxes on the benefits you collect , which is taxed as regular income .
Additionally , any supplemental benefits coming from company - funded programs are not taxed as income , but as “ wages . ”
That means that you ’re going to get a W - 2 for them at the end of the year , and the IRS will tax you then .
In some states , you have the option to collect taxes that are withheld at the time the unemployment check is issued .
Generally , 10 percent is withheld from the check .
This withholding is optional , and recipients can elect to collect the entire amount and pay taxes on it at the end of the year instead .
Collecting a larger check is tempting , but it ’s wise to have the taxes withheld from your unemployment check .
Taking a hit now is better than owing the IRS at the end of the year .
If you end up with a tax refund at the end of the year instead of owing , that money can go toward any bills you incurred as a result of being unemployed .
If you still decide to not have tax withheld from your unemployment benefits , make sure to set aside a portion of each check ( say 10 percent ) in a high - yield , interest - bearing account .
Reporting Unemployment on 1099 - G
When you receive unemployment compensation , you will get issued a 1099 - G at the end of the year .
This is how the IRS keeps track of any income received from governmental sources .
You are required to report this as income , and failing to do so might be one of the biggest tax mistakes you can make .
If you fail to report your unemployment benefits as income , it ’s unlikely you ’re going to end up federal prison for tax evasion .
But the fees and penalties associated with lying on your taxes are significant .
And if you get audited ( even if all your other finances are clean ) the process will be time - consuming and potentially expensive .
When it comes to paying taxes , honesty is always the best policy .
Reporting unemployment income on your taxes is easy .
There are lines on your tax forms that are specifically for any 1099 - G income .
FAQs
Why did I receive a Form 1099 -G ?
You received Form 1099 - G because you received unemployment benefits during the year .
You ’ll report the funds that you received on Form 1099 - G .
How do I report this unemployment information on my income taxes ?
If you received unemployment benefits , you ’ll receive Form 1099 - G in the mail .
Report your unemployment on this form .
I never received Form 1099 -G ?
If you never received Form 1099 - G , but you did receive unemployment benefits for the tax year , you ’re still obligated to report your benefits on Form 1099 - G when you file your taxes .
Failure to do so may result in heavy tax penalties and fees .
Order the form on the IRS website , fill it out , and include it with your tax return .
Can I get my Form 1099 - G information online ?
Form 1099 - G is not available online .
You can mail - order the form here .
May I send an inquiry regarding my Form 1099 - G by fax or mail ?
Yes !
You may send an inquiry via mail or fax .
However , your information ca n’t be faxed back to you due to confidentiality concerns , so it ’ll be returned to you via mail .
Why is my overpayment , which I repaid , not reported on my Form 1099 -G ?
The IRS handles overpayments separately from your tax return .
If you were subject to non-fraud overpayment ( in other words , if the overpayment was n’t your fault ) , then you would receive a notice from the IRS telling you whether or not you must repay the overpayment .
If you already repaid your overpayment , and you receive an IRS notice demanding repayment , you should contact your local IRS office .

For the third time , the Supreme Court on Monday reversed the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and restored a death sentence for a California murderer who bludgeoned a young woman in 1981 to steal a stereo from her house .
The justices , in a unanimous , unsigned opinion , rejected the notion that Fernando Belmontes should be spared because his lawyer had failed him by not presenting mitigating evidence about Belmontes ’ childhood .
“ It is hard to imagine . . . additional facts about Belmontes ’ difficult childhood outweighing the facts of [ Steacy ] McConnell ’s murder , ” the justices said .
“ We agree with the state court ’s characterization of the murder ” as one of “ ‘ extraordinary brutality ’ and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve ‘ needless suffering . ’ ”
Belmontes broke into McConnell ’s home in the small Central California town of Victor , near Stockton , and struck her in the head 15 or 20 times with a steel barbell , crushing her skull .
She put up “ a desperate struggle for [ her ] life , ” the court said , but died a few hours after the beating .
Belmontes and two accomplices sold her stereo for $ 100 and used the money to buy beer and drugs .

In 1982 a jury convicted Belmontes and condemned him to die , and the California Supreme Court affirmed his sentence in 1988 .
Since then , the case has been on appeal in the federal courts .
Under the Habeas Corpus
Act , state defendants can sue in a federal court and argue that they are being punished in violation of the U.S. Constitution .
Three times in this decade , the 9th Circuit Court ruled in favor of Belmontes and set aside his death sentence .
In the first two decisions , the appeals court said jurors may have thought they could not weigh evidence about Belmontes ’ conversion to Christianity as a reason for sparing his life .
State prosecutors sent appeals to Washington after each of these rulings .
In the first case , the high court set aside the 9th Circuit ruling in a brief order and said the decision should be reconsidered .
The second time , the justices issued a written ruling reversing the appeals court .
When the case returned to the 9th Circuit , Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Richard Paez , both of Los Angeles , wrote a new opinion and said the lawyer for Belmontes failed to “ humanize ” him and give jurors a basis for sparing his life .
Advertisement
On Monday , the justices disagreed again .
In a 14 - page opinion , they concluded it was “ fanciful ” to believe jurors would have spared Belmontes had they heard more about his childhood .
The case illustrates the continuing dispute over the death penalty between state prosecutors and federal judges in California .
The state has 685 inmates on death row , by far the most in the nation .
Yet , executions are rare .
Since capital punishment was restored in 1977 , the state has carried out 13 executions .
Many of the cases have remained tied up in federal litigation for decades .
Mark A. Johnson , a deputy attorney general in Sacramento , said the Belmontes litigation may be nearing an end .
“ This decision finally resolves all the outstanding issues , ” he said .
“ But then again , you can never say ‘ never ’ with these capital cases . ”

At 2:05 a.m. Sunday , guards at the James A. Musick jail in Irvine dealt with a man apparently eager to get into the place .
Rather than stop at the front gate of the jail , Matthew Van McDaniel , 25 , drove a late - model Mercedes - Benz through it , Orange County Sheriff ’s Department Lt. Janet Lonich said .
McDaniel got out of his car , which was left in drive and later hit a tree on the jail campus , Lonich said .
His later confrontation with a Sheriff ’s Department sergeant turned into “ a little physical altercation , ” Sgt. Fritz Von Rettberg said .
McDaniel escaped after giving the sergeant some cuts and bruises , Von Rettberg said .
But deputies soon arrested him on the jail campus .
“ It ’s the first time somebody tried to break into the jail , ” Sheriff ’s Department spokesman Jim Amormino said .
McDaniel , a dancer , was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving , assault on a police officer , resisting arrest and unspecified weapons charges , Von Rettberg said .
The jail and the gate were not damaged , Lonich said .

True , this is just about the time with some D.C. area snowstorms that the computer models suddenly throw a curveball , some forecasters start to backpedal from their original accumulation predictions , and chaos ensues .
Not so this time , at least not as of this morning 's latest data , which continues to suggest a major winter storm is on track to wallop the metro area .
Something interesting to keep an eye on -- or really , ear out for -- during this storm is thunder .
Yes , I said thunder .
Thundersnow is rare , but not uncommon when it comes to powerful winter storms like this one , which can generate the strong vertical motions in the atmosphere needed to create lightning .
The most likely time for thundersnow would be during the most intense part of the storm , which shapes up to be Saturday morning into afternoon .

Your garden variety telecom policy issue rarely gets beyond the usual places in Washington , notably Capitol Hill and the main meeting room at the Federal Communications Commission .
But a few issues do escape , among them debates about the FCC 's broadcast ownership rules , white space devices , and now , net neutrality .
New York 's City Council and San Francisco's Board of Supervisors have resolutions before them backing the Commission 's efforts to enact tougher Internet non-discrimination measures .
Each is currently making its way through the committee process .
Go slow on both coasts
San Francisco considered its measure at a hearing just before Thanksgiving .
The resolution urges the FCC to " to codify strong network neutrality principles in order to ensure that the Internet will continue to foster innovation , increase competition , and spur economic growth as well as making the Internet faster and more affordable for all . "
In New York , language favoring both the FCC 's efforts and Rep. Ed Markey 's ( D - MA ) Internet Freedom Preservation Act ( H.R. 3458 ) received support and criticism at a recent hearing held before the Council 's Committee on Technology in Government .
The Markey Bill would make it unlawful for ISPs to " block , interfere with , discriminate against , impair , or degrade the ability of any person to use an Internet access service , " and would authorize the FCC to enforce this principle .
FCC Chair Julius Genachowski contends the agency already has the authority to take that step , and he has proposed rules that would add an enforcement and transparency mechanism to the Commission 's Internet Policy Statement .
The Big Apple 's proposed statement smiling upon these efforts is being moved along by council member Gale Brewer , who represents Manhattan 's Upper West Side and Clinton neighborhoods .
The document is preceded by the usual lengthy pile of whereases , eg : " Whereas , many are concerned that charging for services will lead to a type of Internet ' toll road ' where an individual 's access to locations on the Internet will be faster to the websites of those content providers who pay a higher price to the network owner , " and therefore the City Council calls upon the FCC and Congress to enact these proposals .
But both the east and west coasts seem to be moving somewhat cautiously towards making decisions on these matters .
San Francisco 's resolution , sponsored by Supervisors Chris Daly and Michela Alioto - Pier , has been referred to the Board 's rules committee , which is scheduled to meet twice in December .
Meanwhile , a staffer at Councilmember Brewer 's office told us that her text will be voted on by the Technology Committee on December 9 ; then , if approved , it will move to a full council decision by the end of the month .
The language of the statement may be tweaked a bit between now and then , possibly over wireless issues , he said , but " nothing majorly substantive " will change .
BMW is putting the brakes on real world testing of the 7 Series Hydrogen vehicles , citing a " lack of infrastructure and high conversion costs , " AllCarsElectric.com reports .
Though claims to see promise in hydrogen technology , rumors have been circulating in Europe that the automaker is on its way to abandoning hydrogen power altogether .
North America spokesman David Buchko , however , says this is not the case .
The 7 Series hydrogen vehicles will continue testing in controlled environments , such as on test tracks and in labs , but BMW is pulling the plug on " real - world driving . "
Because only 200 hydrogen stations exist worldwide , most of which are reserved for commercial , military , government , and use , the concept of hydrogen vehicles has never received enough support to get off the ground .
BMW announced last week that a new electric model two - door sedan would be unveiled at the Detroit auto show next month .
Greek authorities are arresting large numbers of migrants and asylum seekers in the country 's cities and islands and moving many of them to the north , raising fears of illegal expulsions to Turkey , Human Rights Watch said today .
Human Rights
Watch received reports from a credible source that , in mid-July 2009 , police transferred a group of Arabic - speaking people from Chios Island to the Evros border region , where they were secretly forced to cross the border into Turkey .
On July 23 , local human rights activists prevented authorities from transferring 63 migrants from Lesvos Island to the north by blocking access to the ferry .
On July 25 , the police took most of them to Athens under heavy police escort .
" These operations and transfers are very worrying , " said Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch .
" We fear that people are being prevented from seeking asylum , that children arriving alone are not being protected , and that migrants are kept in unacceptable detention conditions and possibly even being secretly expelled to Turkey . "
In another recent episode , in a large - scale police operation from July 16 to 18 , police in Athens surrounded what appeared to be several hundred migrants and locked them inside an abandoned courthouse .
The police arrested anyone who left the building .
It is feared that some of them may have needed protection and did not have a chance to file a claim for asylum , the police prevented Human Rights Watch from speaking to the people held inside , and Human Rights Watch does not know the whereabouts of those who were arrested when they tried to leave .
In a November 2008 report , " Stuck in a Revolving Door : Iraqis and Other Asylum Seekers and Migrants at the Greece / Turkey Entrance to the European Union , " Human Rights Watch documented how Greek authorities have systematically expelled migrants illegally across the Greece - Turkey border , in violation of many international legal obligations .
These " pushbacks " typically occur at night from detention facilities in the northern part of the country , close to the Turkish border , and they involve considerable logistical preparation .
Human Rights
Watch at that time interviewed 41 asylum seekers and refugees - all privately and confidentially - in various locations in both Greece and Turkey , who gave consistent accounts of Greek authorities taking them to the Evros River at night and then forcing them across .
Human Rights
Watch also documented how Greek authorities miscategorize unaccompanied children as adults and detain them for prolonged periods of time in conditions that could be considered inhumane and degrading .
( See the December 2008 report , " Left to Survive : Systematic Failure to Protect Unaccompanied Migrant Children in Greece . " )
In yet another recent incident , on July 12 , police destroyed a makeshift migrant camp in Patras , on the Peloponnese peninsula .
In the days before the camp was destroyed , the police reportedly arrested large numbers of migrants there , and according to credible sources , transferred an unknown number to the northern part of the country .
On July 17 , Human Rights Watch met with several Afghans in Patras , including 12 unaccompanied migrant children now homeless as a result of this operation , who were in hiding in abysmal conditions out of fear of being arrested .
A 24 - year - old man told Human Rights Watch : " We 're living like animals in the jungle ... we can't take a shower and we do n't have proper food ... before I lived in the camp , but all of my things and clothes were burned .
Now I have a shirt and a pair of pants , nothing else . "
A 14 - year - old Afghan boy who arrived in Greece one year earlier said : " The worst situation during the past year is now , in Patras - now that I 'm living in this forest ....
There 's not enough food and we only eat bread with water . "
Human Rights
Watch also observed on July 17 how more than 1,000 migrants lined up all night , largely in vain , trying to file asylum applications at Athens ' main police station .
Greece recognizes as few as 0.05 percent of asylum seekers as refugees at their first interview and passed a law at the end of June that abolishes a meaningful appeals procedure , making it virtually impossible for anyone to obtain refugee status .
It also extended the maximum length of administrative detention for migrants to 12 months - and under certain circumstances , up to 18 months - from previously 90 days .
" It appears Greece is doing everything it can to close the door on persons who seek protection in Europe , no matter how vulnerable they are , " said Frelick .
" The European Union must hold Greece accountable for acts contrary to international and European human rights and refugee law , and it needs to act fast , as the lives of many are at risk . "
Despite all Labour 's travails , there have always been doubts about the strength of the Conservatives ' electoral prospects .
It has never been clear that the party had " sealed the deal " with the electorate .
For a start , the party has rarely secured much more than 40 per cent in recent months .
That was hardly the performance of a party that had the enthusiastic support of a large section of the electorate .
Meanwhile , when , as they do each month , ComRes have asked people whether they think of themselves as a Conservative , Labour or Liberal Democrat , those declaring themselves Conservative have typically been no more numerous than Labour .
This suggested the Tory lead was built on soft , potentially temporary support rather than loyal support that would necessarily be sustained all the way through to next May .

Now those doubts have been underlined .
There is still no sign of a Labour recovery ; Gordon Brown 's Government remains deeply unpopular .
Nevertheless ,
Tory support has fallen by three points .
As a result , at 10 points , the party 's lead is now no longer sufficient for Mr Cameron to be sure he would secure an overall majority .
Individual polls can , of course , sometimes be misleading .
But this is no isolated , unusual result .
It confirms a trend of slipping Conservative support that was apparent in many polls throughout last month .
Mr Cameron really does have reason to worry .
He does , after all , face plenty of competition in the scramble for the votes of the disaffected and disappointed .
The classic party of protest , the Liberal Democrats , have been polling more strongly , at around 20 per cent , for some months now .
Meanwhile smaller parties continue to register unprecedented levels of support .
Mr Cameron must wonder in particular how many of the 6 per cent of voters who say they would vote for Ukip might otherwise have been Conservative supporters .
He must be hoping the new Ukip leader , Lord Pearson , will prove a less effective than his predecessor , Nigel Farage .
Still , Labour would be unwise to derive too much comfort from this poll .
It still suggests Mr Cameron will lead the next government , albeit perhaps from a more precarious position than he would like .
And if Lord Ashcroft 's efforts in marginal seats pay off , today 's 10 - point lead might still be enough for a Tory majority .
Even so , evidently the outcome next May is far from being a foregone conclusion .

WASHINGTON — The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the earliest image yet of the universe -- just 600 million years after the Big Bang , when the universe was just a toddler .
Scientists released the photo Tuesday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
It 's the most complete picture of the early universe so far , showing galaxies with stars that are already hundreds of millions of years old , along with the unmistakable primordial signs of the first cluster of stars .
These young galaxies have n't yet formed their familiar spiral or elliptical shapes and are much smaller and quite blue in color .
That 's mostly because at this stage , they do n't contain many heavy metals , said Garth Illingworth , a University of California , Santa Cruz , astronomy professor who was among those releasing the photo .
" We 're seeing very small galaxies that are seeds of the great galaxies today , " Illingworth said in a news conference .
Until NASA 's
Hubble telescope was repaired and upgraded last year , the farthest back in time that astronomers could see was about 900 million years after the Big Bang , Illingworth said .
Hubble has been key in helping determine the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years , ending a long scientific debate about a decade ago .
As far back as Hubble can see , it still does n't see the first galaxies .
For that , NASA will have to rely on a new observatory , the $ 4.5 billion James Webb telescope , which is set to launch in about four years .
" We are on the way to the beginning , " said astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson of the American Museum of Natural History .
" Every step closer to the beginning tells you something you did not know before . "
The new Hubble picture captures those distant simpler galaxies juxtaposed amid closer , newer and more evolved ones .
The result is a cosmic family photo that portrays galaxies at different ages and stages of development over the course of more than 13 billion years .
Tyson , who was not involved in the Hubble image research , said most people only like their own baby pictures , but Hubble 's photo is different : " These are the baby pictures for us all , hence the widespread interest . "

A protester who presented himself as an Iraqi journalist in exile has hurled a shoe at the colleague who a year ago found fame by throwing his own footwear at then - US president George W Bush .
Television reporter Muntazer al - Zaidi was in Paris to promote his campaign for the " victims of the US occupation in Iraq " when a fellow Iraqi critic turned the tables on him , shouting : " Here 's another shoe for you . "
The thickset man with an Iraqi accent made a brief speech in Arabic during the question - and - answer session , defending US policy and accusing Mr Zaidi of " working for dictatorship in Iraq " , before throwing his shoe .
The shoe was thrown hard at Mr Zaidi 's head , but he managed to dodge it and it bounced harmlessly off a curtain erected behind the speakers by the event 's hosts , the Foreign Press Welcome Centre in Paris .
Mr Zaidi's brother grappled with and slapped the man , whom witnesses later described as an asylum - seeker they know only as Khayat , before venue staff and bystanders separated them and the aggressor was hustled away .
" When I used this method , it was against the occupation .
I did not use it against a compatriot , " Mr Zaidi said .
" I always knew the occupier and his lackeys would stop at nothing to get to me . "
Following the commotion , the news conference continued with Mr Zaidi taking questions about his famous assault on Mr Bush on December 14 last year , which was shown around the world and made him a hero in the Arab world .
Mr Zaidi , a journalist for Iraq 's Al - Baghdadia television , threw his shoes at Mr Bush during the US leader 's final visit to Iraq , protesting the six - year - old occupation with a cry of : " This is the farewell kiss , you dog . "
The 30 - year - old member of Iraq 's Shiite majority was jailed for nine months and was flown out of Iraq by his employers shortly after he was freed .
Asked about the huge sums and even offers of marriage made by admirers during his jail term , Mr Zaidi said he had asked his family to refuse all gifts " until I find a way that they can be passed on to the people of Iraq " .

Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged the United States to back talks between his government and Mullah Omar , the leader of the Taliban .
Former Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakkil says that if a negotiated peace could be reached between the Karzai government and the Taliban , the latter would abandon their vague alliance with al - Qaeda ( via USG Open Source Center , “ Former Taleban minister describes Obama ’s new Afghan strategy contradictory , ” Afghan Islamic Press , Sunday , December 6 , 2009 ) :
“ On the one hand , the foreigners claim about efforts for ensuring peace in Afghanistan , but they deploy more troops to the country on the other .
These two issues are contradictory and will not have any other results but extension of war and fighting .
. .
The AIP asked Motawakkil that the US and other foreigners have problems with Al - Qa’idah , therefore , is it possible for the Taleban to separate themselves from Al - Qa’idah ?
He answered :
The relation between the Taleban and Al - Qa’idah was similar to the relation between a host and a guest in the past .
Now they are like two war partners .
When an easy way to solving the problem is found , no one will go after the difficult solution ; therefore , peace will be ensured .
This will also end their war partnership .
There will be no need for the Taleban to stand in the same row with the Al - Qa’idah .
Motawakkil explicitly said :
No foreigner has the right to take part in determining the Afghans ’ destiny , because it is only the Afghans ’ right to decide about Afghanistan ’s system and future .
Motawakkil further said :
At the moment , distrust is a big problem between the current government and the Taleban and as long as the two sides do not trust each other , there will be no development in peace talks .
At a presser this afternoon , Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked about one of Obama ’s campaign pledges and whether CSPAN cameras would be allowed to film the House - Senate negotiations on health care reform :
“ There are a number of things he was for on the campaign trail , ” she pointedly noted .
Ultra -orthodox rabbis in Israel are trying to crack down on growing use of the internet among their followers , saying that it is filled with " abomination " and is leading believers astray .
But despite their efforts , the number of ultra-orthodox Israelis online is growing rapidly , while ultra-orthodox websites are proliferating .
In recent days , wall posters have sprung up in the ultra- orthodox Mea Shearim area of Jerusalem signed by the " Committee for the Purity of the Neighborhood " .
The posters voice alarm at growing use of the internet by rabbinical seminary students who live outside the school 's supervision in rented flats .
There have also been fire and brimstone - type broadsides against the internet during sermons by prominent rabbis in recent weeks .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" To our dismay , computers with all sorts of abominations have been found in the unsupervised flats , may God protect us , " say the posters .
The posters give a phone number to report seminary students who abuse computers .
Secular Israelis pride themselves on their country being at the cutting edge of internet technology .
But the ultra - orthodox have always striven to be a community apart , preserving their ancient lifestyle and insular neighbourhoods guided by strict Jewish law as interpreted by their rabbis .
With Israel 's establishment in 1948 , the ultra- orthodox , fearing that the army would secularise their youngsters , were able to secure deferments for their youth from the mandatory service performed by other Israelis .
The deferments turned into de facto exemptions .
But now the web is seen as a major new threat that could prompt youth to assimilate into larger Israeli society .
" We consider it to be very dangerous , " says Yitzhak Goldknopf , an ultra- orthodox rabbi and educator in Jerusalem who serves on a committee to ensure the Sabbath is observed .
" It is something that is liable to cast down a lot of casualties . "
The internet is seen foremost as violating modesty laws : the ultra - orthodox believe it is forbidden to publish even the faces of women .
The web , according to rabbis , is also rife with " evil speech " and " idle gossip " .
" This epidemic must be stopped , " Yisrael Hager , a leading rabbi , said in a recent address to followers .
One ultra-orthodox group , the Vishnitz Hasidic movement , has told its followers that if they install an internet connection , which it terms an " instrument of impurity " in their homes , their children will be excluded from the movement 's educational system .
Some are profiting from the growing concern of the rabbis about internet use .
In September , the Israeli firm Landau Computers began marketing computers whose Wi-Fi is hermetically sealed .
The company invited its customers from the preceding year to bring back their computers and have them sealed free of charge .
Yet it appears that the warnings and injunctions of the rabbis are increasingly being ignored .
According to Bezeq , the leading Israeli phone company , one - quarter of ultra-orthodox households have a Bezeq internet connection .
" Internet use is growing all the time , " says Dov Povarsky , editor - in - chief of the popular Bechadrei Charedim ( " In the rooms of the ultra- orthodox " ) website .
He says this is due in part to the advent of filters keeping out unwanted sites , " which enable people to allow themselves to surf . "
The rabbis " are right that the internet is an instrument that can go in unwanted directions , " says Povarsky , " but it is an instrument that can not be ignored .
I do n't think they are really trying to stop it outright . "

Identity Thesis for Language and Music :
All formal differences between language and music are a consequence of differences in their fundamental building blocks ( arbitrary pairings of sound and meaning in the case of language ; pitch - classes and pitch - class combinations in the case of music ) .
In all other respects , language and music are identical .
In particular , we argue , developing but also extending earlier proposals by Lerdahl and Jackendoff ( 1983 ) , that music , like language , contains a syntactic component in which headed structures are built by iterated , recursive , binary Merge .
This is the component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Prolongational Reduction , which represents hierarchical patterns of tension and relaxation in tonal harmony .
We further argue that the distinct component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Time Span Reduction is a musical prosodic component ( a point anticipated by Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves ) -- whose interface with the syntactic component is strikingly similar to the comparable interface between syntactic and prosodic structure in language .
Though our discussion takes Lerdahl and Jackendoff 's work as a starting point and touchstone throughout , our proposals also constitute a significant realignment of their model -- necessary in order to reveal similarities between musical and linguistic structure that were not evident in their presentation .
This realignment also reflects a distinction in goals between our proposal and theirs .
Their work took as its starting point the question " Given a piece of music in a particular musical idiom I , what laws govern the class of analyses that a listener assigns to it in I ? "
Our proposals arise from a related but distinct question , more typical of generative linguistic work : " What general laws define the class of possible pieces in I ? "
That is , what is the grammar of I ?
Our realignment of Lerdahl and Jackendoff 's proposals in light of the Identity Thesis allows us to ask questions not taken up in their work .
For example , does Internal Merge ( i.e. syntactic movement ) apply in the construction of musical syntactic structure , in addition to External Merge ?
We argue that the phenomenon of cadence is an instance of exactly this : head - movement from the penultimate constituent of a musical passage ( the dominant ) to the final tonic chord .
Finally , we argue that the output of musical syntax feeds a Tonal - Harmonic Component whose formal relation to the music syntax strongly resembles the relation between linguistic syntax and the semantic system that interacts with it -- and is subject to a Principle of Full Interpretation with respect to that component .

LSD is a drug that produces fear in people who dont take it .
– Timothy Leary
It ’s now almost half a century since that day in September 1961 when a mysterious fellow named Michael Hollingshead made an appointment to meet Professor Timothy Leary over lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club .
When they met in the foyer , Hollingshead was carrying with him a quart jar of sugar paste into which he had infused a gram of Sandoz LSD .
He had smeared this goo all over his own increasingly abstract consciousness and it still contained , by his own reckoning , 4,975 strong ( 200 mcg ) doses of LSD .
The mouth of that jar became perhaps the most significant of the fumaroles from which the  ’60s blew forth .
Everybody who continues to obsess on the hilariously terrifying cultural epoch known as the  ’60s — which is to say , most everybody from my “ gege - generation , ”  the post - War demographic bulge that achieved permanent adolescence during that era — has his or her own sense of when the  ’60s really began .
There are a lot of candidates : the blossoming pink cloud in the Zapruder film , Mario Savios first speech in Sproul Plaza , the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , the Beatles ’ first appearance on the the Ed Sullivan Show , the first Acid Test , the Human Be - In in Golden Gate Park , the release of the song  Good Vibrations ,  the day Jerry Garcia got kicked out of the army .
But as often as not , if you are a Boomer , the  ’60s began for surreal on the day you dropped acid .
And if that is when the shit hit your personal fan , you may owe a debt of ambiguous gratitude to the appealingly demonic young sociopath who conveyed the Stark Bolt of Chemical Revelation to the nice young gentlemen of the Harvard Psilocybin Project .
The essential tameness of the group that was to become so notorious is only one fascinating feature of discourse to follow between the Projects second and third most celebrated veterans : Ram Dass ( who as Richard Alpert , PhD , was Tom Sawyer to Tim Leary  ’s Huckleberry Finn ) and Dr. Ralph Metzner ( who began as an acolyte and wound up presiding over the remains ) .
In some of the photographs in this book , taken prior to the arrival of Mr. Hollingshead and his Magic Mayonnaise Jar , the learned investigators are actually whacked on psilocybin and yet , their narrow black ties are still neatly knotted , their horn - rimmed glasses are on straight , their earnest civilization is still visibly intact .
Consider that Dr. Alperts first impulse , upon regaining the ability to walk during his first psychedelic experience , was to head off through the snow to his parents  house and start shoveling their driveway .
Upon being discovered , his defiant response was to dance a jig .
This is truly a rebel without claws .
But a few days after that fateful lunch with Hollingshead , Timothy Leary dropped acid and everything changed .
The sober , scientific center of the Harvard Psilocybin Project lost its hold on the centripetal edge .
The past started to end and the future started to begin .
Their ties loosened and disappeared , along with belief in any such prosaic artifact as objective reality and the social conventions that accompanied it .
As Leary later wrote in High Priest ( p. 256-257 ) :
From the date of this session it was inevitable that we would leave Harvard , that we would leave American society and that we would spend the rest of our lives as mutants , faithfully following the instructions of our internal blueprints , and tenderly , gently disregarding the parochial social inanities .
Ram Dass had a somewhat more alarmed reaction :
When Tim first took LSD , he didn ’t speak for weeks .
I went around saying , ‘ We  ’ve lost Timothy , we ’ve lost Timothy . ’
I was warning everybody to not take that drug , because Tim was n’t talking and he was sort of dull
When I took it , I felt it went so far beyond the astral , beyond form , to pure energy .
It showed me that in previous psychedelic sessions , I had been screwing around in the astral plane .
LSD was no nonsense .
If you were n’t grounded somewhere , you  ’d go out on this drug .
They were both right , of course .
These were by no means unusual responses to the experience .
Thanks in very large part to the subsequent exertions of Drs. Leary , Alpert and Metzner , the experience was one shared over the following decade by tens of millions of Americans , the larger part of whom found it difficult ever after to take seriously the verities that few in Eisenhower  ’s America would have questioned .
Our paradigm got fucking well shifted .
At least mine certainly did .
And so , I would venture , did that of the United States of America , during the trip we took between 1961 and 1972 .
One can make a non-ludicrous case that the most important event in the cultural history of America since the 1860s was the introduction of LSD .
Before acid hit American culture , even the rebels believed , as Thoreau , Emerson and Whitman implicitly did , in something like God - given authority .
Authority , all agreed , derived from a system wherein God or Dad ( or , more often , both ) was on top and you were on the bottom .
And it was no joke .
Whatever else one might think of authority , it was not funny .
But after one had rewired ones self with LSD , authority — with its preening pomp , its affection for ridiculous rituals of office , its fulsome grandiloquence , and eventually , and sublimely , its tarantella around Mutually Assured Destruction — became hilarious to us and there wasnt much we could do about it .
No matter how huge and fearsome the puppets , once ones perceptions were wiped clean enough by the psychedelic solvent to behold their strings and the mechanical jerkiness of their behavior , it was hard to suppress the giggles .
Though our hilarity has since been leavened with tragedy , loss , and a more appropriate sense of our own foolishness , were laughing still .
Birth of A Psychedelic Culture is a saga of holy heroism .
The people in it were like the Lewis and Clark of the Mind .
But it is also a cautionary tale and contained within it is a lot of the real reason that America had such a visceral immune reaction to our sudden , terrifying and transforming  Otherness  in the middle of its consciousness .
Before delightedly steering the train off its rails , we were given a glimpse of grace and infinity .
But like all that is utterly true , the lightning was brief and the thunder rolls still .
In the beginning for me — and for many of us — there was the realization that religion was mostly the creation of God in man ’s own image .
Just as Tim Leary became furious at Catholicism shortly after hitting West Point , I bought a little Honda motorcycle and found that my dopily consoling Mormonism couldnt seem to ride along .
Like the maddeningly glib Dick Alpert — and believe me , he was a man of many words in those days — I left monotheism for sex and velocity .
But there had been , even in a book as weird as the one the Angel Moroni purportedly gave Joseph Smith ( Mark Twain called it  chloroform in print ) , a spark of something .
It was not religion , but you could almost see it from there .
I sped around with a longing for the Spirit that seemed inaccessible until sometime in 1964 when I read about the  Good Friday Experiment  in which , on Good Friday of 1962 , Walter Pahnke , Tim Leary and the two battle - scarred saints of the Unnamable whose reminiscences you can read in the book ( Ram Dass and Ralph Metzner ) , had given psilocybin to some divinity students in Boston Universitys Marsh chapel and — mirabile dictu ! — they fucking saw God or something like It .
And all because somebody gave them a pill .
Like most people raised by hick kids in the mountains , I was a mystic without ever having heard the word .
If I could have a direct experience of The Thing Itself , without all that regulatory obligation wrapped around it , I would become whole again .
After that , I read everything I could find about mystico- mimetic chemicals : Gordon Wassons 1957 article for Life magazine about magic mushrooms , Aldous Huxleys Doors of Perception , Bill Burroughss Yage Letters , etc .
I wanted a piece of that communion wafer and so did a lot of other kids raised around the dreary wasteland of American piety .
In the fall of 1965 , I entered Wesleyan University where both the man who was to become Ram Dass , as well as the man who sheltered and then spurned the Harvard Psilocybin Project , Dave McClelland , had taught shortly before .
I knew about Leary , Alpert and Metzner and had my own copy of The Psychedelic Experience .
But I thought they were still at Harvard .
I was going to go find them .
Before I could get around to that pilgrimage , I found myself at a Vassar mixer one late night in late 1965 and met a strangely luminous Indian Brahmin fellow who stood apart .
He asked me if I could give him a ride to the religious retreat where he was staying not far from Poughkeepsie and I agreed .
So we wheeled around shiny narrow roads to Millbrook in a truly Biblical downpour and the next thing I knew I was looking at the headquarters of the Castalia Foundation .
He invited me in .
I didnt know who lived there .
Now , at that point , my heroes had not only been cast out of Harvard , but paradise as well .
Inside the house it was not such a pretty sight .
The social order had been whupped upside the head too many times already , but that didnt bother me .
I had Forrest Gumped my way into the Temple of Delphi .
Not long after that , I was fully enrolled in the Eastern Orthodox Church of LSD .
A great deal more could be said about my initiation and the adventures that followed , but this is not about my long , strange trip .
Besides , there are better stories about the perception of mysterium tremendum and its effect upon mere mortals .
( Understanding the legend of Dr. Faustus might not be a bad start either ) .
I will say that there was a night in late 1966 , I think , when I rode a motorcycle from Millbrook to Middletown during an ice storm and was , because of the acid , convinced that I could no more leave the road than an electron could escape the centerline of a linear accelerator .
I will also say that by then I  ’d switched my academic focus from physics to phenomenology with a particular focus on Medieval Christian mystics like St. Theresa , St. John of the Cross , and Meister Eckhart .
I had a sign on my dorm room door displaying the following formula : [ picture of me ] + [ skeletal schematic representation of the LSD - 25 molecule ] = [ picture of the Buddha ] .
The acid was working .
What I did n’t know then was that my best friend from prep school , a kid named Bob Weir , who had been strangely incommunicado since shortly after he worked on my family ’s ranch , had been right next to another great fumarole of pharmaceutical whacketydoodah , the Acid Tests .
His little band , the Grateful Dead , had been part of an experiment in mass hallucination which seemed , from our East Coast view , to make Millbrook look like a Trappist monastery .
It sounded to me like what these West Coast people were doing was a particularly blasphemous form of drug abuse , the spiritual equivalent of breaking into Chartres Cathedral and getting drunk on the communion wine .
But , while we were looking down our long patrician noses at these barbaric shenanigans , they were apparently producing transformations similar to our own .
Five years later , Hunter S. Thompson recalled 1965 and 1966 in San Francisco like this ( Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , pg 68 ) :
There was madness in any direction , at any hour You could strike sparks anywhere .
There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right , that we were winning .
And that , I think , was the handle — that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil .
Not in any mean or military sense ; we did n’t need that .
Our energy would simply prevail .
Yes .
That seemed right .
Even as we were dismantling the monotheistic model of God as Abusive Father , we were assembling another one — in our own image of course — more personally available through mysticism and generally more immanent than the Previous Dude , but still inclined to lend special sanction to the actions of a particular socio-political cohort which , happily , turned out to be ours .
God , or Something Like It , was on our side this time .
The fact that God might turn up looking like a fat guy with an elephant head or as an aperture into pure , spirit - scalding Light , or even as Michael Hollingshead on a bad day , didnt matter to us .
The Apocalypse was nigh .
The Age of Aquarius had dawned , and God was no longer in his Heaven but getting down , right there inside of us and our holy pills .
By spring of 1967 , Leary , Alpert , and Metzner had already started to feel the arrogance of this premise .
All three had gone to India and two had come limping back .
Personally , I was still accelerating into the radiant fog , and so was a large percentage of my swollen generational demographic .
The Gathering of the Tribes had taken place in Golden Gate Park in January of that year .
Leary and Allen Ginsberg had turned up there along with the international press , and the coastal schism in the Church of Acid had been officially healed .
Somewhere in there , Time magazine ran a cover story on  The Hippies . 
A more attentive cultural observer than I would have known by that sign that wed reached our high - water mark .
Whatever my earlier misgivings about the Acid Tests , I had learned by then that my dear Weir had been part of this heresy .
I was tickled to hear that the Grateful Dead were going to play their first New York gig at a Bleecker Street disco called the Cafe Au GoGo in June .
Early June 1967 was a mighty time , the reverberations of which are now as ubiquitous in American cultural history as is the Big Bang in the rest of the universe .
As I remember it , the Dead played on June 6th .
The Six Day war had broken out the day before .
Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band had been released five days before , as had the Grateful Deads eponymous first record .
I had helped make arrangements to take the Dead up to Millbrook the day after .
After the show , which was kind of forgettable , Weir and I wandered over to Washington Square Arch and were trying to debrief one another .
It was steady work .
It wasnt obvious that he had entirely passed the Acid Test .
His eyes were all pupil , it seemed .
He had the longest hair Id ever seen on a human with a penis .
And he ’d become a fellow of very few words .
While we were struggling with the acquisition of a common language , a pale green Ford Falcon station wagon leapt the curb fifteen feet away and , like evil clowns emerging in platoon strength from a tiny circus car , some ten Long Island toughs poured out of it and headed toward us .
You could see with one eye that they weren’t from our side of a culture war that had already gotten ugly in America .
Like T cells in jackboots , they took us for antigens and meant us harm .
As they were circling , Weir looked up and said mildly ,  ” You know , I sense violence in you guys , and whenever I feel it in myself , there ’s a song I like to sing . ” 
( And I m thinking , ??! )
All of a sudden he ’s chanting  Hare Krishna ,  and what with my wondering ears should I hear but the toughs singing along .
For about fifteen seconds .
And then they beat the crap out of us .
So , as I drove my 550 horsepower Chevy Super Sport up the Taconic to Millbrook the next day , both Bobby and I looked like Wiley Coyote after a bad run-in with an Acme product .
Also on board was a girl named Bos ( over whom I was totally goofy at the time ) , Phil Lesh , and Frank Zappa ’s star chick singer , a hot number who called herself Uncle Meat .
We listened to war news from the Holy Land on the radio and we had on board a copy of Sgt.
Pepper ’s , which Id bought on the way out of town and which none of us had heard yet .
I was trying to explain to my inamorata Bos , both of whose parents were Jewish psychiatrists , why I felt so moved by St. John of the Cross ’s Dark Night of the Soul .
It was a moment in the  ’60s , that day was .
When we got to the Hitchcock Mansion , it was pretty clear that whatever else the charming Dr. Leary was trying to tell the world , housekeeping tips were not being integrated into it .
Few of the regulars remained .
Ralph , Tim , and even Michael Hollingshead had reached a point the year before when they ’d found Dr. Alperts manias so alarming that theyd sent him packing off to India .
( Where he was , by this time , already in a dhoti and well on his way to becoming Baba Ram Dass .
He dropped the Baba as soon as the wisdom actually kicked in . )
That night we all gathered in the second floor library and , with ecclesiastical ceremony , we put on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Nobody said a word while the record played .
Many of us couldn ’t have if we ’d wanted to .
I was so high I could taste the music and found the purple notes a little hard to chew .
When the London Philharmonic ’s last cacophonous notes trailed out of  ’A Day in the Life , ’ there was a portentous silence and Timmy intoned solemnly , “ My work is complete .  ”
Little did he know how right and how wrong he was .
I say this because while he and the rest of us crazy angels had truly delivered some form of apocalypse , it could not actually take effect in a couple of years or even a couple of generations .
No revelation so culturally shattering was going to be universally accepted overnight .
No generation that called itself now was going to find lengthy evolution palatable , but that was what was on our plate nonetheless .
Yes , the Beatles had dropped acid and the whole world had noticed , but not everyone was pleased .
The Empire was about to strike back .
Moreover , we had , with our giddy carnival frenzies and darker madnesses soon to come , sown the seeds of our own disaster .
There was a moment in the fall of 1967 that I myself became convinced , with passionate intensity , that we were that rough beast 
Yeats had described .
We were leading society into such a quagmire of narcissistic , self - reaffirming subjectivism that if we continued to  Storm Heaven ,  as Jay Stevens put it , little of what might be a reasonable basis for polity or even what passes for civilization would survive our self - indulgence .
I went unhinged .
I became psychotic and grandiose and decided to become what would have been America ’s first suicide bomber .
I was prepared to sound a warning with my own spattered flesh and that of innocent others .
I would be the admonition on the front page of every paper that would slow the juggernaut of hideous Truth .
I had the means and the moment .
Fortunately , praise Providence , I was found out and stopped forty - five minutes short of my own vile apocalypse .
I lived on Thorazine for a while after that .
But my intended mission attracted other willing soldiers .
In my stead , we got Charlie Manson and Altamont .
We got the behavioral sink of the long autumn that followed the Summer of Love .
We got the Chicago Democratic Convention , the Weather Underground , the Symbionese Liberation Front , the communes that turned into rural slums overnight .
What we got was the Bill .
Hunter S. Thompson put it very harshly but with some accuracy a few years later in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( pgs 178-179 ) :
All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit .
But their loss and failure is ours , too .
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life - style that he helped to create a generation of permanent cripples , failed seekers , who never understood the essential old - mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture : the desperate assumption that somebody or at least some force — is tending the light at the end of the tunnel .
Who can blame the Rotarians of America for being alarmed ?
We became terrifying enough to scare ourselves .
The Babbitry came down with a not ill - considered immune response that , however draconian its methods , was nevertheless their Apollonian duty just as appropriately as the creation of Dionysian chaos had seemed to be ours .
But perhaps even more unsettling to the Powers That Had Been was the fact that , as I mentioned earlier , in addition to calling into question their version of God - given authority , we now found them amusing .
Since there is nothing authority hates worse than being laughed at , the authorities resolved to make themselves even less funny .
The harder the acid heads laughed , the more bellicose , pig-headed , and , well authoritarian the Powers became .
And thus , instead of a quick abdication by the cultural forces that had been in charge of Western  Civilization  for two thousand years and a peaceful transfer of power to the laughing Aquarians , there commenced the forty year Mexican standoff that I call the War Between the Fifties and the Sixties .
Of course , this conflict had a lot of other names along the way , most of them delicious with the kind of dark irony it takes an acidhead to properly savor .
There was the Viet Nam War , the War on Poverty , The War on Terror , both Wars on Iraq , and throughout , interwoven into every inch of American life , there was the War on ( Some ) Drugs .
There was also , implicitly , the War on the Bill of Rights .
Whatever its other depraved social consequences — the millions jailed , the military dead and maimed , the deceit and denial at all levels of American society , particularly within the nuclear family — the War Between the Fifties and the Sixties endowed us with a golden age of irony .
If you did n’t have a sense of irony , you were missing most of the fun , and , um , ironically , just about the only Americans who did have one were the acid heads .
This created yet another badly hung loop as various iterations of  We had to destroy the village in order to save it concatenated through the culture and , once again , we were the only ones laughing .
And then , lest we forget , throughout much of this period , and scarcely mentioned by anybody , acid head or Republican
Whip , was the greatest surreality of all : the almost universal belief that somewhere and some time soon , someone would foul up and launch the nuclear storm that would glaze the planet with our elemental constituents .
And if you couldn ’t laugh at that , what could you laugh at ?
Now , it seems many of these horrors may be consigned to the history of a future that never happened .
While new horrors surely await us , very few still believe we ’re likely to go toe - to - toe with the Russkies  in nuclear combat as Slim Pickens put it in one of the most immortal lines of the 1960s .
Better still , the worst of the authoritarian prigs have so magnificently shot their wad during eight long years of Cheney / Bush that only those savagely beaten by their own fathers or the clergy support them now .
Aside from the coming kerfuffle over war crimes indictments and ongoing skirmishes along the Mason - Dixon Line , the War Between the Fifties and the Sixties may be finally drawing to an end .
Indeed , as I write these words , the President of the United States , in addition to being black and self - admittedly smart and well - educated , strikes me as a fellow who probably dropped acid at some point .
At the least , when asked if he inhaled ,  he replied ,  I thought that was the point . 
Now that the worst of it may be over , perhaps it may become possible for various members of Congress , federal judges , ranked military officers , prominent clergy , and captains of industry — aside from the peculiarly honest Steve Jobs — to do as most of these , had they been brave enough , ought to have done decades ago and say in public :
There was a moment , years ago , when I took LSD .
And , whatever the immediate consequences , it made me a different person than I would have been and different in ways I have been grateful for all this time .
That would be a mighty moment .
Those who still live are all now older and wiser than we were in those literally heady days , and we may finally be ready to tell such truths without setting off another round of conflict .
Ram Dass has come a long way along the path of the profound since I first met him as the maddeningly manipulative Dick Alpert .
Indeed , at one point some years ago , I was having dinner with him and confessed to a moral dilemma that I was having a hard time teasing apart .
I cant even remember what it was now , but he cut through it snickety - snack , like a sword through the Gordian Knot , with a few well chosenwords .
That s the problem with you , man ,  I said , and continued with a concession I would not have made even to Baba Ram Dass , who turned up first at Wesleyan when he returned from India , still pretty full of self - promoting nonsense ,  You re just a lot wiser than I am . 
His eyes narrowed .
 ” Dont you lay that wisdom shit on me , Barlow ,  ” he retorted , thereby defeating his own argument with its refutation .
But even before then , he had uttered a motto that has been far more important to carrying the essential message of the sixties than  ” Turn on .
Tune in .
Drop out  ” ( which was actually coined by Marshall McLuhan and given toTim Leary since it didn ’t fit McLuhan ’s rap ) .
Ram Dass said ,  ” Be here now .  ”
And here we all are .
Now .
Ready at last with the patience , forgiveness , contrition and self - amusement necessary to continue the work in earnest .
It is a good time to go back to the beginnings of the revolution still under way and take stock .
It is a good time to read this book .
Now .

Clinton , Merkel and me in a global war on sexism , by Harriet Harman
Pioneer : Harriet Harman has called on other high - profile female politicians to fight for equality
Harriet Harman has spoken of her ambitions to sit alongside Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel in a global crusade against sexism .
Labour 's deputy leader wants to establish a group of high - ranking women , including the U.S. Secretary of State and the German Chancellor , who would meet regularly to fight for equality .
Her announcement , in a speech to EU leaders , also appeared to be an attempt to burnish her credentials as a future Labour leader .
Miss Harman , the minister for women , said : ' There is , as yet , no international architecture which serves effectively to bring together women leaders who are working for progress along the same lines in each of our own countries .
We need to look at how this could be done . '
She made clear she sees herself as a pioneer to rank alongside Mrs Clinton and Mrs Merkel .
She said : ' In the UK we have a new Government Office for Equality - of which I am in charge .
Germany has its first woman Chancellor - Angela Merkel - and half the Spanish cabinet are women .
' The U.S. has a woman heading the State Department , Secretary Hillary Clinton , and Hilda Solis as Secretary for Labour .
For the first time , the House of Representatives has a woman speaker , Nancy Pelosi . '
Miss Harman said she would seek to enlist the 140 female ministers throughout the EU in a bid to push women 's issues .
She said : ' By doing this we can ensure the concerns of the 250 million women in the EU are taken into account when decisions are made . '
Girl power : Harman is keen to work closely with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( right ) to fight sexism
She also plans to fight to set up a new UN ' consolidated gender entity body to progress issues concerning women ' .
Tory spokesman Theresa May accused Miss Harman of putting her personal ambitions ahead of the interests of British working women .
She said : ' We want to ensure that issues affecting women are not forgotten but we all need to concentrate on the job in hand if we are to tackle Labour 's jobs crisis and mend our broken economy ' .
Here is an interesting story in the Denver Post by Bill Johnson : Credit - card squeeze stirs elderly couple 's anger
Lawrence Rickman ... is 81 now , seven years his wife 's senior .
They have had a Bank of America credit card for 20 years .
They never once in all that time ... missed a payment .
Rickman slides his December bill across the table , with instructions to read it .
...
Look at the interest rate , he says .
Sixteen - point - nine percent , it reads .
" I was paying 5.9 percent , which is what I have paid for years , " he says .
" I always paid them $ 500 a month without complaint .
Now , they want $ 1,074 this month .
I can't pay it .
I wo n't pay it . "
...
" When I got this month 's bill , " Lawrence Rickman recalls , " I got on the line and told them they were getting out of hand on this interest rate , that I wanted to negotiate . "
The conversation , he says , went something like this :
" Lower my rate , or I 'll file bankruptcy , " he told them .
" But sir , if you do , it will destroy your credit rating . "
" So what ?
I 'm almost 82 years old ... "
The interest rate increase is outrageous , but also notice that Mr. Rickman was apparently not paying off his credit card balance every month .
I suspect he has been running a fairly large balance compared to his income ( only Social Security at this time according to the article ) , and just making the minimum payment on his credit card .
Although the 5.9 % interest rate was somewhat reasonable , it is still far more than Rickman could earn on any conservative investment .
Credit cards are great if the holder pays off the balance every month - or if the holder infrequently needs to spread an unexpected bill over a few months .
But routinely running large credit card balances is hazardous to the holder 's financial health .
IMO there is something inherently wrong with a business that encourages customers to make bad financial decisions .
( I 'll get off my soapbox ... )
Joe Lieberman claims that he ' wish[es ] people would come out and debate me on the public option instead of questioning my motives ' when asked about the money he 's receiving from the insurance industry .
That 's news to Rachel Maddow Joe .
If you 're looking for someone to debate you about your motives , I hear she 's still looking for a response from your office .
SCHIEFFER : I ’m going to ask you this question because I want to give you a chance to respond to it .
Some of your critics say that the reason that you are so dead set against the public option is because there are so many insurance companies headquartered in your home state in Connecticut and they ’ve been some of your biggest supporters .
What have they given you this year , $ 400,000 ?
Something like that ?
Has that had anything to do with your position on the public option ?
LIEBERMAN : No .
I wish people would come out and debate me on the public option instead of questioning my motives .
If they look at the record , I have never hesitated to get tough on insurance companies when I thought they were wrong .
When I was attorney general of Connecticut , I filed an antitrust action against the Connecticut insurance companies .
A few years ago when there was a patient bill of rights in the Senate which the insurance companies opposed , I supported it .
Right now , I ’ve said that I will support the removal of the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have .
That ’s not the reason .
But I will say this .
This recommendation of a public option , a government health insurance company , takes our government down a road that we ’ve never gone down before .
In other words , we believe in a market economy .
It ’s what ’s created the great American middle class .
But it does n’t have a conscience .
When it behaves badly , we regulate it , companies .
We sue them .
I ’ve been angry at oil companies .
I never had the idea that the government should go into the oil business to make oil companies behave better .
I think this would be a terrible mistake .
In its recent look back on the first 10 years of the century , Time Magazine proclaimed the period to be " the decade from hell " .
The editors made their case based on what they saw as the signature events of the past 10 years , notably the ravages of terrorism , failed wars , and a global financial crisis .
Taken together , these factors produced an era that Time is convinced will be remembered as one of the low points in our history .
As the media hate to dwell on the negative , the commentary was rife with notes of optimism about pending recovery .
It could hardly be accidental that in the very next issue , Fed Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was named " Man of the Year " for his supposedly Herculean efforts to keep the economy afloat as we departed the Naughty Aughties .
Although Time takes pains to point out that the " Person of the Year " honor reflects impact rather than adulation , its profile of the chairman was triumphant .
A little over a week ago , the media began reporting that the g - spot - or , as it's less sexily known , the Gräfenberg spot - does not exist .
Our commenters immediately called bullshit , as did many experts .

The study , titled Genetic and Environmental Inﬂuences on self - reported G - Spots in
Women : A Twin Study , set out to determine whether or not identical twins were more likely to report having a g - spot than fraternal twins .
This , science blogger Scicurious , explains , could indicate there is a biological basis for the g- spot .
If the g - spot is a biological fact , then identical twins should either both have it or neither should , or so the logic goes .
While half the women questioned claimed they do have a g - spot , there was no correlation between twins .
The authors of the study took this to conclude that there was no genetic basis for the g- spot .
This quickly became the story Scientists prove the g - spot is a myth !
Call of the search !
and spawned a lot of unhappiness among women everywhere .

But there are problems , which is only natural , considering the fact that there are few topics more fraught with stereotypes and misinformation than female sexuality .
Scicurious breaks down several of the issues with the study into three points : the average age of participants ( 55 ) may have skewed the information , the study excluded homosexual and bisexual women , focusing instead on what is apparently most important about women 's sexuality ( the penis , duh ) and finally , the authors of the study never defined the g- spot .
They handed out surveys with questions like " do you have a g - spot ? " but they did not provide an accurate description of exactly what that means .
Bloggers for the Sundance Channel report that the women were asked if they had a " so called G spot , a small area the size of a 20 p coin on the front wall of your vagina that is sensitive to deep pressure ? "
( I 'd love to see a study asking men if they have a " so called dick ? " and other such leading questions ) .
This was , sadly , all the guidance they received .
To further complicate matters , Scicurious correctly points out that the idea of the g - spot has been inflated to epic proportions , until many people ( women and men ) no longer really know what it means ( if they ever did ) :
Any woman who 's looked at a Cosmo has seen the headlines , and see the crap they have to say about what a G - spot is .
Thus , unless you define what the G - spot is supposed to be , the results you 're going to get from a survey saying " do you have a G - spot " are going to be pretty variable .
Many women may not have even looked for it .
Some women may think it 's a magic button to orgasm , and figure if they do n't orgasm instantly , they do n't have one .
This probably is n't the case .
It may be a highly sensitive area , but probably does n't just magically cause an orgasm .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The phrase " magic button " also pops up in Rachel Kramer Brussel 's exploration of the area for the Daily Beast .
She spoke with several experts , including Violet Blue , author of The Smart Girl 's Guide to the G - Spot , about the whole g- spot brouhaha :
Blue cautions women to not believe the hype .
" Part of the problem is that when people started talking more openly about the G - spot , a lot of [ untrained ] entrepreneurs rushed in to ‘ sell ' the magic button of the G - spot , " she explains .
" People need to screen the source of their information .
Random , self - made ‘ sex experts ' trying to sell videos , books and sex toys might make the G - spot out to be the Holy Grail of orgasms , like this magic , mysterious button that once you find it and press it gives you unlimited mind - blowing orgasms . "
Cue
The G - SHOT , billed as " a simple , nonsurgical , physician - administered treatment that can temporarily augment the Gräfenberg spot ( G - Spot ) in sexually active women with normal sexual function . "
Because " human- engineered collagen " is clearly the path to a better sex life ... but just as , say , anal sex is n't for everyone neither is delving deep into the G - spot .
" With this thinking , any woman who can't find ‘ it ' with two hands and a flashlight must be broken , " says Blue .
" While all women have the tissue in varying forms , it 's going to feel really great for some women or really unpleasant for others .
Headlines that read ‘ G - Spot is a Myth ' fuel sexist notions around women 's orgasms being mysterious , shame women who enjoy G - spot stimulation , and set us back about 100 years . "
This does n't contradict the women who did n't report having a G - spot ; it 's possible they did n't know about the term or where it 's located , had never had it stimulated , did n't like having it touched , etc .

So , there you have it .
The existence of the g - spot has been neither affirmed or denied by this study .
And yet , reporters still seemed to jump on the it's a myth !
bandwagon with nary a thought to the sexism behind the statements .
Unfortunately , a study that could have helped demystify a part of the female anatomy has only served to thicken the mists that obscure the elusive area .
For now , we can turn back to Scicurious for a succinct , non-sexified description of the spot :
The G - spot , first described by Ernst Granfenberg in 1950 , is hypothesized ( not proven yet ) to be a group of sensitive nerves along the anterior ( that 's the front ) wall of the vagina .
Other groups have hypothesized that they sensitivity of the area is due to the presence of residual prostate tissue in some women ( the prostate in men surrounds the urethra , which in women is anterior to the vagina , hence the possible placement ) , and that stimulation of this area can lead , not only to orgasm , but also to female ejaculation .

I ’ve always stood behind Nintendo ’s over - milking of their franchises .
This is because they take each sequel seriously and change gameplay , plotlines , worlds and characters with every iteration .
They see every title as a chance for improvement and innovation that just happens to have a built in audience .
So I ’m more than a little perplexed as to why they took the Wii as an opportunity to revisit the gaming dark ages .
New Super Mario Wii is a 2.5D side scroller starring the world ’s only Italian plumbers to never touch a plunger or go to Italy .
The title “ New ” is a misnomer because I ’m sure in five years everyone who played it will have forgotten it and everyone who made it will start to feel silly because it ’s based on outdated gameplay mechanics .
A more appropriate name would have been “ Original Super Mario Brothers , ” or perhaps “ Super Nostalgia Brothers ” because that ’s really all it is .
I ’d have been more leery of asking someone who ’s never left his flying broomstick to design a good walkway , but to each his own .
Do n’t get me wrong ; when Nintendo sets out to stamp the name Mario on a game , they do it up right .
The control scheme is flawless , the difficulty curve is the best I ’ve seen in recent memory , the levels are crafted with loving attention to detail and it ’s chalked full of enough secret passages , level skips and hidden levels to keep the pros and speed - runners busy .
My criticism for this game ca n’t be expressed mechanically or objectively .
But if you ’re playing it for nostalgia , understand that it really is n’t a better game than Super Mario World for the SNES .
The only reasons children will be more receptive to this game than the golden oldies are the cheery music and the fat little guy with a mushroom addiction who talks like a G - rated Borat .
The game kicks off with the kidnapping of the Princess at her own birthday party , no surprise there .
Bowser Jr. and his brothers from Super Mario World are the antagonists this time around .
Also added to the cast of baddies are the genetic clones of the original Koopa kids only painted grey and black because they ’ve all been watching Twilight and started dressing from Hot Topic .
Naturally , most of the Mushroom Kingdom is under the control of Bowser ’s Minions because the Shrooms ca n’t be bothered to create a military force to hold the map after any of Mario ’s repeated genocides .
And Bowser has yet to fire his lead architect , Magikoopa , who has designed all the lands castles to be entirely handicap inaccessible .
By handicap I of course mean anyone who ca n’t jump six times his own height , including the entirety of Bowser ’s junior staff .
I ’d have been more leery asking someone whose never left his flying broomstick to design a good walkway , but to each his own .
NSMB starts off in ordinary grasslands and quickly moves to icy terrains , deserts , mountains , archipelagos and an active volcano as Mario follows Bowser Jr. ’s airship from castle to castle .
Each world has its own unique terrain challenges and set of monsters to deal with , while all of them build upon existing monsters and challenges to create a steady and entertaining difficulty curve .
Every new hazard is introduced in a low stress environment then made more difficult later by the addition of cliffs or moving platforms to require precise movements .
There are safe houses run by the Mushroom people where you can obtain power - ups , which can be used between levels , or extra lives .
However , every level starts with predictable power up boxes and there ’s no limit on continues , so every one of these safe houses can be skipped and you wont find the game any more difficult or time consuming .
Now if one of them had given me an item that let me skip the level selection screen every time I died , the idea may have had merit .
The items in the game have seen some changes .
The flight cap this time is a helicopter helmet which zooms into the air with a shake of the controller .
The fireflower also has a a counterpart ice flower which freezes enemies to be thrown and shattered or used as platforms .
The wildcard is the penguin suit which allows ice flower abilities but also the ability to slide on your belly and destroy things in front of you .
Fun though flightless waterfowl are , there is no use for this past the second world which feels like a missed opportunity .
The game ’s biggest selling feature over its predecessors is the multiplayer functions .
This experience can best be described as the Mario brothers spending six hours trying to occupy the same space in the least homoerotic way possible .
Nintendo has taken extreme measures to ensure that a less experienced player does n’t drag a better one down , as is the case with little siblings .
A player can always hit a button to put themselves in a bubble and drift around in safety until the other player pops them .
This way any given player can skip challenges they find too difficult provided one player can accomplish the task .
Lives are not shared , though again , since continues are infinite I ’m not sure why they bother keeping track other than to get players to endanger themselves in the pursuit of coins .
You can assist each other in jumping by bouncing off of each other ’s heads , but since the game must be beatable single player , there is no point at which this maneuver is necessary and several points at which it is a liability .
At no point does having a second , third or fourth player actually help you , it ’s just an excuse to get two people playing the same game in the same room .
The experience would be greatly improved were the player ’s also playing separate games on separate screens .
Of course what ’s a Mario game without a climax involving a fight with a two story tall , fire - breathing dragon turtle thing .
And what ’s a boss fight without that serious design flaw built into all of Bowser ’s personal castles where a brightly colored , clearly labeled button collapses the only platform big enough to hold the monster .
It ’s not like this made any sort of sense the first time they did it , the only reason it ’s still here is because it was there the first time around and Nintendo knows full well they ’re only selling this game on nostalgia .
So if you were planning to buy a game to please the kiddies this holiday season , this is no disappointment to be sure , though the siblings may have some arguments about who knocked who into the lava .
But if you ’re a twenty something gamer who got started on an SNES , like me , and you ’re looking for a nostalgic good time , go pick up Mario All - Star or Super Mario World on Game Boy Advance .

Last night BJ Penn handed Diego Sanchez the most definitive loss of his career in a five round clinic at UFC 107 .
Sanchez was dropped to the canvas early in the first round as the two fighters made good on their promise to meet in the center of the cage .
Though he recovered , Sanchez never got a foothold in the fight , and in the fifth , a rare head kick from Penn opened up a large cut on his forehead that forced the referee to call an end to the bout .
Though bloodied , bruised and disappointed , Sanchez was gracious in defeat in a brief post - fight interview with Joe Rogan .
“ It just happens .
B.J. is a great champion , ” he said .
“ I did my best .
He came out on top , but I ’ll be back . ”
A day later , after having time to reflect further in the events of the night , Sanchez gave his thoughts on the fight to fans via his twitter account .
“ Long night yesterdy Bj really gave it to me .
It was not my night I just could n’t find him .
I guess you have to take some to give some .
Thanks to all my fans for the support . ”
On Tuesday Sanchez posted again , and showed that the defeat has n’t had a negative effect on his attitude .
“ I ’m good : ) in High spirits I have work to do ounce my face heals I will be training asap with bad intentions for the next person I fight on the road back to Penn . ”
A Day later he was on twitter again , this time with a more aggressive take on his feelings over the fight , and his future .
“ To be honest I ’m really f’nnnn pist off I hate losing and am more hungry for victory than ever …
All I can think about is working my way back to earn another shot at Bj Penn .
My dream has changed it is no longer just become ufc champion it is to fight Bj Penn again .
I will put my heart and soul into this !!!
Im on a mission now .
All you doubters shut up and watch me !
If there is any doubt about just how hard Penn was to hit on the night , the Fightmetric stats reveal that in the five rounds Sanchez landed just 8 strikes , while his opponent landed 150 .
Sanchez has given no specific details of his injuries , though at the post - fight press conference Dana White stated , “ In 10 years of being in this business , I do n’t know if I ’ve ever seen anybody more busted up than Diego is right now . ”
Despite concerns that the winner of TUF season one had broken his nose , his manager later confirmed to sherdog.com that he suffered no “ major damage ” and was released from hospital after receiving multiple stitches to his lower lip , forehead and eyelid .
After such a convincing defeat Sanchez , now 21 - 3 in his mixed martial arts career , will have to learn from his experience fighting against one of the sports greats , and hope to come back stronger in the future .
There are still fights available for him at lightweight , including a rematch with fellow TUF season one competitor Kenny Florian which he has been calling for since his move to the lighter weight class . ,
He has also previously stated that he eventually plans to move back up to the welterweight division .

Total bummer but we were asked to take this post down by the copyright holders .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - A Canadian man who kept exotic cats behind his farmhouse was mauled to death by his 650 - pound pet tiger , police said on Monday .
Norman Buwalda , a 66 - year - old collector of wild animals , was found dead in the tiger ’s pen on Sunday afternoon at the property in western Ontario ,
“ The owner of some exotic animals went out to feed the tiger which was in a cage or large pen and the animal attacked him and killed him , ” said Troy Carlson , a constable for the Ontario Provincial Police who attended to the incident .
He said Buwalda ’s family and officials of nearby Southwold township would decide what to do with the tiger .
The cat was found pacing inside the compound in which it was kept when police arrived on the scene .
The tiger was described as a large , fully grown male , although Carlson could not identify the subspecies .
“ There were no witnesses so we do n’t know what prompted the attack , but a short time later a family member found ( Buwalda ) and contacted police , ” he said .
Carlson said that six years ago a Siberian tiger attacked a 10 - year - old boy on the Buwalda property .
In fact , according to The Huffington Post , nearly every staff member of Representant Parker Griffith 's office quit Monday morning in response to his decision to switch parties .
His chief of staff Sharon Wheeler resigned , along with his entire legislative and communications team , many of whom have worked for Griffith since before he arrived in Washington .
In a statement , Sharon Wheeler explains why she can no longer work for Parker Griffith :
(...)
Alabama 's Fifth District has deserved and has benefited from great Democratic conservative leadership since Reconstruction .
And until now they had it .
(...)
I appreciate Congressman Griffith 's being a very dedicated congressman .
But we believe he made a mistake -- a well - intentioned but misguided mistake that is not in the interest of the great people of North Alabama who elected him a year ago as a Democrat .
As his staff , we wish him only the best , and we all remain committed to the citizens of the Tennessee Valley .
But we cannot , in good conscience , continue working for him .
It is with deep sadness that we leave our work for the Fifth District .
But because we are unwavering in our own principles , we have no choice but to move on .
We do not know what the future holds , but we are taking a leap of faith with the belief we will soon find ourselves in the employment of principled public officials .
Joining Wheeler were Legislative Director Megan Swearingen , Legislative Assistants Brian Greer and Will Crain , Press Secretary Sean Magers , Legislative Correspondents Arinze Ifekauche and Chase Chesser , Staff Assistant Mary Lou Hughston , Congressional Fellows Dr. Anjali Shah Kastorf and Leslee Oden and intern Andrew Menefee .
They waited until the winter break was over so they could return to Washington to resign .
According to POLITICO 's Josh Kraushaar , Griffith 's campaign consulting team dropped him when he announced his party switch :
One early consequence of Rep. Parker Griffith ’s party switch :
He ’s losing nearly his entire political consulting team , according to a senior Democratic operative , and will have to retool his operation with a new lineup of GOP consultants .
Pollster Fred Yang ( Garin - Hart - Yang ) , media consultant Jim Duffy ( of Murphy Putnam Media ) and fundraiser Lindsay Angerholzer ( Sutters Mill ) are all leaving the Griffith campaign .
Another general consultant based in Alabama , Joey Cici , will remain with Griffith ’s political operation .
Can we say karma ?
Is n't
It odd when even your own staff members do n't follow you til the end ?
Or his former staff has more scruples than Parker Griffith himself .
Anyway , I bet GOP will find him a brand new Teabaggers team .
UPDATE
Thanks to Scarce , I can post this :
Monday , January 4 , 2010 Representative Parker Griffith 's Staff Resigns ~ Say Independent - Minded Democrats Succeed for North Alabama~ WASHINGTON , D. C. - Nearly every staff member of Representative Parker Griffith 's office tendered their resignation this morning in response to his recent decision to change party membership .
This included the Chief of Staff , along with the entire legislative and communications team .
In departing Griffith 's office , the staff characterized his party - switch as a " mistake " and emphasized that this district has " benefited " from conservative Democratic leadership .
Many of the staff members had worked for Griffith since before he arrived in Washington including several who worked on his campaign for Congress in 2008 .
" Alabama 's Fifth District has deserved and has benefited from great Democratic conservative leadership since Reconstruction .
And until now they had it , " Chief of Staff Sharon Wheeler said .
" But Parker Griffith has abandoned the legacy of conservative leadership provided by Bud Cramer , Ronnie Flippo , Bob Jones , Howell Heflin , Jim Allen , Lister Hill , John Sparkman , Big Jim Folsom , and so many more . "
Joining
Wheeler in departing from Griffith 's staff were : Megan Swearingen ( Legislative Director ) , Brian Greer ( Senior Legislative Assistant ) , Will Crain ( Legislative Assistant ) , Sean Magers ( Press Secretary ) , Arinze Ifekauche ( Legislative Correspondent ) , Chase Chesser ( Legislative Correspondent ) , Mary Lou Hughston ( Staff Assistant ) , Dr. Anjali Shah Kastorf ( Congressional Fellow ) , Leslee Oden ( Congressional Fellow ) , and Andrew Menefee ( Intern ) .
The staff members waited until they could return to Washington to resign .
Last month , Griffith 's campaign consulting team announced they had terminated their relationship with Griffith .
Wheeler continued , " I appreciate Congressman Griffith 's being a very dedicated congressman .
But we believe he made a mistake - a well - intentioned but misguided mistake that is not in the interest of the great people of North Alabama who elected him a year ago as a Democrat .
As his staff , we wish him only the best , and we all remain committed to the citizens of the Tennessee Valley .
But we cannot , in good conscience , continue working for him .
It is with deep sadness that we leave our work for the Fifth District .
But because we are unwavering in our own principles , we have no choice but to move on .
We do not know what the future holds , but we are taking a leap of faith with the belief we will soon find ourselves in the employment of principled public officials . "
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
Sean Magers , Press Secretary -
" It has been a privilege working for a Blue Dog for the past year , and I look forward to continuing to promote the progress already achieved in twelve short months by the Democratic Party .
Working for my home Congressional District has afforded me a true passion to work for the results that are generated by a thoughtful Democratic process , and I look forward to taking that work ethic with me where ever I go . "
Will Crain , Legislative Assistant -
" It has been a true honor serving the people of my home district and state , but I cannot in good faith follow Dr. Griffith into the Republican Party .
I took a job with this office to carry on the conservative , Democratic policies of Bud Cramer , who like many of his predecessors helped lead North Alabama to periods of remarkable economic development and prosperity .
While I will always be proud of the work our staff accomplished with Dr. Griffith , I look forward to bringing the bridge - building and fiscally responsible policies of the Blue Dogs we worked hard to advance to other career opportunities .
These are the principles that have traditionally benefited the Tennessee Valley and that I believe will lead our nation back to an era of economic growth and security . "
Brian Greer , Senior Legislative Assistant -
Working as a member of the Honorable Congressman Parker Griffith 's staff has been an exciting and educational journey .
However , my personal and professional values do not permit me to advance the Republican agenda .
Although Congressman Griffith 's views have changed , mine have remained aligned with the Democratic Party .
I believe we have accomplished a great deal in the 111th Congress .
Much work remains to be done , and I plan to continue working for Democrats in a different capacity , specifically focusing on helping Americans , strengthening our economy , and keeping our population safe from threats both foreign and domestic .
Thank you to all my friends and colleagues for support during this transition .

He explained to Mark Steyn who was guest - hosting for Sean Hannity why he decided to become a republican .
THE Copenhagen conference was rightly killed by greed , science fiction and a surfeit of hot air emitted by the 45,000 delegates , rent - seekers and assorted hangers - on , all of whom attempted to defy common sense and cripple the global economy .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who sought to attain some semblance of world statesmanship as a " friend of the chair " appointed by host , Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen , again demonstrated his lack of diplomatic negotiating skills as conferees failed to agree to a meaningful conclusion .
Fortunately , Rudd 's attempts to scare Australians into supporting an untested emissions trading system in advance of the failed conference were derailed by a new and reinvigorated Opposition , under Tony Abbott , at the eleventh hour .
Had Malcolm Turnbull 's plan to go along with the Labor Party succeeded , Australia would now be suffering under a new tax scheme that would have ensured the collapse of industries fundamental to the economy .
The collapse at Copenhagen into a weak , almost meaningless morass of platitudes and " legally non-binding " ( how 's that for humbug ? ) agreement with no firm limits on emissions provided real - time proof of the inability of the United Nations to organise , let alone operate , anything .
That Australia sent more than 100 people to Copenhagen to participate in this gabfest only to return with a piece of paper that reads like a drunk 's New Year 's resolution is an absolute disgrace .
What 's more , the whole show will be repeated in Bonn in six months in another exercise of futility , fatuity and duplicity .
Left - leaning nations and taxpayer - funded organisations went to Copenhagen prepared to give the dysfunctional global bureaucracy the power to operate the largest , most intrusive , supra-national tax - and - police authority ever envisaged .
Characters dressed as polar bears and pandas cheered such irrational leaders as Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez as he called for the end of capitalism , for only with the end of rationalism can such endangered fruit - loops hope to survive .
One of the few to show any independent thinking was Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who said his nation supported a collective global agreement , but any compromise must not ignore the science .
" To settle for something that would be seen as diminished expectations ... would be in our view a very wrong message to emerge , " he said .
Without doubt , the wrong message has been sent .
As Patrick Michaels , formerly professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia , wrote in The Wall Street Journal , Climategate - the now famous leaked emails from the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit - demonstrate some arbitrary manipulating of various climate data sources in order to fit preconceived hypotheses , deliberate blocking of freedom of information requests related to data provided to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and the silencing of climate scientists sceptical of the prevailing orthodoxy .
In effect , the global warming claims of the so - called science has been ripped apart .
The crowd who gathered in Copenhagen were there pushing a fraud .
The Russians were on to it early when they checked the claims being put forward on the basis of the data they had supplied .
Last week , the Moscow - based Institute of Economic Analysis ( IEA ) was issued a report claiming that the Hadley Centre for Climate Change based at the headquarters of the British Meteorological Office in Exeter ( Devon , England ) had probably tampered with Russian climate data .
The IEA said Russian meteorological - station data did not substantiate the anthropogenic global - warming theory and that the Hadley Climate Research Unit Temperature UK ( HadCRUT ) survey had cherry - picked available data .
It had ignored material that showed no substantial warming in the late 20th century and early 21st century and included incomplete data , rather than using uninterrupted observations .
The London Daily Telegraph's James Delingpole , a keen student of Climategate , noted : " What the Russians are suggesting here , in other words , is that the entire global temperature record used by the IPCC to inform world government policy is a crock . "
In The Weekend Australian yesterday , a number of respected scientists dismissed the alarmist warnings about the extinction of the Great Barrier Reef .
The widely anticipated extreme weather predicted by climate alarmists has not eventuated .
Even the threats of rising sea levels have been rejected by one of the world 's foremost sea-rise experts , Nils - Axel Morner , the leader of the Maldives Sea Level Project , who wrote in October to Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed telling him that the results of extensive testing of the sea levels in the Maldives over several decades showed " overwhelming evidence that sea level was by no means in a rising mode in the Maldives , but had remained quite stable for the last 30 years " .
The same goes for Tuvalu and the other island nations claiming to be threatened by calamitous sea rise , he said .
Very emotive , but a fraud .
There we have it .
As yet , the global warming crowd have failed to produce any observation - based evidence that carbon dioxide levels have led to rising temperatures , but have shown that they are willing to distort data , manipulate facts and censor those who disagree with their ideology .
May all those who have peddled this dangerous and unscientific nonsense wake to a lump of coal in their stocking on Christmas Day .

US F1's sporting director Peter Windsor says his team is frustrated by the mandatory summer shutdown imposed in Formula 1 since last year .
Since the rule was introduced , all teams have been forced to shut down their factories during the August break in order to reduce costs .
Windsor said his team , which will make its F1 debut this year , will follow the rules and shut down its factory too , but reluctantly .
" We 're all complaining a little about everything closing down for the New Year but - believe me - America is currently much more industrious than the UK , " Windsor wrote on the US F1 website 's blog .
" Here , at our home base , we were quiet on Christmas Day ( naturally ) and then again today .
The UK - and most of Europe - basically shut down on December 18 and will not stagger back to life until January 4 .
That 's 16 valuable days lost in the too - short life of the F1 European winter .
" And that 's not all : remember the August F1 shutdown that was introduced for the first time in 2009 ?
Well , it 's happening again in 2010 .
Understand that most of Europe closes for August and you kind of understand the decision .
Unless you 're American , that is .
" As in Australia , August for Americans is just another working month in which some people maybe take a week or two away .
There 's no nationwide shutdown , as such - not of the type that regularly afflicts massive F1 teams like Ferrari .
" For years all of their suppliers have been shutting their doors for the month of August - and for years the European teams have been complaining that the situation has been growing worse , not better . "
He added : " There was an F1 team meeting vote in the early fall about whether the 2009 F1 August shutdown had been a ' success ' .
I was impressed to hear the McLaren guys say that it was a waste of time and that most of their staff had found it all very frustrating , but sadly these were lone voices : the majority of the teams , led by Red Bull , it seemed to me , are firmly committed to the summer shutdown .
And so shut down we will . "

I had enough problems trying to solve the original Rubik ’s Cube .
Heck , I was often tempted to just peel all the colored stickers off and place them on the proper sides of the cube whenever I got frustrated with the damned thing .
So when I came across V - CUBES , I just about lost my mind .
V-CUBE cubic puzzles come in 5x5x5 , 6x6x6 and an insane 7x7x7 configuration for the true puzzle masochist .
The mammoth 7x7x7 cube is made up of hundreds of individual pieces which rotate around an inner mechanism that was precisely engineered to turn quickly and smoothly ( hence the slightly bulging appearance of the cube ) .
If I ’m doing my math right , the V - CUBE 7 offers up about 1.95 * ( 10 ^160 ) permutations , so that should keep you busy for just a little while .
Think that seems unsolveable ?
Check out this video clip of master puzzle solver Frank Morris cranking through the V - CUBE 7 in just under 7 minutes flat :
And just in case that ’s not complicated enough for you , the V - CUBE guys are working on future models all the way up to 11x11x11 .
O.M.G.W.T.F.R.U.B.I.K ?
You can find all of these cubes over at the V - CUBES Online Shop .
Prices range from about $ 35 to $ 70 USD .

Hoffman has siphoned so much support from Ms. Scozzafava that their Democratic rival has vaulted into the lead , according to a poll released Thursday .
The election is Nov. 3 .
" Personally , I 'm just as fed up with the Republican Party as the Democratic Party , " says Catherina Wojtowicz , coordinator of the Chicago tea - party group .
" The Republican Party looks great on paper .
But the people who call themselves Republicans , with a few exceptions , have no idea what the party stands for , or do n't care . "
... The Club for Growth , a fiscally conservative group , has announced it 's spending $ 250,000 -- and may spend more -- in support of Mr. Hoffman , depicting Mr. Owens and Ms. Scozzafava as equally contemptible liberals .
Mr. Hoffman has attracted the endorsements of several conservative and antiabortion groups .
" The fact that [ the tea - party groups are ] out there is going to help my candidacy , because there are people just like me that are feeling the same frustrations and the same disappointment with our leadership and doing something about it , " says Mr. Hoffman .
Last month we started looking at the special election campaign in the mammoth congressional district in northeast New York ( NY - 23 ) to replace John McHugh , who Obama named Army Secretary .
The district has n't sent a Democrat to Congress since the Republicans became a reform - oriented party in the 1860s .
It went Republican -- but anti-slave Republican -- and never changed , even though the GOP changed so much that -- thanks to Richard Nixon 's and Kevin Phillips ' " Southern strategy " -- it has come full circle as the party that actually advocates policies that are both racist and as close to slavery as one can get under the current social constraints against that sort of thing .
In the end , we concluded that although the mainstream Republican , Dede Scozzafava , is pro-choice and favors equality for gays , she is n't necessarily a better option than conservative Democrat Bill Owens .
She 's good for a Republican and he 's pretty piss - poor for a Democrat but in the end , she 'll generally vote against working families and he 'll generally vote for working families .
Either , of course , is preferable to the extreme right - wing fringe loon , Doug Hoffman -- a registered Republican , of course -- that the Conservative Party is running .
He 's being backed by the teabaggers , the Club for Growth , religionist loon Gary Bauer , all kinds of fringe right - wing outfits , and extremist politicians from out of state like Indiana radical Mike Pence and Tennessee actor Fred Thompson .
Yesterday ' spointed out that teabagger antics like this are wrecking the GOP strategy for an electoral comeback -- and not just in Upstate New York .
Teabaggers are refusing to support the Republican candidate , and teabagger - oriented extremists in Congress , like Pence , are following their lead , hoping for national notoriety .
Yesterday the GOP Establishment rolled out an endorsement by Newt Gingrich in the hope of over - awing the far right but instead they got nothing but ire and vituperation from the extremists .
Right wing fanatic Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) , who would like to rise in the House Republican leadership , wrote Scozzafava a check and " his conservative base attacked him viciously , specifically harping intimidate details of his personal life .
" Right - wing propaganda operations are at war with each other as well .
The , which is more like a tabloid selling stories of Michael Jackson resurrections on Neptune every day , is making the absurd claim -- pulled right out of their asses -- that Scozzafava will switch parties if she wins .
And a column by William Kristol in the same rag claims that she is n't even the Republican in the race .
Theis scared that what 's happening in NY - 23 is also what 's happening around the country , including in high profile campaigns in Florida , New Hampshire , Connecticut , Illinois , and Delaware , where the national GOP leaders want candidates who can win moderates , mainstream and independent voters but where teabaggers are looking for the kind of ideological purity that works wonders in Republican primaries but are suicide in general elections .

WHEN the UN Climate Change Conference opens in Copenhagen next month , all eyes will be on the delegates ’ efforts to broker a deal that will prevent catastrophic global warming .
Yet amid all the talk of caps , targets and trading , it is easy to forget who is ultimately responsible for the mess we find ourselves in .
I have long argued that climate change begins at home .
Each of us in the developed world has played our part in creating this problem and , while there is no doubt that coordinated global action is needed to tackle it , we can each be part of the solution .
So , ask yourself this : how green am I really ?
You might think you are doing your bit for the environment , but even if you shun bottled water , buy local produce and reuse your plastic bags , chances are that you have some habits that are far more environmentally damaging than you realise .
What ’s more , if everyone else is doing these things too , their detrimental effects really add up .

Its vendors are in the vanguard of those promoting more “ sustainable ” products , with organic and fair trade options now widely available .
Starbucks even boasts a programme it calls Shared PlanetTM programme – the irony of that trademark appears to be lost on them – which has the declared aim of minimising the company ’s environmental impact and increasing involvement with local communities .
That ’s no bad thing , as far as it goes : fair trade can help to stop the exploitation of farmers , and buying organic may ensure more sustainable production …
USC players just emerged from their first team meeting with new Coach Lane Kiffin and assistants Ed Orgeron and Monte Kiffin .
Lane Kiffin was a USC assistant under Pete Carroll for six seasons before head - coaching stints with the Oakland Raiders and the University of Tennessee .
“ It went great , ” Kiffin said of the 20 - minute meeting .
“ This is the third time I ’ve done a first meeting , but it was different because you knew so many people and so many things have been established here .
“ We just need to continue on and improve in certain areas as well . ”
Players said the emphasis was on following team rules and starting with a clean slate .
“ It was nice to get that out of the way , to hear his perspective finally without it being a conference on TV , ” quarterback Mitch Mustain said .
Senior fullback Stanley Havili , who was a freshman in 2006 during Kiffin ’s final season , said there was new excitement , especially with Orgeron in the mix .
“ We ’ve been doing the same thing for a long time , ” Havili said .
“ Even though [ Kiffin ] was under coach Carroll , I feel like with Coach O back it ’s a whole different mentality . ”
I ’ll have more later at latimes.com / sports

Now that the core demand of progressives has been removed from the Senate health care bill - - namely , the public health insurance option -- should progressives continue to support the effort ?
For me , the question is particularly difficult .
I have been the thinker most associated with the public option , which I ’ve long argued is essential to ensuring accountability from private insurers and long - term cost control .
I was devastated when it was killed at the hands of Senator Joe Lieberman , not least because of what it said about our democracy -- that a policy consistently supported by a strong majority of Americans could be brought down by a recalcitrant Senate minority .
It would therefore be tempting for me to side with Howard Dean and other progressive critics who say that health care reform should now be killed .
It would be tempting , but it would be wrong .

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
Without fanfare , President Barack Obama has OK'd a large cash infusion to help clean up the Great Lakes , quietly signing a bill that was years in the making and marks a rare bipartisan milestone .
The former senator from Illinois , which borders Lake Michigan , did it on Friday .
Few people knew about it until Monday .
That ’s because the measure with $ 475 million for the Great Lakes was part of a broader spending bill that included money for other projects , including $ 4 million with which to buy additional property for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park .
And attached to that Interior and Environmental Appropriations
Act was a more urgent matter , namely , temporary legislation , called a continuing resolution , to keep agencies within the United States government operating until late December .
It had to be signed by the end of last week or the government would not be able to pay its bills , since Congress has not yet approved all the spending for the current fiscal year and the old resolution was expiring .
So Obama signed it , barely 24 hours after the Senate took the last legislative step .
While senators , environmental groups and reporters were expecting word from the White House on a signing ceremony or Great Lakes kickoff event , the president ’s signature was already dry .
Still , the news brought cheers Monday .
It will mean about $ 146 million can be spent in the next year to clean toxic sediment and areas of concern , including the lower Cuyahoga River , while $ 60 million more can go toward removing zebra mussels , keeping out Asian carp and dealing with other invasive species that threaten marine life , shipping and recreation , according to figures in Obama ’s budget .
Another $ 97 million will go to reduce runoff and contamination from entering streams and rivers from farms and industry , while $ 105 million will help restore habitat and wildlife , including building the populations of lake trout , brook trout , lake sturgeon and piping plover .
Finally , the budget has $ 65 million for accountability and monitoring .
This was a bipartisan accomplishment , set in motion during President George W. Bush ’s administration when Great Lakes shippers , environmentalists , fishermen and recreational boaters created an ambitious restoration blueprint calling for investments from U.S. and Canadian governments , states and provinces and the private and nonprofit sectors .
Yet despite his blessing , Bush never approved the necessary money , said Kristy Meyer , director of agricultural and clean water programs for the Ohio Environmental Council .
The Bush White House and Republican lawmakers said at the time that the Iraq war and other matters required them to shift their spending priorities .
That ’s what makes this news " a huge deal , " Meyer said Monday .
" This is the first time ever that a president has given substantial money to the Great Lakes . "
The spending bill also contains $ 3.4 billion for drinking water and sewer improvements acround the nation .
It has another $ 4 million to add 635 acres to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Summit County .
Congress also inserted a provision that will exempt 13 ships from having to comply with a stringent new Environmental Protection Agency air rule .
Great Lakes shippers said older steamships that could not burn low - sulfer fuel and would have to stop operating .
Besides the 13 exempted , another 13 will be eligible to apply for waivers .
" President Obama is committed to protecting and restoring the Great Lakes and recognizes this is a shared effort in partnership with regional leadership , " White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said .
" The Administration is very encouraged that the funding the president requested for the Great Lakes restoration initiative was in the final Interior Appropriations bill as it will help to improve water quality and reduce pollution in the nation ’s largest system of fresh water . "
Congress members from both parties , including Republican Sen. George Voinovich and Rep. Steve LaTourette , and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Reps. Betty Sutton , Marcia Fudge and Tim Ryan , supported the bill and pushed its passage .
Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich supported the Great Lakes and environmental provisions , yet he voted against the bill .
He said that 's because the portion that went to continue the government 's operations went to such operations as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which he cannot support .
" This is a great day for the Great Lakes and the people who depend on them for their jobs and their way of life , " said Jeff Skelding of the National Wildlife Federation .
Skelding is the national campaign director for a 110 - organization coalition , called the Healing Our Waters - Great Lakes Coalition , that has worked for this kind of federal commitment for years .

Europe 's new president , Herman Van Rompuy , faced a furious backlash in Turkey yesterday amid reports of his hostility to the country 's EU membership .
Suat Kiniklioglu , an influential member of the ruling Justice and Development party ( AKP ) , told the Guardian there was " widespread Turkish sentiment " that Van Rompuy would harm Turkey 's European aspirations and suggested that France and Germany had championed him for that reason .
" We are concerned , " said Kiniklioglu , a member of the Turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee and the AKP 's deputy chairman for external affairs .
" This man has made it very clear that he does n't want to see Turkey in the European Union .
What is even sadder is that he is making that argument on the basis of the supposed Christian values of the union .
That 's not the type of union we envisage .
The values we envisage are of democracy , transparency , human rights and the rule of law . "
Kiniklioglu was referring to remarks by Van Rompuy in the Belgian parliament in 2004 that " Turkey is not a part of Europe and will never be part of Europe " .
Van Rompuy had also said : " An expansion of the EU to include Turkey can not be considered as just another expansion as in the past .
The universal values which are in force in Europe , and which are also fundamental values of Christianity , will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey . "
The comments have been widely seen in Turkey as chiming with opposition to Turkish membership as voiced by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and the German chancellor , Angela Merkel .
The EU voted unanimously to begin accession talks with Turkey in 2004 , prompting an initial outpouring of pro-European enthusiasm in the country .
However , the early euphoria evaporated as prospects for Turkish membership foundered amid protracted negotiations to open various chapters of EU law .
European politicians have blamed the slow pace of political reform in Turkey .
But Turkish politicians cite European prejudice , particularly in Germany and France , against the idea of a Muslim nation joining the union .
Kiniklioglu said these considerations had driven Van Rompuy 's appointment .
" His appointment is really evidence that the Franco - German axis in the union is gaining increased strength , " he said .
" I would not be surprised that his views on Turkey have played a role in that choice . "
Earlier this month , Turkey 's EU minister and chief membership negotiator , Egemen Bagis , told the Guardian that he would have welcomed Tony Blair as president of the European council .
Blair is warmly regarded in Turkey for vocally supporting its membership in the run-up to the 2004 accession vote .
Kiniklioglu said dismay at Van Rompuy 's appointment had been eased by the choice of a Briton , Lady Ashton , as foreign minister , but lamented that a higher profile figure had not been selected .
" We are perplexed about these choices .
I do n't think they are in consonance with what the Lisbon treaty is trying to achieve , " he said .
" The idea was that you would have one voice , a high - profile person who would have experience in dealing with international leaders and would drive the desire to make the EU a player in global affairs . "
Staff members on Capitol Hill might have to walk over “ dead ” bodies to get to work Tuesday morning as Tea Party protesters plan to meet their end in the Senate .
Well , sort of .
As the Senate gets into its second week of debate on health care , the protesters plan to turn the chamber ’s offices and hallways into “ government waiting rooms , ” pretending to be sick patients waiting for treatment .
As the day wears on , their “ untreated illnesses ” will get worse , and some will “ die . ”
Yet , even in death , some corpses only plan to leave by force .
“ We must remind them that our steadfast opposition to a government takeover of health care is as strong now as it has been all along , ” Mark Meckler , an organizer , wrote on the Web site Tea Party Tax Day .
Mr. Meckler appeals to his Tea Party kindred to make the Christmastime “ sacrifice ” to come out and feign sickness and death , noting that “ throughout history American Patriots have made far greater sacrifices than this to protect our liberty . ”
The movement , which has likened most , if not all , of the Democrats ’ efforts to socialism , last took to the Hill in November for the same cause and several others , encouraged by Representative Michele Bachmann , Republican of Minnesota , and Glenn Beck , the conservative Fox News host .
TV advertising used to work like this : you sat on your sofa while creatives were paid to throw a bucket of shit in your face .
Today you 're expected to sit on the bucket , fill it with your own shit , and tip it over your head while filming yourself on your mobile .
Then you upload the video to the creatives .
You do the work ; they still get paid .
Hail the rise of " loser - generated content " ; commercials assembled from footage shot by members of the public coaxed into participating with the promise of TV glory .
The advantages to the advertiser are obvious : it saves cash and makes your advert feel like part of some warm , communal celebration rather than the 30 - second helping of underlit YouTube dog piss it is .
Witness the current Oxo Factor campaign .
According to the website : " Has your Family got the OXO Factor ?
It 's 2009 .
There 's no such thing as ' the OXO Family ' any more .
We 're all OXO Families !
That 's why we asked you to film your family performing the script for our new TV ad , for the chance to see yourselves on TV , alongside some of Britain 's other brilliant families . "
Or " other insufferable arseholes " , depending on your point of view .
End result : a bunch of wacky - doo show - offs titting around in their kitchens , each reciting the same script , which they 're not allowed to deviate from .
They can perform it " ironically " , and indeed they all do , which somehow only makes it more horrible still : the Oxo family of 2009 may display faint traces of corporate - approved subversion , provided they adhere to the corporate - approved screenplay .
Lynda Bellingham 's fictional family of yore might 've been insipid , but at least they were n't willing participants in a macabre dystopian dumb - show .
Phone ads are worse .
Everybody 's " brightdancing " according to The X Factor break bumpers .
" Brightdancing " consists of shooting a video of yourself waving your mobile around while being filmed by a Talk Talk website gizmo which turns the glare from your mobile 's screen into a ribbon of light .
It 's less creative than choosing which colour iPod you want for Christmas .
" Brightdancing " .
Jesus .
Then there 's Josh , the simpering middle - class mop who 's apparently " forming a supergroup " for T - Mobile .
According to the official story , Josh was strolling down the street one day when a T - Mobile film crew asked him what he'd do if he had free texts for life .
Rather than pointing out that " free texts for life " means dick - all in a world containing the internet , Josh burbled something about forming a band .
A few weeks later and gosh oh crikey that 's precisely what 's happening !
And we 're all invited !
Hey everyone !
Join Josh 's Band !
As well as TV spots recounting the irritating story of Josh and his " volunteers " ( Yikes !
They 're busking in an open - top London bus !
Bonkers ! ) , there are YouTube videos of Josh 's utterly spontaneous and not - at - all - stage - managed musical quest .
The group has its own song , which you 're encouraged to perform and upload yourself , hastening humankind 's slow cultural death in the process .
The recurring melody sounds suspiciously like a seven - note ringtone , while the lyrics speak vaguely inclusion and connectivity – y'know , the sort of thing they guff on about in mobile phone ads .
The third line is " I call up all of my friends " .
Why call anyone ?
You 've got free texts for life , you prick .
It 's so clumsily contrived it would n't fool a hen , yet we 're meant to welcome this " supergroup " as an authentic grassroots musical phenomenon .
On MySpace , Josh ( or whoever 's controlling him ) claims , " It 's a shame so many cynics think this band is completely manufactured . "
So it 's a genuine people 's movement , then ?
And this band does n't contain any paid - for session musicians ?
And that song was n't written by professional tunesmiths - for - hire ?
And the lyrics were n't penned by some dickshoe at Saatchi & Saatchi ?
Hmm .
Piss off , T - Mobile .
Stop trying to " crowdsource " .
You 're embarrassing yourselves .
Scram .
And empty that bucket on your way out .

The publisher of Madden , Dead Space and The Sims will release fewer games next year , reacting to market changes and embracing lessons its competitors are just now learning , the head of EA told Kotaku .
Advertisement
" We 're building our games differently and we are building fewer of them , " EA CEO John Riccitiello said in his interview with the site this week .
He said that the publisher is declining its title count from 60 - something games two years ago , to 50 - something this year to about 40 next year .
He said , there will be " no less emphasis on innovation .
No less emphasis on quality .
No fewer new IPs .
But games that are n't finding a large enough audience , we 're taking those resources and doubling down on larger games .
That 's what the market seems to want . "
Riccitiello 's comments echo those of his chief financial officer who recently told a group of financial analysts at a meeting that Kotaku attended that the very top games are garnering more sales than ever , making the top - 20 far and away the largest hits , a shift from a few years ago when games in the top - 40 could all boast grand sales figures .

The move toward fewer games is also a move toward better games , which Riccitiello believes is a deciding factor for a publisher having bigger - selling games .
" I'm a massive believer in quality and in innovation and we invest heavily in it , " he said , in the midst of describing both long - term efforts to turn innovative games into blockbusters ( see his discussion with Kotaku about the future of Mirror 's Edge ) and fundamentally changing established franchises for the modern era ( see his discussion with Kotaku about Command & Conquer ) .

The emphasis on quality is earning EA money , Riccitiello believes .
He cites an increase in EA games receiving 80 - or - higher Metacritic scores from about five games two years ago to over what he expects will be 20 this year and says that coincides with higher revenues .

" So my quality is up .
We 're doing more original [ intellectual property ] than anyone else in the industry by a fairly wide margin and we 're innovating sequels like we never did before .
And in cases where we 're on our back like with Need for Speed on quality , the quality is up some 20 - odd points .
So , quality and innovation , I can point to almost any corner in my business and show you where that 's living .
And one of the things , I 'm pleased to say , in an industry that was down in the first half of this fiscal year … we were up 13 % in revenue .
It was the quality games that yielded more revenue . "
Making fewer and fewer games could be problematic , of course .
" There 's a risk that if you follow this trend , you have one game when you 're done .
We 're never going to go there .
And you could end up cutting out innovation . "
He said that EA has games based on new intellectual properties scheduled for next year , including one from Dead Space and Dante 's Inferno studio Visceral Games .

The push toward innovation in new content and sequels led Riccitiello to , of course , draws a contrast between today 's EA and both the EA of old and unnamed competing publishers .
" I think a pattern EA went on and I think other companies are following right now is the trend of while you 're milking your cash cows and nothing else , it 's a very profitable business .
While you 're doing that it feels really good and [ Wall ]
Street loves you .
I think EA got into that position in the last cycle .
I think other companies are in that position now .
I 've lived through both ends of that .
And one of those reasons I spend so much time talking about quality and innovation is I do n't think it 's an end goal .
I think it 's a pursuit that does n't stop .
You will not see a year from EA where I 'm not excited about two or three major intellectual properties the world has never heard of .
And I wo n't go to Madden meetings or FIFA meetings or Need for Speed meetings without saying :
What 's different that totally excites me that we 've never seen before ?
And you wo n't see us doing that and not asking the creative leaders in our building what excites them , because that 's the beat of our business .

" I think I and others might have been lured into thinking it was something else once upon a time ago .
And some people are currently hypnotized by that , who we compete with .
They will learn the same lessons .
" This industry is ultimately a small group of people with a creative idea that are allowed to express that idea through video game software in a way that is high art or , sometimes high and crass exploitation that can be fun .
But it 's some combination of those things . "

EA recently announced that it has cut a third of the projects in development in the studio .
Riccitiello declined to describe any of them to Kotaku , but that cutting seems consistent with the better , fewer games philosophy which now seems to guide one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world .
They are meant to be Spain 's most important inland wetlands , but yesterday the lagoons at Las Tablas de Daimiel national park were not just dry , they were burning .
Stilted walkways stood on baked earth and rowing boats lay stranded on the ground .
Observation huts revealed no birds , just an endless stretch of reeds rooted in cracked mud .
Only 1 % of the park 's surface remains wet , but the real catastrophe is happening underground .
" If you see smoke it is because the dried - out peat under the ground has begun to self - combust , " a park worker warned visitors .
Occasionally , the fire breaks to the surface , sending up puffs of white smoke .
Scientists warn the wetlands are losing the lining that once retained water , with deep cracks opening up in the worst areas .
Park authorities worry the damage may prove irreversible .
Park director Carlos Ruíz believes this is a life - or - death moment for one of Spain 's 14 national parks .
" We are at a point of no return , " he said in a recent report .
Spain 's environment ministry , which runs the failing park , this week banned Ruiz from talking to the Guardian , but scientists who know the wetlands all agree on what is happening .
The aquifer which once fed the lagoons now lies 50ft below them .
Farmers near the park have sunk thousands of wells , some 300 ft deep , and have spent years pumping out more water than goes in .
Furthermore , the Guadiana river , which used to flow into the Tablas de Daimiel , has disappeared .
" People have been warning that it was going to dry out for 20 years , " said Luís Moreno of Spain 's Geological and Mining Institute .
As the peat burns , an area that once trapped carbon dioxide has started releasing vast quantities of it .
" We saw the first smoke in August but the fires must have been burning for a while , " said Moreno .
" It is a very difficult thing to control .
It could burn for months . "
Many worry the political will does not exist to save a park where the last few lagoons are still a refuge for egrets , coots and other waterfowl .
" Daimiel was once a paradise , with thousands and thousands of birds , " said Santos Cirujano , of Spain 's Higher Scientific Research Council .
" If they want to save it , they can , but that requires a will to conserve it . "
Environmentalists want Unesco to shame Spain by removing Daimiel and its surrounding area from the list of international biosphere reserves .
A plan approved two years ago to revive the aquifer by cutting down on irrigation is not working , environmentalists say , as local officials protect farmers .
" Rather than fix the problem here , they use the Tablas [ problem ] to ask for more money and demand water be pumped in from elsewhere , " said José Manuel Hernández , a local environmentalist who sits on the park 's consultative board .
" There are thousands of families who live off agriculture in the area , and it is going to take time to change the way people farm , " said José Luis Martínez , head of agriculture at Castilla La Mancha 's regional government .
Spain 's environment ministry this week pledged to pump water over from the Tagus river basin early next year .
But the last time that was attempted , 95 % of the water was lost along the way .
Furthermore , in a country where water is fought over bitterly , the decision has provoked angry reactions from Tagus farmers .
Some scientists have predicted that Spain 's thirsty agriculture cannot survive in the next decade , as aquifers are exhausted and global warming cuts rainfall .
Last year , Barcelona was forced to import water in tankers to supply the city .
But Pepe Jimenéz , head of Spain 's national parks , denied the situation in Tablas was irreversible .
" We are buying up land around the park and buying water rights too , " he explained .
" The rate at which the aquifer is declining is slowing down but it will take time before it can provide water to the park . "
Manuel Martín grows melons and giant pumpkins on a modest plot where the river Guadiana once sprung generously from the ground .
Now the barren river bed is pitted with cracks and subsidence holes .
Half a dozen water mills remain stranded along the banks .
The land around , however , boasts huge , overhead " pivot " sprinklers for cereal crops .
" The lagoon here used to be full all year round but I have n't seen water since 1985 , " Martin said .
" Our grandparents managed to irrigate their fields without making the water disappear .
They should ban those pivot sprinklers until it comes back . "
PEBBLE BEACH , Calif . --
The NHL wants to hold a second outdoor game , this one in Canada , commissioner Gary Bettman confirmed Wednesday .
" Yes , it 's something we 're going to look at for next season , " Bettman said as the NHL's Board of Governors meeting wrapped up .
" We 'll see if we can make it happen . "
This season 's Winter Classic is Jan. 1 at Fenway Park in Boston between the Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers .
What 's not clear at this point is what day the second outdoor game would be held next season .
" There 's been a lot of speculation , " Bettman said .
" And again , not all of this has been resolved .
But I 'm just laying it out .
Do you do two games on New Year 's Day , or do you do one on New Year 's Day and one on [ CBC's ] ' Hockey Day In Canada ? ' "
Whatever the plan the NHL Player 's Association would have to approve it .
" Hockey Day In Canada " on CBC features all six Canadian teams in a tripleheader , usually in February .
A league source told ESPN.com that this is the leading option for the second outdoor game and that Calgary was the leading candidate to host it .
The Flames wanted to host an outdoor game this season , but those talks fizzled last summer as the league ran out of time to make it happen .
Having the second outdoor game at least a month apart would allow the league to use the same ice plant it owns .
But Bettman did n't believe that was a big issue either way .
" While we like the rink and the truck is very nice and gets a lot of attention , we could buy another one or we could rent a second one , " Bettman said .
The first regular - season outdoor game was held in Edmonton , known as the Heritage Classic , in November 2003 between the Oilers and Montreal Canadiens .
The NHL made it an annual event , with the Winter Classic making its debut Jan. 1 , 2008 , in Buffalo between the Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins .
Last New Year 's Day , the Chicago Blackhawks hosted the Detroit Red Wings at Wrigley Field .
The 2010 - 2011 outdoors game has not yet been chosen , but Yankee Stadium appears to be the leading contender .
Bettman laughed when asked which Canadian teams had expressed an interest in hosting the second outdoor game .
" I think all of them , " he said .
" We did n't ask for a document sworn to under oath , but in the course of conversations , I think every one of the Canadian clubs has said either , ' We want to host and be in it or at least be in it . '
So I think all six have expressed interest . "
" By the way , just about every U.S. club , even if they 're in a warm climate , has said , ' We want to play in it . '
It has become an event that our clubs are having the desire to participate in . "

Dutch scientists have designed a molecular motor that can be locked using an acid and unlocked using a base .
The research represents another step towards molecular machines that can be controlled in the same way as the machines we use in everyday life .
Ben Feringa and colleagues at the University of Groningen have built a series of different synthetic motors in the last few years , but this is the first to feature a locking mechanism .
It ’s a neat single - molecule system in which the ’ rotating arm ’ of the molecule also acts as a plug for a socket formed from a dibenzo [ 24 ] crown - 8 ring .
The two halves of the molecule are joined by a double carbon bond .
As Feringa explains , the 360 ?
rotation of the arm is caused by isomerisations driven by light and heat , but , crucially , only when the socket is unplugged .
This requires a strong base to draw protons away from an NH ?
2 group in the plug , breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold it in place .
’ If you irradiate it with light when it ’s in the locked state it does n’t do anything , but as soon as you deprotonate it unlocks , ’ says Feringa .
David Leigh , who works on molecular motors at the University of Edinburgh , UK , is interested to see that hydrogen bonding is strong enough to keep the two parts together .
He also notes that the paper illustrates the difference between machine mechanisms in the macroscopic and molecular worlds - whereas the moving components in macroscopic rotary motors have angular momentum , the twisting action in the molecular version has several different stages associated with it , each having different sorts of driving forces .
Another noticeable difference is that the team ’s nanoscale motor takes more than half an hour to complete one rotation , but Feringa says the speed could be tuned all the way to micro- or even nanoseconds .
’ It is a rather slow process , ’ he says , ’ That has to do with the fact that the thermal isomerisation steps are not as fast as the photochemical isomerisation steps , which are extremely fast , but in this particular case , we ’re not focusing on enhancing speed , but proving the principle of the locking . ’
The team has already designed other motors that spin at more than three million times a second and are currently building a ’ nanocar ’ .
They plan to connect the rotational movements produced by their lockable motor to the back and forwards movements of pistons .
Feringa is also keen to explore how the devices can be incorporated into biological systems .
Relative to biological molecular motors , says Henry Hess , a nanobiotechnologist at the University of Florida , US , synthetic motors still have a way to go .
’ But Feringa ’s paper is a major step forward , ’ he says .

WASHINGTON  Some House Republicans are boasting about their chances of regaining control of the House in 2010 and relegating Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to minority status for the second half of President Obama ’s term .
“ I have no doubt that we will , ” said Representative Tom Price , the Georgia Republican who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee .
“ The American people want checks and balances , and the way to do that is to put Republicans back in charge . ”
Publicly and privately , Republicans have been upbeat about the midterm outlook , saying voter unrest demonstrated at meetings this summer coupled with strong candidate recruitment have them highly optimistic about capturing 40 or more Democratic seats and resuming command of the House .
They are talking confidently about knocking off such old bulls as Representatives David R. Obey of Wisconsin and Ike Skelton of Missouri , the chairmen of the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees .
“ In terms of candidate recruitment , fund - raising and issue development , we are far ahead of where we were at this point in 1993  and you remember what happened in 1994 , ” Representative Pete Sessions , the Texan who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee , told the conservative Web site Human Events .
Mr. Sessions , of course , was referring to the election that swept Republicans into the House majority after four decades in minority exile .
Auch Spanien steht vor der Herabstufung der Kreditwürdigkeit Ralf Streck
Nach Griechenland rückt auch Spanien wegen der schlechten wirtschaftlichen Aussichten immer deutlicher ins Rampenlicht .
Immer heftiger meldet sich Finanzkrise zurück .
Nach der Dubaikrise und und der Tatsache , dass Griechenland der erste mögliche Pleitekandidat in Euroland werden könnte , rückt nun auch das wirtschaftlich abstürzende Spanien ins Rampenlicht .
Jetzt hat die Ratingagentur Standard & Poor 's ( S&P ) den Ausblick für die Kreditwürdigkeit von Spanien auf " Creditwatch Negative " eingestuft .
Schon im vergangenen Januar hatte S&P dem Land das Top - Rating " AAA " aberkannt und es $ ( LEmit : " AA + " eingestuft ( ) .
Man kann davon ausgehen , dass Spanien sehr bald real weiter herabgestuft wird .
Das " Creditwatch Negative " von S&P kam kurz vor der erneuten [ http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/31/31689/1.html
Abstufung von Griechenland ) $ durch Fitch am Dienstag , die eine Schockwelle über die weltweiten Börsen schickte und den Euro stark unter Druck brachte .
Auf dem Parkett in Madrid ging es am Mittwoch schon munter bergab .
Nach einem Minus von 1,7 % durch die Griechenland - Abstufung am Dienstag folgte wegen den steigenden Zweifeln an der Bonität Spaniens am Mittwoch ein Minus von fast 2,3 % .
Weniger schlecht fielen die Indizes in London , Frankfurt und Paris aus , wo erneute Verluste von 0,37 % , 0,72 % und 0,74 % verzeichnet wurden .
So schlimm wie in Griechenland ist die Lage für Spanien allerdings noch nicht , weil die Gesamtverschuldung derzeit " nur " knapp 70 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts ausmacht .
Bei Griechenland sind es schon 125 %. S&P begründete seine Einschätzung korrekt mit der Gefahr , dass sich die Verschuldung Spaniens schnell der Marke von 100 Prozent nähern könnte .
Denn ähnlich wie Griechenland weist auch Spanien ein explodierendes Staatsdefizit aus .
Der IWF prognostiziert für 2009 mit 12,3 % ein fast genauso hohes Defizit wie die 13 % Griechenlands .
Beide Länder werden zudem wegen struktureller Probleme länger mit der Rezession zu kämpfen haben .
Während die Schulden stark steigen , die wegen dem steigenden Zinsunterschied ( Spread ) bei zehnjährigen Staatsanleihen noch teurer werden , schrumpft die Wirtschaftskraft weiter .
Auch Spanien wird von der EU schon als Hochrisikostaat eingestuft und man kann , wie man es in Japan von Regierungsseite schon tut , auch hier offiziell schon von einer gefährlichen Deflation sprechen , weil die Preise sieben Monate in Folge gefallen sind .
Weil das Land schon seit langem den EU - Spitzenplatz mit knapp 20 % Arbeitslosigkeit einnimmt , sind die Ausgaben enorm hoch und gleichzeitig brechen dem Staat die Einnahmen weg .
Die Politik der Sozialisten , die nun sogar die Mehrwertsteuer um 2 % erhöhen wollen , darf als Rezept für ein Desaster bezeichnet werden .
Die ohnehin schwer angeschlagenen Familien mit niedrigen Einkommen werden besonders hart getroffen , und das wird den nationalen Konsum , an dem die Wirtschaft vor der Krise hing , noch stärker belasten .
Angesichts der massiven Ausweitung der Schwarzarbeit , mit der sich viele Familien mangels Hartz IV oder Sozialhilfe über Wasser halten müssen , darf sogar bezweifelt werden , ob so höhere Steuereinnahmen erzielt werden .
ZAGREB ( Reuters ) - Opposition Social Democrat Ivo Josipovic convincingly won Sunday ’s Croatian presidential election , promising to help the government ’s efforts to complete European Union membership talks and join the bloc in 2012 .
Josipovic , a law expert and classical music composer who is relatively inexperienced in high politics , won 60.3 percent of the vote in the second round run-off , the state electoral commission said early Monday .
He will be Croatia ’s third president since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 .
Populist Zagreb mayor Milan Bandic , backed by the Roman Catholic church and more conservative voters , took 39.7 percent of the vote as an independent candidate .
He was expelled from the Social Democrats for insisting on running for president against the party ’s will .
Josipovic promised to back Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor ’s drive to implement reforms and fight widespread corruption , as required by Brussels to complete EU accession talks this year .
“ I want an uncompromising fight against corruption and organized crime .
That is what I promised , that is what we ’ll achieve , ” Josipovic said , to the cheers of his supporters .
“ I strongly believe that we all want a better Croatia with more justice , that we want a country where work is paid for and crime is punished , ” he said .

The candidate of the ruling conservative HDZ party failed to make it to the runoff .
But Kosor , who took over in July and kick - started the new anti-corruption drive , remains the country ’s most popular politician .
“ I believe Josipovic will support the government ’s efforts and that we ’ll cooperate well for the well - being of all our citizens , ” Kosor said Monday .
NEW TEAM FOR FINAL EU DRIVE
The HDZ last week expelled Kosor ’s predecessor , Ivo Sanader , after he announced a political comeback with a stinging attack on the party leadership and the government .
Kosor later said she felt stronger than ever and determined to press on with reforms .
Zeljko Trkanjec , political analyst and editor at Jutarnji List daily , said Croatia got “ a sort of a dream team ” with Kosor and Josipovic for the final stage of EU entry talks .
“ They could function great together and that will help Croatia become a country with a real rule of law , which is the basic precondition for EU membership , ” Trkanjec said .
But Social Democrat chief Zoran Milanovic , boosted by his candidate ’s victory , quickly pointed to problems ahead , mainly in the struggling economy which contracted 6 percent last year .
“ I am inviting the prime minister to meet and start discussing the serious problems , the unrealistic budget .
We obviously want to continue spending more than we have , which cannot go on , ” he said .
Analysts say the government ’s biggest challenge is to salvage the strained budget , particularly as the government ’s macroeconomic forecasts of modest economic growth this year were seen as too optimistic .
Josipovic will succeed veteran reformer Stjepan Mesic , whose second five - year term ends in February .
He will have limited powers over foreign policy , defense and the intelligence services but none over the economy or legislation .
A TEENAGE boy charged over the pack rape of two 15 - year - old girls told police he'd done nothing wrong and the girls wanted it , a court heard today .
The 16 - year - old boy , one of two charged today with the pack rape involving up to 10 males in Melbourne in October , had shown no remorse , police informant Detective Dave Newman told a children 's court .
" It seemed in the interview any girl outside at night and drinking alcohol is fair game and I have a major concern he could do this to other people , '' he told the court .
" I am quite disturbed and have major concerns about that attitude being back on the streets and going straight back to reoffending with members of the public or witnesses . ''
The 16 - year - old boy from Broadmeadows was charged with four counts of rape and a 17 - year - old boy from Coolaroo has been charged with two counts of rape .
The court heard a graphic account of how the girls were raped repeatedly and taunted by up to 10 males .
Someone close to the defendant had talked about burning the girls ' house down while the defendant talked about " buying the girls ' ' to get himself off , the court heard .
A lawyer for the boy told the magistrate he had no criminal history and should be granted bail as two other males involved in the case had been .
A magistrate said she was concerned the boy was a risk and was convinced that the two girls were petrified and remanded him in custody until another hearing next month .
The 17 - year - old will apply for bail next week and will spend the weekend behind bars after an interpreter could not be found to appear in court .

The small island nation of Haiti relies heavily on food imports , but with prices soaring , some Haitians are resorting to eating mud .
The cookies — made of dirt , butter and salt — hold little nutritional value , but manage to keep Haiti ’s poor alive .
Worldfocus special correspondent Benno Schmidt and producer Ara Ayer report from Haiti , showing how far some people are going to fill their stomachs .

Virginia Saenz could hear the desperation in the voice of the telephone message .
It was 5 a.m. on the day before Thanksgiving , and the caller , Lucy Crutchfield , was trying to tell her daughter that she 'd send money for groceries -- but she 'd have to miss a mortgage payment to do it .
But Crutchfield dialed the wrong number .
Instead of getting her daughter , she got Saenz , a real estate agent from the San Diego suburb of Tierrasanta .
" I know right now we are all struggling , " Saenz said .
" Lisa on the phone , she sounded so desperate for her daughter , it broke my heart . "
Saenz did the only thing she could think of -- she called Crutchfield back and said not to worry .
Crutchfield would pay the mortgage , and Saenz would handle the groceries .
" She said , ' You have the wrong number ... do n't worry any more , ' " Crutchfield recalled .
For Crutchfield , it was a holiday miracle .
Her house is already in foreclosure .
Her mother recently passed away , and Crutchfield is now trying to pay off her house .
She had a money order prepared to make a mortgage payment on that house -- but was going to cash it in when her daughter called asking for money .
" I thought I was going to lose that house , too , " Crutchfield said .
Saenz told Crutchfield to keep her money and promised to take care of her daughter .
The real estate agent then called Crutchfield 's daughter .
" I asked her what she would like , what her kids like , and then I felt really bad because she said she only wanted eggs and milk , " Saenz said .
" When somebody only asks you for eggs and milk , they are in a really bad situation . "
So Saenz went grocery shopping on Thanksgiving morning with her 14 - year - old son in tow to tell her what kids liked to eat .
They bought food for a Thanksgiving dinner and enough groceries to get Crutchfield 's daughter through the end of the month -- her next payday .
She said the act of giving made " the day special for me . "
" I helped somebody , " Saenz said Friday .
" I think it 's what anybody would have done . "

Last month , after Annise Parker was elected mayor of Houston , Dave Welch of Houston Area Pastor Council , apologized to the nation for failing to stop this gay candidate from taking office , saying “ we let our position on the wall be breached by the enemy . ”
Today , Welch is back , this time attacking megachurch pastor Joel Osteen for offering the opening prayer at Parker ’s inauguration , saying that officials like Parker and President Obama are “ wicked ” and saying their election is proof “ of cancer of the soul among the people ” :
I 've lived in the Washington , D.C. , area for the better part of the last 10 years .
So I 've seen my share of demonstrations , although more often than not I just try to avoid the traffic nightmares they cause .
Among the various classes of protests — pro-life , anti-war , environmental , and now tea parties — the most destructive are the anti-globalization marches .
So when cops clashed with anti-globalization demonstrators at the Pittsburgh G - 20 summit in September , it was easy to assume that most of the altercations represented justified police responses to overzealous protesters .
But a number of disturbing photographs , videos , and witness accounts told a different story .
Along with similar evidence from other recent high - stakes political events , they reveal an increasing , disquieting willingness to smother even peaceful dissent .
On the Friday afternoon before the G - 20 meeting kicked into high gear , a student at the University of Pittsburgh snapped a photo showing a University of Pittsburgh police officer directing traffic at a roadblock .
What 's troubling is what he 's wearing : camouflage military fatigues .
It 's difficult to discern a practical reason why a man working for an urban police department would need to wear camouflage , especially while patrolling an economic summit .
He 's a civilian dressed like a soldier .
The symbolism is clear , and it affects the attitudes of both the cops wearing the clothes and the people they 're policing .
The campus cop was n't alone .
Members of police departments from across the country came to Pittsburgh to help during the summit , most of them dressed in paramilitary garb .
In one widely circulated video , several officers dressed entirely in camouflage emerge from an unmarked car , apprehend a young backpack - wearing protester , stuff him into the car , and drive off .
The sequence evoked the " disappearances " associated with Latin American dictatorships or Soviet Bloc countries .
When Matt Drudge linked to the video , he described the officers in it as members of the military .
They were n't , but it 's easy to understand how someone might make that mistake .
In another video , members of a police unit from Chicago who took vacation time to work at the summit prop up a handcuffed protester and gather behind him .
Another officer then snaps what appears to be a trophy photo .
Two men in faraway Queens were arrested for posting the locations of riot police on Twitter , as though they were revealing the location of troops on a battlefield .
Another video shows dozens of police in full body armor confronting and eventually macing onlookers ( who were n't even protesters ) in the neighborhood of Oakland , far from the site of the summit , as a recorded voice orders any and all to disperse .
Students at the University of Pittsburgh claim cops fired tear gas canisters into dorm rooms , used sound cannons , and shot bean bags and rubber bullets .
The most egregious actions took place on September 25 , when police began ordering students who were in public spaces to disperse despite the fact that they had broken no laws .
Those who moved too slowly , even from public spaces on their own campus or in front of their dorms , were arrested .
A university spokesman said the aim was to break up crowds that " had the potential of disrupting normal activities . "
Apparently a group of people need n't actually break any laws to be put in jail .
They must only possess the " potential " to do so , at which point not moving quickly enough for the cops ' liking could result in an arrest .
That standard is a license for the police to arrest anyone anywhere in the city at any time , regardless of whether they 've done anything wrong .
In all , 190 people were arrested during the summit , including at least two journalists .
It can't be easy to both keep order and protect civil liberties at such events .
But that does n't mean police and city officials should n't be expected to try .
Yes , some protesters damaged some property at the G - 20 summit , although there was n't much of that this time around .
But the presence of a few unruly demonstrators does n't give the police carte blanche to crack down on every young person in the general vicinity , nor should it give the city free rein to suppress all public protest .
It 's unfortunate that when the global press and the leaders of the world 's 20 largest economies came to Pittsburgh , the images that emerged were not of a society that values free expression and constitutional rights but of one willing to grant police powers normally seen in authoritarian states .
This projection of overwhelming force at big events is becoming more common .
At last year 's Republican National Convention in Minneapolis , police conducted peremptory raids on the homes of protesters before the convention began .
In all , 672 people were jailed , including at least 39 journalists .
According to the Minneapolis Star - Tribune , 442 of those 672 later had their charges either dropped or dismissed .
Four years before that , more than 1,800 people were arrested at the previous Republican National Convention in New York City .
Ninety percent were never charged with a crime .
One notorious photo from the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver shows a small mass of protesters , zoned far off from where any delegates or media representatives could hear them , surrounded by two walls of riot police who outnumbered them at least 2 to 1 .
Denver 's police union later issued a commemorative T - shirt of the event emblazoned with an illustration of a menacing cop wielding a baton and the slogan , " We get up early to beat the crowds . "
The trend may have started at the 1999 World Trade Organization summit in Seattle , which saw both actual rioting and police overkill .
Mayor Paul
Schell not only declared a state of emergency , imposed a curfew , and designated swaths of the city " no- protest " zones ; he actually banned civilian possession of gas masks .
Police then gassed entire city blocks .
The victims included many owners of the stores the police were ostensibly protecting from looters .
Assistant Police Chief Ed Joiner , who was in charge of security for the event , would later tell reporters that future summits should be held only in destinations with military governments .
These are precisely the kinds of events where free speech and the freedom to protest need protection the most : when influential figures make high - level decisions with far - reaching consequences .
Instead , we see the opposite .
The higher the event 's profile , the more powerful the players involved , and the more important the decisions being made , the more determined police and politicians are to make sure dissent is kept as far away from the VIPs as possible .
Or silenced entirely .

We did n't approach these women — models , actresses , circus performers , dancers , students , nurses , programmers — just to ogle and schmooze .
We did n't simply want to collect pretty pictures for readers to drool over .
( Although we did that , too . )
We wanted to get to know the girls , their pasts , how they came to be booth babes , what they did when they were n't charming strangers , and what they experienced during their times at conventions such as CES .
Many of these intelligent , charming women had a sense of reluctance when it came to taking members of the press seriously .
Often we heard girls talk of men who do n't understand that a " press badge is n't an excuse " to fondle them as one might touch " everything shiny and pretty " in the booths .

A booth babe 's job is to lure convention attendees into her booths , to do a product demonstration or to pass people off to a coworker .
That 's fine .
But when misunderstandings occur — or attendees forget they 're interacting with living , breathing human beings — some attendees turn into jerks , pressing intimidatingly close and crossing boundaries .
Some slip these girls their hotel keys , pressuring them for a visit later in the day .
Others mistake professional flirting for actual flirting and try pick - up lines .

Others in the tech industry , such as game developer EA , have promoted this mentality to the point of offering a bounty to anyone harassing their booth babes with photo evidence .
The point is that these girls are being paid to be pretty and cordial — and we are n't ashamed to enjoy checking them out and laughing with them .

Speaking on Fox News Sunday , Senator Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , who leads the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , shared his vision of “ tomorrow ’s war . ”
“ Somebody in our government said to me in Sana ’a , the capital of Yemen , Iraq was yesterday ’s war , ” Lieberman explained .
“ Afghanistan is today ’s war .
If we do n’t act preemptively , Yemen will be tomorrow ’s war .
That ’s the danger we face . ”

Senator Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) , also appearing on the program , seemed to agree , calling an attack against Yemen “ something we should consider . ”
“ Maj . Nidal Malik Hasan — the Army officer who killed 13 people in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in November — was linked to Anwar al - Awlaki , a radical Muslim cleric now based in Yemen , ” The Hill noted .
Unnamed administration officials told US media in the aftermath of the thwarted attack that their suspect had confessed to traveling to Yemen and receiving training by Al - Qaeda .
Lieberman ’s saber rattling against Yemen is “ likely to be echoed in the days ahead as a growing number of neoconservative and conservative foreign policy voices have used the attempted airline attack to call into question the tactics Obama has applied to curb terrorism , ” Sam Stein added .
In a borderline - livid post , Firedoglake writer Spencer Ackerman assailed Lieberman ’s hawkish stance .
“ Is it a mistake to respond to this with more than ridicule ?
Maybe , but if not : it ’s a ludicrously blithe and cost - free assertion to say that we need to take preemptive action in Yemen .
What the fuck does Joe Lieberman know about Yemen ?
What does anyone in the Washington policy community know about Yemen ?
Fucking nothing except that ( a ) there is an apparently growing al - Qaeda presence there ; Abdulmutallab told investigators that he got hooked up with his botched explosive there ; the USS Cole was bombed there ; there ’s an important port there ; and … that ’s it . ”

“ The good news is that while progressives basically need Joe Lieberman ’s vote in the Senate to pass domestic legislation , thus giving him a ton of leverage over what happens , nobody needs to listen to him about Yemen , ” blogger Matt Yglesias opined .

Defender nearing return after metatarsal injury
Arsenal full - back Kieran Gibbs has targeted a return to full fitness a month ahead of schedule .
The 20 - year - old has not played since a UEFA Champions League win over Standard Liege in November , in which he picked up a fractured metatarsal .
Gibbs was expected to spend three months on the sidelines but , after stepping up his recovery programme , he admits he can now focus on regaining his match fitness .
" I feel fine at the minute , and have been doing some work in the gym , " Gibbs told .
" Hopefully if the results come back okay , I can get on and really start getting [ match ] fit again . "
The injury is the first serious one of the youngster 's career and although he admits he has found it tough , returning to the club 's training ground has helped his state of mind .
" I did not deal with it that well , because this is my first time I have been out for a long time , " he added .
" But your friends and family are there , and they help you get through it .
" I have been into the training ground recently , and seen a lot of the players .
It is good when you are around the team .
" To come back into the changing room , to get involved again makes you feel back at home . "

Presentation Summary “ High Performance at Massive Scale : Lessons Learned at Facebook ”
Recently , we were fortunate to host Jeff Rothschild , the Vice President of Technology at Facebook , for a visit for the CNS lecture series .
Jeff ’s talk , “ High Performance at Massive Scale : Lessons Learned at Facebook ” was highly detailed , providing real insights into the Facebook architecture .
Jeff spoke to a packed house of faculty , staff , and students interested in the technology and research challenges associated with running and Internet service at scale .
The talk is archived here as part of the CNS lecture series .
I encourage you to check it out ; below are my notes on the presentation .
Site Statistics :
Facebook is the # 2 property on the Internet as measured by the time users spend on the site .
Over 200 billion monthly page views .
> 3.9 trillion feed actions proceessed per day .
Over 15,000 websites use Facebook content
In 2004 , the shape of the curve plotting user population as a function of time showed exponential growth to 2 M users .
5 years later they have stayed on the same exponetial curve with > 300 M users .
Facebook is a global site , with 70 % of users outside of the US .
Today , there are 1.3B people in the world who have quality Internet connectivity , so there is at least another factor of 4 growth that Facebook is going after .
Jeff presented statistics for the number of users that each engineer supports at a variety of high - profile Internet companies : 1.1 M for Facebook , 190,000 Google , 94,000 Amazon , 75,000 Microsoft .
Photo sharing on Facebook :
Facebook stores 20 billion photos in 4 resolutions
2 - 3 billion new photos uploaded every month
Originally provisioned photo storage for 6 months , but blew through available storage in 1.5 weeks .
Facebook serves 600 k photos / second –> serving them is more difficult than storing them .
Scaling photos , first the easy way :
Upload tier : handles uploads , scales the images , sotres on NFS tier
Serving tier : Images are served from NFS via HTTP
NFS Storage tier built from commercial products
Filesystems are n’t really good at supporting large numbers of files
Scaling photos , 2nd generation :
Cachr : cache the high volume smaller images to offload the main storage systems .
Only 300 M images in 3 resolutions
Distribute these through a CDN to reduce network latency .
Cache them in memory .
Scaling photos , 3rd Generation System : Haystack
How many IO ’s do you need to serve an image ?
Originally , 10 I /O ’s at Facebook because of the complex directory structure .
Optimizations got it down to 2 - 4 IOs per file served
Facebook built a better version called Haystack by merging multiple files into a single large file .
In the common case , serving a photo now requires 1 I/O operation .
Haystack is available as open source .
Facebook architecture consists of :
Load balancers as front end requests are distributed to Web Servers retrieve actual content from a large memcached layer because of the latency requirements for individual requests .
Presentation Layer employs PHP
Simple to learn : small set of expressions and statements
Simple to write : loose typing and universal “ array ”
Simple to read
But this comes at a cost :
High CPU and memory consumption .
C++ Interoperability Challenging .
PHP does not encourage good programming in the large ( at 3 M lines of code it is a significant organizational challenge ) .
Initialization cost of each page scales with size of code base
Thus Facebook engineers undertook implementing optimizations to PHP :
Lazy loading
Cache priming
More efficient locking semantics for variable cache
Memcache client extension
Asynchrnous event - handling
Back - end services that require the performance are implemente in C++.
Services Philosophy :
Create a service iff required .
Real overhead for deployment , maintenance , separate code base .
Another failure point .
Create a common framework and toolset that will allow for easier creation of services :
Thrift ( open source ) .
A number of things break at scale , one example : syslog
Became impossible to push large amounts of data through the logging infrastructure .
Implemented Scribe for logging .
Today , Scribe processes 25 TB of messages / day .
Site Architecture
Overall , Facebook currently runs approximately 30 k servers , with the bulk of them acting as web servers .
The Facebook Web Server , running PHP , is responsible for retrieving all of the data required to compose the web page .
The data itself is stored authoritatively in a large cluster of MySQL servers .
However , to hit performance targets , most of the data is also stored in memory across an array of memcached servers .
For traditional websites , each user interacts with his or her own data .
And for most web sites , only 1 - 2 % of registered users concurrently access the site at any given time .
Thus , the site only needs to cache 1 - 2 % of all data in RAM .
However , data at Facebook is deeply interconnected ; each user is interested in the state of hundreds of other users .
Hence , even with only 1 - 2 % of the user population at any given time , virtually all data must still be available in RAM .
Memcache
Data partitioning was easy when Facebook was a college web site , simply partition data at the level of individual colleges .
After considering a variety of data clustering algorithms , found that there was very little win for the additional complexity of clustering .
So at Facebook , user data is randomly partitioned across indiviual databases and machines across the cluster .
Hence , each user access requires retrieving data corresponding to user state spread across hundreds of machines .
Intra-cluster network performance is hence critical to site performance .
Facebook employs memcache to store the vast majority of user data in memory spread across thousands of machines in the cluster .
In essence , nodes maintain a distributed hash table to determine the machine responsible for a particular users data .
Hot data from MySQL is stored in the cache .
The cache supports get / set / incr / decr and
multiget / multiset operations .
Initially , the architecture needed to support 15 - 20 k requests / sec / machine but that number has scaled to approximately 250k requests / sec / machine today .
Servers have gotten faster to keep up to some but Facebook engineers also had to perform some fundamental re-engineering of memcached to improve its performance .
System performance improved from 50 k requests / sec / machine to 150 k to 200 k to 250k by adding multithreading , polling device drivers , stats locking , and batched packet handling respectively .
In aggregate , Memcache at Facebook processes in 120 M requests / sec .
Incast
One networking challenge with memcached was so - called Network Incast .
A front - end web server would collect responses from hundreds of memcache machines in parallel to compose an individual HTTP response .
All responses would come back within the same approximately 40 microsecond window .
Hence , while overall network utilization was low at Facebook , even at short time scales , there were significant , correlated packet losses at very fine timescales .
These microbursts overflowed the limited packet buffering in commodity switches ( see my earlier post for more discussion on this issue ) .
To deal with the significant slow down that resulted by synchronized loss in relatively small TCP windows , Facebook built a custom congestion - aware UDP - based transport that managed congestion across multiple requests rather than within a single connection .
This optimization allowed Facebook to avoid the , for example , 200 ms timeouts associated with the loss of an entire window ’s worth of data in TCP .
Authoritative Storage
Authoritative Facebook data is stored in a pool of MySQL servers .
The overall experience with MySQL has been very positive at Facebook , with thousands of MySQL servers in multiple datacenters .
It is simple , fast , and reliable .
Facebook currently has 8,000 server - yearas of runtime experience without data loss or corruption .
Facebook has learned a number of lessons about data management :
Shared architecture should be avoided ; there are no joins in the code .
Storing dynamically changing data in a central database should be avoided .
Similarly , heavily - referenced static data should not be stored in a central database .
There are a number of challenges with MySQL as well , including :
Logical migration of data is very difficult .
Creating a large number of logical dbs , load balance them over varying number of physical nodes .
Easier to scale CPU on web tier than on the DB tier .
Data driven schemas make for happy programmers and difficult operations .
Lots of examples of Facebook ’s contribution back to open source here .
Given its global user population , Facebook eventually had to move to replicating its content across multiple data centers .
Facebook now runs two large data centers , one on the West coast of the US and one on the East coast .
However , this introduces the age - old problem of data consistency .
Facebook adopts a primary / slave replication scheme where the West coast MySQL replicas are the authoritative stores for data .
All updates are applied to these master replicas and asynchronously replicated to the slaves on the East coast .
However , without synchronous updates , consecutive requests to the same data item from the same user can return inconsistent or stale results .
The approach taken at Facebook is to set a cookie on user update requests that will redirect all subsequent requests from that user to the West coast master for some configurable time period to ensure that read operations do not return inconsistent results .
More details on this approach is detailed on the Facebook blog
Areas for future research at Facebook :
Load balancing
Middle tier : balance between programmer productivity and machine efficiency
Graph - based caching and storage systems
Search relevance via the social graph
Object discovery and ranking
Storage systems
Personalization
Jeff also relayed an interesting philosophy from Mark Zuckerberg : “ Work fast and do n’t be afraid to break things . ”
Overall , the idea to avoid working cautiously the entire year , delivering rock - solid code , but not much of it .
A corollary : if you take the entire site down , it ’s not the end of your career .
Roughly a third of the US ' carbon dioxide emissions come from burning petroleum products in vehicles , a habit that also has significant implications for foreign policy and public health .
The government and automakers have agreed to significant increases in fuel economy , a change that some of them intend to meet in part through the development of plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) , which can complete short trips without burning any gasoline .
But a report from the National Academies of Science suggests that getting these vehicles to market in significant numbers faces a series of challenges , and that it may take decades before PHEVs have a significant impact if fuel prices stay low .
The report was prepared by a committee that was initially assembled to evaluate hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ; once that was complete , the Department of Energy asked them to also consider PHEVs , since much of the data on fuel efficiency and consumption of existing vehicles is relevant to both problems .
The authors consider two types of PHEV .
One is a short - range PHEV - 10 , which would be similar to a plugin Prius that can go 10 miles on battery alone before switching to hybrid mode .
The second is a longer - range vehicle that 's similar to the Chevy Volt .
That can go about 40 miles before its engine kicks in , and said engine never drives the wheels directly ; instead , it simply powers an on - board generator to recharge the batteries .
In either case , both suffer from the same problem , namely that we should n't expect any major breakthroughs in battery technology .
As far as the committee could determine , any PHEVs likely to reach the market in the next few decades will be using some form of lithium battery , which ( thanks to its heavy use in personal electronics ) is already mature technology .
Any changes , in terms of cost , weight , charge density , etc. , are likely to be incremental .
The same goes for just about any other key component .
We 're already pretty good at building generators and electric motors , so we can't expect any breakthroughs there .
But it 's really the batteries that will be the biggest barrier to adoption for a simple reason : price .
The PHEV - 10's battery currently adds $ 3,300 to the price of the car , and the battery of a PHEV - 40 adds a whopping $ 18,000 .
Since change will be incremental , the report estimates that it will still be costing $ 11,000 in 2030 under likely estimates of battery progress ; even in its optimistic scenario , the battery will still be pushing up the price tag by $ 9,000 .
Ouch .
( The costs do n't end there , either .
For a reasonable rate of charge , people will have to install 220V , 40A outlets in their garages . )
Because of the price barrier and the slow turnover of the total vehicle fleet , the most optimistic estimates are that only 13 percent of the US ' total vehicles will be PHEV by 2030 , and a more realistic estimate is for less than half that value .
Worse still , unless the price of gasoline stabilizes at over $ 4.00 a gallon , PHEV - 40s wo n't be cost effective until sometime in the 2040s ( PHEV - 10s will get there before 2030 ) .
The only way to drive their adoption in the interim will be some sort of incentive ; the report estimates that up to $ 300 billion will be needed to push any sort of accelerated adoption .
Although it 's not discussed by the report , an obvious issue is whether the expected technical developments will actually occur if there are n't sufficient expectations of future sales .
Because of the slow pace of adoption , PHEVs are expected to have a negligible impact on oil use prior to 2030 .
And , once adoption rates are higher , they wo n't necessarily have a large impact on CO 2 emissions unless the electric grid is substantially decarbonized in the meantime , either through nuclear and / or renewables , or by sequestering some of the emissions from the coal plants that currently produce half the US ' electricity .
Getting the electricity to the vehicles will also require some changes , as many areas of the country are already at grid capacity during peak usage hours .
Unless there 's some pricing incentive that encourages most people to charge their vehicles at night , PHEVs will put an uncomfortable strain on the grid .
So , given this grim picture , it might be tempting to question whether it 's worth going this route at all .
But the committee points out that the US has very little in the way of options for reducing its reliance on oil imports , so it really has to work on having all of its bases covered if it 's serious about doing so .
Although the individual effects are much smaller , combining PHEVs with biofuels and increased efficiency in conventional vehicles would be sufficient to drop US gasoline use to less than five percent of what it would be otherwise by 2050 .
Unfortunately , it will be decades before significant differences in oil use become apparent , and require a significant up - front investment in technology and incentives .
A limited oil supply that pushes prices well above $ 4.00 a gallon seems far more likely .
Joe Lieberman may or may not be stupid .
But for threatening to filibuster the Senate health care bill he is most certainly a hypocrite .
Tonight , Rachel Maddow showed that Lieberman railed against filibuster - ing — before he wanted to do it .

Fourteen years ago Nelson Mandela used the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite black and white South Africans .
A film based on the historic event , Invictus , opens on Friday and has raised the question :
Has the dream of transformation lived on ?
Both the film and the book on which it is based - John Carlin 's Playing the Enemy - have a fairytale ending , but this is not necessarily the case for South Africa today .
You knew that white is right and black is wrong , and then all of a sudden white is wrong and black is right
Marguerite Wheatley
Actress Today 's racial tensions are a lot more subtle .
Most black and white South Africans have embraced each other 's differences but every once in a while the country 's apartheid past rears its ugly head .
When political leaders fail to agree , they often accuse each other of being racists .
Elusive dream
But jobs previously reserved for white people are now accessible to blacks .
White and black South Africans can socialise without fear of victimisation .
RAINBOW NATION ? 24 % of South Africans do not speak to people of other races on a typical day 46 % " never socialise " with people of other races in their own homes or friends ' homes 39 % find people of other races " untrustworthy " 59 % said they found it " difficult to understand the customs and ways " of people of other races Source : Institute for Justice and Reconciliation
There are no " whites only " or " blacks only " signs hanging in restaurants , on buses , on beaches or airports .
But a new study suggests that much work needs to be done to achieve the goal of a " rainbow nation " .
The study by the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation used a sample of 3,500 people .
According to the survey , 24 % of South Africans said that they never spoke to people of other races on a typical day .
And 46 % admitted to " never socialising " with people of other races in their own homes or friends ' homes .
Mr Mandela used rugby to preach transformation and reconciliation to South Africans - it was one of the first fruits of his " rainbow nation " .
But still rugby remains a predominantly white man 's sport .
And equally football remains a predominately black sport .
So have South Africans forgotten Mr Mandela 's message ?
Work in progress South African actress Marguerite Wheatley , who plays the wife of former national rugby captain Francois Pienaar ( played by Matt Damon ) , was 14 years old when South Africa played New Zealand in the momentous final .
She says she was " oblivious " to apartheid South Africa and what the rugby match meant to the dream of a " new South Africa " .
You feel that there is still this sense of promise [ in South Africa ]
Morgan Freeman
" Then you knew that white is right and black is wrong , and then all of a sudden white is wrong and black is right so it was very confusing for me as a teenager , " she says .
" For us young people it was easier to accept each other .
I can't remember much about apartheid [ but ]
I know that when apartheid fell , they were saying ' Our country has gone to the dogs ' . "
Wheatley says although South Africa was brought together " forcefully " most South Africans are looking at working together to continue building the nation .
" We 're figuring out , we 're sorting it out , " she says .
Hollywood star Morgan Freeman , who has visited the country a number of times , says there is still " energy " in South Africa reminiscent of the 1995 World Cup victory .
" I made two visits here , one during the transition when it was so volatile and at Madiba 's 80th birthday I came back and the place was absolutely electric with promise , " says Freeman .
" You do n't feel this electricity right now but you feel the energy , this feeling , sense of promise .
You feel that there is still this sense of promise that now we can get moving . "

Advertisement Film critics are already predicting that the movie will earn Freeman an Oscar .
The actor , who is also one of the film 's executive producers , plays Mr Mandela - a role with the potential to catapult any actor 's career to world acclaim .
Freeman says he was " blessed " to have access to Mr Mandela .
" I studied him ; I had close access to him , " he says speaking about the man he describes " a friend " .
" Not only was I able to look at tapes and get mannerisms and the walk , I was able to sit and hold his hand and talk to him . "
Freeman says one of the challenges of accurately portraying Mr Mandela was learning how to speak like him .
" Nobody else sounds like him ; it 's a very distinctive voice , so I had to work on that , " he says .
Complaints
The film is directed by veteran actor Clint Eastwood and includes a local and international film crew .
In recent weeks , local actors ' unions have complained about Hollywood actors playing lead roles in films portraying South African icons and say South Africans should play more prominent roles in big productions .
But producers argue that using well - known names draws in crowds and goes a long way to ensuring the film 's success .
Invictus has a strong presence of local actors , although they are not playing lead roles .
The name of the film is derived from a poem by William Ernest Henley which Mr Mandela is said to have memorised during his years imprisoned on Robben Island .

Washington , D.C. , police are investigating after Internet videos showed a detective waving his gun during a mass snowball fight on a city street .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Washington 's police chief criticized a veteran detective Monday for pulling a gun during a mass snowball fight .
Authorities said the officer is on desk duty while the case is under investigation .
Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said she had watched video clips from the weekend confrontation and has no doubt that the off - duty officer pulled his gun after snowballs hit his personal vehicle during Saturday 's record snowfall .
" Let me be very clear in stating that I believe the actions of the officer were totally inappropriate ! "
Lanier said in a statement .
" In no way should he have handled the situation in this manner . "
Hundreds of people were gathered for the snowball fight on a major street during Saturday 's snowstorm .

One video posted on YouTube showed a man holding what appears to be a gun in the snowy street .
Another video shows the same man telling people he is " Detective Baylor " and that he pulled his gun because he was hit by snowballs .
Videos also show a uniformed police officer holding his gun by his side before holstering it again .
Police said in a statement Sunday that the uniformed policeman was there in response to a call about an armed man , acted appropriately and did not point his weapon at anyone .
Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Monday that the detective has been placed on desk duty and his badge and weapon have been withdrawn .
He did not identify the officer but described him as a veteran detective with more than 25 years of experience .
" He has a very good reputation , " he said .
Newsham said the internal affairs division wants to complete its investigation as quickly as possible , within a number of weeks .
" We have to put the whole incident into context , " he said .
There could be a recommendation to discipline the detective , which could range from a reprimand to removal , he said .
Police have at least two videos of the incident , and Newsham said there could be more as the footage shows other people with cellphones and cameras .
Police are working to obtain any additional material and will continue to speak to witnesses .
He asked people to contact police if they have more footage or to make a report about it .
It 's unclear why the officer stopped in the first place , Newsham said .
There were no arrests , he said .
Newsham praised the work of other officers who arrived at the scene and de-escalated the situation .
He called the incident " very disappointing " as video of it garnered national attention after circulating on the Internet .
" It does bring a negative light " on the department , he said .
Newsham said the incident detracts from the work that day of hundreds of officers who helped people in the snow and directed traffic .

NBC is reporting that several workers at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia were fired for refusing to get vaccinated .
CHP cares for very sick children , many of whom have compromised immune systems or are too young to get vaccinated .
The twist ?
Some of the employees refused vaccinations for religious reasons :
" I am a Christian , and my religion prohibits me from receiving vaccines , " said Tyrika Cowlay , who was a lab technician .
First and foremost , this is n't a religious issue .
It 's a safety issue .
I mean , c'mon .
We know vaccinations prevent the spread of diseases , especially among children , and even more so among those who are too young to be vaccinated themselves -- herd immunity is all those infants have .
Second , I 'm thinking that if your religion forbids you from vaccinations ( and to my knowledge , mainstream Christianity does not preclude them ) , then maybe a children 's hospital is n't the best line of work for you ( any more than an orthdox Jew should work at a pork rendering factory ) .
That may seem harsh , but let 's replace a few words in the linked article and see how you feel :
Several Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia employees were fired for refusing to wash their hands after using the bathroom .
The people who were let go said this year is the first that the hospital has mandated hand washing .
" I never thought that not washing my hands after I used the toilet would result in the loss of my job , " said [ one of the workers who was let go ] .
Imagine someone at a hospital claiming their religion says they can't wash their hands !
If I saw a hospital employee leave the bathroom without washing , I 'd file a complaint instantly .
I have no qualms with the hospital making vaccinations a mandatory requirement .
However , one issue raised in the article is that some employees were granted exemption from the vaccinations and some were n't .
If that 's true , it 's unfair .
No one should be exempted due to their beliefs .
There .
Problem solved .
So while I 'm sorry these people had to be let go , I will always choose children 's safety over someone 's religious or personal beliefs .
Always .
Tip o' the syringe to Matt Andrews .
With the price of gold near a record high , it 's an offer that 's hard to ignore : send us your unwanted jewellery and we 'll send you a cheque straight back .
Over the last year there 's been an boom in the number of shops and websites offering to take those old rings and trinkets off your hands .
But Newsbeat 's found out that some of the biggest names in the industry are paying just a fraction of the amount that gold could be worth if it was taken to a jeweller or pawnbroker .
" Some of the quotes are just shockingly low , " said Alonso Ercilla from the Trading Standards Institute .
" It boils down to shopping around because , in theory , traders can just offer what they want . "
' Thought it was a joke '
29 - year - old Nic from Huddersfield wanted to sell four of her old rings to raise money for Christmas presents .
I was just shocked .
I was hoping for something around the £ 200 mark Nic , Huddersfield
" I was off work poorly and the adverts were all over daytime TV .
I thought it would give me a bit of extra money , " she said .
Nic went online and ordered a free postal packet .
She sent the rings off and waited a couple of weeks .
Then a quote came back for just £ 27 .
" I was just shocked .
I was hoping for something around the £ 200 mark , " she said .
" I sent them an email asking if it was a misprint .
The valuation was so low I thought it was missing a digit . "
She asked for her rings back and was later quoted £ 125 from a local company in Huddersfield offering a similar cash - in service .
What 's it worth ?
We wanted to try it out for ourselves so asked Tony Jarvis , an independent gold bullion dealer in Mayfair , London , to value a bunch of old earrings , chains and lockets .
He told us that a " fair price " for the nine carat scrap gold would be around £ 300 , although daily variations in the gold price could push that number up or down slightly .
We double - checked and took the gold anonymously to a number of shops in London 's famous old jewellery market , Hatton Garden , specialising in scrap metal .
Sure enough , the best price we were offered was £ 318 .
We then sent exactly the same set of rings and chains to three of the biggest players in the postal market .
American giant Cash4Gold has grown quickly off the back of heavy TV advertising , including expensive primetime slots in this year 's US Superbowl .
It claims that 94 % of its 900,000 customers in the US accept the valuation they are offered .
The firm is now expanding internationally and opened its British operation over the summer .
Customers call a telephone helpline or log on to the firm 's website and order a free gold pack containing a pre-paid envelope .
As with all the other firms featured here , the value of the package is insured up to £ 500 .
You drop in your old jewellery , fill out a basic form and put it in the post box .
Staff at the firm 's British headquarters value the metal and a week or so later send you a cheque back which you can either bank or return within 12 days to get your jewellery back .
' Hassle - free '
So how did Cash4 Gold compare with our " fair valuation " of £ 300 ?
The firm sent us a cheque for just £ 63 .
When we called to ask for our jewellery back that offer was increased to £ 100 .
The firm 's boss , Jeff Aronson , makes no apologies for pricing , claiming that some people are willing to accept less for their gold in return for convenience and speed .
" Our customers are not interested in going to a pawnshop or a jewellery store , " he said .
" They would be mortified if a friend saw them doing that .
We are serving a new industry that we have created .
We are not here to price fight against a jeweller . "
Crewe - based CashMyGold is the most high profile British company in the market .
Like its American namesake it spends heavily on advertising , especially on daytime TV .
It works in an identical way : users call or go online , order an envelope , post off their gold and wait for the cheque to arrive .
We offer a fair price for those who are looking for a hassle free , door - to - door service CashMyGold statement
The company uses the slogan " best prices paid for your gold " but its offer was the lowest of the three at just £ 60.20 .
We called to ask for our jewellery back and a sales rep immediately offered to increase the offer to " £ 150 maximum " .
In a statement the firm said it has a " very different business model " to high street gold dealers with " different costs such as postal insurance and administration " to consider .
" Taking this into account , we believe we offer a fair price for those who are looking for a hassle free , door - to - door service , " it said .
Finally high street jeweller H.Samuel launched its own postal gold service over the summer .
Unlike other firms , it always telephones customers to ask if they will accept an offer rather than sending a cheque straight back .
Its quote ?
The highest of the three at £ 182 rising to £ 210 if we agreed to take gift vouchers instead of a cheque , still significantly below the £ 300 quoted by our gold bullion dealer .
Again the firm claimed its offers are fair .
" By using our service customers are dealing with a well - known and established high street jeweller with national store coverage , " it said .
" If the customer does not want to accept our offer the jewellery is returned at no cost to them . "
' Shop around '
We put the findings to the Trading Standards Institute .
Its joint lead officer for fair trading , Alonso Ercilla , said offering a low price for gold might be irritating but it 's not illegal .
" Unfortunately there is n't much Trading Standards can do if people are getting a bad deal , provided the trader is not actually misleading the seller about the gold 's worth , " he said .
" Customers need to shop around and try to establish the price per gram .
" If you are using a website , read their terms and conditions .
And do n't automatically take the first price you are offered . "
Loneliness , like a bad cold , can spread among groups of people , research at the University of Chicago , the University of California - San Diego and Harvard shows .
Using longitudinal data from a large - scale study that has been following health conditions for more than 60 years , a team of scholars found that lonely people tend to share their loneliness with others .
Gradually over time , a group of lonely , disconnected people moves to the fringes of social networks .
" We detected an extraordinary pattern of contagion that leads people to be moved to the edge of the social network when they become lonely , " said University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo , one member of the study team and one of the nation 's leading scholars of loneliness .
" On the periphery people have fewer friends , yet their loneliness leads them to losing the few ties they have left . "
Other members of the study team were James Fowler , Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of California - San Diego , and Nicholas Christakis , Professor of Medicine and Professor of Medical Sociology in the Harvard Medical School .
Before relationships are severed , people on the periphery transmit feelings of loneliness to their remaining friends , who also become lonely .
" These reinforcing effects mean that our social fabric can fray at the edges , like a yarn that comes loose at the end of a crocheted sweater , " said Cacioppo , the Tiffany & Margaret Blake Distinguished Service Professor in Psychology .
Because loneliness is associated with a variety of mental and physical diseases that can shorten life , Cacioppo said it is important for people to recognize loneliness and help those people connect with their social group before the lonely individuals move to the edges .

The scholars ' findings were published in the article , " Alone in the Crowd : The Structure and Spread of Loneliness in a Large Social Network , " published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
For the study , the team examined records of the Framingham Heart Study , which has studied people in Framingham , Mass . since 1948 .
The original group , including more than 5,209 people , was originally studied for the risks of cardiovascular disease .
The study has since been expanded to include about 12,000 people , as the children and the grandchildren of the original group and others have been included to diversify the population sample .
The Framingham study now includes more tests , including measures of loneliness and depression .
The second generation in the study , which includes 5,124 people , was the focus of the loneliness research .
Because the study is longitudinal , researchers kept in touch with the subjects every two to four years and accordingly collected names of friends who knew the subjects .
Those records became an excellent source of information about the people 's social networks .
By constructing graphs that charted the subjects ' friendship histories and information about their reports of loneliness , researchers were able to establish a pattern of loneliness that spread as people reported fewer close friends .
The data showed that lonely people " infected " the people around them with loneliness , and those people moved to the edges of social circles .
advertisement
The team found that the next - door neighbors in the survey who experienced an increase of one day of loneliness a week prompted an increase in loneliness among their neighbors who were their close friends .
The loneliness spread as the neighbors spent less time together .
Previous work suggested that women rely on emotional support more than men do , and in this study women were more likely than men to report " catching " loneliness from others .
People 's chances of becoming lonely were more likely to be caused by changes in friendship networks than changes in family networks .
Research also shows that as people become lonely , they become less trustful of others , and a cycle develops that makes it harder for them to form friendships .
Societies seem to develop a natural tendency to shed these lonely people , something that is mirrored in tests of monkeys , who tend to drive off members of their groups who have been removed from a colony and then reintroduced , Cacioppo said .
That pattern makes it all the more important to recognize loneliness and deal with it before it spreads , he said .
" Society may benefit by aggressively targeting the people in the periphery to help repair their social networks and to create a protective barrier against loneliness that can keep the whole network from unraveling , " he said .
The research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging .
" Previous research has shown that loneliness and lack of social connection can have a significant negative effect on the overall health and well - being of older people , " said Richard Suzman , Ph.D. , director of the NIA 's Division of Behavioral and Social Research , which funded the research .
" This pioneering research into the connections of individuals within their social networks has important implications for the larger issue of social interactions and health . "
AT&T : The most hated company in iPhone land
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Consumer outrage about AT&T's 3G service for iPhones is boiling over , but the dropped calls and spotty service reflect a greater lack of foresight in the wireless industry .
Analysts say AT&T 's problems would have happened on any network that carried Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iPhone because of the overwhelming amount of data downloaded by iPhone users .
Over the past three years , AT&T 's data traffic increased 5,000 % because of the iPhone .
" The challenges that AT&T has are being faced by a lot of operators around the world : Very rapidly growing usage coupled with dense populations , " said Daniel Hays , wireless expert and partner at consultancy PRTM .
" Would it have been different on Verizon ?
Probably not . "
AT&T accurately states that it has the nation 's fastest 3G network but it " probably bit off more than it could chew , " said Doug Helmreich , program director at consultancy CFI Group .
" Now some of their customers are paying the price . "
IPhone users in New York and San Francisco in particular have been up in arms about frequent service interruptions .
Earlier this month , AT&T 's head of mobility , Ralph de la Vega , admitted at an investors ' conference that the company 's service in those two cities was " below our standards . "
It 's not just New York and San Francisco iPhone users who are grumbling .
An annual Consumer Reports study recently rated AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) the worst in customer satisfaction in 19 cities across the country .
( Rival Verizon Wireless rated No. 1 in the study . )
In nearly three - quarters of the surveyed areas , AT&T was rated lowest for availability of service , frequency of dropped calls and quality of voice service .
Verizon vs. AT&T
Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) has had a field day at AT&T's expense .
" There 's a map for that " commercials have poked fun at AT&T 's smaller 3G footprint .
And that has helped Verizon take market share , according to Piper Jaffray .
But studies show that AT&T 's network is actually faster than Verizon's , and Verizon 's ad campaign may be a bit misleading .
Four recent independent studies from wireless industry analysis firms Global Wireless Solutions and Root Wireless , investment bank Piper Jaffray and tech blog Gizmodo all concluded that AT&T's 3G network was the fastest in the United States .
" We drove millions of miles across the country , and our data support AT&T 's claim that it has the fastest 3G data network , " said Global Wireless CEO Paul Carter .
The map that Verizon shows in its ads is correct , but AT&T 's 3G network still covers nearly 80 % of the U.S. population , said Carter .
And AT&T's non -3G coverage is also broader than its 3G network .
With that kind of pedigree , analysts say AT&T was likely the best - equipped network to handle the iPhone .
" For Verizon ... we still wonder if the network has the capacity and backhaul to support a device with an adoption curve of the iPhone , " said Piper Jaffray analyst Chris Larsen in a client note .
Perception vs. reality
AT&T admits that it has had problems keeping up with the data demands of iPhone users , which has prompted the company to accelerate scheduled improvements in its network .
" There 's more work to be done and a sense of urgency to do it , but we feel like we 're on the right track with our investments , " said Fletcher Cook , spokesman for AT&T .
In the next few years , AT&T said it would double its network speed , and Cook said AT&T has already improved overall network quality by 25 % .
The company has also deployed more than 20,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across the country , which it says may help alleviate stress on its 3G network .
PRTM's
Hays applauded the Wi-Fi solution and AT&T 's dedication to improving its network , calling them " critical levers in addressing AT&T 's network performance issues . "
He expects AT&T to go even further , perhaps by integrating tiered data plans that would force iPhone users to pay for the data they download .
Still , perception has hurt AT&T .
AT&T 's network is the No. 1 hangup for people who are in the market for an iPhone , according to a CFI Group study .
The company 's woes have even become the butt of jokes on late - night TV .
" It was reported this week that Google would soon launch its own cell phone as a challenge to the iPhone , " said " Saturday Night Live 's " Seth Meyers on Dec. 19 .
" Also a challenge to the iPhone ?
Making phone calls . "
The building frustrations led some angry consumers to take matters into their own hands .
" Operation Chokehold , " which took place on Dec. 18 , was an attempt to overload AT&T 's network by running data - intensive apps to try and send a message that consumers " are sick of their substandard network . "
The ploy failed .
" Unfortunately for AT&T , when it comes to network quality , perception is reality and right now Verizon has a more positive public perception , " said Larsen .
" If AT&T can continue to show improvement in network throughput , it may blunt some of the impact . "
Tony Blair used " deceit " to persuade parliament and the British people to support war in Iraq , Sir Ken Macdonald , the former director of public prosecutions , said today .
In an article in the Times , Macdonald attacked Blair for engaging in " alarming subterfuge " , for displaying " sycophancy " towards George Bush and for refusing to accept that his decisions were wrong .
Macdonald 's comments about Blair 's decision to go to war are more critical than anything that has been said so far by any of the senior civil servants who worked in Whitehall when Blair was prime minister .
Macdonald was DPP from 2003 until 2008 and he now practises law from Matrix Chambers , where Blair 's barrister wife , Cherie , is also based .
In his article Macdonald highlighted a remark Blair made in an interview broadcast yesterday about supporting the overthrow of Saddam Hussein regardless of whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction to explain why he thought the former prime minister was guilty of deceit .
But Macdonald also expressed concerns about the Iraq inquiry , suggesting that some of its questioning so far had been " unchallenging " and that Sir John Chilcot and his team would be held in " contempt " if they failed to uncover the truth about the war .
Macdonald wrote : " The degree of deceit involved in our decision to go to war on Iraq becomes steadily clearer .
This was a foreign policy disgrace of epic proportions , and playing footsie on Sunday morning television does nothing to repair the damage .
" It is now very difficult to avoid the conclusion that Tony Blair engaged in an alarming subterfuge with his partner , George Bush , and went on to mislead and cajole the British people into a deadly war they had made perfectly clear they did n't want , and on a basis that it 's increasingly hard to believe even he found truly credible . "
Macdonald said that Blair 's fundamental flaw was his " sycophancy towards power " and that he could not resist the " glamour " he attracted in Washington .
" In this sense he was weak and , as we can see , he remains so , " Macdonald went on .
" Since those sorry days we have frequently heard him repeating the self - regarding mantra that ' hand on heart , I only did what I thought was right ' .
But this is a narcissist 's defence , and self - belief is no answer to misjudgment : it is certainly no answer to death . "
Macdonald said that , with the exceptions of some of the interventions from Sir Roderic Lyne , the questions asked when the Chilcot inquiry has been taking evidence from witnesses have been tame .
" If this is born of a belief that it creates an atmosphere more conducive to truth , it seems naive .
The truth does n't always glide out so compliantly ; sometimes it struggles to be heard , " Macdonald said .
Many commentators have criticised the fact that all members of the Chilcot team are establishment figures – Chilcot himself is a former permanent secretary – and Macdonald said the inquiry needed to prove its independence .
" In British public life , loyalty and service to power can sometimes count for more to insiders than any tricky questions of wider reputation .
It 's the regard you are held in by your peers that really counts , so that steadfastness in the face of attack and threatened exposure brings its own rich hierarchy of honour and reward .
" Disloyalty , on the other hand , means a terrible casting out , a rocky and barren Roman exile that few have the courage to endure . "
Macdonald said Chilcot and his team needed to tell the truth without fear of offending the Whitehall establishment .
" If Chilcot fails to reveal the truth without fear in this Middle Eastern story of violence and destruction , the inquiry will be held in deserved and withering contempt , " Macdonald said .
Yesterday , in an interview with Fern Britton broadcast on BBC1 , Blair said he would have backed an attack on Iraq even if he had known that Saddam had no WMD .
" If you had known then that there were no WMDs , would you still have gone on ? "
Blair was asked .
He replied : " I would still have thought it right to remove him [ Saddam Hussein ] " .
Blair added : " I mean obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments about the nature of the threat . "
Tapping into drones ' video feeds was just the start .
The U.S. military 's primary system for bringing overhead surveillance down to soldiers and Marines on the ground is also vulnerable to electronic interception , multiple military sources tell Danger Room .
That means militants have the ability to see through the eyes of all kinds of combat aircraft – from traditional fighters and bombers to unmanned spy planes .
The problem is in the process of being addressed .
But for now , an enormous security breach is even larger than previously thought .
The military initially developed the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver , or ROVER , in 2002 .
The idea was let troops on the ground download footage from Predator drones and AC - 130 gunships as it was being taken .
Since then , nearly every airplane in the American fleet – from F - 16 and F / A - 18 fighters to A - 10 attack planes to Harrier jump jets to B - 1B bombers has been outfitted with equipment that lets them transmit to ROVERs .
Thousands of ROVER terminals have been distributed to troops in Afghanistan and Iraq .
But those early units were " fielded so fast that it was done with an unencrypted signal .
It could be both intercepted ( e.g. hacked into ) and jammed , " e-mails an Air Force officer with knowledge of the program .
In a presentation last month before a conference of the Army Aviation Association of America , a military official noted that the current ROVER terminal " receives only unencrypted L , C , S , Ku [ satellite ] bands . "
So the same security breach that allowed insurgent to use satellite dishes and $ 26 software to intercept drone feeds can be used the tap into the video transmissions of any plane .
The military is working to plug the hole – introducing new ROVER models that communicate without spilling its secrets .
" Recognizing the potential for future exploitation the Air Force has been working aggressively to encrypt these ROVER downlink signals .
It is my understanding that we have already developed the technical encryption solutions and are fielding them , " the Air Force officer notes .
But it wo n't be easy .
An unnamed Pentagon official tells reporters that " this is an old issue that 's been addressed . "
Air Force officers contacted by Danger Room disagree , strongly .
" This is not a trivial solution , " one officer observes .
" Almost every fighter / bomber / ISR [ intelligence surveillance reconnaissance ] platform we have in theater has a ROVER downlink .
All of our Tactical Air Control Parties and most ground TOCs [ tactical operations centers ] have ROVER receivers .
We need to essentially fix all of the capabilities before a full transition can occur and in the transition most capabilities need to be dual - capable ( encrypted and unencrypted ) . "
Which presents all sorts of problems .
Let 's say a drone or an A - 10 is sent to cover soldiers under fire .
If the aircraft has an encrypted transmitter and the troops have an unencrypted ROVER receiver , that surveillance footage can't be passed down to the soldiers who need it most .
" Can these feeds be encrypted with 99.5 percent chance of no compromise ?
Absolutely !
Can you guarantee that all the encryption keys make it down to the lowest levels in the Army or USMC [ United States Marine Corps ] ?
No way , " adds a second Air Force officer , familiar with the ROVER issue .
" Do they trust their soldiers / Marines with these encryption keys ?
Do n't know that . "
Since the top commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , issued strict new guidelines on the use of airstrikes , the United States has turned nearly every plane in its inventory into an eye in the sky .
Sending video down to those ROVER terminals has become job No. 1 for most American air crews flying today .
And U.S. troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan have come to depend on the feeds .
" For sure , " Lt. Col. Greg Harbin told the* Los Angeles Times * , " I would be dead without this technology . "
Still , some Air Force officers downplayed the significance of the ROVER 's security hole .
" If you 're an insurgent , you need to know when and where [ aircraft ] are flying and then be within the line - of - sight footprint of the feed for any chance of successfully using the information real - time , " one officer writes .
" This is much to do about nothing .
You have bigger fish to fry . "
" The ranges on these signals is not very great , they are low - power and intended for line - of sight communications .
A risk has been identified , [ but ] it poses limited immediate operational or tactical risk , and certainly does not outweigh the value of thee capabilities , " a second notes .
I have immense respect for both of these officers .
But I 'm not sure I buy their arguments .
If real - time video feeds are valuable to U.S. troops , then it stands to reason that the footage is valuable to insurgent forces , as well .
Either this is important data – and worth protecting – or it is n't .
UPDATE : Some military drones are " particularly susceptible " to having their video tapped , a senior military officer tells Danger Room .
That 's because these smaller unmanned aircraft – like the Shadow , Hunter , and Raven – broadcast their surveillance footage constantly and in every direction .
All you have to do , basically , is stand within " line of sight " of the drone , and you can tap in .
" It 's like criminals using radio scanners to pick up police communications , " the senior officer says .
Larger aircraft – both manned and unmanned – are a little less vulnerable .
They can shut off their video feeds if no friendly forces are watching at the time .
And they can " neck down " those omnidirectional signals a bit .
So it 's more difficult to intercept the transmission .
The officer contends that there have " not been any significant – not any impact – on operations as a result of this . "
Still , systems like the ROVER ( and the Predator , for that matter ) were " built to be cheap .
They used commercial off - the - shelf hardware .
We wanted to get stuff out there .
So it 's not gonna be perfect , " the officer adds .
" So yeah , if we 're broadcasting in the electromagnetic spectrum and you 're underneath the footprint , you can receive it .
Duh-uhhhh . "

In an act of uncharacteristic defiance of President Obama , the House Judiciary Committee voted today 16 - 10 to remove the “ lone wolf ” section of the USA PATRIOT Act .
The Justice Department had opposed the move , though it insists that it has never once used the provision .
It has been criticized considerably for granting broad surveillance power against people with no ties to terror groups or even criminal activity .
The Obama Administration has argued that all three expiring provisions of the act needed to be extended , and said they were only willing to consider revisions to allow limited civil rights protections .
Today ’s vote suggests they may face an uphill battle in getting their wish , as while the Republicans on the committee opposed the provision ’s removal , every single member of Obama ’s own party voted against him .
We fight for victims who suffer permanent injuries and for those who need around - the - clock care , or whose lives have been dramatically altered through no fault of their own .
We have built a strong reputation for representing the families of loved ones who have been killed as a result of someone else ’s negligence .
Some of the most serious personal injury claims our Atlanta catastrophic injury lawyers handle include :
Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
This injury often completely changes a person ’s life .
A TBI can cause severe cognitive difficulties , loss of physical function , and many emotional complications .
Spinal cord injuries .
We are experienced at showing that an act of negligence by another party caused loss of motor function , loss of bladder control , changes in sexual function , and other pain and nerve damages .
In the most serious cases , victims can become quadriplegic or paraplegic .
Loss of limb .
Clients who lose an arm or a leg , a hand or a foot , or multiple appendages , suffer physical pain and the inability to perform daily living activities , such as eating or enjoying time with their loved ones .
Some people are permanently unable to return to work .
Prosthetics may be required .
The physical pain is made worse for most patients because it is accompanied by the emotional suffering of disfigurement .
Burn injuries .
First - , second - , and third - degree burns can be caused by an auto or truck accident , accidents at home , or accidents in workplaces such as industrial sites .
Even with surgery , burns often cause scarring and disfigurement .
News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch tells US regulators that users will pay for news – and aggregation is theft
Rupert Murdoch has today reiterated his belief that internet users will pay for content , saying they would be happy to shell out for " information they need to rise in society " .
Murdoch , the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation , gave a wide - ranging address to US media regulators that attacked internet news aggregation as " theft " and claimed that advertising - only business models were dead .
" From the beginning on , newspapers have prospered for one reason : giving readers the news that they want , " he said .
He said newspapers should not blame technology if they failed .
" If we fail , we fail like a restaurant that makes meals that no one wants to eat . "
His company 's customers were " smart enough " to know they had to pay for news , Murdoch told a US Federal Trade Commission workshop on the future of journalism in the internet age .
Referring to his much - criticised plans to put his newspaper sites behind a paywall , Murdoch said he had succeeded before when nobody had believed he would , adding : " We started Fox when everyone said it could n't be done . "
One News Corporation newspaper , the Wall Street Journal , already charges for content and has 1 million subscribers .
" We will expend to extend this model to all our news organisations such as the Times in London .
At the Times , there are journalists who invested days and weeks into their stories , and our customers are smart enough to know that they can't get something for nothing , " he said .
" Producing journalism is expensive .
We invest tremendous resources in our project from technology to our salaries .
To aggregate stories is not fair use .
To be impolite , it is theft .
" Without us , the aggregators would have blank slides .
Right now content producers have all the costs , and the aggregators enjoy [ the benefits ] .
But the principle is clear .
To paraphrase a great economist , [ there is ] no such thing as a free news story . "
Murdoch said that making the reader pay was the only way to create future revenue streams :
" The business model that relies on advertising - only is dead .
Online advertising is increasingly only a fraction of what is being lost from print advertising , and it is under constant pressure . "
Murdoch , who read his speech from printouts and not his laptop at the FTC workshop , announced that News Corporation had worked on a two - year project to spread news content from TV and newspapers to mobile devices , because " today 's news consumers do not want be chained to boxes in their homes " .
He attacked plans to protect newspapers with public funds , saying it could damage democracy .
It would lead to " papers giving up their rights to endorse politicians " .
" In other words , it subsidies their failures .
The press is the only institution that is truly accountable .
The founding fathers put the first amendment first for a reason . "
Murdoch ended his speech with a plea to adhere to a series of clear principles in the digital world .
" Let them innovate when they want and how they want .
Let consumers pay .
Let aggregators desist and start employing their own journalists .
" When we think of the future of newspapers , we think of the future of democracy .
It does n't matter if we are reading our news from paper or on another device , but the basic truth is that to make informed decisions free man and women need news .
If they come on electrons or dead trees is not that important .
Therefore the news industry should remain free and competitive . "
Two men heckled Murdoch as he ended his speech , shouting from the audience : " Do you agree that Obama is a racist ? "
This was a reference to the controversy surrounding Glenn Beck , the presenter on News Corp - owned Fox News , and his controversial criticism of the US president .
Murdoch did not reply as he left the stage at the FTC event and the two men were ushered out quickly .

MY HOPES OF COMPUTING SCIENCE Edsger W.Dijkstra BURROUGHS
Plataanstraat 5
5671 AL Nuenen
The Netherlands
Formulae have always frightened me .
They frightened me , I remember , when I was sixteen and had bought my books for the next year .
I was particularly alarmed by my new book on trigonometry , full of sines , cosines , and Greek letters , and asked my mother — a gifted mathematician — whether trigonometry was difficult .
I gratefully acknowledge her wise answer : " Oh no .
Know your formulae , and always remember that you are on the wrong track when you need more than five lines . "
In retrospect , I think that no other advice has had such a profound influence on my way of working .
A quarter of a century later , formulae still frightened me .
When I saw Hoare 's correctness proof of the procedure " FIND " for the first time , I was horrified , and declared that such a ballet of symbols was not my cup of tea .
And even now my first reaction to formulae , written by someone else , is one of repulsion — in particular when an unfamiliar notational convention is used — and when reading an article , my natural reaction is to skip the formulae .
At the same time I have a warm appreciation for well - designed formalisms that enable me to do things that I could n't possibly do without them .
I acquired almost naturally my agility in the first - order predicate calculus like I had learned trigonometry 25 years earlier , and in both cases using the tool effectively gives me great intellectual satisfaction .
I can explain this love - hate relationship only in one way .
Why should I continue to shudder at the sight of formulae , whereas in the meantime I should know better ?
I think that , by now , I know from sad experience that only too many mathematicians and computing scientists have had the misfortune of missing my mother 's wise advice at the impressible age of sixteen .
Too often the five - line limit is ignored and , instead of using the compactness of the formal notation to keep the text concise , authors use it — in a still limited space ! — for the introduction of much more complexity than I feel comfortable with .
Hence my shudder .
( I do n't know how you feel about the famous report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 .
I admire it very much and think its fame well - deserved .
But in retrospect I think ALGOL 60's syntax , though rigorously defined , more baroque than is desirable , and it is certainly the compactness of BNF that has made the introduction of so much arbitrariness possible . )
Later I learned that for the kind of effectiveness that I loved , mathematicians had a perfectly adequate , technical term : they call it " mathematical elegance " or " elegance " for short .
I also discovered that the term is much more " technical " than most mathematicians suspect , much more " technical " in the sense that even among mathematicians of very different brands there exists a much greater consensus about what is a really elegant argument than they themselves seemed to be aware of .
Show any mathematician a really elegant argument that is new for him : at the moment it becomes his intellectual property , he start to laugh !
The discovery of this strong consensus has made a great impression on me .
It was very encouraging .
It came at a moment that — in private , so to speak — I had already come the conclusion that in the practice of computing , where we have so much latitude for making a mess of it , mathematical elegance is not a dispensable luxury , but a matter of life and death .
But I hesitated to say so very much in public , just for fear of pushing another buzzword ; now I dare to do it , assured as I am that mathematical elegance is a clear notion , firmly rooted in our culture .
But I am also aware of the fact that my sensitivity for it can be tracked down to how I was educated in my youth .

Language is another issue .
I often feel uneasy about it .
At the time I got my mother 's wise advice about trigonometry , I wrote many poems , and often I was dissatisfied : I knew that what I had written was not " it " , yet I found myself unable to identify the shortcoming , and had to console myself with A.A. Milne 's " As near as you can get nowadays . " .
My first task at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam was writing the precise functional specification for the computer that was there at that moment under design .
I did so to the best of my ability , and thought I had done so rather well — and , from the point of precision , I had — .
But it was something of a shock for me to discover that , within a few days after its appearance , my beautiful report was generally known as " The Appalling Prose " .
At that time I only felt that we had to learn how to write better about our own subject .
I think that it was not until 1960 , when Peter Naur acquainted me with Wittgenstein 's famous quotation : " What can be said at all , can be said clearly ; and on what we cannot talk about , we have to remain silent . " that it slowly dawned upon me that , therefore , we had to learn to think better about our own subject .
In the meantime , I had another linguistic shock : I became a member of the ACM , shortly before its Communications started to appear .
Prior to that I had hardly had any exposure to the foreign literature .
What I then read was written in a way so totally different from what I , in relative isolation , had acquired as my own habit , that I was absolutely flabbergasted .
The heavily anthropomorphic terminology was totally new for me , and hardly compatible with my cultural roots ; so was the animism betrayed by the term " bug " : we had never called a bug a bug , we had always called it an error .
Still hesitating whether or not to adopt the jargon , I was confronted with a next term of a glaring inadequacy — was it " program maintenance " ?
I do n't remember — and I knew that I had to design my own way of writing about our subject in English , as I had done in Dutch .
In retrospect this may strike you as a proud decision , but it was n't : it was a decision taken in desperation , for otherwise I could not think in the way I wished to think .
One more remark about language that seems relevant .
With English being computing science 's Esperanto , colleagues with English as their native tongue often feel somewhat guilty about what they regard as their undeserved advantage over most foreigners .
Their feeling of guilt is misplaced , because the advantage is ours .
It is very helpful to have to do your work in what always remains a foreign language , as it forces you to express yourself more consciously .
( About the most excellent prose written in our field that I can think of , is to be found in aforementioned ALGOL 60 Report : its editor had the great advantage of being , besides brilliant , a Dane .
I have always felt that much of the stability and well - deserved fame of ALGOL 60 could be traced down directly to the inexorable accuracy of Peter Naur 's English . )

The above has been presented , by way of background information , as a help for the interpretation of what follows : a summary of my hopes of computing science .
This topic is not as frivolous as it might seem at first sight .
Firstly , already in my early youth — from 1940 until 1945 — I have learned to hope very seriously : secondly , my hopes of computing science — which have directed most of my work — have shown a great stability .
They evolved : some hopes became fulfilled , some hopes , originally far away , became almost challenges as their fulfillment began to appear technically feasible .
Admittedly they are only my hopes , but they are of a sufficiently long standing that I now dare to confess them .
How were we attracted to the field of automatic computing ?
Why do we remain fascinated ?
What is really the core of computing science ?
Well , everybody got attracted in his or her way .
I entered the field by accident .
I became attracted by the combination of the urgency of the problems that needed to be solved for the recovery of my country from the damage done to it in World War II , and the discovery that carefully applied brains were an essential ingredient of the solutions .
Up till that moment I had never been quite sure whether my love of perfection had been a virtue or a weakness , and I was greatly relieved to find an environment in which it was an indispensable virtue .
I became — and remained — fascinated by the amazing combination of simplicity and complexity .
On the one hand it is a trivial world , being built from a finite number of noughts and ones , so trivial that one feels oneself mathematically entitled , and hence morally obliged , to complete intellectual mastery .
On the other hand it has shown itself to be a world of treacherous complexity .
The task that should be possible , but was n't , became the fascinating challenge .
For me , the first challenge for computing science is to discover how to maintain order in a finite , but very large , discrete universe that is intricately intertwined .
And a second , but not less important challenge is how to mould what you have achieved in solving the first problem , into a teachable discipline : it does not suffice to hone your own intellect ( that will join you in your grave ) , you must teach others how to hone theirs .
The more you concentrate on these two challenges , the clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin : teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable .
As I said , my hopes have evolved , and one way in which they did so was by becoming more precise and more articulate .
Ten years ago I expressed my dissatisfaction with the then current state of the art by aiming at programs that would be " intellectually manageable " and " understandable " .
At the time they represented the best way in which I could express my then still vague hope ; I apologize for these terms to the extent that they became buzz - words before they had become sufficiently precise to be technically helpful .
What does it help to strive for " intellectual manageability " when you do n't know how you would prefer to " manage intellectually " ?
What guidance do you get from the goal of " understandability " before you have chosen the way of understanding ?
Very little , of course .
I particularly regret my use of the term " understanding " , for in the combination " ease of understanding " it has added to the confusion by not inviting to distinguish carefully between " convenient " and " conventional " , and that distinction , I am afraid , is vital : I expect for computing scientists the most convenient way of thinking and understanding to be rather unconventional .
( That is not surprising at all , for , after all , also thinking is only a habit , and what right do we have to expect our old habits to be adequate when faced , for the first time in our culture , with a drastically novel universe of discourse ? )
My hope became more articulate , when programming emerged as an application area par excellence of the techniques that are well - known because we struggle with the small sizes of our heads as long as we exist .
they are roughly of three different forms :
1 ) separation of concerns and effective use of abstraction
2 ) the design and use of notations , tailored to one 's manipulative needs
3 ) avoiding case analyses , in particular combinatorially exploding ones .
When faced with an existing design , you can apply them as a checklist ; when designing yourself , they provide you with strong heuristic guidance .
In my experience they make the goal " intellectually manageable " sufficiently precise to be actually helpful , in a degree that ranges from " very " to " extremely so " .
For the techniques of scientific thought I called programming an application area " par excellence " , and with that last term I meant two things : indispensable and very effective .
That they are indispensable seems obvious to me .
They summarize the only ways in which we have ever been able to disentangle complexity more or less successfully ; and we cannot expect our designs to turn out to be any better than the ways in which we have thought about them , for that would be a miracle .
The indispensability of the techniques of scientific thought is , admittedly , only my belief , and you are free to dismiss it ; you could remark that I am primarily a scientist , and that to someone whose only tool is a hammer , every problem looks like a nail .
I am , however , strengthened in my belief of their indispensability by the outcome of the experiments that we could take , viz. , trying how effectively we could learn to apply the techniques of scientific thought .
Of the experiments I am aware of , the outcome has been very encouraging .
Engaged in these experiments , you start to treasure the just solvable problems , and try to present the most elegant solution you can think of as nicely as possible .
I have now joined that game for several years and cannot recommend it warmly enough .
It is a highly rewarding and fascinating learning process .
It is very rewarding for its immediate benefit : a significant decrease in the average amount of effort , needed to find a solution .
The untrained thinker — unless a genius — spends inordinate amounts of effort in avoidable complications , and only too often , unaware of their avoidability , he fails to disentangle himself again : a vast amount of effort has then been spent on producing an inferior solution .
Our educators have something to answer for .
Reading the literature , I must come to the sad conclusion that untrained thinkers are rather the rule than the exception : people have been taught facts and tricks , but not a methodology for using their brains effectively .
The scope of the educational challenge is enormous .
It you accept it — and I think we should — you have my blessing .
You 'll need it — and much more ! — because you will encounter formidable obstacles on your way .
You 'll have at least two dragons to slay .
Confusing " love of perfection " with " claim of perfection " , people will accuse you of the latter and then blame you for the first .
Furthermore , in spite of all the evidence to the contrary , the teachability of thinking effectively will be flatly denied , and your methodological contributions — needed more than anything else — will be dismissed as " for geniuses only " : remember , while fighting this second dragon , that most frequently the term " genius " is not used as a compliment , but only as an alibi for the mentally lazy .
* *
* For a prosperous future of computing science — like for any science — it is essential that its achievements are published well , so that the next generation can start where the preceding one left .
Above , I have expressed some of my dissatisfaction about the quality of today 's publications in our field .
The problem is a very serious one , and it is more than a purely educational problem .
How do we publish a sophisticated piece of software ?
( We can reproduce the code , but that is only fit for mechanical execution .
I meant " to publish " in the scientific sense : our text should fully enlighten the attentive reader . )
Admittedly , many papers about algorithms could be written much better already now , but beyond a certain limit , no one knows for certain , how to do it well !
And that universal inability makes it a technical problem , urgent and as yet unsolved .
One of my fervent hopes is that we shall solve it .
How should a well - written publication about a sophisticated piece of software look like ?
We do n't know yet , but two things seem certain .
Firstly , the texts will be " mathematical " in the sense of Morris Kline , when he wrote : " More than anything else mathematics is a method . "
Secondly , the texts will have to be written in a style that is very different from the style of traditional mathematical texts .
Depending on your mood you may regard this either as disturbing or as exciting , but in any case you should be convinced of the necessity of developing a radically new style of writing mathematical texts , very unlike anything ever written before : this novelty is required by the novelty of the subject matter .
Traditionally , mathematical texts are written on a fairly uniform semantic level , and that style cannot suffice for the disentanglement of the many intricate intertwinings we have to deal with .
In the relation between mathematics and computing science , the latter has , up till now , mostly been at the receiving end , and it seems to me that the time has come to start repaying our debts .
Besides broadening the scope of applicability of mathematical techniques ( as indicated above ) we could also change their traditional applications .
When , at last , the predicate calculus were to become an indispensable tool in the daily reasoning of all sorts of mathematicians , when the replacement of the asymmetric implication by the symmetric disjunction were to rob the so called " reductio ad absurdum " from its special status and equivalence would no longer be expressed by the clumsy " if and only if " , when mathematics would become enriched by a greater variety of inductive arguments , in all those cases such a development could possibly be traced down to computing science 's wholesome influence .
But repaying our debt to mathematics at large is certainly not our only task : also computing proper needs our attention .
We know that the problem of programming and system design are such that they cannot be solved without an effective application of the techniques of scientific thought .
But how well are we able to apply them ?
How well are we , for instance , able to separate the concern for correctness from the concern for efficiency ?
Both concerns are so " major " , that I do n't believe that significant progress will be possible unless we manage to separate them completely .
Efficiency has to do with cost aspects of program execution , correctness has to do with a relation between input and output , between initial and final states .
Complete separation of these two concerns means that we can deal with the correctness issue without taking into account that our programs could be executed .
It means that we can deal with the correctness issue , temporarily ignoring that our program text also admits the interpretation of executable code , i.e. , we must be able to discuss correctness independently of an underlying computational model .
To learn to dissociate our reasoning from underlying computational models , and to get rid of our operational thinking habits , that is what I regard as computing science 's major task .
That is what I would like to see achieved more than anything else .
Its difficulty should not be underestimated : it is like asking the average mathematician suddenly to do Euclidean geometry without drawing pictures .
As Morris Kline remarks : " But the pictures are not the subject matter of geometry and we are not permitted to reason from them .
it is true that most people , including mathematicians , lean upon these pictures as a crutch and find themselves unable to walk when the crutch is removed .
For a tour of higher dimensional geometry , however , the crutch is not available . "
The analogy is almost perfect : the pictures are to geometry what computational histories ( or " traces " ) are to computing science , " and we are not permitted to reason from them " .
But the operational thinking habits are firmly rooted in many wide - spread traditions , ranging from automata theory , via LISP , to FORTAN and BASIC , and many people , including computing scientists , lean upon traces " as a crutch , and find themselves unable to walk when the crutch is removed " .
In the case of uniprogramming the trace is a linear sequence of states and events , about as manageable and " helpful " as a picture in two - or three - dimensional geometry .
But in the case of multiprogramming traces are unmanageable and the " crutch is not available " .
For Euclidean geometry the analytical methods of Descartes provided the alternative to the crutch , and in analytical geometry the generalization from three to more dimensions was technically very smooth .
In programming , the postulational methods of Floyd and Hoare provided the alternative to the crutch ; in uniprogramming they did so very successfully , but their generalization from uni- to multiprogramming is — at the time of writing and to my knowledge — less smooth , although after the successful start of Gries and Owicki I have n't the slightest doubt that in the long run it will be done quite successfully .
The need to delineate very carefully one 's " point actions " is a new aspect of the game ; so is the discovery of Laws that give the implementer a greater freedom in embedding in space and time the activities involved in the implementation of single point actions .
( One of the ways in which we can appreciate the manifestly greater difficulty of designing multiprograms is that the implementer is interested in much greater freedom : under which circumstances , for instance , is he allowed to implement in a distributed system a point action — in the presence of other traffic !— by an activity in node A , followed by a " slow " message from A to B , and finally , upon reception of the message , some activity in B ? )
Dealing successfully with these technicalities will , I am very much afraid , be a minor task , compared to the educational challenge of getting nonoperational arguments accepted and getting people thereby out of the their operational thinking habits , for over and over again they prove to be a mental stumbling block for accepting a nonoperational argument , particularly when , from an operational point of view , it does not make sense .
It is distressingly hard to make someone accept a universal invariant while he all the time remains obsessed by his knowledge that in his implementation it will never be true , because his implementation will never show a moment in which it wo n't be halfway engaged on one or more point actions somewhere in the network .
The fight against operational thinking habits is a major educational task ( of which the crusade against anthropomorphic terminology is only a modest beginning . )
* *
* I hope very much that computing science at large will become more mature , as I am annoyed by two phenomena that both strike me as symptoms of immaturity .
The one is the wide - spread sensitivity to fads and fashions , and the wholesale adoption of buzzwords and even buzznotions .
Write a paper promising salvation , make it a " structured " something or a " virtual " something , or " abstract " , " distributed " or " higher - order " or " applicative " and you can almost be certain of having started a new cult .
The other one is the sensitivity to the market place , the unchallenged assumption that industrial products , just because they are there , become by their mere existence a topic worthy of scientific attention , no matter how grave the mistakes they embody .
In the sixties the battle that was needed to prevent computing science from degenerating to " how to live with the 360 " has been won , and " courses " — usually " in depth ! " — about MVS or what have you are now confined to the not so respectable subculture of the commercial training circuit .
But now we hear that the advent of the microprocessors is going to revolutionize computing science !
I do n't believe that , unless the chasing of day - flies is confused with doing research .
A similar battle may be needed .
An unmistakable symptom of maturity of computing science would be a consensus about " what matters " among its leaders , a consensus that would enable us to discuss its future course as if computing science were an end in itself .
Obviously , such a consensus can only emerge as the byproduct of a coherent body of knowledge and insights , but the crucial point is " knowledge of what ? " and " insights in what ? " .
What would be worth knowing ?
What would be worth understanding ?
I believe that a bold extrapolation from the past will help us to find the answers .
When programming methodology in the early seventies adopted formal techniques for verification and for the derivation of correct programs , earlier ways in which programming language features had been discussed were suddenly obsolete .
The earlier pragmatic discussions , blurred by different tastes and habits , had only created a confusion worthy of Babel , but then the simple question " does this proposed feature simplify or complicate a formal treatment ? " cut as a knife through the proposals and did more to establish consensus than eloquence or bribery could ever have achieved .
My extrapolation from that experience is that our knowledge should concern formal techniques , and our understanding should be of the limits and of the potential of their application .
Let me comment in this connection shortly on two developments currently in bloom , developments that certainly fall under the heading " formal techniques " : the knowledge is being developed , but about the understanding of limits and potential I have in both cases my misgivings .
I mean abstract data types and program transformation , both under development in an effort to separate correctness concerns from efficiency concerns .
For the blooming of abstract data types I feel some co-responsibility , having coined and launched the terms " representational abstraction " back in 1972 , and if it turns out to be a mistake , part of the guilt could be mine .
One hint that it might be a mistake comes from the fact that it is only a slight exaggeration to state that , after five years of intensive research and development , the stack is still the only abstract data type ever designed .
This is in strong contrast to what happened when its inspirator , the closed subroutine , was invented !
For this disappointing outcome , so far , of the research devoted to abstract data types I can , at my current stage of understanding , offer two tentative explanations .
The one is simply that an abstract data type is so much more complicated , so much harder to specify , than a subroutine , that it is orders of magnitude harder to invent a useful one .
( If that is the case , I have only been impatient . )
The other one is that , when all is said and told , the type of interface , as provided by an abstract data type , is inappropriate for its purpose : when we analyze carefully really sophisticated algorithms , we could very well discover that the correctness proof does not admit a parcelling out , such that one or two parcels can comfortably be identified with an abstract data type .
In other words , the hope that abstract data types will help us much could very well be based on an underestimation of the logical complexity of sophisticated algorithms and , consequently , on an oversimplification of the program design process .
Program transformations — each of which embodies a theorem ! — have been suggested as a candidate that could contribute to the necessary body of knowledge .
The hope is that transformations from a modest library will provide a path from a naïve , inefficient but obviously correct program to a sophisticated efficient solution .
I have seen how via program transformations striking gains in efficiency have been obtained by avoiding recomputations of the same intermediate results , even in situations in which this possibility — note that the intermediate results are never part of the original problem statement !— was , at first sight , surprising .
And yet my hope is tempered for the following reason : when , in contrast to the correctness of the naïve algorithm one starts with , the correctness of the efficient one critically depends on a ( perhaps deep ) mathematical theorem , the chain of transformations would constitute a proof of the latter , and , to the best of my knowledge , mechanical proof verification is very cumbersome and is expected to remain so .
I am afraid that great hopes of program transformations can only be based on what seems to me an underestimation of the logical brinkmanship that is required for the justification of really efficient algorithms .
It is certainly true , that each program transformation embodies a theorem , but are these the theorems that could contribute significantly to the body of knowledge and understanding that would give us maturity ?
I doubt , for many of them are too trivial and too much tied to program notation .
And this brings me to my final hope : before I die , I hope to understand by which virtues the one formal notational technique serves its purpose well and due to which shortcomings the other one is just a pain in the neck .
On my many wanderings over the earth 's surface I learned that quite a few people tend to help me starting an animated conversation by the well - intended question : " And , professor Dijkstra , what are you currently researching ? " .
I have learned to dread that question , because it used to leave me speechless , or stammering at best .
Came the moment that I decided that I had better design a ready - made answer for it , and for a while I used the answer , both true and short : " Programming . " .
the usual answer I got was very illuminating " Ah , I see : programming languages . " , and when I then said " No : programming . " , my good - willing partner seldomly noticed that he was being corrected .
The ACM has a Special Interest Group on Programming Languages , but not one on programming as such ; its newest periodical is on Programming Languages and Systems and not on programming as such .
The computing community has an almost morbid fixation on program notation , it is subdivided in as many subcultures as we have more or less accepted programming languages , subcultures , none of which clearly distinguishes between genuine problems and problems only generated by the programming languages it has adopted ( sometimes almost as a faith ) .
For this morbid fixation I can only offer one explanation : we fully realize that in our work , more than perhaps anywhere else , appropriate notational conventions are crucial , but also , we suffer more than anyone else from the general misunderstanding of their proper role .
A MAN caught driving more than six times over the legal limit in Sydney 's west , police say .
The 28 - year - old allegedly blew 0.326 after being stopped at Toongabbie about 4 pm ( AEDT ) yesterday .
Police will allege it is the third time in five years the South Wentworthville man has been charged with drink driving .
About an hour later , the man 's partner was busted for the same offence , allegedly returning reading a reading of .150 - three times over the legal limit .
The 44 - year - old woman was on her way to the police station to pick - up her partner , police said .
The pair have been charged with high - range drink driving and will appear at Fairfield Local Court on January 19 .

How
The iPhone part of PdaNet listens on port 2007 .
PdaNet Windows client is a fake modem driver .
The driver connects to port 2007 on the iPhone through iTunes 's USB multiplexor on one end and to the standard Windows PPP driver on the other end .
The protocol is simple : upon connection , PdaNet server responds with a version banner ( 1.61 in the example above ) and then sends and receives PPP frames .
umux2007 takes place of the fake modem driver .
It pipes packets between pppd and usbmuxd , the open source iPhone USB multiplexor .
Due to a mental deficiency on the part of PdaNet developers , the server expects every PPP frame to begin and end with the Flag character ( 0x7E ) and to be sent in a single packet .
umux2007 adds the extra Flags if required and tries to use one write ( ) per frame .
On my system , Twisted , the UNIX socket driver , usbmuxd and iPhone TCP stack happen to preserve packet boundaries .

The Milky Way as you 've never seen it before :
The colourful centre of our galaxy in all its glory
Advertisement
Colourful , swirling clouds of cosmic dust interspersed with glowing star clusters are revealed in this extraordinary image of the Milky Way .
The dazzling image combining reds , yellows , blues and purples , was created by layering stunningly detailed pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope , the Spitzer Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory on top of each other .
The Milky Way is at the centre of our own galaxy and this image shows its core .
The image was created to celebrate the 400th anniversary o f Galileo Galilei 's first demonstration of his telescope .
Unprecedented : A beautiful composite image of the Milky Way centre using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope , the Spitzer Space Telescope , and the Chandra X-ray Observatory ARCHED FILAMENTS :
These are located 85 light years from the centre of the Milky Way , the Sagittarius A area .
The ' filaments ' are roughly ten light years long and one wide .
One light year is nearly 6 million million miles , the distance light travels in a year .
ARCHES CLUSTER :
The densest known star cluster within the Milky Way containing about 1,000 ' young ' stars X - RAY BINARY STAR :
The glow is created by two stars , hence binary , orbiting a centre of mass QUINTUPLET CLUSTER :
It is a collection of stars which is 4 million years old and contains 10,000 times the mass of our Sun PISTOL STAR :
This is the biggest type of star known in the universe and is called a ' blue hyper giant ' .
Like our Sun it has solar winds but these are 10 billion times more powerful .
Astronomers believe the Pistol Star will soon undergo a massive stellar explosion known as a supernova .
Our solar system was probably created by such an event .
SICKLE : The Sickle is made up of dense dust clouds which are given their shape by radiation and solar winds from ' young ' stars SAGITTARIUS A : This is the centre of the Milky Way .
Astronomers believe that it contains a massive black hole , a space with a gravitational field so intense that no matter or radiation can escape .
Evidence for this includes mysterious radio waves emitted from this area .
Observations from Spitzer ( left ) Hubble ( centre ) using infra-red and Chandra ( right ) using X - rays created the most detailed picture of our galactic centre
The Earth is on the Orion arm of the Milky Way .
The telescopes peered towards the centre of our galaxy
The three space observatories peered into the central region of the Milky Way , which is 26,000 light years from Earth .
One light year is nearly 6 million million miles , the distance light travels in a year .
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy , which is a galaxy with spiral arms and a central bar - shaped structure composed of stars .
Our solar system sits half - way along the minor Orion arm on the inner rim .
The arm or ' spur ' is named due to its proximity to stars in the Orion constellation .
Scientists were able to see through the obscuring dust and into the intense activity near the galactic core using infrared light and X - rays .
They created an image 250 light years across with the width of the picture covering about the same angular width as the full Moon .
The image reflects the spirit of international cooperation in astronomical research as the Hubble Telescope is a collaboration between the European Space Agency and Nasa .
Both Spitzer and Chandra are part of the American space agency 's observatories programme .
Each telescope 's contribution has been presented in a different colour .
Yellow represents the near - infrared observations of Hubble , which is better known for its astonishing visible - light pictures .
These infrared observations outline the most active regions where stars are being born and reveal hundreds of thousands of stars .
The galactic centre is marked by the bright patch in the lower right .
Along the left side are large arcs of warm gas that have been heated by clusters of bright massive stars .
In addition , Hubble uncovered many more massive stars across the region .
Portrait of Galileo Galilei - the father of modern astronomy
Winds and radiation from these stars create the complex structures seen in the gas throughout the image .
This sweeping panorama is one of the sharpest infrared pictures ever made of the galactic center region .
Red represents the infrared observations of Spitzer .
The radiation and winds from stars create glowing dust clouds that form complex structures from compact spheres to long , stringy filaments .
Blue and violet represent the X - ray observations of Chandra .
X - rays are emitted by gas heated to millions of degrees by stellar explosions and outflows from the super - massive black hole in the galaxy 's centre .
The bright blue blob on the left side is an emission from a double star system containing either a neutron star or a black hole .
A supermassive black hole - some four million times more massive than the Sun - resides within the bright region in the lower right .
When these views are brought together , the composite image provides one of the most detailed views ever of our galaxy 's mysterious core .
The image was created to mark the work of the Italian astronomer and physicist Galileo ( 1564-1642 ) .
He applied the telescope to astronomy and observed craters on the moon , sunspots and the phases of Venus .
Dr Robert Massey from the Royal Astronomical Society said : ' This image reminds us how far astronomy has come as it was only 400 years ago that we looked up at the stars through telescopes .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Small and medium - sized U.S. businesses seeking to finance capital equipment showed further signs of distress in November as loans more than six months past due rose for the 22nd consecutive month , PayNet Inc reported on Monday .

Accounts behind 180 days or more , and unlikely ever to be paid , rose to 0.91 percent in November from 0.87 percent in October , according to PayNet , which provides risk - management tools to the commercial lending industry .
It was the 22nd consecutive monthly increase in loans so far in arrears they ultimately may have to be written off by lenders .
Accounts in moderate delinquency , or those behind by 30 days or more , rose in November to 4.33 percent from 4.19 percent in October , according to PayNet .
That ended a three - month stretch where moderate delinquencies had fallen , a trend that fueled hopes prospects were improving for small businesses , which led the broader economy into the past two recessions and are widely regarded as the best hope for job creation in any recovery .
But accounts 90 days or more behind in payment , or in severe delinquency , improved modestly in November , slipping to 1.40 percent from 1.43 percent in October .
It was the fourth consecutive improvement in the measurement .
That was not the only glimmer of light in PayNet ’s monthly report .
The company ’s Small Business Lending Index , which measures the overall volume of financing , fell just 11 percent year - over - year in November .
While that indicates that lenders remain reluctant to extend credit to small and medium - sized businesses , it was the smallest decline in the index since the recession began .
“ We ’re not out of this slump yet , ” said Bill Phelan , president and founder of Skokie , Illinois - based PayNet .
“ But the year - over - year decline in the small - business lending index is smallest so far in this downturn and continues an encouraging trend line .
From January through May , the index was falling 25 to 33 percent .
And then from June to October , we saw moderating declines of 16 to 21 percent .
So 11 percent is really another step in the right direction . ”
PayNet ’s report kicks off a week that will be heavy with economic data , including the Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing survey on Monday , December car sales on Tuesday , December retail sales figures on Thursday and December nonfarm payroll data on Friday .
A man behind bars for nearly four years for a gang rape that did not happen has been cleared after his accuser admitted she lied to make her friends feel sorry for her .
William McCaffrey hugged his lawyer after the same New York judge who had sentenced him to 20 years in prison threw out the case and apologised on Thursday .
" I 've been waiting for this for a long time , " the softly spoken McCaffrey , 32 , said outside a Manhattan court .
" I 'm just glad it 's over . "
New DNA tests played a part , but his exoneration hinged largely on his accuser recanting - a rarity after rape convictions , the head of a national prosecutors ' group said .
My Secret Santa got me a ridiculously awesome sword set !
Not only are they awesome , but they 'll go perfect with my sword collection !

Arthur was a surprise choice as South Africa coach in May 2005
Mickey Arthur said " differences " between himself and Cricket South Africa ( CSA ) had forced him to step down as coach of the national team .
The 41 - year - old confirmed he had resigned from his post on Wednesday , with Corrie van Zyl installed as caretaker coach for the India tour .
" I do n't believe I can take the team forward under the present circumstances , " said Arthur .
Meanwhile chairman of selectors Mike Procter has been sacked by CSA .
Fellow selectors Craig Matthews , Winky Ximiya and Mustapha Khan have also been relieved of their duties .
Instead , CSA chief executive Gerald Majola will oversee the interim selection process alongside Van Zyl and former captain Kepler Wessels .
Arthur denied his resignation was because of a breakdown in his relationship with South Africa captain Graeme Smith , who sat beside the former coach at a media conference in East London .
Mickey expressed the very honest and humble view that he did not believe that at this stage he could continue as coach of the Proteas
CSA chief executive Gerald Majola
" The two of us have had a great partnership for five years , " said Smith , whose team depart for a two - Test , three one - day match tour of India on Saturday .
" It hurts to see him move aside .
Mickey was integral in bringing stability and a lot of calmness to the side and he can be proud of what he achieved .
" I think its natural for the players to have some emotion now , Mickey has been part of our life for five years .
The players will try and be as professional as possible .
We know this ( India ) is an important tour . "
Majola said the board was unhappy with the team 's results in 2009 , despite topping the International Cricket Council 's world Test rankings last August .
However , Arthur said Majola and his fellow board of directors also wanted a different approach which he did not share .
" My vision of how to go forward with the team was clear , but the board 's was different , " said Arthur , who is keen to pursue his career in English county cricket .
" I 've always run a tight management and team , but the CSA board of directors want structural changes . "
Installed as Ray Jennings ' successor in May 2005 , Arthur guided South Africa to their maiden
Test series victory in Australia last year , as well as their first series win in England for over 40 years in 2008 .
However , both Arthur and Smith were criticised for their defensive approach during their four - Test home series against England , where they twice failed to dismiss the tourists with last - man Graham Onions at the crease .
Van Zyl ( right ) was a former assistant coach for South Africa
The hosts squared the series 1 - 1 in Johannesburg following a crushing innings and 74 runs victory nine days ago .
But that draw , along with a 2 - 1 home Test series defeat by Australia , a semi-final loss to Pakistan in the World Twenty20 semi-finals followed by a first - round exit at the Champions Trophy , prompted CSA to reconsider South Africa 's strategy for 2010 .
" I am disappointed , because when I started I said I wanted to get South Africa to number one in both forms of the game , " added Arthur .
" I wanted to be the first South African coach to win in England , and the first to win in Australia .
" The only thing I did n't achieve was an ICC trophy . "
Majola said there would be a board meeting on 19 February when a new team structure is set to be announced .
" Mickey 's resignation came through the normal stock - taking process which followed the England home series and against the backdrop of the disappointing results of 2009 , " he said in a statement .
" As this process unfolded and remedies were sought , Mickey expressed the very honest and humble view that he did not believe that at this stage he could continue as coach of the Proteas . "
Arthur 's temporary replacement Van Zyl , who was assistant national coach under Bob Woolmer , Graham Ford , Eric Simons and Jennings from 1998 to 2003 , has been in charge of South Africa 's High Performance Centre in Pretoria .
606 : DEBATE
It is all starting to look a bit political , a shame as SA have a big tour coming up and it would be a shame if this undermines it
RedRedRobin
The 48 - year - old has less than two weeks to prepare before South Africa 's first Test against the world 's top - ranked side India in Nagpur on 6 February .
" It 's not the ideal situation to take over now , but I have worked with Mickey before , " said former Glamorgan batsman Van Zyl .
" I had been focusing on the high performance centre till Monday , but I will meet with the captain in Cape Town on Thursday to prepare for India . "
Arthur , a prolific batsman in South African domestic cricket in the 1990s , was a surprise choice to take over from Jennings as national coach .
However he has impressed a number of South African cricket pundits , while overseeing the development of Dale Steyn , Morne Morkel , Paul Harris and Hashim Amla on the international stage .
New Zealand have denied approaching Arthur to replace Englishman Andy Moles , who quit as coach in October last year .

It is an anquished plea from a daughter for a father who has been imprisoned for a crime she believes he did not commit .
But Johina Aamer ’s two - page hand written letter to Gordon Brown is not like any other child ’s request for state intervention in a miscarriage of justice .
Johina ’s father is Shaker Aamer , the last recognised British resident at Guantanamo Bay where the Americans have held him for eight years without ever charging him with a crime .
His continued absence from the family home in south London is hard for Johina , 12 , and her young three brothers to understand .
Two years ago they were told that their father had been cleared for release and they expected him to be flown back to Britain with fellow prisoner Binyam Mohamed when he was released from Guantanamo last February .
Then last year the Aamer family watched Barack Obama promise the world that within 12 months he would close the notorious prison camp at the US naval base in Cuba .
Yet still the Aamer family wait .
Johina ’s younger brother Faris , eight , has never seen his father because he was born after the family were separated during the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
In her letter , Johina tells Mr Brown : “ He has never felt what it ’s like to be with a father like every child does .
He misses him a lot .
Sometimes he thinks other people are his father .
Once a man came to our garden and after he left Faris asked my mum ‘ is that my dad ’ . ”
The eight - year ordeal has also taken a terrible toll on Johina ’s mother .
“ My mother , " Johina tells Mr Brown , " is very patient but sometimes when she misses him too much she gets depressed .
My Mother is also a psychiatric patient .
Whenever she gets depressed we have to go to my grandparents house where my grandparents look after her when she is ill she is in bed day and night and ca n’t do much .
I really hate it when she gets depressed . ”
Today Amnesty International is joining Johina to call on the UK government to exert its influence to secure the release - or fair trial - of Mr Aamer , 42 .
Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said : “ We need to see the UK government stepping up its efforts to get Shaker Aamer out of Guantánamo .
Every extra day he ’s kept in Guantánamo is an extra day of cruel injustice for Shaker and his long - suffering family .
Guantánamo is n’t over yet , and besides the need to secure Shaker ’s release the government should seek assurances that another Guantánamo prisoner - Ahmed Belbacha , a man formerly living in Britain - is not left behind in Guantánamo or forced back to his native Algeria where he ’d be at risk of torture and imprisonment without trial . ”
Mr Shaker is a Saudi national with a British wife and his four children are all British .
Britain made its first request for his release to representatives of the Bush administration in August 2007 .
Mr Miliband was known to have discussed Mr Aamer 's release with Hillary Clinton after President Obama 's election victory .
And in November Britiain repeated this request .
A Foreign Office spokesperson said then : " We have made an exceptional request for the release and return of Shaker Aamer , a Saudi national , to the UK .
" This is because of the exceptional nature of the Guantanamo facility and our sustained efforts to see it closed .
Though we were successful with securing the return of four other non-UK nationals , we have not been able yet to do so with Shaker . "
But Mr Aamer , who is being represented by solicitor Irene Nembhard of Birnberg Peirce , claims he was tortured by the American and that Britain was complicit in that torture .
Last month the High Court in London ruled that there was evidence of wrong - doing in Mr Aamer 's case and ordered the UK Government to disclose secret documents that Mr Aamer alleges prove Britain was complicit in his torture .
The case is potentially more damaging to Britain than that of former Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed because British agents are accused of being present during Mr Aamer 's alleged torture .
In one allegation an MI5 agent is said to have been present when Mr Aamer 's US interrogators banged his head against a wall , although the agent did not intervene .
In his court victory on Tuesday two judges ruled that Mr Aamer was entitled to see UK Government documents relating to his detention .
His lawyers say they contain evidence supporting his claims that confessions he made were obtained through torture .
Lord Justice Sullivan said : " Our present view is that this matter is clearly very urgent .
If this information is to be of any use it has to be put in the claimant 's hands as soon as possible . "
President Obama made the closure of the US naval base a key priority when he was elected last year .
He set himself a deadline of one year but has since admitted that he will not be able to meet this target .
But the US have told the UK that they believe Mr Aamer represents a security risk .
Today Johina will go to Downing Street to personally deliver her letter to Gordon Brown .
She will be accompanied by Baroness Helena Kennedy , Kate Allen ( Director , Amnesty International UK ) , Vanessa Redgrave ( actress ) , Kate Hudson ( Chair , CND ) , Gareth Peirce ( lawyer for the family ) and Victoria Brittain ( writer and friend of Johina ’s mother ) .
Shaker Aamer was cleared for release from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 , yet despite UK government efforts to secure Mr Aamer ’s freedom his release has reportedly been blocked by the US authorities .
There are concerns that Mr Aamer ’s release is being delayed as “ punishment ” for his role in acting as a representative of fellow detainees at the camp .
Johina says in her letter to the Prime Mininister : “ At school when it is time to go home most of the children have their fathers pick them up which makes me miss him even more .
Also there is no reason fro my father to be in prison .
There have never been any charges against and he is innocent . ”
Drinking regular or decaffeinated coffee is associated with a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer , new research suggests .
“ Coffee has effects on insulin and glucose metabolism as well as sex hormone levels , all of which play a role in prostate cancer , ” said Kathryn M. Wilson , PhD , a postdoctoral fellow at the Channing Laboratory in Boston .
She and her colleagues found that men who drank the most coffee had a 59 % decreased risk of either lethal or advanced prostate cancer compared with men who drank no coffee .
The magnitude of risk reduction was more pronounced in men who never smoked ; in this group , the biggest coffee consumers had an 89 % decreased risk compared with men who did not drink coffee .
Dr. Wilson , who presented study findings at the American Association for Cancer Research Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research Conference in Houston , said caffeine is not the key factor in this association .

The researchers analyzed data from men who participated in the Health Professionals ’ Follow - Up Study .
They documented the regular and decaffeinated coffee intake of about 50,000 men every four years from 1986 to 2006 .
Prostate cancer developed in 4,975 men during this period .
“ Very few lifestyle factors have been consistently associated with prostate cancer risk , especially with risk of aggressive disease , so it would be exciting if this association is confirmed in other studies , ” Dr. Wilson said .
“ While it is too early to recommend increasing coffee intake based on this study alone , our results do suggest there is no reason to stop drinking coffee out of any concern about prostate cancer . ”

Brand New Steyr AUG / A3 SA USA Rifle in 5.56x45 mm ( .223 Rem . )
After 20 years of absence the new steyr aug proves to be well worth the wait
TRUSSVILLE , AL —-( AmmoLand.com ) -
Two decades after it was banned from importation , the venerated and much - sought - after Steyr AUG has made its triumphant return to firearm stores across America .
Now built stateside by Steyr subcontractor Sabre Defense — legendary for its tactical rifles and its unrivaled M2HB and Minigun barrels currently in use by the U.S. military — under the watchful eyes and to the exacting tolerances of Austrian engineers , the new Steyr AUG / A3 SA USA made its debut at the 2009 SHOT Show and is now available in 5.56x45 mm ( .223 Rem . ) .
After the importation ban in 1989 , the legendary AUG / A1 frequently commanded in excess of $ 5,000 , but the svelte , utilitarian Austrian bullpup in its upgraded , modern A3 configuration is now available at a fraction of that .
With an overall length of 28.15 inches including its 16 - inch heavy barrel , the uncompromising , clean - running AUG / A3 SA USA measures 8 inches shorter than an AR - 15 carbine with a comparable barrel length and an extended stock , making the AUG the ultimate home - defense or ranch rifle .
And while the AR - 15 ’s often maligned gas - impingement system expels a large quantity of operational gas — and all the accompanying carbon and unburned powder — directly into the bolt carrier within the receiver , all gas used to cycle the utterly reliable short - stroke gas - piston AUG design exits the system within an inch of the barrel ’s gas port .
The new AUG / A3 SA USA also has two gas adjustment settings .
The AUG / A3 SA USA was engineered specifically with the American marksman in mind , and it incorporates all the features that AUG aficionados have always desired in the platform .
An innovative muzzle brake design tames recoil exceptionally effectively , providing for accurate second shots on target .
The new last - round bolt - hold - open feature provides a subtle “ feel ” indication that the magazine is empty , and after a magazine change , the low - profile bolt release is conveniently located on the left side of the stock .
The redesigned charging handle , forward on the left side of the receiver , also serves as a forward assist .
The most obvious departure from the AUG of two decades ago is the lack of an integral optical sight .
In keeping with its A3 designation , the new AUG is of a flat - top design with a marked , 25 - position Picatinny rail .
This makes sighting options almost limitless — from low - powered , long - eye relief optics to high - powered scopes to iron sights or even a combination of both .
AUG purists need not fret ; a Picatinny version of the original integrated Austrian “ donut reticle ” 1.5X optical sight is also available from Steyr Arms .
A smaller side rail also has been added for the integration of one of the many illumination or laser devices on the market .
Of course , the AUG / A3 SA USA has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design , including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left - hand operation , which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left - eject bolt .
It also features a quick - change barrel with a collapsible forward grip .
The AUG / A3 SA USA includes two transparent polymer 30 - round magazines , a cleaning kit that stores in the rifle ’s buttstock , a factory sling , a soft carry case and an owner ’s manual .
Suggested retail is $ 2,295 .

As I pointed out in December 2008 , Nouriel Roubini wrote the month before that the government might buy U.S. stocks :
The Fed ( or Treasury ) could even go as far as directly intervening in the stock market via direct purchases of equities as a way to boost falling equity prices .
Some of such policy actions seem extreme but they were in the playbook that Governor Bernanke described in his 2002 speech on how to avoid deflation .
Given that Roubini was previously a senior adviser to Tim Geithner , he probably knows what he 's talking about .
Now , Charles Biderman , CEO of TrimTabs , argues that the government may , in fact , have been buying stocks to prop up the stock market .
Given that 25 % of the top 50 hedge funds in the world use TrimTabs ' research for market timing , it is a credible source .
Specifically , Biderman writes :
As far as we know , it is not illegal for the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury to buy S&P 500 futures .
Moreover , several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices .
For example , former Fed board member Robert Heller opined in the Wall Street Journal in 1989 , “ Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thereby stabilizing the market as a whole . ”
In a Financial Times article in 2002 , an unidentified Fed official was quoted as acknowledging that policymakers had considered buying U.S. equities directly , not just futures .
The official mentioned that the Fed could “ theoretically buy anything to pump money into the system . ”
In an article in the Daily Telegraph in 2006 , former Clinton administration official George Stephanopoulos mentioned the existence of “ an informal agreement among the major banks to come in and start to buy stock if there appears to be a problem . ”
Mike Whitney - in commenting on Biderman 's essay - adds another juicy quote :
Consider the comments of former Clinton advisor George Stephanopoulos who verified the existence of the PPT in an appearance on Good Morning America on Sept 17 , 2000 .
He said :
" What I wanted to talk about for a few minutes is the various efforts that are going on in public and behind the scenes by the Fed and other government officials to guard against a free - fall in the markets . . . perhaps the most important the Fed in 1989 created what is called the Plunge Protection Team , which is the Federal Reserve , big major banks , representatives of the New York Stock Exchange and the other exchanges and they have been meeting informally so far , and they have a kind of an informal agreement among major banks to come in and start to buy stock if there appears to be a problem .
They have in the past acted more formally . . .
I do n't know if you remember but in 1998 , there was a crisis called the Long term Capital Crisis .
It was a major currency trader and there was a global currency crisis .
And they , with the guidance of the Fed , all of the banks got together when it started to collapse and propped up the currency markets .
And , they have plans in place to consider that if the markets start to fall . "
Biderman continues :
This type of intervention could explain some of the unusual market action in recent months , with stock prices grinding higher on low volume even as companies sold huge amounts of new shares and retail investors stayed on the sidelines .
For example , Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge has pointed out that virtually all of the market ’s upside since mid-September has come from after - hours S&P 500 futures activity .
If we were involved in a scheme to manipulate the stock market , we would want to keep it in place until after the “ wealth effect ” put a floor under the economy of , say , three quarters of positive GDP growth .
Assuming the economy were performing better , then ending the support for stock prices would be justified because a stock market decline would not be so painful .
Whitney summarizes another of Biderman 's arguments :
" We cannot identify the source of the new money that pushed stock prices up so far so fast .
For the most part , the money did not from the traditional players that provided money in the past . "
Huh ?
So , this vast infusion of liquidity -- which helped the banks to avoid painful deleveraging -- did not come from the usual suspects ?
That 's right .
According to Biderman , the money did not come from ( a ) companies ( " which were a huge net seller " ) ( b ) retail investor funds , ( c ) retail investors , ( d ) foreign investors ... , ( e ) pension funds [ or ( f ) hedge funds ] .
Has it happened ?
Has the government or it 's primary dealers really purchased stocks ?
I do n't know , but Bernanke 's refusal to open up the Fed 's books - and the lack of accountability and transparent accounting standards for the big banks - is n't helping to dispel suspicions .
And if the stock market tanks again in 2010 , it might add circumstantial evidence to a short - term attempt to prop up the market by the government .
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele has given his fair share of awkward answers to journalists .
But this one takes the cake .
In a recently televised segment , he was asked to explain his thoughts on the so - called “ global cooling ” he invented during a radio interview last March .
Specifically , a MyFox anchor was curious as to how Steele knows such a thing is happening .
ADVERTISEMENT
His response was nothing if not bizarre .
At one point , Steele even seemed to be suggesting that earth ’s crop of climate scientists are unfit and must be replaced by the “ right scientists ” who can help us “ appreciate ” climate change .
“ I do n’t ! ” he declared .
“ I do n’t !
But apparently neither does anybody else !
Okay ?
I do n’t .
All I know is every morning I come on , I turn on channel 13 and I ’ll see what the weather man tells me .
Okay ?
But the reality of it is , you know , really what is being exposed down is the profit motive and the profit taking and the flawed science that many of us have been talking about for years .
You know , let ’s clear all of that out .
Let ’s get the smart , right scientists in place to help us understand and appreciate what ’s happening .
I ’m still trying to find the brother who told me , ‘ This is the temperature it should be . ’
So , you know , we do n’t know .
The earth is a living organism and it changes .
We all know what that is about , right ? ”
The inexplicable response was first snipped by Think Progress .
That ’s a far cry from what he told a conservative radio host in March .
“ We are cooling .
We are not warming , ” Steele claimed .
“ The warming you see out there , the supposed warming , and I am using my finger quotation marks here , is part of the cooling process .
Greenland , which is now covered in ice , it was once called Greenland for a reason , right ?
Iceland , which is now green .
Oh I love this .
Like we know what this planet is all about .
How long have we been here ?
How long ?
No very long . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Over at the Discovery blog , the RNC chairman ’s comment drew little more than disdain .
“ You want me to respond to that gibberish ?
Seriously ?
The man got the history of Greenland wrong … need I really wax poetic on the rest ?
It ’s not a question of ‘ what this planet is all about ‘ , but rather what planet is the RNC Chairman on ? ”
After an “ exhaustive review , ” the Associated Press declared that the so - called “ climategate ” emails which exposed a row between scientists at the University of East Anglia did not show any climate data had been faked .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The AP studied all the e-mails for context , with five reporters reading and rereading them — about 1 million words in total , ” the wire service noted .
“ One of the most disturbing elements suggests an effort to avoid sharing scientific data with critics skeptical of global warming .
It is not clear if any data was destroyed ; two U.S. researchers denied it . ”
A recent Ipsos / McClatchy poll found that continued denial of climate change is increasingly leaving Republicans isolated .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In 2007 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded it is ‘ highly likely ’ that greenhouse gases largely contributed to a roughly 1 - degree Fahrenheit rise in global average temperatures since 1905 , and likely will lead to a 3 - to 7 - degree rise by 2100 , ” USA Today reported .
Scientists predict a dramatic rise in sea levels to coincide with heightened temperatures , triggering more erratic and violent weather systems and mass migrations throughout human societies due to coastal habitat destruction .
This video was broadcast by MyFox Tampa Bay on Thursday , Dec. 10 , 2009 .
The segment on climate change begins at 7:15 .
Chinese car sales rose by more than 50 % last year
China has said it overtook the United States to become the world 's biggest car and van market in 2009 .
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said 13.6 million vehicles were sold within the country last year .
That compares with just over 10 million vehicles in the US , which was previously the world 's largest market .
Unlike the US , China 's figures include heavy trucks , but they added just 650,000 to the total .
That meant China was still comfortably ahead in terms of private car sales , which were 53 % higher than in 2008 .
The top three companies in terms of sales are all joint ventures with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation .
SAIC -GM - Wuling sold just short of one million vehicles , Shanghai Volkswagen sold 728,200 while another SAIC - GM tie - up , Shanghai GM , accounted for 708,000 sales .
Part of the rise was due to moves by the government to stimulate demand .
These included cuts in sales tax for small cars .
Glenn Beck ’s attempt to rape and murder 1st Amendment in 2009 - fails
November 10 , 2009
Court decides
Beck ca n’t ‘ rape and kill ’ domain name
The alleged victim of a rape and murder in 1990 can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing those seeking justice on her behalf will not be silenced by the likes of Glenn Beck any time soon .
That ’s because the FoxNews show host , and rumored suspect , Glenn Beck lost his lawsuit against Isaac Eiland - Hall over the domain name of his site – glennbeckrapedand murderedayounggirlin1990.com .
This decision has made it safe again to ask the question at the heart of the controversy - Did Glenn Beck rape and kill a woman in 1990 ?
And , if he did n’t why has n’t he denied the allegations ?
Due to Beck ’s silence on the issue , concerned Americans are no closer to answering the question today than when the story broke back in the beginning of September .
The site in question was created almost immediately after news of Beck ’s possible involvement in the 1990 rape became public .
The site has become the headquarters for concerned citizens devoted to discovering the truth behind the vicious rumor that Glenn Beck raped and killed a woman in 1990 .
Although Beck has not publicly addressed the allegations , he clearly wants these rumors to go away as evidenced by his botched attempted cover up , which was debunked right here on UnreasonablySafe.com .
The decision is a significant win for not only vaginal rights advocates , but also for freedom of speech lovers too .
Because had the ruling gone in Beck ’s favor , it would ’ve surely discouraged the public from investigating more unsolved 1990 Glenn Beck rape and murder cases .
Although , the court remained silent on the actual rumor itself , its ruling clearly leaves the door wide open for further questioning of Beck ’s supposed innocence .
Some have even suggested that based on Swiss customs , the court ’s silence actually means that it is interested in hearing Beck ’s side of the story and he should promptly confirm or deny the allegations in a very detailed affidavit .
Others were less sympathetic , one anonymous observer of the Beck case said , “ regardless whether WIPO is in Switzerland or not - the fact is we let him walk out of that courtroom without handcuffs .
I mean and we had him in our midst and we let him walk right out the front door - we should have busted him for rape and murder and asked questions last .
It ’s likely that the poor woman in 1990 would have wanted it that way - because I ’m pretty sure he did n’t ask for permission before he raped her and killed her . ”
Surprisingly , Beck ’s supporters have joined his detractors in openly criticizing him and his lawsuit for being deceptively hypocritical .
Many cite his characterization of the freedom of speech as , “ our most precious right ” and people ’s ability to speak out as “ the supposed watchdog of our Republic . ”
Beck seems to think the First Amendment only applies when he ’s the one hurling offensive insults and allegations , and not when he becomes the target of allegations .
Because , while Beck was claiming his freedom of speech protected his brand of incendiary rhetoric from White House criticism of FoxNews , he was simultaneously trying to prevent others from exercising their right to speak out against him .
Despite embarrassing
Beck in court , Eiland - Hall decided to give him control of the site and basically told Beck - ‘ I won , you can have the stupid domain because thanks to you I more than proved my point and I do n’t need it anymore . ’
Eiland - Hall ’s gesture of giving Beck the domain might seem unjustifiably polite , it was actually a sneakily shrewd move because it officially put the ball in Beck ’s court .
Beck was now faced with two options - maintain the site open , or take it down .
While leaving the site open wo n’t make the allegations go away anytime soon - it makes him look like he ’s got nothing to hide .
On the other hand , if he immediately shuts it down he looks like he ’s got something to hide and would surely raise even more suspicions .
Now , ask yourself what would you do , if it was alleged that you had raped and killed a girl in 1990 and wanted the story to go away as quickly as possible ?
If you answered : deny the allegations and leave the site up - you ’re right !!
Well , apparently Beck did n’t think so , as he did the exact opposite and immediately took down the site without releasing a statement .
Time will show that Beck ’s move to shut down the site will only cause the water to get murkier and deeper in the pool of suspicion Beck finds himself wading .
Why has he spent anywhere between $ 500 K – 1.4 million to try and break the will of the brave who dare to ask whether he raped and murdered a woman in 1990 ?
Why did he refuse to deny the allegations at the beginning when doing so would have been free ?
Why do all his actions tend to make him look more and more like he has a terrible secret he ’s hiding ?
While fears of being raped and murdered by Glenn Beck in 1990 will probably always haunt us , thanks to Eiland - Hall and the First Amendment at least we no longer have reason to fear that Beck will come after us for having the courage to ask people like Beck about their murky past .
So it is without any fear that I ask the question on everyone ’s mind - Whether Glenn Beck allegedly raped and murdered a girl in 1990 ?
And , if he did n’t why does n’t he just deny the allegations ?

US President Barack Obama has proposed significant new curbs on the activities of banks to try to prevent future financial crises .
The plans - the most far - reaching yet - include limits to the size of banks and restrictions on riskier trading .
" Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by banks that are too big to fail , " Mr Obama said .
He added he was ready for a " fight " with any banks prepared to lobby against tougher regulations .
US stocks such as JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America fell sharply as the sweeping planned reforms were announced .
JP Morgan lost 6.6 % , while Bank of America gave up 6.2 % .
Limiting risk taking " While the financial system is far stronger today than it was one year ago , it is still operating under the exact same rules that led to its near collapse , " Mr Obama said .
His proposals also include a ban on retail banks from using their own money in investments - known as proprietary trading .
Instead , banks would be limited to investing their customers ' funds .
If these folks want a fight , it 's a fight I 'm ready to have
Barack Obama
Q&A : How will the changes work ?
Tories back US bank limit plans
Send your comments " Banking reforms do not come bigger than those proposed by President Obama , " the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said .
This may mean that some of the US ' biggest banks , such as Bank of America and JP Morgan , whose shares were badly hit , may have to be broken up .
The industry lobby group for banks suggested Mr Obama was trying to return the US to the past .
" The better answer is to modernise the regulatory framework and not take the industry and the economy back to the 1930s , " said the Financial Services Roundtable , an industry group that represents large Wall Street institutions .
In the UK , shadow chancellor George Osborne said that if the Conservatives won the next general election , they would impose an identical dismantling of UK banks to those suggested by the US president .
City Minister Lord Myners said the US proposals were " very much in accordance with the direction we have been setting " .
Fighting talk Mr Obama 's move is his first proposal since Republican Scott Brown 's shock victory in Massachusetts to win a Senate seat .
The Republican victory may make it harder to get Mr Obama 's proposals passed in the Senate , as they are more likely to get held up in political wrangling .
" This is a political effort because of what happened in Massachusetts , " said economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland .
The US President believes that banks are back to their bad old ways too soon after their woes led to the biggest bank global bail out in history
BBC business editor Robert Peston
Peston : Obama to break up banks
Banks have also been lobbying against more stringent regulation .
" If these folks want a fight , it 's a fight I 'm ready to have , " Mr Obama vowed .
The president dubbed his proposals on limiting bank risk the Volcker rule - after Paul Volcker , one of his economic advisors and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve central bank .
The moves follow popular anger at financial institutions , who have been paying large bonuses to staff even as they accepted government bail - outs to keep them going .
Mr Obama 's proposals appear to be a return to the principles underlying the Glass - Steagall Act .
That law - from the 1930s in the aftermath of the Great Depression - separated commercial and investment banking and was eventually abolished in 1999 under President Bill Clinton .
Mr Clinton 's financial secretary at the time , Robert Rubin , previously worked at Goldman Sachs and went on to be an advisor to Citigroup until last year .
The latest proposals follow a $ 117bn ( £ 72 bn ) levy on banks to recoup money US taxpayers spent bailing out the banks .
The tax will claw back some of the losses from a $ 700 bn taxpayer bail - out of US banks known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
It was drawn up in the midst of the financial crisis in 2008 , following the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers and rescue of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) .

Mossad Tied to ‘ Underwear Bomber ’ By Victor Thorn “ His explosives could n’t have blown up his own seat .
Even if full power , it
would n’t have worked . ”
These were the words relayed to me during a Jan. 2 interview with military analyst and counterinsurgency specialist Gordon Duff in regard to the attempt of Christmas Day underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab [ sometimes referred to as Abdulmutallab ] to ignite 80 grams of the explosive PETN on a flight destined for America .
He also explained how the patsy ’s country of origin , Nigeria , is clandestinely controlled by the Israeli army and Mossad .
These entities train the military , sell weapons , run the airports , and wield power over DICON ( Defense Industries Corporation ) .
Furthermore , Mutallab ’s father is a Mossad partner and Israel ’s No. 1 contact in Nigeria .
As the former CEO of his country ’s most influential bank and the man who ran their national arms industry , Mr. Mutallab also harbors extremely close relationships with the U.S. ambassador and CIA chief in Nigeria .
On Nov. 19 , 2009 , Mutallab supposedly felt so alarmed about his errant son ’s behavior that he met with the CIA ’s station chief in Nigeria .
Duff describes the father in a Dec. 31 article for Veterans Today as “ one of the richest people in the world , head of a major bank , head of the national
armaments industry , and close associate of the U.S. ambassador , ” as well as being a Mossad asset .
Yet we ’re to believe that nobody prevented his Yemeni - influenced “ terrorist ” son from boarding a plane ultimately bound for Detroit ?
Another significant detail is being neglected by mainstream media sources .
The firm in charge of security at Amsterdam ’s Schiphol Airport is the Israeli - owned International Consultants on Targeted Security ( ICTS ) .
They ’re also the same outfit responsible for all three airports used by “ Muslim hijackers ” on 9 - 11 .
ICTS also handled security for London ’s bus system during their 7 - 7 “ Muslim bombing , ” while doing the same at Charles de Gaulle Airport when “ shoe bomber ” Richard Reid boarded a plane in Paris on Dec. 22 , 2001 .
When a Michigan passenger , attorney Kurt Haskell , reported that a “ well - dressed ” Indian man arranged for Umar Mutallab to perform a “ walkaround ” without a passport in Amsterdam , ICTS was one of only a few entities that could have permitted this security breach to take place .
Despite tighter screening processes since 9 - 11 , Northwest Airlines Flight 253 experienced no delays in takeoff .
According to the Mathaba News Agency on Jan. 2 , “ It is evident that clearing the terrorist with higher - ups took a matter of a minute or so — the ‘ Indian ’ obviously had a high - level pass ( CIA , Mossad or high - level security clout ) . ”
Then , during the flight , onlookers noted that another passenger spent a great deal of time filming 23 - year - old Mutallab with his camcorder .
Even stranger , once the suspect tried to ignite his “ crotch bomb , ” Mathaba reported , “ Throughout the incident , the man continued recording the terrorist , calmly and without interruption . ”
Next , after the plane landed , another Indian man was led away in handcuffs after bomb - sniffing dogs smelled explosives in his luggage .
Now , more than a week later , officials have refused to release Schiphol CCTV airport footage from Amsterdam , the air - bound “ video passenger ” film , or identify the man arrested in Detroit .
This Indian link does n’t surprise Duff .
“ Israel and India are very close business partners , especially via their military contracts .
Also , the Indian intelligence agency ( Research and Analysis Wing ) works hand - in - hand with Israel .
Essentially , the two governments are one . ”
But the Mossad ’s reach extends even further , directly into the country where Mutallab purportedly trained .
On Oct. 7 , 2008 , BBC News reported , “ Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has said that security forces have arrested a group of alleged Islamist militants linked to Israeli intelligence . ”
The ties go even deeper , straight to Mutallab ’s home country .
In a Sept. 5 , 2008 article by Tashikalmah Hallah and Francis Okeke entitled “ Nigeria : Lawmakers Divided Over Mossad , ” Sen . Nuhu Aliyu voiced his support for their pact with Israel .
“ They ( Mossad ) are professionals , and they are here to help train our own intelligence agents .
I do n’t see any way by which their presence in the country poses a threat to our national security . ”
One final element of the equation needs to be addressed ; specifically , the “ terrorist cell ” that ostensibly trained Mutallab prior to his Christmas Day terror attempt .
However , Duff paints an entirely different picture .
“ There is no al - Qaeda in Yemen .
George Bush released a couple of phony operatives from Guantanamo , and after traveling to the Middle East , they hooked up with the Mossad .
The only reason Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez released
them is because they ’re assets . ”
Of course , the American public is being misled again into believing that this “ lone nut ” terrorist sneaked through the system ( no - fly lists , airport scrutiny etc ) due to mere incompetence , similar to what occurred on 9 - 11 .
Yet Israeli intelligence provided security at the Amsterdam Airport , where Mutallab boarded a plane with no passport ; the NSA is equipped to electronically eavesdrop anywhere around the world ; the Mossad is tied to Yemen , Nigeria and India ; while the suspect ’s father opened up banking and arms contacts in the Middle East while harboring an extremely close relationship with American and Israeli intelligence .
What we ’re being fed is another propagandized cover story that is intended to keep ratcheting up Orwellian - style trauma and fear , all the while further spreading our global “ terror war ” to Yemen and the African continent .

( Issue # 3 , January 18 , 2010 )
Daimler AG , the parent company of Mercedes Grand Prix ( nee Brawn ) has reportedly discovered details of a fraud in relationship to a sponsorship that had been planned for its new Formula 1 team .
According to the respected financial journal Handelsblatt , Brawn GP met with a Henkel employee as long ago as Monaco in May .
They began discussing a deal being worth $ 43 m a year .
By the end of July a three - year deal worth $ 130 m had been agreed .
It was due to begin in March 2010 .
According to the newspaper the scam was discovered only after Brawn and Mercedes did their deal .
Brawn informed Mercedes boss Dieter Zetsche that there was a Henkel deal in place and he spoke directly to Henkel ’s chief executive Kasper Rorsted , who said that the company had no interest in Formula 1 and denied any such agreement .
The result of this was an investigation that revealed that the head of sponsorship and two accomplices were allegedly creating fake paperwork using Henkel stationery to get loans valued at $ 65 m .
They intended to use this money to pay for the sponsorship , but around $ 16 m of that money is reported to be missing .
It is not clear how they intended to convince Henkel that it should agree to a sponsorship it was not funding .
Henkel is now saying that it has no intention of honouring the deal signed by its employee ( nor former employee ) as he did not have the right to agree such a deal .
Daimler wants the cash .
Release : Sanders Puts Hold on Bernanke
WASHINGTON , December 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) today placed a hold on the nomination of Ben Bernanke for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
“ The American people overwhelmingly voted last year for a change in our national priorities to put the interests of ordinary people ahead of the greed of Wall Street and the wealthy few , ” Sanders said .
“ What the American people did not bargain for was another four years for one of the key architects of the Bush economy . ”
As head of the central bank since 2006 , Bernanke could have demanded that Wall Street provide adequate credit to small and medium - sized businesses to create decent - paying jobs in a productive economy , but he did not .
He could have insisted that large bailed - out banks end the usurious practice of charging interest rates of 30 percent or more on credit cards , but he did not .
He could have broken up too - big - to - fail financial institutions that took Federal Reserve assistance , but he did not .
He could have revealed which banks took more than $ 2 trillion in taxpayer - backed secret loans , but he did not .
“ The American people want a new direction on Wall Street and at the Fed .
They do not want as chairman someone who has been part of the problem and who has been responsible for many of the enormous difficulties that we are now experiencing , ” Sanders said .
“ It ’s time for a change at the Fed . ”
The Federal Reserve has four main responsibilities : to conduct monetary policy in a way that leads to maximum employment and stable prices ; to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions ; to contain systemic risk in financial markets ; and to protect consumers against deceptive and unfair financial products .
Since Bernanke took over as Fed chairman in 2006 , unemployment has more than doubled and , today , 17.5 percent of the American workforce is either unemployed or underemployed .
Not since the Great Depression has the financial system been as unsafe , unsound , and unstable as it has been during Mr. Bernanke 's tenure .
More than 120 banks have failed since he became chairman .
Under Bernanke 's watch , the value of risky derivatives held at our nation 's top commercial banks grew from $ 110 trillion to more than $ 290 trillion , 95 percent of which are concentrated in just five financial institutions .
Bernanke failed to prevent banks from issuing deceptive and unfair financial products to consumers .
Under his leadership , mortgage lenders were allowed to issue predatory loans they knew consumers could not afford to repay .
This risky practice was allowed to continue long after the FBI warned in 2004 of an " epidemic " in mortgage fraud .
After the financial crisis hit , Bernanke 's response was to provide trillions of dollars in virtually zero - interest loans and other taxpayer assistance to some of the largest financial institutions in the world .
Adding insult to injury , Bernanke refused to tell the American people the names of the institutions that received this handout or the terms involved .
“ Mr. Bernanke has failed at all four core responsibilities of the Federal Reserve , ” Sanders concluded .
“ It ’s time for him to go . "
If so , gold would go " up , and up , and up " as the only safe haven from fiat paper money .
Private debt is also crippling .
Even if the US savings rate stabilises at 7 pc , and all of it is used to pay down debt , it will still take nine years for households to reduce debt / income ratios to the safe levels of the 1980s .
The castration of pigs prevents the " boar taint " smell in the meat and allows them to contain more fat .
However in practice this can be very different .
Now , for the first time , a scientific team has collected information on the conditions of castration on European pigs .
The main conclusion of the study , that forms part of the PIGCAS project , is that these animals are castrated directly by the livestock farmers , without anaesthetic and in some cases , without respecting the European legislation .
As part of the PIGCAS research project ( Attitudes , practices and state of pig castration in Europe ) , a team of European scientists has just demonstrated that , of the 125 million male pigs slaughtered each year in Europe , 77 % are castrated without anaesthetic .
This investigation , which appears in the most recent issue of the journal Animal , confirms that some countries fail to comply with the regulation for these practices , given that the European legislation states that castration without anaesthetic must be carried out within the first seven days of the animal 's life .
After this period it must be done by a vet using anaesthetic .
Norway and Switzerland have banned surgical castration without anaesthetic to prevent pigs from suffering and now they are looking into enabling the breeding of intact males ( without castrating ) .
However this option also has some disadvantages : " The breeding of ' intact ' males is quite complicated , because when they reach sexual maturity there is more fighting and mounting amongst the animals , in addition to the pigs suffering from stress and injuries , " Maria Font i Furnols , co-author of the study and researcher in the Institute for Food and Agriculture Research and Technology ( IRTA ) , has indicated .
In Spain roughly 30 % of male pigs for conventional production are castrated .
The most common method is surgical castration without anaesthetic .
In non-conventional production , which includes large - scale pig breeding , almost all the males are castrated , as they are slaughtered at heavy weights for the production of high - quality cured products .
According to Font i Furnols , within the IRTA they have already studied aspects of breeding and handling of intact males to try to minimize the negative effects of stopping castration .
They are also working on other alternatives to surgical castration , such as immunocastration , a technique recently authorised in the European Union , which has been used for years in Australia and New Zealand , and which involves vaccinating the pigs to reduce the production of the chemical compounds responsible for the " boar taint " from the meat .
In the case of female pigs , the legislation does not consider castration unless it is for therapeutic or diagnostic reasons .
However based on the PIGCAS project it has been confirmed that in some countries this practice is carried out .
In 88 % of the cases analysed in Europe it is the livestock farmers themselves who carry out the castration .
This is due to the demands of the market .
This way the sexual smell is avoided , a sensorial defect in the meat of some male pigs that are not castrated , it can allow for a better handling of the animals in the farm and it results in the meat containing more fat and finer marbling , a characteristic which is valued in cured products .
A Tourist ’s Afghanistan
Travel Stories : Cullen Thomas recounts an independent traveler 's time in the war - torn country
REUTERS / Jerry Lampen REUTERS / Jerry Lampen
Of course , people in Kabul asked my friend Barry Misenheimer what he was doing in Afghanistan .
Not a spook , not military , not a contractor , not a consultant or NGO worker , he was rarer , more absurd than all those .
“ I ’m a tourist , ” he answered people , recalling his trip recently from his apartment on the Lower East Side .
The other foreigners laughingly called him “ the tourist . ”
And so he was without an agenda , had no objective in Afghanistan other than his own on - the - fly itinerary : to see and experience the country independent of General McChrystal and President Obama , the front pages of the Wall Street Journal .
A middle - aged North Carolinian and former executive for Coca - Cola , Barry had done this before : Sarajevo in 1995 ; Saddam ’s Baghdad in 1998 ; smacking golf balls into the Taedong River in Pyongyang in 2005 ; driving by nuclear facilities in Iran in 2006 .
Chasing war , despotism , political intrigue .
Chasing history .
It had taught him a great deal .
And now he sat at a white linen breakfast table in the Kabul Lodge on Passport Lane .
He ’d arrived on September 11 , 2009 .
That felt very odd , he said .
His companions at the table : a Scottish health consultant for the European Commission ’s support staff to the Afghan government ; a mysterious French woman who said she was working on a book — though people whispered that she must be an intelligence agent ( what white Westerner travels independently to Kandahar in a burqa ? ) — ; and a Dutch man also working for the Afghan government .
Barry asked what they thought :
How safe was it ?
What was the state of the place ?
Each had a different take , and they quickly talked into a heated argument .
“ It was like that story of the blind men touching an elephant , ” Barry said .
The Scottish woman had to review reports of ongoing , hideous things , reports the French woman did n’t see , but then she ’d been to Kandahar in a burqa , and how bad could it be ?
Some expats said it was safe to walk around Kabul , but , as far as Barry saw , “ nobody did . ”

He took room 26 at the lodge , one of the larger bedrooms .
It had dark wood paneling and an eerie feel .
The French woman refused to stay there ; she told Barry the room was haunted .
Haider , who owned the lodge , said the entire place had once been occupied by one of Bin Laden ’s wives .
Had the wife stayed in the room ?
Barry wondered , trying to sleep on the bed .
Had Bin Laden himself been in it ?
Or had they tortured prisoners there , in that very room , as was rumored around the lodge ?
Barry had been to Tuol Sleng .
He changed rooms straight away .
Then the Italian convoy was bombed , not too far away , not too long after Barry had passed that way .
And he went to the site and was appalled by the crater in the road .
He hired a driver and guide and took the road north toward Mazar .
People had said it was the safest .
But outside Pul - e - Khumri he saw the fresh , not even an hour old , charred remains of a bombing , the trees along the road blackened and cracked .
His guide and translator , a former policeman named Esmed , said it had been a suicide bomber , that he ’d been aiming at a U.S. convoy but had killed only Afghan civilians .
Later , Barry looked for reports of this attack , but not even Al Jazeera had word of it .
Even as he ventured out , taking careful steps in a land of war , and was surprised himself to be able to hire a car and just drive north out of Kabul — an unarmed American tourist — he still felt like something was closing around him , on that place .
Outside Balkh , at the No Gombad Mosque , one of the oldest in Afghanistan , a cannabis plant grew naturally at the side of the road , right next to the door of the car where they parked .
Aggressive wasps had made nests in the mosque , the old caretaker lamented , and before a few years ago he ’d never seen any .
Some called the wasps Americans , he joked .
They spied a Japanese man and woman wandering in the area , the only other tourists Barry would see .
And how crazy were they , he thought .
He and Esmed insisted on driving them back into town ; walking was dangerous .
The young Japanese man said he was planning to take a bus from Kabul to Herat , which Barry had been soberly warned was a deadly Taliban route .
He tried to talk the guy out of it .
“ I wanted to tell him that he should just hang himself in his closet , at least save himself the bus fare . ”
Wondering about their fate , back in Manhattan Barry googled “ Japanese tourists , Afghanistan . ”
Nothing , just a story about a different Japanese couple murdered in the country back in 2006 .
At a checkpoint on the road back from Mazar , an Afghan soldier called out to Esmed and Barry ’s driver , “ Why is n’t this American you ’ve kidnapped screaming ? ”
The joke went over huge with the other soldiers .
Barry laughed too .
You scream or you laugh , one of the two .
He flew to Herat .
Through the air is the best way around angry , land - locked Talibs , for they ’re tied to the dirt of the earth and ca n’t touch a tourist tailing it thousands of feet over their turbaned heads .
Then to Bamiyan to see the effaced Buddhas , but on the trip he ’d have to wear a pakol on his head and a scarf over his face .
The road might not be safe , at least not for an American , one with a southern drawl .
After dinner the first night ( everything soaked in oil , naan bread slapped on the floor where people had walked ) , a tall Afghan with dark hair and blue eyes approached Barry outside the restaurant .
“ Welcome to Bamiyan ! ” the jolly fellow called out .
“ No Taliban here .
Safe here .
You want woman ? ”
After roughly a month , having traversed 3,000 miles of the country , 1,500 by road , he estimates , Barry was back in Kabul .
The window for trips like his in Afghanistan was closing , he felt .
Then on the morning of October 8 , one of his last days there , while at breakfast with others in the lodge , he raised his coffee and was accosted by a massive explosion .
A powerful wave pounded through his body as the glass of the windows burst in on him , throwing shards across the room .
A Taliban suicide bomber in a car had detonated just a hundred yards away , at the intersection of Passport Lane and Interior Ministry Road .
He was stopped trying to come down their street , stopped by the guard who Barry waved to each day , the guard whose forearm was found still clutching his rifle .
Stunned but unscathed — unlike the 17 who died in the blast and the dozens of others injured — Barry videotaped the scene not long after : the site of the explosion , the random , vicious disorder left behind : a little picture of hell , dark blood stains splattered on the cement walls lining the road , bees hovering around the spots , the blackened engine block and chassis of the madman ’s car tossed separately down Passport Lane , strangely malevolent things that looked almost alive .
Then chains were tied around these parts and they were disturbingly reanimated as a crane jerked them a few yards at a time through the debris .
Barry wanted to know their names , the bomber , the guard who may have saved their lives .
The bomber , it was reported , was named Khalid , from Paghman , where the Kabul Golf Club is .
Barry had been out there to see it .
Esmed said the guard ’s name was Matin .
Barry wanted them to be real .
The last thing could well have been the two of them looking each other in the face — militant Khalid , noble Matin .
A German business consultant staying at the lodge led Barry and the others in collecting $ 1,000 U.S. for the guard ’s widow .
Weeks later the German wrote the group in an email , “ Some shops opened again but there are no kids anymore in our street on their way to school . ”
Barry was back in New York , staring out over the East River , saying how much talk of the war in Afghanistan sounded like our history in Vietnam .
A tourist ’s Afghanistan , ancient and in trouble .
By the end Barry could n’t help but feel as though he were being stalked .
But he ’ll never forget it .
He brought back a few souvenirs : worn and faded Afghani bills , a Kabul Golf Club key chain , and a ten - inch piece of metal from a car , most likely the bomber ’s , which is carbonized , thin and sharp all around , twisted into an indescribable shape .

reports on an Apple patent that was disclosed last month ( the same day as the Windows 7 launch , incidentally ) that would embed ads within the Apple OS , possibly as a way of subsidizing its hardware .
The claims are eye - opening : " A computer - implemented method for providing an advertisement in a device , the method comprising : providing an operating system of a device with at least one advertisement , the operating system configured to temporarily disable a function thereof and present the advertisement in the device while the function is disabled ; and receiving a report from the device confirming that the advertisement has been presented .
" What this means , in plain English , is that an Apple device could be configured to lock down at least a portion of it until the ad itself was acknowledged , most likely through a button click .
And the ads , not surprisingly , could be used to help defer the cost of the product .
"
In return for paying attention to the advertisements , the user can receive a product or service for free or at reduced cost , or otherwise receive a benefit , " the patent notes .
Users could also " unlock " an ad - free mode through a payment .
Theraises the question that Apple could lose its " cool " reputation by embedding ads in the OS .
It 's not clear that it will ; Apple does n't have to act on its patents , although a significant number of them ( such as multitouch gestures and the Magic Mouse ) seem to end up as products of some form or another .
And Apple make its clear that the ad patent is broad enough to apply to any device : " While the presentation of advertisements is described in examples herein with respect to a personal computer 102 , it should be apparent that the disclosed implementations can be incorporated in , or integrated with , any electronic device , e.g. , a device that has a visual user interface , including without limitation , portable and desktop computers , servers , electronics , media players , game devices , mobile phones , wireless devices , email devices , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , embedded devices , televisions , set top boxes , etc , " the patent reads .
The patent also provides mechanisms to force the user into paying attention to the ad , such as disabling the mouse and keyboard , or switching off or pausing DVD playback .
The patent also postulates that users could " defer " the ads through a " credit system , " but eventually be forced to pay attention to them .
If they do not , penalties could be applied .
" The approaches for verifying user presence can be made progressively more aggressive if the user has failed a previous test , " the patent reads .
" For example , after the user fails the test the first time , the subsequent tests can be made to appear more frequently or at varying times .
As another example , the test (s ) can be made more subtle so as to render them more difficult to perceive , such as by reducing the size of a message box on the screen , or by making an audio prompt more similar to the advertisement in which it is inserted .
" Let 's hope this never comes to pass .
The unanimous approval of a transgender protections law in Cleveland on Monday was an unexpected victory for gay activists working for its passage .
The law bans discrimination in the areas of housing , employment and public accommodations on the basis of gender identity .
Cleveland 's anti-discrimination law already includes sexual orientation , age , race and religion .
A last - minute amendment excludes shared showers , locker rooms and restrooms .
Fears that the legislation was about to fail were proven unfounded when the entire slate of 21 council members voted in favor of the legislation .
David Caldwell , spokesman for the Cleveland - based gay rights group Ask Cleveland , told On Top Magazine last month that he believed the bill still faced an uphill battle .
“ We 're working hard to earn the votes necessary to ensure victory , ” he said .
Going into the vote , activists said they expected the bill to be approved narrowly , but remained uncertain .
The legislation was sponsored by outgoing Council member Joe Santiago , who introduced the bill in August .
Santiago , who is openly gay , lost his bid for a second term in September .
As lawmakers considered a gay - inclusive domestic partnership registry in the spring , several council members were targeted by opponents of gay rights .
A group of mostly Black ministers rallied against the bill , saying it resembled gay marriage , and threatened to unseat members who favored it .
The bill eventually cleared the chamber and Mayor Frank Jackson signed it into law , but the chamber split mostly along racial lines , with only 2 out of 10 African - American members voting in favor of passage .
Gay activists lobbied dissenters of the gay partnership bill ; Ask Cleveland delivered more than 2,500 postcards urging council members to approve the bill and join 6 other Ohio cities that have enacted such protections .
But the fear that Monday 's vote would once again fracture mostly along racial lines remained .
“ It 's … in the African - American community , where our work had the biggest impact , ” said Caldwell .
“ We spoke with over a thousand supportive African - American voters , who helped us dispel the myth that African - Americans do n't support equal rights for the LGBT community – and helped us win the votes of their representatives . ”
Caldwell called the vote a “ game changer ” for gay rights in the city .
There is a strong likelihood that someone in this generation will be the last human to eat a bluefin tuna .
By most scientific accounts , the species hovers on the brink of extinction , if it has n’t already crossed that line .
Should bluefin disappear , much of the blame will go to an organization called the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) , although Carl Safina of the Blue Ocean Institute gave what some consider a more appropriate name , the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna .
There are now only about 34,000 tuna swimming in the entire western Atlantic , down 82 percent from levels when the commission started “ managing ” the fishery .
Representatives from ICCAT ’s 48 member countries have been meeting this week in Porto de Galinhas , Brazil , to go through their annual charade of setting catch limits .
They will be unveiled when the commission adjourns on Sunday .
I telephoned Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Pew Environment Group , who is attending the session , to see how things were going .
She answered just as she was leaving the conference room and heading out to dinner .
I ’m not sure whether she sounded more frustrated or pessimistic .
In an address to ICCAT delegates earlier in the week , Lieberman could n’t have been more clear about her group ’s catch - limit recommendation for Atlantic bluefins : zero .
“ Looking at the science , there ’s nothing else that makes any sense , ” she said .
“ The current quota is driving the species to commercial extinction . ”
Not that ICCAT ever pays much attention to science .
“ Last year ICCAT ’s scientists said that the quota should be no higher than 15,000 metric tons , ” said Lieberman .
“ So they went with 23,000 tons .
In reality , with overfishing and illegal fishing , what they actually took was much higher , probably double the quota .
What we ’re calling for is to suspend the fishery .
Let it recover , and then you can go back to fishing .
But there ’s tremendous opposition , particularly from the European Union , to cutting anything . ”
Bluefins are amazing animals .
They can live for 40 years and attain weights of 1,600 pounds , yet they blast through the water at speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour .
Unlike most fish , they are warm blooded .
In other respects , they have everything going against them .
That warm bloodedness is what makes their meat so tasty .
Tuna grow slowly , and young females lay only a fraction the number of eggs that older ones do .
Yet the old fish are the most sought after .
They only have two spawning grounds , one in the Gulf of Mexico and one in the Mediterranean Sea , and when they are on them , tuna form tight schools , making them easy to catch .
If ICCAT fails to act responsibly ( and I have n’t heard of anyone who is betting that it will ) , Atlantic bluefins ’ last hope for survival could rest with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES ) .
That group will meet in March 2010 to consider a proposal to list bluefin on its Appendix I , which would ban international trade in the fish .
Interestingly , last month ICCAT ’s own researchers reported that the species clearly qualified for inclusion .
If science does n’t convince ICCAT to act logically , maybe commonsense will .
“ We ’re not saying that no one should ever eat bluefin sushi again , ” said Lieberman .
“ We ’re saying that if you want to eat it in the future , you ’ve got to bite the bullet and do the right thing now . ”

Consulting firm AlixPartners has found Mexico to be the cheapest place in the world to manufacture products for the U.S. market .
India comes in second , while China and Brazil are the third and fourth cheapest places .
This is n't news for some Chinese companies , who have been setting up manufacturing capacity in Mexico for years as a way to reduce their production costs .
It 's important to remember that costs , even wages , have been rising rapidly in China over the years .
Combined with transportation and other factors , it all eventually adds up and apparently has .
Moreover , Mexico 's competitive position vs. China is likely to strengthen further , given the yuan could soon be adjusted upward against the dollar .
Someone this author knows well used to help set up factories on the U.S. - Mexico border .
We hear the scale of these factory cities is something to see .
Commodity Online :
The influx of Chinese manufacturers began early in the decade , as China - based firms in the cellular telephone , television , textile and automobile sectors began to establish maquiladora operations in Mexico .
By 2005 , there were 20 - 25 Chinese manufacturers operating in such Mexican states Chihuahua , Tamaulipas and Baja .
The investments were generally small , but the operations had managed to create nearly 4,000 jobs , Enrique Castro Septien , president of the Consejo Nacional de la Industria Maquiladora de Exportacion ( CNIME ) , told the SourceMex news portal in a 2005 interview .
China ’s push into Mexico became more concentrated , with China - based automakers Zhongxing Automobile Co. , First Automotive Works ( in partnership with Mexican retail / media heavyweight Grupo Salinas ) , Geely Automobile Holdings ( PINK : GELYF ) and ChangAn Automobile Group Co. Ltd. ( the Chinese partner of Ford Motor Co. ( NYSE : F ) and Suzuki Motor Corp. ) , all announced plans to place automaking factories in Mexico .

Naked rambler Stephen Gough has been warned he faces spending the rest of his life in prison if he continues to refuse to wear clothes in public .
The former Royal Marine , a veteran of two “ boots - only ” hikes from Land ’s End to John O’Groats , has spent most of the last four years in solitary confinement in Scottish jails after stripping off on a flight to Edinburgh .
Since then he has declined to wear prison uniform or to appear clothed in court resulting in further custodial sentences for contempt .
This week he was found guilty of causing a breach of the peace following his arrest as he left Perth prison in December where he had just finished serving a 12 - month sentence for the same offence .
On that and a previous occasion police have been waiting to re-arrest him at the prison gates .
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis told the 50 - year - old father of two that it did not require " crystal ball gazing " to realise that the same scenario would be repeated if he continued to decline the offer to return to his home in Eastleigh , Hampshire in return for wearing clothes .
Ordering psychological and psychiatric reports she said : " When the day comes for you to be released , you will be apprehended and the same process gone through again . ”
But Mr Gough , who is now representing himself after parting company with his lawyer last year , said he accepted he could " potentially " remain in jail forever and added : " This is about individual freedom . "
It is estimated that the latest round of imprisonment has cost the tax payer in excess of £ 200,000 – a figure which looks set to keep mounting .
Mr Gough completed his first naked ramble across Britain in 2003 during which he was arrested 15 times and spent 140 nights in jail , mainly in Scotland where the authorities hold a dimmer view of public nudity than in England and Wales .
He finished his second hike with his then girlfriend Melanie Roberts three years later .
But it was while returning to Edinburgh to appeal against contempt of court convictions in Scotland that he undressed on board an early morning flight from Bournemouth airport .
Supporters have been urging him to appeal against his convictions for breach of the peace , citing rulings made in cases involving anti-nuclear protesters at Faslane .
They say his behaviour does not constitute a “ serious disturbance to the community ” though some have grown dismayed at his refusal to co-operate .
what 's going on ?
Your Magic Flower is powered by a groovy scientific phenomenon called ' capillary action ' .
Thanks to capillary action , paper absorbs water very rapidly .
When paper gets wet , it swells which causes the folded petals of your Magic Flower to open up .
As the name suggests , capillary action happens inside capillaries and it takes a little explaining .
The capillaries in your body are the minute blood vessels between the end of your arteries and the beginning of your veins .
But ' capillary ' can also mean a tiny tube , like a straw with a teeny - weeny tiny bore .
Straws with very narrow bores are absolutely useless for drinking milk shakes but superb for studying capillary action .
Now you might have noticed that the water level inside a straw is slightly higher than the water level outside .
The water surface also curves up the sides of your drinking glass a tiny bit .
This is all because water is slightly more attracted to glass and plastic than it is to itself .
This upward creeping makes the water surface curve downwards slightly from the edges of a glass container or straw and this shape is called a negative meniscus ( meniscus means crescent shapes ) .
Mercury is slightly less attracted to glass than it is to itself so it does the opposite and bulges upwards in a glass creating a positive meniscus .
Mercury is very poisonous though , so you should never , ever play with it !
Now heres the interesting thing .
If you place a whole bunch of glass straws , each with a slightly narrower bore in water , you discover that the narrower the bore , the higher the water level inside creeps up .
This is capillary action !
Putting glass straws with tiny bores in water is a classic first year physics experiment at university .
I can still remember marvelling at the colourful anti-gravity water inside little glass straws just like the ones in this photo in my first year at QUT .
It s amazing !
So what does all this have to do with your Magic Flower ?
Well , if you put paper under a microscope , youll notice it is not a solid , impenetrable substance .
Paper is made of tiny wood fibres which are tightly interwoven providing amazing strength and a beautiful writing surface .
Even in high quality photocopier paper , there are billions of tiny little gaps between the fibres ( paper towel is made to be especially airy ) .
When paper comes into contact with water , the amazing power of capillary action rapidly draws water into all these tiny spaces .
It s because the water is slightly more attracted to the wood fibres than to itself .
This helps trees and plants to lift water from their roots up to their leaves .
The Sun provides the extra bit of lift required by evaporating water from tiny holes in the leaves called stomata .
This process is called transpiration and we wouldnt be here without it .
But back to your Magic Flower .
When the paper absorbs water ( which it does so well thanks to capillary action ) it swells .
That s why paper goes wrinkly when it gets wet but it also causes any folds to open back up again .
If you folded each neighbouring petal over sequentially , your flower will open very differently than if you folded each opposite pair .
Try experimenting with the order and youll see what I mean .
But the best thing about Magic Flowers is that they simply make you smile .
Whether its someone you fancy or someone whos not feeling too crash hot , a Magic Flower is guaranteed to brighten up their day .

Audio DRM has all but dissapeared from MP3s .
Apple said earlier this year that there would be no more DRM on music available via the ITunes music store .
However , as prolific writer and blogger Cory Doctorow has found out , they still require DRM on their Audiobooks .
DRM does n’t work .
We know it , you know it and even the RIAA knows it .
The FCC has had hearings on it , and even the retailers agree that it is useless , which was why Apple removed DRM from their music .
Unfortunately , it ’s still required for audiobooks that are sold through the iTunes Music Store .
Cory Doctorow , blogger , author and columnist , is not shy of technology or the Internet .
His last book , Little Brother , covered the internet , RFID , terrorism and even the Pirate Party .
Doctorow also served as the European Director for the EFF and co-founded the ORG .
When it comes to DRM , he knows his stuff , and he also knows that DRM does n’t work
So , when he wanted to release an audio version of his new book ‘ Makers ’ without DRM , it seemed a fairly simple prospect .
The publishers , Random House Audio , were amenable to it .
The problem was one of distribution .
There are two major players in this area , Audible and Apple .
Unlike the publishers , they are not so keen on the ‘ no DRM ’ position .
Audible , writes Doctorow in Publishers Weekly , turned them down flat when it came to a DRM - free version of Little Brother last year .
Since they ’re the only retailer on the iTunes music store , that locked out an huge market .
When it came time for ‘ Makers , ’ this time they said yes .
Apple , however , said No. audiobooks have to have DRM .
Does n’t matter what the author or publisher wants , Apple wants DRM , so it ’s DRM or nothing .
The backup plan then was just to sell via Audible .
The problem then , writes Doctorow , is that while the files might not contain DRM , they come with an End User Licensing Agreement ( EULA ) , which effectively does the same thing – DRM by contract .
DRM might be be gone from music as apple proudly proclaimed early this year , but it ’s still alive and kicking .
Often not because of the artist or the publisher wants it , but because it ’s a store requirement .
Indeed , Mr Doctorow is very happy with his publisher , telling TorrentFreak “ Random House Audio has been remarkably flexible and committed to letting me sell my audiobooks without DRM and I ’m incredibly grateful to them and to my editor , Amy Metsch , for all their hard work . ”
Now for Apple and Audible to similarly be flexible and hard working , after all , they did n’t create the work , they ’re just selling it .

In an effort to solidify opposition to gay marriage legislation currently pending in the state legislature , five Senate Republicans today said they will be supporting the civil union law and work instead to make sure it is enforced .
Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean ( R - Union ) along with Sens. Chris " Kip " Bateman ( R - Somerset ) , Jennifer Beck ( R - Monmouth ) , Sean Kean ( R- Monmouth ) and Andrew Ciesla ( R - Ocean ) asked for Democratic senators to join them , saying it 's " unlikely that a bill redefining marriage can pass the Senate . "
Full Star - Ledger coverage of the Gay Marriage Debate in New Jersey
“ Moving testimony in Senate hearings suggests that New Jersey ’s civil union law is not always understood or followed , ” Kean said in an email statement .
“ We need to educate the public about the law , and enhance it if necessary so that no civil union partner is turned away from the hospital bed of a loved one . ”
The senators did not say how they would enforce the current civil union law so that it " provides all rights and benefits that legislators intended , " except to say there should be " strong penalties " for violating it .
Democratic party members and gay marriage supporters have previously reached out to Republican senators believed to be undecided on the issue , in an effort to rally support for the bill .
The legislation passed the Senate Judiciary committee earlier this month but did not have the support needed for a full floor vote .
Proponents of the bill say they are giving the issue a break during the holidays and could post it for debate in the Assembly Judiciary Committee as early as Jan. 4th .
BCG TV News More4 looking to order a full series of Todd Margaret More4 looking to order a full series of Todd Margaret
According to Broadcast Magazine , Channel 4's digital station More4 is looking to order a full series of The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret , a sitcom about an American sales executive for a drinks company who finds himself out of his depth when he is sent to run the UK arm of the business .
The pilot , which was broadcast in November as part of the Comedy Showcase strand , stars Arrested Development 's David Cross , with Sharon Horgan and Russell Tovey .
It was created and is written by Cross and British comedy writer Shaun Pye .
More4 is now said to be keen to order a full 6 episode series of the show , and is currently in negotiations with " a major US partner " to co-fund the development .
If successful , this will be More4 's first original comedy series commission .
Cross , Horgan , Tovey and Will Arnett are all set to reprise their roles .
More 4 plans to air the series in late summer with a repeat on Channel 4 later in the year .
Shane Allen , Channel 4's head of comedy , told Broadcast Magazine that More 4 felt like the show 's natural home as Todd Margaret shared the same " smart and sophisticated " tone as US comedies Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Daily Show , both of which are repeated on the Freeview channel .
He says : " It 's a real passion piece for David , who 's been feverishly writing away since the pilot . "
The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret will become the fourth comedy from the seven - episode 2009 Comedy Showcase pilot season to head for a full series .
Six new 45 - minute episode of Campus , a university - set sitcom from the team behind Green Wing , have already been given the greenlight .

In the first and second part of our effort to speed up our buildbox , we replaced the harddisk with a RAM disk and swapped in a bigger CPU .
This brought the build time down from 03:30 minutes to 02:00 minutes .
Boosting the memory
When we began the journey , we wanted to undercut the 02:00 minutes threshold .
The last component that directly impacts performance of our box was the memory .
We started out with 4 GB of DDR2 - 800 modules .
To have a feeling for the effects , we upgraded to 4 GB of DDR2 - 1066 first and then added another 4 GB , resulting in 8 GB of RAM .
We expected the performance gain to be small , but noticeable .
The RAM disk , for example , is directly affected by memory speed .
As much , but faster
The first upgrade brought the first surprise : Upgrading from DDR2 - 800 to DDR2 - 1066 modules did n’t change anything .
It ’s not that the mainboard or CPU does n’t support the faster RAM , it just seems to be fast enough , despite the data bus clock rate .
Our build process still took 02:00 minutes , reproducible and without exception .
Filling all the banks
The mainboard can load up to 16 GB of RAM , but our budget just allowed to buy 8 GB of DDR2 - 1066 RAM .
We installed it and ran the same 32 bit Ubuntu Linux as before .
The build process took 02:00 minutes , which was expected now .
Changing to 64bit
We changed to boot harddisk , installed a 64 bit Ubuntu Linux and ran the build again .
Still 02:00 minutes .
The switch to 64 bit was n’t a big deal with Java , but some of the included native libraries complained about the change .
Recompiling them solved the issue .
Finally reaching the target
As a last measure , we increased the maximum memory of the build JVM to the biggest value it would accept .
This was - Xmx2600 m , a surplus of 600 MB to the original setting .
This sped up the build process by five seconds , it took 01:55 minutes now .
Conclusion and perspective
We ’ve reached our anticipated target of less than two minutes build time .
We exceeded our original budget of 500 EUR , but bought some parts that finally were n’t used in the build box , but elsewhere .
The two parts that made the whole difference were the CPU and some more memory to spend it on the RAM disk .
If you want to speed up your single build box , aim for the CPU / RAM combo and try to install a RAM disk to perform all the work on .
This leads me to the perspective of the next part of the series :
If you plugged in the most expensive CPU and enormous amounts of RAM to speed up your buildbox , you still are n’t done .
You should invest some time to look into distributed builds .
Hudson as our continuous integration server provides nearly instant “ build slave ” support .
With this feature , you can set up a whole build farm to further increase your build throughput .
Stay tuned for “ Part IV : Beyond the box ”
Severe unemployment worsens in cities
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of U.S. metropolitan areas with jobless rates above 15 % increased in November , according to government figures released Tuesday , despite the biggest one - month drop in the national rate in more than three years .
The Labor Department said 17 of 372 metropolitan areas surveyed suffered unemployment rates of at least 15 % last month , up from 15 metro areas in October .
National unemployment improved to a seasonally adjusted 10 % in November from the 26 - year high of 10.2 % hit in October .
The rate had climbed for 12 out of the previous 13 months before November .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com expect the national rate to edge up to 10.1 % when the Labor Department releases its December jobs report Friday .
Three areas in Michigan posted jobless rates higher than 15 % , including Detroit .
The city wrecked by the collapse of the auto industry continued to lead the nation 's areas of 1 million people or more with the highest unemployment rate in November at 15.4 % .
California 's Inland Empire , including Riverside , San Bernardino and Ontario , ranked second to Detroit among larger areas with an unemployment rate of 14.2 % in November .
El Centro , Calif. , held its place as the metropolitan area with the highest unemployment rate at 29.2 % , down from an upwardly revised 31.9 % in October .
The second highest rate was in Yuma , Ariz . , at 21.1 % , a drop from 23.3 % in October .
Jobless rates were higher than 10 % in 125 metropolitan areas in November , up from 123 in October .
Overall , 143 cities in the Labor Department report had unemployment rates above the non-seasonally adjusted national figure of 9.4 % , while 229 reported jobless rates below it .
The three metro areas with the lowest unemployment rates in November were all in North Dakota , with Bismarck at 3.4 % , followed by Fargo and Grand Forks at 3.7 % .
Large cities with the lowest jobless rates were New Orleans and the Washington , D.C. metro areas , each at 6.1 % .
Oklahoma City followed close behind with an unemployment rate of 6.4 % .
Sony 's booth at CES was an orgy of televisions , many of which displayed 3D content .
One of the busiest areas was a display hooked up to a PlayStation 3 , where show - goers could get their hands on one of the most - hyped game releases .... in 3D .
That 's right , Gran Turismo 5 was demoed using the latest and greatest screen and the most over - used gimmick at CES .
So how was it ?
After putting on the glasses and playing a good session , it 's unclear if the 3D effect adds anything of real worth to the experience .
The game looks great , and it plays just as well as you could imagine — this is Gran Turismo 5 , after all — but after a few minutes I was ready to take the glasses off and play the game using the standard graphics on a normal television .
Seeing both your arms and the dashboard in front of you while the track races by in 3D is definitely cool , but the graphics were dimmer than you 're used to from a standard set , and wearing the glasses on top of my normal glasses was n't exactly an optimal experience .
After playing Gran Turismo , I felt almost like I had experienced a very novel arcade game .
It was certainly fun for ten minutes or so , and it 's suitably impressive to see Sony 's technology shown off with a such a big - name title , but staying at home and playing games for hours and hours in 3D ?
That 's going to be a very hard sell for the forseeable future .
A timely study in the journal Human Factors suggests why texting while driving is riskier than talking on a cell phone or with another passenger .
Human factors / ergonomics researchers at the University of Utah found that texters in a driving simulator had more crashes , responded more slowly to brake lights on cars in front of them , and showed impairment in forward and lateral control than did drivers who talked on a cell phone while driving or drove without texting .
Researchers Frank Drews and colleagues found evidence that attention patterns differ for drivers who text versus those who converse on a cell phone .
In the latter case , the researchers say , " drivers apparently attempt to divide attention between a phone conversation and driving , adjusting the processing priority of the two activities depending on task demands . "
But texting requires drivers to switch their attention from one task to the other .
When such attention - switching occurs as drivers compose , read , or receive a text , their overall reaction times are substantially slower than when they 're engaged in a phone conversation .
The type of texting activity also appears to make a difference ; in this study , reading messages affected braking times more than did composing them .
The hazards of texting while driving continue to receive broad national and international attention as accident rates attributed to this practice increase .
As a result , a growing number of U.S. cities and states , as well as Canadian provinces , ban texting while operating a vehicle .
Drews et al. noted that according to CTIA ( www.ctia.org), more than 1 trillion text messages were sent in 2008 in the United States alone .
To find why and how much drivers are impaired during texting , the researchers engaged 20 men and 20 women between the ages of 19 and 23 in both a single task ( straight driving ) and a dual task ( driving and texting ) in a high - fidelity simulator .
The participants , experienced texters with an average of 4.75 years of driving experience , received and sent messages while the researchers observed their brake onset time , following distance , lane maintenance , and collisions .
The crash risk attributable to texting is substantial .
One possible explanation is that drivers who text tend to decrease their minimum following distance and also experience delayed reaction time .
For example , in the Drews et al. study , drivers ' median reaction time increased by 30 % when they were texting and 9 % when they talked on the phone , compared with their performance in a driving - only condition .
Notwithstanding the safety risk of texting while driving , previous research by Drews and colleagues at the University of Utah -- not to mention crash data and widespread legislation -- makes clear that using a phone while driving is dangerous .

PESARO , Italy 
One summer day in 1964 a fishing trawler from Fano , a small seaside town a few miles south of this provincial capital on the Adriatic , unexpectedly dredged up a life - size bronze statue from the ocean ’s depths .
Most likely fashioned in ancient Greece and lost at sea after being looted by Romans , the sculpture is now a centerpiece of the Getty Villa , part of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles .
If Italian prosecutors have their way , however , its time in America could soon be at an end .
The statue , called “ Victorious Youth ” in the Getty catalog but better known as the Getty Bronze ( after the museum ’s founder ) , depicts an athlete crowned with an olive wreath .
It was originally thought by some archaeologists to be the work of Lysippos , the renowned sculptor of the fourth century B.C. , though more recent studies date it to the second or third century B.C.
It is widely held to be one of the finest original Greek bronzes to have survived from the classical era ( most bronzes from that time are Roman copies ) , which helps explain why it has been at the heart of a complex legal dispute for decades .
The latest round was fought on Friday , in a court here , where Italian prosecutors and lawyers for the Getty presented closing arguments in a case dealing with one key question :
Was the museum acting in good faith when it purchased the statue for a little less than $ 4 million in 1977 ?
The Italians assert that the bronze was smuggled out of Italy ( after being buried in a cabbage patch and later hidden by a priest ) without the proper export papers , and that the museum was willfully negligent in carrying out due diligence before buying the work .

It ’s a pity .
News Hounds usually pegs Fox News pretty accurately .
But the blog has slipped lately .
For instance , a post today accuses the corporate media leviathan of hating Obama more than al - Qaeda .
“ Those America lovers over at Fox Nation are so obsessed with ginning up hatred for President Obama , there ’s not much room for focusing on what Al Qaeda is up to .
They ’re whom I would consider the real enemies of America .
But judging from the top stories and the comments , the residents of Fox Nation — readers and writers – seem to think that the real enemy is our president .
Many of the comments even say so , ” writes Ellen .
News Hounds points to a Fox Nation article citing the scurrilous neocon Ralph Peters who says “ the bomber ’s ineptitude preserved the lives of nearly 300 innocents . ”
Did ineptitude place a man with a camcorder who videotaped the patsy Abdulmutallab on the flight as well ?
In predictable fashion , Peters — a retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel who once drew up a map of a reorganized Middle East — reduces the issue to a ridiculous black and white caricature .
According to Peters , everybody on the plane was Christian and the plan was to engage in yuletide terror and mass murder .
“ By continuing to lie to ourselves .
Although willing — at last — to briefly use the word ‘ terror , ’ yesterday President Obama still refused to make a connection between the action , the date and Islam , ” Peters declares .
It is sad both so - called liberals and conservatives are so blindsided by propaganda and spin they cannot recognize a false flag operation when they see one .
It should be obvious by now — from the well - dressed man escorting the clueless Nigerian wanna - be underwear bomber to a mysterious man videotaping the operation — that the Christmas event is not what Fox and MSNBC or the rest of the corporate media tell us it is .
[ efoods ]
Fox Nation is a rest stop for neocons who want to kill Muslims and News Hounds is an excuse to protect Obama from criticism .
Far too many liberals are oblivious to the fact Obama is nothing if not a cigar store Indian for the banksters who do n’t give a whit about political striping .
Liberals and neocons are unable to accept or even recognize an exhaustively documented fact — al - Qaeda was created by the CIA and is not even an organization in the commonly accepted sense of the word .
It is a government and corporate media manufactured hobgoblin designed to scare people into accepting the destruction of the Constitution , the Bill of Rights , and acquiescing to endless war waged on behalf of bankers and transnational corporations .
The real enemy is not Fox Nation , as News Hounds believes .
It is a cartel of international bankers who have a vested interest in keeping people stupid and distracted by a false right - left sideshow .

Stand up and repeat these words in marching cadence :
“ I went down to the market
Where all the people shop
I pulled out my machete
And I began to chop
I went down to the park
Where all the children play
I took out my machine gun
And I began to spray ”
This is a chant our young are taught to march to in our military today , and this is how two young veterans of the Iraq War begin their presentations to groups across the country .
Late last fall , Josh Stieber and Conor Curran spoke to a gathering of Veterans For Peace and civilian peace activists in San Francisco , as part of their six months of walking and biking from the East Coast to the West to engage in dialogue about war and to become involved in community service along the way .
Both young men are from small American heartland towns – Josh from Maryland and Conor from Ohio .
They did not know each other until after they got themselves out of the military .
They spoke of their motivations for joining the Marines , their experiences in Iraq and the turning points that made them reject violence .
The two called their cross-country odyssey , “ The Contagious Love Experiment ” – certainly a retro , ‘ 60s “ Hippie Haight - Ashbury ” moniker to more mature ears .
The tag is both innocent and naive , but on a deeper level , it is their counterbalance to the brutality and disillusionment they experienced .
Their story and reasoning are worth listening to .
Josh , a tall , blond , “ all - American - type ” in his early 20s , was in junior high school in Maryland when September 11th happened .
His determination to , as he saw it , protect his country was initiated when his parents took him to see the damage at the Pentagon , and so he joined the Marines straight out of high school .
Raised as a devout Christian , he pushed aside doubts while in basic training and forced himself to answer “ yes ” when asked , “ Will you kill a ‘ hostile ’ even if lots of civilians are around who will get hurt ? ”
Conor , thin and tall with black curly hair , also became a Marine , but spoke more of being alienated during and after high school , wanting to fit in and be accepted , using “ lots of drugs , ” getting into debt , and not having a skill or education to direct him .
So at 20 years old , “ The Few and The Proud ” seemed to give him all the answers .
At the time , he said , being in the Marines helped him to change his values and gave him a “ mission accomplished ” feeling .
He became a good soldier .
But Conor ’s second tour was when ‘ it got heavy . ’
Josh spoke frequently of his Christian upbringing that taught him principles in complete opposition to the killing , fear and hatred he learned in Iraq .
( To say nothing of the disconnect of being told that America was “ liberating Iraq and bringing Freedom and Democracy ” and the “ chop and spray ” chant ! )
He said fear of and hatred for the Iraqi people would build up in the troops to the point where ripping apart homes , wrecking gardens and property , and arresting and abusing prisoners became commonplace .
On the street , going out of the way to run a truck through mud to spray old people , or , during house searches , taking the dolls of little girls , twisting their heads off then giving them back became acceptable behavior .
“ Why do we make the locals fear the U.S. military more than the insurgents ? ” he wanted to know .
“ We out - terrorized the terrorists ! ”
Josh vividly recalled pulling guard duty on a prisoner with another young American soldier right after coming from a church service .
Josh thought of the moral and religious lessons he learned at home in Maryland : “ blessed are the peace makers ; ” “ turn the other cheek ; ” and “ love thine enemy , ” as his buddy talked of how he was going to brutalize the prisoner .
“ Jesus would n’t let himself get punked around , ” was his friend ’s reply when Josh objected on Christian principles .
The insanity of war gradually became apparent to Josh during his 14 - month tour of duty , as when he and his squad detained a man with ample evidence that the Iraqi had been involved in attacks on American soldiers .
This man turned out to be the mayor of the town , and U.S. military authorities ’ regular “ payments ” of school supplies and cash ensured a halt in attacks on Josh and his men , at least in that part of town .
So much for “ we will not negotiate with terrorists , ” he thought .
These revelations led this idealistic youth into a “ bleak ” period , he said , with feelings of hopelessness , “ always looking over my shoulder , ” and the realization that he ’d always let others tell him how to think and how to live up to their expectations .
Neither young man spoke of killing anyone , and no one from the audience asked .
But each spoke of turning points when they decided they could not continue as soldiers .
For Josh this was a gradual process , but for Conor it came during his second tour while conducting random searches with his squad for weapons caches in Ramadi , without adequate intelligence .
They set upon a home with an exceptionally beautiful garden and proceeded to tear it apart and dig it up .
“ Then the man of the house came out with a tray and served us all tea ! ” said Conor .
“ He spoke English and wanted to be our friend .
He showed love to us and we were terrorizing him . ”
Thus the seed for “ The Contagious Love Experiment ” was planted .
Conor and Josh had many encounters along the roads of America since the spring , but the one that stood out for them was meeting a Vietnam War veteran who told them , “ Instead of uniting against a common enemy , we should unite for a common goal – peace . ”

WASHINGTON , Nov 16 ( Reuters ) - Two U.S. Senators on Monday unveiled bipartisan legislation aimed at doubling nuclear power in 20 years and increasing funding for research into low carbon sources of energy .
Sponsored by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander and Virginia Democrat Jim Webb , the bill would provide $ 100 billion in loan guarantees for carbon - free electricity projects , adding to the existing $ 47 billion loan guarantee program .
Although the additional loan guarantees would not be limited to nuclear power , the nuclear industry would likely be the major recipient of the extra money because it is one of the most established low carbon energy sources .
The legislation comes as Senate Democrats work to draw more support for controversial climate legislation by crafting measures that would increase support for nuclear power and offshore drilling .
This bill is separate from the climate legislation currently making its way through the Senate , said Alexander and Webb .
Alexander said senators working to advance the climate bill may try to incorporate some provisions from his legislation , but that was not his intention .
Alexander does not support establishing an economy - wide , cap - and - trade system to lower carbon emissions .
" I do believe that climate change is an issue and we need to deal with carbon in the air , " Alexander told reporters at an American Nuclear Society conference .
" I think the most effective way to do it is to double nuclear production and to do heavy ( research and development ) on alternative energy , " he added .
The lawmakers ' energy bill would cost up to $ 20 billion over 10 years .
In addition to the loan guarantees , the bill would provide $ 750 million annually for 10 years to research and development of : carbon capture and storage , advanced biofuels , batteries for electric cars , solar power and recycling used nuclear fuel .
After narrowly passing the House earlier this year , climate legislation that would limit greenhouse gas emissions has run into opposition in the Senate even from some moderate Democrats .
[ ID : nCLIMATE ]
Webb raised concerns about the effectiveness of the climate legislation in Congress and said he does not back the Senate bill in its current form .
" I have a lot of reservations about cap and trade as a concept , " Webb said .
" And I have very strong reservations about the notion that we should apply different standards to ourselves in terms of global warming than other countries such as China . "
The United States is headed to international negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen next month .
U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders signaled over the weekend that a legally binding deal for reducing global carbon emissions will not be reached at the meeting .
Instead , the leaders expect to develop a framework for an international climate agreement .
U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about that setting targets to limit the nation 's carbon emissions would make U.S. industries less competitive , if major emitters such as China do not agree to similar cuts .

Every time I watch Rick Sanchez on CNN or every time I get a new follow update from someone I know in real life , who 12 months ago made fun of me for being on Twitter , I question its value over time : are Twitter and other social networks destined to niche status or are they so embedded in our lives that they are now an indispensable part of our society ?
To answer , we can take a look at some other community - based cultural phenomena as a way to shine a light on whether or not social networks will survive to the next iteration of the web .
Unlike most Internet people , when I think of Phish , I think of music , of road trips , of community , and not the scams that have co-opted the name .
Phish the band has been around since 1983 , just a bit before the idea of a phishing scam .
Yet , there is a kernel of history set aside for Phish as pioneers in both music distribution and in creating a web community .
When we look at bands and artists that foster community ( and sometimes endless jams ) , we can see parallels to the rise of social networks .
The Soundtrack ( and Memoirs ) to Our Lives
Indeed , music can be argued as a universal language where you do n’t need to know the vocabulary to still understand the content .
So is the case for social networks .
Each social networking site has its own terminology and its own etiquette , but you do n’t need to understand all of it to get value from it ; you can understand and find value in the site — much as you can with music — in any way you want and it is still a valid idea .
If music plays the soundtrack to our lives , these days , for many of us , social networks act as our memoirs .
But our embrace of sites like Twitter and Facebook is more about how we use the site , as experiencing a Grateful Dead or Phish concert is more about how we interpret the music .
Music , because of its seemingly infinite ways of being interpreted , is an emotional product .
Music makes us laugh , it makes us cry , it makes us feel ; but most importantly , music connects people .
Think of your closest friends and odds are they share similar musical tastes as you .
Maybe you ’ve even met some of your friends as a result of your love of the same type of music .
In other words , music creates community .
Fan Communities are About the Fans
There are certain bands that are defined by their community and the jam - band scene has produced two massive sub-cultures : Deadheads and Phisheads ( just do n’t compare them to each other in front of fans , because as they will heatedly tell you both bands are intricately different , yet intrinsically conjoined ) .
Each of these bands has a rabid fan - base that were early adopters of technology , evangelizing the music and spreading the gospel of front men Jerry Garcia or Trey Anastasio .
Sounds a bit like the early adopters of Twitter , peddling the service to friends , family and clients , while at the same time praising Ev and Biz and Jack as the Internet version of The Beatles , right ?
The parallel goes farther than music to the cultural phenomenon created by all dedicated fan communities .
Star Wars , Harry Potter , Twilight to name a few , all have fans that are devoted to these products .
While these examples are part of the popular culture and have received tremendous amounts of , for lack of a better word , fanfare , the communities that have popped up around them are still niche .
Let 's look at Harry Potter more closely .
The Harry Potter series – both book and film – is a once - in - a- generation kind of occurrence .
The books caused people to read – amazing but true – and spawned a community of wizard and muggle lovers who would congregate to read the story or act out the plot .
This community also used the online forum to help solidify their presence .
Sites like Mugglenet.com and The Leaky Cauldron are centered on the fans as much as they are on the Potter story .
These sites built a community for Potter - lovers to visit and share information .
In fact , the creators of each site have been able to publish best - selling books of their own about their experiences in and with the greater Harry Potter fan community .
The Grateful Dead and Phish have similar sites .
Dead.net and Phantasy Tour ( a site that started out as a play on another niche community , fantasy sports ) enabled ‘ heads ’ to meet and talk with one another before , during and after shows .
They were ( and continue to be ) places where like minds could congregate to discuss their favorite music , favorite films , favorite books and how the influence of the Dead or Phish led them to where they are .
These sites were the precursors to social networks ; people created meet - ups at rest stops along the band ’s touring schedule ; people traded music and ideas .
In fact , Phantasy Tour , which initially sprang up for Phish , now has communities for several bands , such as the Disco Biscuits , Umphrey ’s McGee and solo efforts of Phish ’s front man .
Both Harry Potter and social networks are wildly popular at the moment , but the Potter series is at once finite and immortal .
Finite in that there is no new content coming and immortal because books and film live on forever , especially when there ’s a cult audience .
The same can be said of music — Rick Astley may not be putting out any new singles , but we 're still being Rickrolled all these years later .
Twitter and Facebook are n’t finite or immortal , they are evolutionary ; they will shape - shift in how they are used by different ( read : larger ) communities , but will be where we get our information .
Adapting with the Community
In the end , though , many of these thriving niche - oriented cultural communities are destined to adapt as their fans continue to evolve with the product .
If the fans did n’t push the product , Phish or The Dead ( and to a different extent , films like “ Star Wars ” or “ Star Trek ” where the audience literally dictated the earnings potential ) would n’t have been able to evolve .
In the cases of Phish and the Dead , the bands were propelled by the way the audience recorded shows and how those recordings were distributed , and the bands adapted along with their fans .
The Grateful Dead has always been known as a band that wanted the free flow of their music to pass from fan to fan .
But once technology dictated that they could make money off better quality sounds , they took a step back and wanted to charge fans for music they had previously obtained for free over the decades .
Obviously , this did n’t go over too well with the fan base , and the Dead compromised by allowing the site Archive.org to stream high - quality ( soundboard ) shows and let fans download audience recordings ( “ the taper ” is an entirely separate community within the jam - band scene ) for free , which are usually of a poorer quality .
Phish , too , has been at the forefront of " community - based " technology and the fans are able to influence how the band uses technology .
The band created LivePhish.com earlier this decade , where fans can purchase high - quality audio of that night ’s concert for a low price , because the community ( especially those who were n’t able to attend a specific concert ) was clamoring for the band to use the Web .
This past tour , UStream was flooded with Phish fans because someone figured out how to stream content via his iPhone , potentially ushering in a huge moneymaker for the music industry .
Imagine , for example , that Phish and their record company strategically placed high - def cameras around the stage and broadcast it over the Internet for $ 10 per show .
How many fans would pay for the right to watch live , high - definition streaming concerts , instead of poor - quality , handheld , fan cams ?
My guess is that especially for deeply community - oriented bands like Phish , where each show is something to dissect and discuss with others , many fans around the world would purchase .
Thousands of people watched this tour ( the first in 5 years ) and it ’s easy to think that because the fans ( and thus , the band ) believe sharing content ( through tapes , then CDs , then MP3s and now Ustream ) is how to keep the community strong that this same philosophy can be attributed to social networks .
These major developments – and yes , they are major , as a band needs to view themselves not solely as artists , but as a business , and these actions help propel the business – of forcing the band to adapt to both technology and its fans came from the community .
We see time and again on Twitter and Facebook how the community pushes the brand .
We now have tweets instead of updates on Twitter because the community called postings tweets and rejected Twitter 's original terminology .
The company eventually caught up and adapted .
By paying attention to how their users are actually utilizing the service , sites like Facebook and Twitter may be able to find those elusive business models .
Just this week , for example , Twitter redesigned their homepage to put a focus on news , trends , and cross-cultural sharing .
None of these were likely envisioned as uses of Twitter originally , but sharing news and non-trivial information is how many people have begun to use the service .
In continually adapting to their community , Twitter might be paving the way to future potential profitability .
Will Social Networking Remain Niche ?
So , taking all this into consideration , are Twitter , Facebook , and the rest destined to ultimate niche status or are they vital to our culture ?
Before we discuss the position in our culture of social networks , let ’s quickly look at how Phish and the Dead fit into our culture .
While many will argue that Phish and the Dead are the ultimate niche bands , the bands ( and subsequently their followers ) are actually cultural indicators .
Synonymous with the " hippy " lifestyle and Haight - Ashbury in San Francisco , the Grateful Dead helped spark the counter - revolution of the late 1960s .
Members of the community that emerged around the Dead fill every walk of life in America and can be seen from the NBA to the most trusted anchor man of his time .
Phish , on the other hand , has become a long - running joke of sorts within the pop culture crowd .
They have their own Ben and Jerry ’s Ice Cream flavor ( as does the late lead man of The Grateful Dead ) and have even appeared on The Simpsons .
Yet even though their mugs have graced the cover of Rolling Stone , they have appeared on Letterman , and feature - length articles have been written about them ( and their fans ) in Entertainment Weekly , they still are not considered part of the mainstream .
Think about this : the Grateful Dead never had multiple number one hits yet sold out 70,000 seat venues like Giants Stadium .
Phish never had heavy rotation on MTV or the radio yet they are able to hold festivals for 80,000 + fans in the swamps of Florida or the mountains of Vermont .
But all of the above would not have happened without the fans .
General society can learn about culture as a whole from the bands ’ followers – from how group think works , to how messages spread and how economies will arise within groups .
In our society , we ’ve seen time and again how the minority drives the majority until the majority embraces the minority .
It comes incrementally , like women ’s suffrage or civil rights for blacks or the current gay rights movement .
Social networks are now straddling the line between minority and majority .
There just needs to be some push , and it ’s happening .
Recent studies suggest that 10 % of Twitters account for 90 % of the activity .
Clearly , these evangelical users cannot sustain the Twitter brand , but we ’re now starting to see pop culture take the baton .
We 're starting to see the early adopter minority influence the mainstream majority .
Twitter has entered our cultural consciousness .
Athletes tweet , rock stars tweet , actors tweet , reporters tweet , teachers tweet , doctors tweet , lawyers tweet .
Kids , teens , college kids , graduate students , parents , grandparents all tweet .
Even politicians tweet !
If all these groups tweet , how is it not embedded in our culture ?
The technology and the service are both affected by and adapt to the communities that use Twitter .
Hell , there ’s a whole economy surrounding Twitter .
Facebook has also crossed the proverbial chasm and affected the mainstream consciousness .
The site has expanded from the college student community to the college students ' parents and Facebook has changed the way we view and understand content sharing .
According to AddtoAny , more people use Facebook to share links than any other service .
Indeed , 24 % use Facebook compared to 10 % for Twitter and 11 % for email .
But as the mainstream audience catches on to these niche / sub - cultural groups , there are lessons to be learned .
Most abundantly ( and perhaps , lucratively , too ) is how brands ( both large and small , personal or corporate ) should be using these sites .
Conclusion
Last week , I was having a conversation with someone in the PR field and he said that his client was asking if they should spend time and money learning about Twitter if the next big thing ( whatever it may be ) is right around the corner .
My friend had no idea what to say .
My response , though , was simple : yes .
If the client put the time in to learn about how blogs could be useful to its brand , they would n’t be asking about Twitter ( or other social networks ) , because they would have the fundamentals in place and could explore on their own or with a guided hand .
They would understand that community propels brands in multiple directions and users are their best salespeople .
We saw it with the Dead , we saw it with Phish , we even saw it with Michael Jackson .
Which brings us back to the original question : are Twitter and other social networks destined to niche status or are they so embedded in our lives that they are now an indispensable part of our society ?
Social networks are still new , but they are much more than fads .
They will continue to evolve as we become more dependent on them for information – from where we get our news to sending pictures from your honeymoon .
User generated content , whether through blogs or microblogs or status updates or whatever , is what shapes a community , and which in turn , shape society .
Social networks played a large part in our political game this past cycle in the US and elsewhere , and will also continue to play its role in shaping how companies participate in the conversation and how they can use social networking as a great customer service tool .
In short , social networking , like rock and roll , is here to stay .

If you follow my tips regarding this recipe you cant fail .
Ive made it 3 times and the best meat I found was cubed steak .
Flour tip :
Add any spices you like ..
I added garlic powder and blackened spice .
Important in the first dredge of flour press the meat into the flour hard on both sides to get it to stick and shake off excess then go to buttermilk and back to flour and be sure to recoat heavily in 2nd flour pass to cover all the wetness from the buttermilk .
Let it rest for 5 - 10 minutes on wax paper Frying tip : I used an electric skillet make sure the oil ( I used wesson ) is deep enough to basically submerge the meat .
Approx 1.5 inches deept
If you dont have enough oil your batter will fall off .
I also used an cast iron skillet which works fine too but I like the electric skillet because of the temperature gauge and the ability to cook more pieces .
Its really good if you spice up the flour mixture as much or as little as you like and use cubed steak because its more tender .
Happy frying RECENT EDIT
I have found that if use extra seasonings and you put your extra seasonings in the liquid ( buttermilk ) and add just salt and pepper to the dry ( flour ) u get a much better coloring on the batter .
It keeps things like garlic powder or spicy seasonings from burning when they are in the liquid protected by the flour .

The three stars are because 2 cups of oil is WAY too much for 4 steaks .
Otherwise the recipe is ok .
I use tenderized sirloin salt and pepper the steak cutlets dip in beaten egg then in flour with more salt and pepper .. have about 1/4 cup of VEGETABLE oil ready in large skillet and carefully place the steak in the hot oil watch carefully and turn down the heat ( Med / low ) so the oil does n't get too hot and burn the flour coating .
When LIGHT brown on one side turn over .
If you need to add a little more oil do it by the Tablespoonsful as necessary .
The secret to keeping the coating from falling off is to have oil hot when you put the steaks in it .
Also Olive
Oil will burn faster than veg .
oil so I would not recommend it for this type of frying .

This is quite similar to the recipe I grew up with .
Chicken - fried steak was one of my mother 's specialties and this approximates her " recipe . "
The gravy is absolutely awesome and is just like you might find at a good family restaurant !
I did add a couple of teaspoons of chicken bouillon which made the gravy taste a little fuller .
The buttermilk did n't seem to appreciably effect the flavor though it does make a thicker liquid mixture which probably helped the flour stick to the meat better .
Mom taught me to use cast iron skillets for chicken - fried steak -- the cast iron skillets and temperature of the grease -- are the keys to getting the breading to adhere to the meat .

This was ok but not great .
To enhance the flavor I used Italian bread crumbs .
Was too lazy to make the gravy .
Meat was very tender .
If you have good quality non -stick pans the breading will not fall off the steak .
Also pan - fried steaks in about 1 T olive oil .
I doubt I 'll make this again .

Recognizing that California and Australia are " inextricably linked to the serious changes and challenges of an accelerating decreasing availability of water and its supply juxtaposed to the demands of ever increasing populations , " according to Grame Barty , regional director of the Americans for the Australian Trade Commission , the L.A. - based commission hosted a one - day event Thursday to bring together water sustainability experts from both sides of the Pacific in what it hopes " will become an important annual exchange of issues and solutions between the USA and Australia . "
It 's part of the annual G'Day USA : Australia Week celebration .
Australia , it seems , could offer a model of how to adapt in California , where , despite this weekend ’s rains , the state remains in a third year of drought -- a drought many water officials expect not only will continue but continue to be exacerbated by a growing population and climate change considerations .
When California water officials look into the future , many of them see Australia : a vast , arid continent that has been suffering through drought for more than a decade .
Severe shortages have prompted Australia to implement strict water - saving measures throughout the country .
It has required residents to use less water in their homes , caused government to build large - scale desalination plants and led farmers to implement drip irrigation systems .
Playing host to a wide range of stakeholders , including utilities , government officials , business leaders , academics and nonprofits , the Australia - USA Water Sustainability and Management Forum covered topics such as trading water rights , the effects of climate change on water , water - demand management and urban water planning for growing populations .
" The past is no longer a guide to water management , " said Bradley Udall , director of western water assessment for the University of Colorado at Boulder .
" Climate theory models all point us in one direction , and that is a future with less water .
We need to think here in the U.S. about how to deal with that now , not later . "
Udall said the current situation in Melbourne , Australia , which has watched its water reserves decline from 100 % in 1997 to 30 % today , represents a likely scenario for the American Southwest .
2006 to 2009 were the driest four years for the river that supplies Australia ’s second - largest city , and the problems are expected to get only worse .
Melbourne ’s population is projected to grow by 2 million in the next 10 years , at which point the city will need to build a second desalination plant because it will have outgrown the one that is scheduled to come on line in 2011 , " just when the city ’s water is close to running out , " said Dave Griggs , director of Australia ’s Monash Sustainability Institute .
" It ’s a little bit of a race against time , " added Griggs , who said more than $ 900 million have already been invested in water - saving strategies for the city .
" Melbourne would ’ve been dry today if strict water - saving measures had n’t been implemented . "
Griggs cited rainwater harvesting and demand management as the least expensive options for increasing water supplies .
Pipelines and dams were among the most expensive options , he said .
" Urban storm water is a large untapped source of water generated close to where it ’s needed .
...
In most Australian cities , as much water falls on that city as the city needs , " Griggs said .
In Queensland , Australia ’s fastest - growing state , with 2.7 million residents , about 20 % of the population has installed rain - catchment tanks since 2006 , when the area received just 7.4 % of its average annual inflow to the major dam that supplies it .
In 2007 , that flow had declined to just 4 % .
Responding to its dire circumstance , the Queensland Water Commission implemented a variety of drastic measures .
On the management end , it reduced the number of utilities in the state from 23 to seven .
It too built a desalination plant .
In addition to developing a system to connect dams supplying the area , it installed an indirect potable reuse system similar to what currently exists in Orange County , said Dan Spiller , principal executive director of the Queensland Water Commission .
On the consumer end , Queensland instituted an aggressive campaign to change the behavior of its residents since 70 % of Australia 's water use is residential .
In 2006 , when Queensland ’s dams had declined to 30 % capacity and severe water restrictions were already in place , prohibiting homeowners from watering their landscapes and washing their cars and homes ’ windows , " residents reported restriction fatigue , " Spiller said .
[ Updated Jan. 20 , 1:30 p.m. : A government official from the Australian state of Victoria took issue with the G'Day USA speaker 's assertion that 70 % of water use in Australia is residential .
According to East Melbourne 's Office of Water , the figure varies state by state , but most water is used for agriculture . ]
Yet further water restrictions were necessary .
So Queensland gave them goals .
Specifically , it asked that residents use just 35 to 40 gallons of water per person per day -- a savings that could be more easily attained if residents reduced their seven - minute showers to four minutes .
In addition to giving residents free shower timers , that message was widely advertised on televison and in outdoor advertising .
Those who significantly exceeded the goal were sent letters asking them to explain their water use ; of those , 34 % reduced their consumption to the appropriate level immediately and 9 % discovered they had a leak .
In addition to outreach , Queensland was aided by a $ 261 - million rebate program that provided its residents with 508,000 water - saving devices , including rainwater tanks , low - flush toilets and water - efficient shower heads .
The result was a population that did n’t just meet the stated goal but exceeded it .
Although rain has since returned to Queensland , and water use levels are now less restricted , Spiller said , " one of our objectives is that residents use only what they need . "
By Queensland standards , that ’s about 30 gallons per person per day , compared with 200 to 300 gallons per person per day in Southern California , said Peter Beattie , commissioner to the Americas of the Queensland state government .
California is the largest , and second - fastest - growing , state in the nation , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
L.A. County alone is projected to grow from the 18.6 million residents today to 26 million by 2030 .
Most of the residents depend , at least in part , on the Colorado River , where demand could outpace supply as early as 2050 , the University of Colorado 's Udall said .
" Australians use the words ‘ water ’ and ‘ security ’ together , " Udall said during his talk on the environmental effects of the Colorado basin .
" I suspect the U.S. will do the same as we get further into the 21st century . "

Much has happened in the Perl 6 land in 2009 .
Here is my humble attempt to summarize some of it ;
If you find something that I missed , feel free to contact me , I 'll try to add it .
Specification
The year started with lots of improvements to S19 .
In January we also learned that *- 1 constructs a closure , which means that Perl 6 has semi-automatic currying features built into most operators .
Lists , Captures and Parcels
We 've seen a lot of talk about slices , lists , captures and parcels .
The heart of the discussions is always how interpolation and non-interpolation of lists can be made both flexible and intuitive .
For example : should 1 , 2 , 3 Z 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' return a single , flat list ?
or instead a list of lists ?
How can a function which receives the result decide for itself what it want to receive ?
How does that mix with multi-dimensional arrays ?
I have n't followed these discussions very closely , and so I 'm hard pressed to give a good summary ; however it seems that in the end an agreement was reached : each parenthesis constructs a Parcel , short for Parenthesis cell .
A Parcel can behave context sensitively : A single - item Parcel degrades to its contents ; as a signature list it is converted to a Capture object ; code object also return parcels .
It remains to be seen how multi-dimensional slices ( with the @@ sigil ) evolve , and if we can't find anything suitable to replace them .
Built - in Routines
S29 , the list of built - in functions and methods , finally got some long awaited attention in 2009 , starting with Carl Mäsak 's S29 Laundry List , and later carried on by Timothy Nelson , who split S29 into a set of documents summarized as S32 .
In December it was decreed that most built - in methods have a candidate in a new class Cool , ( Convenient OO Loopbacks ) , of which all value types and container types in Perl 6 inherit .
That way maximal DWIMyness can be retained , while keeping user defined types clean of the more than hundred methods defined in Cool .
It is rather perlish to have a distinct name for each operation , and make it coerce its arguments .
A few exceptions exist in Perl 5 ( like reverse , which is list reverse in list context , and string reverse in string context ) ; in Perl 6 , most of these exceptions have been removed : reverse now only reverses lists , strings are reverted with flip , hashes with invert .
At the Nordic Perl Workshop , Larry decided that the prefix : <=> operator had to go , and replaced it with the .get and .lines methods .
Operators
The Cross Meta Operator is now Xop instead of XopX ; in analogy the R meta operator reverses the argument list , so $ a R- $ b is the same as $ b - $ a .
Ranges served two purposes : one for denoting ranges in the sense that the mathematicians use them , and for generating lists according to simple schemes .
These two functions have been separated : ranges are still constructed with two dots , but the : by adverb is gone ; more intricate , lazy list generation can be achieved with the new series operator :
. say for 1 , 1.1 , 1.2 ... 5 ; . say for 1 ... *+ 0.1 , 5 ;
Numbers
The above actually works , and does n't suffer from floating - point arithmetics , because 0.1 is n't stored as a floating - point number , but rather as a fractional number of type Rat .
Other languages decided against that approach , because some very simple loops quickly produce rather large numerators and denominators , degrading performance of the integer operations .
Perl 6 instead has a limit in denominator size , and falls back to floating - point operations when that limit is crossed .
Implementations
Rakudo
A lot of work has been done in Rakudo ; in fact it 's hard to remember how it used to be in January 2009 ; Most features were implemented by Patrick Michaud and Jonathan Worthington , but we had a lot of other contributors too .
In January , Rakudo left the Parrot repository and since then lives on github as a git repository .
It now relies on an installed parrot .
Rakudo implements many new features and lifts old limitations :
Many built - in routines are now written in Perl 6
eval ( ) and classes now have access to outer lexical variables
and classes now have access to outer lexical variables Much improved Unicode support , both in IO and regular expression
punning of roles when .new is called
is called Typed arrays and hashes , parametric roles
Routine return types are now enforced
Error messages now contain backtraces with filenames and line numbers
Multi dispatch is now implemented with a custom dispatcher and signature binder , bringing much improvements over the dispatch and binding semantics that parrot supports .
User - defined operators now possible , and automatically generate some of their associated meta-operators .
Contextual variables
User - defined traits are now possible ; some of the built - in traits are now written in pure Perl 6 .
Rational numbers are now implemented , and support for Complex numbers has been much improved .
routine signatures can now be introspected properly .
SMOP and Mildew
SMOP and Mildew have seen a major refactoring , connected to the changed semantics of slices , captures and parcels , and to the way method invocations are stored .
Paweł Murias implemented multi dispatch as a Summer of Code project .
Mildew now supports an impressive set of features , but since it is not very user oriented , I know of no projects that actually use mildew as a platform .
Other implementations
Elf development seems to have stalled .
Pugs mostly sleeps , too , though Audrey updated it to work with the latest Haskell compilers .
( It does n't live in the Pugs repository anymore though , and is distributed by cabal , the Haskell package manager ) .
New in the field are Sprixel , a Perl 6 to Javascript compiler , and vill , an experimental LLVM backend to STD.
pm+viv .
Test Suite
The test suite continued to grow ; most tests have now been moved to t/spec/ , the official Perl 6 test suite .
Most tests in the other remaining files are either rather dubious , or rely on behaviour that 's not officially specified ( or are specific to an implementation ) .
Many new tests have been contributed by two new faces : Solomon Foster contributed a large number of tests for trigonometric functions on the various number types , and rational and complex numbers .
Kyle Hasselbacher provided us with many regression tests for Rakudo which are also useful to other implementations .
Documentation
Bemoaning the fact that Perl 6 has nearly no user - level documentation , Carl Mäsak started u4x , User - Level Documentation for X - Mas.
Hinrik Örn Sigurðsson chimed in , and started to write grok , a tool for retrieving and showing documentation , sponsored by the Google Summer of Code project .
Patrick Michaud , Jonathan Worthington , Carl Mäsak , Jonathan Scott Duff and Moritz Lenz started to work on a Perl 6 book , with a few chapters already being written .
Websites
In an attempt to provide an up - to - date link list , Moritz registered perl6 - projects.org and collected links .
Later Susanne " Su - Shee " Schmitt contributed a nice design , and Daniel Wright made the domain perl6.org available to us .
So we now have a community driven , central Perl 6 site at perl6.org .
Leo Lapworth redesigned perl.org , and also the old Perl 6 development page , and updated it a bit .
Blogs
As an attempt to improve the visibility of the Perl community , Matt S. Trout issued the Ironman Perl Blogging Challenge .
So far it 's a huge success , and quite a few hackers blog about Perl 6 there .
Also the blog roll of the Planetsix Blog Aggregator continued to grow , some excellent new blogs were added in 2009 .
Carl Mäsak blogged at least once per day in Novemeber , same procedure as least year :-)
IRC
The #perl6 IRC channel has been very pleasant and active in 2009 , with three times the activity of 2008 .
The Future
For April 2010 the Rakudo developers have planned a big release called Rakudo * , not feature complete but still useful and usable .
Around the same time the new Perl 6 book will be released .
The specification is still evolving , and has some areas that are in need of implementation before they can evolve more ; among them are macros , concurrency and IO .
Update : improved floating point example as per comment from Matthias .

Director James Cameron is bearing down on his own legacy .
Cameron 's sci-fi opus Avatar claimed the No. 1 spot at the box office for the fourth straight weekend and continues to demolish records , including the filmmaker 's own .
Avatar raked in $ 48.5 million , according to studio estimates from box - office tracking firm Nielsen EDI .
TOP 10 CHART : See how your favorite films fared at the multiplex
The haul brings Avatar 's total to $ 429 million and was enough to make the 3 - D spectacle the biggest movie of 2009 .
It beat out Transformers 2 : Revenge of the Fallen , which made $ 402 million .
Avatar shattered the record for highest fourth - weekend ticket sales .
The previous titleholder : Cameron 's Titanic , which earned $ 28.7 million in 1997 .
The weekend haul also moved Avatar to seventh on the all - time list of biggest films .
The strong hold — the movie dropped just 29 % from last weekend — means it could be in striking distance of The Dark Knight , which is the second - biggest film with $ 533 million .
That would leave it chasing Titanic 's most prized title : highest - grossing film of all - time at $ 601 million .
Though 20th Century
Fox executives were careful not to draw comparisons between Cameron 's films , it 's clear they were enjoying the race .
" Avatar became water - cooler talk , " says Fox 's Bert Livingston .
" People are seeing it so they can be part of the discussion .
I think people who have n't seen it yet are becoming the minority .
Who knows how high this thing can go ? "
The film is helping business at all turnstiles .
Ticket sales were up 18 % over the same weekend last year , getting 2010 off to a quick start .
Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes was second with $ 16.6 million , which brings its total to $ 165.2 million .
Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel continues to be a quiet powerhouse .
It brought in $ 16.3 million , good for third place and an overall gross of $ 178.2 million .
The horror film Daybreakersfell slightly below expectations with $ 15 million , and Meryl Streep 's It 's Complicated rounded out the top five with $ 11 million in its third week .
The Amy Adams romantic comedy Leap Year had a solid if unspectacular $ 9.2 million debut .
Michael Cera 's comedy Youth in Revolt met its modest expectations with $ 7 million .
Final figures are due today .
Well , you have to say that Michael Moore lived up to his promise to me in our exclusive interview when he said he would go on FOX Noise with Sean Hannity and give them a little " something - something . "
Amato : Would you ever go back on FOX again ?
Moore : Yes , I would go back on FOX again .
I would not go on Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck because they use far too much hate speech and calls for violence and I cannot participate with anyone that goes down that road .
I stayed off because somebody at the studio told me that whenever I go on their ratings go up and I 'm not interested in helping them sell products and make money for themselves and having said that I 'm ready to tee up ( garbled audio , but I think he said Hannity ) Hannity I think pretty soon .
Amato :
That would get huge ratings and it's also really enjoyable to see you kick them around because you know the type of Democrat that go on most of the time that are just so weak and that 's the way they like them so that they can serve them up and kick them around .
Moore :
Then I will make a point during this tour to try and go on one of their shows and give them something - something ...
Amato :
Do it for the blogosphere !
( laughs )
Moore :
Do it for the blogosphere .
This one 's for you !
Biologists long have marveled at the ability of some animals to re-grow lost body parts .
Newts , for example , can lose a leg and grow a new one identical to the original .
Zebrafish can re-grow fins .
These animals and others also can repair damaged heart tissue and injured structures in the eye .
In contrast , humans have only rudimentary regenerative abilities , so scientists hoping eventually to develop ways of repairing or replacing damaged body parts are keenly interested in understanding in detail how the process of regeneration works .
Using zebrafish as a model , researchers at the University of Michigan have found that some of the same genes underlie the process in different types of tissues .
Genes involved in fin regeneration and heart repair are also required for rebuilding damaged light receptors in the eye , they found , suggesting that a common molecular mechanism guides the process , no matter what body part is damaged .
Zhao Qin a graduate student in the department of Molecular , Cellular and Developmental Biology will present the research Oct. 19 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago .
Her coauthors on the paper , which also was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are professor and chair Pamela Raymond and research laboratory specialist Linda Barthel .
The researchers briefly exposed zebrafish to intense light , which destroys the light receptors in their eyes , just as staring into the sun harms human eyes .
But unlike humans , who remain blinded if the damage is severe enough , zebrafish repair the damage with new nerve cells ( neurons ) .
Where do those new cells come from ?
The U - M researchers suspected they develop from cells in the retina called Müller glia , known to have the ability to give rise to nerve cells , and in previous work another graduate student in Raymond 's lab confirmed the suspicion .
In the current work , Qin wanted to find what prompts Müller glia to start the regeneration process .
To get at the question , she looked at patterns of gene expression in Müller glia from damaged , regenerating zebrafish retinas and from undamaged zebrafish retinas to see which genes are expressed differently in damaged and undamaged retinas .
" Of course I found a lot of genes --- a total of 953 , " Qin said , " but two were of particular interest . "
The two genes , hspd1 and mps1 , had been found in other studies to be required for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish , and Qin 's work showed that they also were switched on in Müller glia from damaged zebrafish retinas .
" This suggests , " Raymond said , " that , although we do n't fully understand it yet , there might be a bigger molecular program , involving not just these two genes but a number of cooperating genes that are required for injury - triggered regeneration . "
The researchers received funding from the National Institutes of Health .
Hu Luang , 32 , a bystander who photographed the incident , said : " I saw one punch him in the eye - he grabbed another by the ear and it responded by grabbing his nose .
They were leaping and jumping all over the place .
It was better than a Bruce Lee film . "
Retail Forward , ICSC and Retail Metrics have all done their monthly numbers crunching .
The verdict is not very good .
November same - store sales disappointed .
According to ICSC sales were down .
Retail Metrics and Retail Forward , however , reported that there was a slight year - over - year raise .
What ’s interesting is that there usually is not this much divergence between the three sources .
According to Retail Forward , sales - weighted same - store sales excluding Walmart increased 0.9 percent in November for the approximately 31 retailers that reported numbers .
( A pdf with each retailer ’s results can be downloaded here . )
Frank Badillo , senior economist at Retail Forward , said in a statement , “ Shoppers continue to give signs that they are ready to loosen the grip on their spending plans , but at the same time remain very cautious and deal - focused in their spending . ”
ICSC ’s tally of 32 retailers is that same - store sales fell 0.3 percent in November in comparison with last year after rising in both September and October .
Here are ICSC ’s results going back to 1993 .
According to its report , “ These data suggested that the holiday season got off to a weak start in November for retailers –though the tail - end of the month saw relatively strong sales for electronics and online spending , but that seemed to be at the expense of some in - store performance and apparel demand , in particular . ”
Retail Metrics , meanwhile , reported that same - store sales increased 0.9 percent–results the firmed called “ a giant miss ” .
Retail Metrics ’ numbers include 37 retailers .
Of those , 14 posted gains , two had flat sales and 21 posted same - store sales declines .
The bottom line is that comp store sales VERY disappointing ahead of the critical December Holiday shopping season .
Facing the easiest monthly comparison this decade , retailers managed to eek out a very soft 0.7 % increase .
This despite increased ad spending and earlier sales events .
The standard line from any retailers was a stronger YOY Black Friday weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month .

Get this kid an agent , STAT .
For decades the environmental impact of plastics has been a major crisis with no clear solution .
Plastics last for thousands of years , and the amount of plastic we make and consume has grown exponentially over the decades .
It appears that we may have a solution .
So …the solution to our plastics crisis is …. worms ?
For the past few weeks the internet has been ablaze with reports of wax worms that can break down plastics into organic compounds .
No , this is n’t a fake story built out of a little GoDaddy satellite site .
This is the real deal .
Incidentally if you are looking for savings on building a website with GoDaddy , take a look at that link .
Pollution of any kind is not acceptable to man .
Whether it be water , air , or waste pollution , they are all unhealthy to the environment and cause more harm than good to mankind .
This explains why every effort is put in to reduce the level of pollution in the world .
The area of plastic waste pollution seems to have gotten a solution in the form of a Wax Worm .
The larvae of this Worm type was initially bred to be used as fish bait before a discovery was made of its love for plastic materials by an amateur beekeeper and scientist , Federica Bertocchini .
Here are reasons why Scientists think the Wax Worm may be the solution to plastic waste solution .
1. APPETITE FOR PLASTIC : Following Federica ’s chance discovery , researchers investigated the report and found that 100 Wax Worms can devour as much as 92 milligrams of polyethylene .
The amazing thing is that this quantity would be devoured in the space of 12 hours .
Compare this to another scientific fact that about 200 plastic bags , which is the average a human being uses in one year , would take between 100 to 400 years to degrade in landfill sites .
With the huge appetite of the Wax Worm for plastic , it makes good sense to use it effectively .
2. POLYETHYLENE BREAKDOWN : The Wax Worm is able to breakdown plastic through the use of an enzyme which they produce .
As a solution to all the plastic waste which fills our landfills , oceans , and waterways , Scientists are researching on how to use the enzymes of the Wax Worm in some type of bacteria and marine organisms to degrade plastic wastes in the wild .
3. ENERGY SOURCE : One major factor which would work in the favor of using Wax Worms to fight against plastic waste pollution is to discover why they consume polyethylene .
If it is just a passing thing , then , it would only be of benefit to man now .
Another explanation may be that it requires it as a source of its energy .
If that be the case , it would work perfectly as a solution to plastic waste pollution .
4. BREED LARGE NUMBER OF THEM : Rather than breed only a few of these Wax Worms for fish bait , emphasis may shift to breeding them in large quantities to be released to the landfills , oceans , and waterways to help degrade plastic wastes lined there .
This would go a long way in solving plastic waste pollutions .
This chance discovery by Federica may be the solution to plastic waste pollution .
Rather than spending long years waiting for polyethylene to degrade in landfills , this solution is both natural and time saving .
Of course we ca n’t just leave it all up to the worms , we have to do our part to reduce and reuse plastic and other items that typically get cast off as waste .
For example instead of throwing out your whole computer , plastic casing and all , when it ’s gotten too old consider using cheap computer parts for less to upgrade your machine .
It ’s the insides that wear out most quickly , and do n’t forget you can take those to an electronics recycling depot to keep them out of the landfill .

MOSCOW 
The Kremlin has long been irritated by the way the United States dominates the Internet , all the way down to the ban on using Cyrillic for Web addresses  even kremlin.ru has to be demeaningly rendered in English .
The Russian government , as a result , is taking the lead in a landmark shift occurring around the world to allow domain names in languages with non-Latin alphabets .
Russians themselves , though , do not seem at all eager to follow .
Cut off for decades under Communism , Russians revel in the Internet ’s ability to connect them to the world , and they prize the freedom of the Web even as the government has tightened control over major television channels .
But now , computer users are worried that Cyrillic domains will give rise to a hermetic Russian Web , a sort of cyberghetto , and that the push for Cyrillic amounts to a plot by the security services to restrict access to the Internet .
Russian companies are also resisting Cyrillic Web addresses , complaining about costs and threats to online security .
“ This is one more step toward isolation , ” said Aleksei Larin , 31 , a construction engineer in Tula , 115 miles south of Moscow .
“ And since this is a Kremlin project , it is possible that it will lead to the introduction of censorship , which is something that certain officials have long sought . ”
Speaking of being a skeptic ...
The skeptic who goes by the name QualiaSoup on YouTube posts fantastic short videos outlining why critical thinking is important , and his new one is no exception :
This one is n't as hard - hitting as some of his others , but it outlines just why we need to think critically , and his message at the end is particularly apt .
FORT WORTH , Texas --
On a day when Gary Patterson received a contract extension through 2016 , the TCU coach stated that the Horned Frogs can win a national championship despite not being in a BCS conference .
And he believes they can do so without a playoff system .
Patterson , whose contract includes salary increases for his assistants , maintains that he 's in favor of the bowl games and not a playoff system .
Gary Patterson has an 85 - 27 record at TCU , including five 11 - win seasons in the past seven years .
Vladimir Cherry / US Presswire
" Is it easier to win one game for a championship ?
Or to have to win four ? "
Patterson asked .
" If you have a playoff , you practice and get on a plane and play .
And if you lose , it 's over .
If you go to a bowl game , you 're there seven days and the kids can enjoy a place and get rewarded . "
Patterson noted there 's still a chance his 12 - 0 team -- TCU 's first undefeated squad since 1938 -- could play for a national title this season .
For that to happen , No. 4 TCU would need Nebraska to upset No. 3 Texas in the Big 12 championship Saturday at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington .
Then , the Horned Frogs would need the BCS formula to work in their favor .
" We had a vision nine years ago of reaching a BCS bowl and going to a national championship , " said Patterson , who is 85 - 27 after completing his ninth season .
" A lot of people laughed and shook their heads and said , ' Well , that 's nice . '
We 're now crossing that threshold .
" We feel like we 're very blessed .
I do not feel like our work is done .
We still have a mountain to climb , a championship to win . "
Patterson , who has led TCU to five 11 - win seasons in the past seven years , believes that playing for a national title is as much about reputation as anything .
" You have to show that you can play with everybody consistently , " he said .
" You have to establish you can do it every year . "
Last season , TCU finished No. 7 in The Associated Press and USA Today polls , the highest - ranked two - loss team in the nation .
If the Frogs win a BCS bowl this season , they could begin 2010 in the top five .
That means fewer teams to leapfrog on the way to a possible BCS national championship berth .
TCU started this season 17th in both polls .
This week Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) announced that Watt took the knife to his bill to audit the Federal Reserve – The Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 ( HR 1207 ) .
According to Paul , Watt as chair of the above mentioned committee cut out , “ just about everything ” in preparing the bill for a full committee vote .
Specifically ,
Watt eliminated the provisions requiring audits of the Fed 's transactions with foreign banks , its deliberations on monetary policy , the activities of the Open Market Committee , and disclosure of communications between the Federal Reserve Board and reserve banks .
Essentially the bill has become a shell of its original self .
Paul , of course , does intend to attempt to restore the bill to its original form during Financial Services Committee deliberations , but that is not the point .
The point is why has Congressman Watt gutted a bill that has over 300 cosponsors in the House and the support of a large majority of Americans ?
It could be because he is repaying the financial industry which has throughout his career in Congress contributed over $ 890,000 to his campaigns .
That would be only fair given how much they have helped him maintain power and the privileged perks of members of Congress – great healthcare , great salary , and a great pension plan .
But , what is funny and ironic is that the industry that is second in contributions to Watt is organized labor at $ 873,000 .
Big banks and labor unions make strange bedfellows ?
You would think their interests are so diametrically opposed that they would not be # 1 and # 2 in contributions to the same member of Congress .
Labor union support of Watt is also curious given that North Carolina is a Right to Work state and not nearly as unionized as the People 's Republics of Massachusetts and California .
But , not to worry , Congressman Watt has traditionally taken care of unions as well .
He has supported every “ entitlement ” program that comes down the pike in favor of their leadership .
The list has included minimum wage , the “ right ” under law to collective bargaining , so - called fair employment practices , social security , socialized medicine – the list goes on and on .
So , if the congressman is so busy serving big banks and labor unions , what has he done for the actual people who elect him every two years ?
Well , very little .
You see by supporting the Federal Reserve and bailing out big banks through legislation he is supporting the perpetuation of inflation .
Our dollar has lost 95 percent of its value since the Fed was given control over it by Congress in 1913 .
But , most folks do n't understand how the Fed imposes this hidden tax on them by debasing our currency causing prices to rise .
Instead Watt and his ilk blame capitalism for rising prices and offer socialized medicine , minimum wages , and other socialist schemes to combat the higher cost of living for families .
If they would just support sound money in the first place there would be no perceived need for these wasteful programs .
So this is where the charlatan or economic imbecile question comes into play .
Does
Watt understand that his support for the banking cartel known as the Federal Reserve System is what actually causes hardship for labor and ordinary Americans in his district ?
Does he realize that by gutting HR 1207 he will help to continue the debasement of our currency ?
Has it clicked in his head that his support for or at the very least his blind eye toward the reckless monetary policy of the current Fed leadership will be responsible for the future hyperinflation we will experience .
Has he considered his own culpability in the coming collapse of the dollar which will usher in an era of even higher unemployment with a drastically reduced standard of living in America ?
Given the bubble mentality around Washington , a reasonable person could conclude that Watt is both a charlatan and an economic imbecile .
He is an economic imbecile because he must believe that economic doom caused by Fed policies is not inevitable otherwise he would not support them in light of the fact that the collapse would also affect him negatively .
He certainly is a charlatan because like many members of Congress Watt has the best of both worlds .
Special interests of all stripes get federal goodies from him which personally cost him nothing .
In return those special interest groups guarantee his reelection every two years with huge cash contributions to his campaigns .
In the meantime , our national debt is grotesquely high , our manufacturing base continues to move overseas , our financial industry is bankrupt , and the dollar is on the brink of collapse .
This is the essence of our problems .
Too many charlatans and imbeciles have been in charge of Washington for far too long .
Unfortunately all good things must come to an end .
The federal gravy train that Congressman Watt and his comrades have built to continually get reelected is about to crash .
When it does they wo n't understand it , but they should because it will be caused by the fraud they have perpetuated on America .

It 's that time of year again .
Actually , it probably started a while ago for those of you in the US , but it 's good to remember each year why lots of LGBT folks do n't donate to the Red Bucket .
From Lisa Neff :
But I do not .
I do not ring the bell for the Salvation Army .
I do not donate to the Salvation Army , because the Salvation Army discriminates against gays and lesbians in employment , works to defeat civil rights measures that protect gays and lesbians and promotes position that gay relationships " do not conform to God 's will for society . "
They also went totally Catholic Church in New York City and San Francisco , saying that they 'd cut services if forced to stop discriminating against LGBT people .
They lobbied the Bush Administration to get federal money but keep on discriminating against LGBT people .
And then there 's this from Mary Shaw :
EAIEA / ENGLISH DICTIONARY
The Eaiea language , created by Bruce Koestner , is designed to allow musical instruments the opportunity to speak words through combinations of pitches , and also to let singers speak two languages simultaneously .
A one act chamber opera for string quartet and two vocalists that employs the Eaiea language has been written , and the composer is seeking talented musicians to perform this work .

From the realm of sci- fi to Steve Jobs ' stage : The iPad is official .
What is it ?
What can it do ?
How does it work ?
Here 's everything you need to know about Apple 's newest creation , all in one place .
Advertisement
It 's almost impossible to overstate the buzz leading up to this device .
Immediately after the death of the Newton , rumors began trickling out about a followup from Apple ; in the last five years , speculation and scraps of evidence about an Apple tablet have been a fixture in the tech media ; in the last year , the rumors were unavoidable .
Today , Apple 's tablet has finally arrived , and we 've got the full rundown — from specs , features , content and price to what it 's like to actually use one .
The Hardware
Advertisement
• Size and shape :
The screen 's aspect ratio makes it seem a bit squat , but this is intended to be a bi-directional tabl —err , Pad .
The bezel is a little fat , but otherwise , this thing is basically a clean slab of pure display .
It 's just .5 inches thick , which is a hair thicker than the iPhone 3GS , and measures 9.56 x 7.47 inches .
Final weigh - in is 1.5 pounds without 3G , and 1.6 with .
Says Mark , who 's actually held one :
Imagine , if you will , a super light unibody MacBook Pro that 's smaller , thinner and way , way , way lighter .
Or , from a slightly different perspective , think about a bigger iPhone that 's been built with unibody construction .

• The screen :
The tablet 's multitouch screen measures in at 9.7 inches , meaning that it's got a significantly smaller footprint than the smallest MacBook , but a much larger screen than the iPhone .
( That 's 9.7 inches diagonal , from screen corner to screen corner . )
The screen 's resolution is a dense 1024 x 768 .
Advertisement
Here 's what it looks like in photos , and on video :
Advertisement
• The guts :
It 's a half - inch thick — just a hair thicker than the iPhone , for reference — and weighs 1.5 pounds .
It 's powered by a 1GHz Apple ARM A4 chip , and has 16GB , 32 GB or 64GB of flash storage .
From the looks of it , Apple finally got some use out of that PA Semi purchase , and built their own mobile processor , but that 's no totally clear yet .
It 's also loaded with 802.11 n Wi -Fi , Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR , a 30 - pin iPod connector , a speaker , a microphone , an accelerometer and a compass .
Video output runs through and iPhone - type composite adapter at up to 576 p and through a dock - to - VGA adapter at up to 1024 x 768 .
No HDMI , no DVI — not even a Mini DisplayPort .
Advertisement
3G is optional , and costs more , not less .
Along with 3G , the upgraded models include A - GPS .
( More on this below )
Oh , and there is n't a rear - facing camera , nor is there a front - facing camera .
This tablet is totally camera - less , which seems a bit odd .
Advertisement
• The battery : Apple 's making some bold claims about battery life : ten hours for constant use , with a one - month standby rating .
Ten hours of constant use includes video viewing , so you could conceivable watch about six feature films before this thing dies .
Advertisement
• How you hold it :
You can hold it two different ways , and the software will adapt to both .
Portrait mode seems like the primay mode , a la the iPhone while landscape mode — better for movies and perhaps magazine content — is a secondary mode .
The Apple decal is oriented for portrait mode , so basically , just get ready for a whole bunch of HEY IT'S A GIANT IPHONE !!
jokes .
Connectivity
Some models have Wi -Fi exclusively , while some have 3G as well .
It 's with AT&T , and costs either $ 15 a month for 250 MB of data , or $ 30 for unlimited data .
With the plan , you get access to AT&T's Wi-Fi hotspots as well .
Best of all , it 's a prepaid service — no contract .
You can activate it from the iPad any time , and cancel whenever you want .
This sounds like a fantastic deal , until you consider how it 's probably going to brutalize AT&T 's already terrible 3G coverage .
Advertisement
The iPad itself is unlocked , so you can conceivably use it with any Micro SIM card .
But what the hell is a Micro SIM card ?
For one , it 's not the same kind of SIM that 's in your iPhone , so do n't expect to just pop that in and surf for free .
It 's a totally different standard , and the iPad 's the only device that uses it right now .
Even if , say , T - Mobile released a Micro SIM card , the iPad can't connect to its 1700 MHz 3G network .

The Software
Advertisement
• The OS :
The operating system on the tablet is based on iPhone OS , which is in turn loosely based on OS X .
In other words , it 's got the same guts as the iPhone , as well as a somewhat similar interface .
What this means in practical terms is that the UI is modal ; you can only display one app at a time , and there are n't windows , per se .
There 's a new set of standard UI tools as well , including a pull - down menu , situated at the top left of most apps .
• The homescreen :
It 's like a mixture between the iPhone and OS X : it uses the iPhone launcher / apps metaphor , but has an OS X - style shiny dock .
It feels very spread out compared to the iPhone 's homescreen , though I suspect this is necessary to keep things from getting too overwhelming .
For our full walkthrough of the new OS , check here .

Advertisement
• The keyboard : Input comes by way of an onscreen keyboard , almost exactly like the iPhone's .
Typing on it is apparently a " dream , " because it 's " almost lifesize " .
Steve was n't typing with his thumbs , but with his fingers , as if it were an actual laptop keyboard .
Navigation throughout the rest of the OS is optimized for one hand , though .
• The browser :
The browser is essential an upscaled version of Safari Mobile , with a familiar , finger - friendly title bar and not much else .
It rotates by command of the accelerometer .
From the looks of it , it does n't have Flash support , but we 'll have to confirm .
UPDATE : Yup , none at all .
You can get away with that kind of thing on the iPhone , sort of , but on a 10 - inch tablet it 's a glaring omission .
Advertisement
• Email : Mail again takes its visual cues from the iPhone , but with a lot more decoration : you can preview your mailbox from any message with a pull - down menu , and preview any message from within the mailbox , with a pop - up window .
Advertisement
• Music :
The music player is even more hybridized , styled like a mix between the iPhone 's iPod interface and full - fledged desktop iTunes .
Interestingly , Cover Flow seems to have more or less died off .
• Maps :
This one may be the most direct conversion from the iPhone , with a very similar interface through and through .
It includes Street View , too .
Advertisement
• Photos :
The photo library app looks a lot like iPhoto , only adapted for multitouch finger input .
Advertisement
• Video : YouTube is available by way of an app , iPhone - style , which can play videos in 720 p HD .
iTunes video content plays back in a dedicated app , just like on the iPhone , and can also play back in HD .
Movie codec support is otherwise the same as the iPhone , which is to say pretty limited .
Advertisement
• Calendar and contacts :
The calendar app is desktop - like , until you open contacts and calendars , which look a lot like actual contact books and organizers .
They 're beautiful , and dare I say a bit Courier - like .
Apps
Advertisement
• iPhone apps :
This thing runs them !
The iPad runs iPhone apps right out of the App Store , with no modification , but they 're either relegated to the center of the screen or in " pixel double " mode , which just blows them up crudely .
Any apps you 've purchased for your iPhone can be synced , for free , to your iPad .
• New apps :
The iPhone app SDK has already been expanded for tablet development , including a whole new set of UI elements and expanded resolution support .
The raw iPhone app compatibility is just a temporary measure , it seems — any developer who wants their app to run on the tablet will develop for the tablet .
Some of the early examples of adapted apps , like Brushes , are spectacular .
More on the SDK here .

Apple 's pushing gaming on this thing right out of the box , demoing everything from FPS N.O.V. A to Need for Speed .
It 's presumably running these games at HD , so the rendering power in this thing is no joke .
• Ebooks : Apple 's also opened an ebook store to accompany the iPad , in the mold of iTunes .
It 's called iBooks .
Advertisement
Advertisement
It offers books in ePub format , and makes reading on a Kindle seem about as stodgy as , you know , paper .
To be clear , though , this is just Apple 's solution — unless they 're explicitly banned from the iPad , you should be able to download your Kindle app as well .
This store does n't sell magazines or newspapers , which 'll be relegated to regular app status .
At this point , whether or not the tablet helps them out is in their hands .

• iWork : Apple ' also designed a whole new iWork suite just for the tablet , which implies that this thing is as much for media creation as it is for consumption .
There 's a new version of Keynote designed just for the iPad , as well as new version of Pages , ( word processor ) , and Numbers , which is the spreadsheet app .
Here 's what Keynote looks like :

The interfaces are obviously designed strictly for touch input , but from the looks of it can handle every function that the old , mouse - centric version could , plus a few more .
And man , they 're so much prettier .
Each app costs $ 10 , and you can get them all for $ 30 .
Advertisement
• File storage : Unlike the iPhone , the iPad does seem to have some shared storage aside from the photo roll .
The newly released SDK reveals that when you connect an iPad to a PC or Mac , part of it — a partition , maybe ? — mounts as a shared documents folder .
Accessories
Advertisement
Right away , Apple 's offering three main official accessories : a book - style case , a regular dock and a keyboard dock .
( Ha ! )
The book cover doubles as a stand , so you can prop the iPad up in a few different ways .
The keyboard dock hooks up with the iPad when it's in portrait mode , so you can type longer documents , charge , or both .
The iPad will also support Apple 's Bluetooth keyboards .
Advertisement
The iPad 's only really got one accessory port , and it takes an iPod dock connector .
Apple 's solution for this ?
Adapters !
So many adapters .
There 's a Dock Connector to VGA adapter , a USB camera adapter ( which gives you one plain USB connection , though it apparently only works for importing photos ) , a USB to SD adapter , and an included USB power adapter , which lets you charge by AC or USB .
It 's essentially just an iPhone charger with a bigger brick .
Advertisement
UPDATE : We have prices :
the Keyboard dock costs $ 70 , the case costs $ 40 , the SD / USB connection kit costs $ 30 and the VGA display adapter costs $ 30 ( 1024x768 only )

What It 's Like to Use
It 's hefty .
Substantial .
Easy to grip .
Fast .
Beautiful .
Rigid .
Starkly designed .
The glass is a little rubbery but it could be my sweaty hands .
And it 's fasssstttt .

Price and Release Date

The iPad ships worldwide in 60 days , but only in Wi-Fi versions .
The 3G version will be another 30 days after that .
Here are the prices :
Without 3G :
• $ 499 : 16GB
• $ 599 : 32GB
• $ 699 : 64GB
With 3G :
• $ 629 : 16GB
• $ 729 : 32GB
• $ 829 : 64GB
Apple will ship all the iPads in 60 days — the end of March — to America , and just the Wi-Fi models internationally .
It 'll be another 30 days beyond that for 3G models to be available outside our shores ;
Apple says they 're still working on carrier deals .
Advertisement
3G comes by way of AT&T , who 's offering the service without contract , for $ 15 a month ( 250 MB of data ) or $ 30 a month ( unlimited ) .
That 's why , unlike the iPhone , the iPad is actually cheaper off - contract .

Animal sacrifice is a vital part of life for many South Africans
A proposal to bless South Africa 's World Cup stadiums by slaughtering a cow in each one has caused concern among animal rights activists .
The Makhonya Royal Trust , which put forward the idea , described the cattle killing ritual as a " true African " way of blessing the 2010 tournament .
Government minister Sicelo Shiceka has promised to lobby football 's governing body , Fifa , in support of the plan .
But animal rights groups have demanded to be consulted over the plans .
The row comes as a South African judge refused to stop a separate traditional Zulu bull - killing ceremony from going ahead on Saturday , instead calling on parliament to look at the issue .
The National Council for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( NSPCA ) has written to Fifa over the World Cup issue .
The BBC's Mohammed Allie in Cape Town says the NSPCA does not object to the ritual slaughter of animals .
New stadiums have been built for the eagerly anticipated World Cup
But the group wants to ensure it is done in a humane way and wants to be involved in the process to ensure the welfare of the cattle , our correspondent adds .
The Makhonya Royal Trust , which co-ordinates African cultural activities , said the sacrifice was an important way of ensuring a successful World Cup .
" We must have a cultural ceremony of some sort , where we are going to slaughter a beast , " trust chairman Zolani Mkiva told Reuters news agency .
" We sacrifice the cow for this great achievement and we call on our ancestors to bless , to grace , to ensure that all goes well . "
Mr Shiceka , the co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister , was quoted in South African media as giving his support to the plan .
" The World Cup will be on the African continent and we will make sure that African values and cultures are felt by the visitors , " the Citizen newspaper quoted him as saying .
Legal challenge
The issue of cattle sacrifice was also discussed by a High Court on Tuesday , when Judge Nic Van der Reyden said the matter needed to be taken up by politicians .
Activists from Animal Rights Africa brought a legal challenge in an attempt to stop a traditional Zulu bull - killing ritual from going ahead at a harvest festival on Saturday .
Known as Ukweshwama , it involves a crowd of young men killing a bull with their hands , and is considered to be a rite of passage to manhood .
The judge in Pietermaritzburg said the activity was as important to the Zulu tradition as the Holy Communion was to Catholics , South Africa 's Sapa news agency reported .
" I suggest that all parties sit down and agree whether video footage can be taken during the ritual so that this matter can be handled by parliament , " he said .
The activists said they had tried to lobby the Zulu king and the government , whose leader President Jacob Zuma is a Zulu , but had had no response .
However members of the Zulu royal family were believed to be at the court hearing .
The parties are due to return to court on Friday .

Mussolini's body was hung from a public square in the centre of Milan
The granddaughter of Italy 's fascist dictator Benito Mussolini has said that blood and parts of his brain have been stolen to sell on the internet .
Alessandra Mussolini , a former showgirl turned MP , said she immediately informed the police when she found out .
The listing , on auction site Ebay , reportedly showed images of a wooden container and ampoules of blood .
Ebay , which does not allow the sale of human matter on its site , said that the listing was removed within hours .
The initial price requested for the material was 15,000 euros ( $ 22,000 ; £ 13,000 ) .
" This is very serious , these are the kinds of things we have to guard against , " said Ms Mussolini , who was attending a seminar on internet crime when the listing was discovered .
Doctors ' denial
The BBC's Mark Duff , in Milan , says that Alessandra Mussolini is a colourful character in her own right who has remained doggedly faithful to her grandfather 's political legacy .
Ms Mussolini said that the remains were stolen from Milan 's Policlinico hospital .
After Benito Mussolini was killed in 1945 his body was put on public display in a Milan square .
It was then taken to the hospital for an autopsy .
However , doctors at the hospital denied any remains of the former Italian leader were kept at the premises , saying they were destroyed in the years that followed .
A spokesperson for Ebay said that the listing violated its own regulations and was promptly taken down .

WebGL
Web browsers are probably the most widely used software in desktops and mobile computers .
They have become the swiss army knife of the Web 2.0 digital world and it is under this context that a Javascript API for rendering GPU - based graphics was born : WebGL .
Long live Java
The WebGL technology enables rendering complex 3D or 2D scenes such as games within your browser .
You could write the next Angry Birds in javascript and WebGL .
But why not leverage the power of existing Java technologies and write your game in Java using WebGL ?
Yes !
You can write Java code and deploy it on the web as javascript thanks to the help of the Google Webtoolkit .
( If you have n’t tried it , then you should ! ) .
The following web app illustrates how easily Java and WebGL can be used together with Libgdx game development framework to create fancy 3D scenes .
Click on the image to see the webGL app .
Note : you ’ll need a WebGL compatible browser such as Firefox or Chrome .
Instructions : use the arrow keys to move the camera and drag the mouse to rotate the camera .
Notes about the code
The code uses WebGL which is pretty much OpenGL ES 2.0 .
The sky and mountains background texture ( a.k.a Skybox ) are rendered using cube mapping and custom shaders .
There is one shader program for rendering the water which is based on the excellent Jay Conrod ’s water simulation shader .
The water looks jaggy because there are n’t many triangles in the model .
Feel free to change this .
The boat 3D model comes from here and the texture from here .
The teddy bear comes from here ( if you know the original source , let me know ) .
All models were exported to G3DT format using blender .
NB .
The code will be available on github in the coming days .
Edit :
The code is available here : https://github.com/recastrodiaz/java-webgl
Cross - platform game development
The holly grail of developers is to code once and run everywhere .
Unfortunately , this is hardly true as platforms are extremely different from each other .
Furthermore , screen sizes and input devices are not the same .
Nevertheless , the Java ecosystem provides great multi platform support out of the box .
Add GWT and Monotouch to the mix and you ’ll support Mac , Windows , Linux , Android , HTML5 and iOS from day one .
Check the following cross-platform gaming frameworks to see how it can be done : PlayN and Libgdx .
Orrin Hatch -- Utah 's longest serving senator in history , former presidential candidate , proud member of the Finance Committee , the subcommittees on Energy , Natural Resources , and Infrastructure and Taxation and IRS Oversight , the Select Committee on Intelligence , the Committee on the Judiciary , and the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , as well as the Joint Committee on Taxation - - can now add another feather to his well - befeathered hat : Hanukkah lyricist .
You may be surprised to learn that in addition to his senatorial duties and occasional cameos on major motion pictures , the 75 - year - old Republican senator is also a songwriter .
From his profile page at LDS Music :
Senator Orrin Hatch 's song " Heal Our Land " was performed at the inauguration of President George W. Bush , January 20 , 2005 .
This patriotic song was sung by Wintley Phipps , a gospel singer who has performed for presidents at the White House and for popes at the Vatican .
He is also the founder the U.S. Dream Academy , an online Christian academic resource .
One of Orrin Hatch 's songs can be found on the commemorative CD for the 2002 Winter Olympics .
He recently teamed with the Osmonds : Second Generation to produce I Love America .
And in the wake of September 11th , Orrin released the single , America United : A tribute to all those who lost their lives on September 11th .
His works also include The Locket ( music written for the book by Richard Paul Evans ) , Put Your Arms Around the World with Santita Jackson and Chris Willis , and Many Different Roads : A Tribute to Diana Princess of Wales and Mother Teresa .
According to Wikipedia , the senator has also released several songs under the pen name , " because it 's you , man , " but this seems like one of those examples when the " citation needed " warning should be heeded .
Senator Hatch loves music , obviously , but he also loves the Jews , whom he affectionately calls " the chosen people . "
We chosen ones are well known for writing fantastic Christmas jingles like " Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer " and " White Christmas , " but when it comes to their own holidays , we stink .
Our best known Hanukkah melody , " I Have a Little Dreidel , " is the most tuneless piece of festive tripe since " Happy Birthday . "
When the good senator learned of our suffering from the writer , Jeffrey Goldberg , he decided to return the favor for all those Christmas songs by writing one for us Jews .
According to Goldberg :
Hatch said he hoped his song would be understood not only as a gift to the Jewish people but that it would help bring secular Jews to a better understanding of their own holiday .
' I know a lot of Jewish people that do n't know what Hanukkah means , " he said .
Jewish people , he said , should " take a look at it and realize the miracle that 's being commemorated here .
It 's more than a miracle ; it 's the solidification of the Jewish people . "
And so , without further ado , I give you Eight Nights of Hanukkah by Orrin Hatch , a.k.a. " because it 's you , man " :
On behalf of the Jews of America , nay , the Jews of the world , I say , " Thank you Senator for the generous gift of song .
It has helped us to realize the miracle that 's being commemorated . "
( For those who watched the video but still do n't realize the miracle that 's being commemorated , you can find details in my Hanukkah post from last year . )
According to the NYT , Senator Hatch has said that Eight Nights of Hanukkah will not be his last venture into Jewish music .
" Anything I can do for the Jewish people , I will do , " Mr. Hatch said in an interview before heading to the Senate floor to debate an abortion amendment .
To which I respond again on behalf of the Jews , " Thank you , Senator , you 've done enough .
Happy Hanukkah . "
Those seeking to understand and predict climate change can now use an additional tool to calculate carbon dioxide exchanges on land , according to a scientific journal article publishing this week .
The research , publishing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , incorporates into global computer models the significant impact an enzyme , carbonic anhydrase , has on the chemical form of carbon dioxide released from the soil and reduces uncertainties in estimates of CO 2 taken up and released in terrestrial ecosystems .
The same enzyme is present in foliage and soils , but leaves a different imprint on CO 2 involved in photosynthesis and respired by soils .
" Our paper presents measurements from all the major regions of the world where we have experimentally determined the effect of this enzyme , produced by many microorganisms , on carbon dioxide released from the soil , " said Dr. Behzad Mortazavi , an assistant professor of biological sciences at The University of Alabama , and a co-author of the article .
In computer models used to estimate and predict carbon dioxide , or CO 2 , exchange , scientists had previously incorporated the role this enzyme plays in the vegetation , but had neglected to include its role in soils , according to the collaborative paper written by 18 co-authors from around the world .
Revising the computer model predictions to take the soil enzymes ' impact on CO 2 into account reduces the discrepancies between the model and atmospheric observations , according to the paper whose lead authors are Lisa Wingate and Jérôme Ogée , representing the University of Edinburg and the French National Institute for Agricultural Research , respectively .

While scientists had suspected the enzyme was also active in soils , Mortazavi said the impact of the enzymes within soil on CO 2 had been difficult to measure and thereby was not factored into the computer models .
In order to effectively tackle the complexities regarding human 's impact on climate changes , it 's important to accurately understand the natural processes , the UA scientist said .
" In general , it 's very challenging to determine how much carbon is taken up by photosynthesis versus how much carbon is released by respiration , " Mortazavi said .
" It 's important to know the contributions of these two processes because as the climate is warming , the balance between carbon taken up and released on land will change .
Warmer temperatures can increase the microbial activity in the soils , leading to a greater release of CO 2 from the soil . "
Ideally , the amount of carbon dioxide removed naturally through the carbon cycle balances the total carbon dioxide emissions .
The amount of carbon released into the atmosphere has grown out of balance because of the increased number of human activities such as the use of fossil fuels , many scientists believe .
As the world debates what steps should be taken to address human activities believed to contribute to climate change , Mortazavi said it 's important the naturally occurring processes are measured accurately , something to which this research will contribute .
A photo of Bin Laden from 1998 ( left ) was digitally altered using elements from an image of Gaspar Llamazares ( right )
A Spanish politician has said he was shocked to find out the FBI had used his photo for a digitally - altered image showing how Osama Bin Laden might look .
Gaspar Llamazares said he would no longer feel safe travelling to the US after his hair and parts of his face appeared on a most - wanted poster .
He said the use of a real person for the mocked - up image was " shameless " .
The FBI admitted a forensic artist had obtained certain facial features " from a photograph he found on the internet " .
The digitally - altered photos of the al - Qaeda leader , showing how he might look now , aged 52 , were published on the state department 's Rewards for Justice website on Friday .
Officials said they had adapted a 1998 file image to take account of a decade 's worth of ageing , and possible changes to facial hair .
' Unintentional and inadvertent ' Mr Llamazares , 52 , the former leader of the United Left coalition in parliament , said he could not believe it when he was first told about the similarity between himself and the new photo - fit of Bin Laden .
He said he soon realised that his forehead , hair and jaw - line had been " cut and pasted " from an old campaign photograph .
Bin Laden 's safety is not threatened by this but mine certainly is
Gaspar Llamazares
" I was surprised and angered because it 's the most shameless use of a real person to make up the image of a terrorist , " he told a news conference .
" It 's almost like out of a comedy if it did n't deal with matters as serious as Bin Laden and citizens ' security . "
The FBI claimed to have used " cutting edge " technology , but Mr Llamazares said it showed the " low level " of US intelligence services and could cause problems if he was wrongly identified as the Saudi .
" Bin Laden 's safety is not threatened by this but mine certainly is , " he said , adding that he was considering taking legal action .
Later , an FBI spokesman told the BBC that it was " aware of the similarities in hairline features of the age - progressed photograph of Osama Bin Laden , posted on the web yesterday , and that of an existing photograph of a Spanish public official " .
" When producing age - progressed photographs , forensic artists typically select features from a database of stock reference photographs to create the new image . "
" After a preliminary review , it appears that in this instance the forensic artist was unable to find suitable features among the reference photographs and obtained those features , in part , from a photograph he found on the internet . "
" The forensic artist was not aware of the identity of the individual depicted in the photograph .
The similarities between the photos were unintentional and inadvertent . "

Jon Chait says the combination of an angry left , an inflamed right , and a despondent middle remind him of the mood during the 2000 recount :
It ’s different , of course , in that the Florida recount involved a massive procedural injustice , and the current situation does not .
But all the other pieces are in place .
You have the destructive left , then enthused by Nader , now enthused by the prospect of killing reform ( see this emblematic campaign by Firedoglake to stop the one plausible path to comprehensive reform . )
You have a wild , energized right willing to push its cause to the absolute limit .
And among mainstream Democrats , you see the same torpor .
…. [ House Democrats are ] angry , they ’re tired , they ’ve lost interest in weighing the merits of a decent compromise option versus a catastrophic failure , and most of all they want somebody else to deal with it .
If they fail to pull themselves together , future generations will look back at them , note that Congress had passed comprehensive reform in both chambers , had the backing of an eager Democratic president , and could finish the deal by getting 218 of their 256 Democratic members to sign on , and somehow refused .
I still find the idea that they ’ll allow this to happen unfathomable .
If they do succumb , it will be because some deep and recurrent character flaw rose to the surface at the worst time , once again .
I agree .
Sure , the Senate bill is n’t perfect .
Nothing ever is .
But the political situation has changed and it ’s now the only game in town .
It ’s beyond belief that we could get this close to a century - old goal of liberalism — we are , literally , just a hair ’s breadth from the finish line — and then allow the most significant social legislation of the past 40 years to slip from our grasp just because we ’re tired and pissed .
All we need is one roll call vote in the House .
That ’s how close we are to passing this genuinely historic bill .
One vote .
Then the next day we can start in on the next 20 years work of improving and finishing what we ’ve begun .
We ca n’t allow this to fail now .
We ca n’t let the Fox / Drudge / Rush axis win .
So call your congressman .
Go organize a rally .
Write a letter to the editor .
Lobby your union president .
Do something .
Do it now .
Tell them :
Pass the damn bill .
Pass it now .

Next week , Congress will vote on President Obama 's plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan .
These wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been going on almost a decade .
There are first and second graders in this country who have never known an America at peace .
To them , America is always at war .
President Obama inspired us in his run for President with his message of peace .
He told Iowans about his courageous stance against the war in Iraq , " I opposed this war from the beginning .
I opposed the war in 2002 .
I opposed the war in 2003 .
I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006 . "
This is why Obama was elected : to bring peace and prosperity to our country .
Obama told the people in Illinois who elected him to the Senate , that " the consequences of war are dire , the sacrifices immeasurable .
We may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom , and pay the wages of war .
But we ought not -- we will not -- travel down that hellish path blindly . "
He told us that we should " not stay the course or take the conventional path because the other course is unknown . "
These are the words of a man of peace , and I believe that we can remind the President that he can be that man of peace ...
We do not want to join a battle to occupy a foreign country indefinitely , no matter how much the military - industrial establishment may press for it .
General Petraeus already said in May that Al Qaeda does n't even operate in Afghanistan any more , and President Karzai agreed .
But we do want to join the battles that President Obama told us about before he became President , the battles , he said , " against ignorance and intolerance , corruption and greed , poverty and despair . "
Those are the battles that , " we willingly join . "

Yesterday I was reminded why Blue America donors chose Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) to be our PAC 's first endorsee for 2010 .
Grayson was onwith Chris Matthews ; take a look : Before being elected to Congress last year , attorney Grayson took on -- and beat -- war profiteers and well - connected insiders defrauding the taxpayers .
When you see him examining banksters and CEOs at the House Financial Services Committee , you watch them squirm as the deference and obsequiousness they expect from their future employees , turns into brutal cross examination from a skillful , fearless and courageous congressman who does n't believe " law and order " is only for poor people .
Recently Grayson thwarted the bipartisan Inside the Beltway Establishment by joining with Republican Ron Paul for abipartisan effort to force through an audit of the Fed .
Thanks to Grayson 's persistence there are over 300 co-sponsors of the legislation .
Earlier , in June , he was instrumental in rounding up Democrats to vote against the president 's war supplemental , and judging by the letter we got from him today , that 's what he 's working on again :
At the very end of his letter , he addresses President Obama directly : " Mr , President , " he writes , " be the President that we voted for , the President that you promised to be .
We agree with you that we should not " travel down this hellish path blindly . "
It is time to come home .
I remember when Barbara Lee told me a couple months ago that Grayson came up to her the first day she drafted her resolution , HR 3699 , that would prohibit funding any increase in the number of troops in Afghanistan , and asked to be a cosponsor .
Now there are two dozen :
These are all courageous men and women ... but notice that only one -- Alan Grayson -- is in a Republican - leaning district .
He 's the only co-sponsor who is being targeted by the GOP .
( On the other hand , conservative Democrats have singled out Donna Edwards , Diane Watson and Steve Cohen for primary challenges next year , so going up against the White House takes a lot of guts on their parts as well . )
Today , though , I want to ask you to consider going to the Blue America 2010 page and showing Grayson that his efforts and his moxie are appreciated .
Yours are too !

Going Hybrid - Implementing a Shopping Cart in F# Tuesday , December 15 , 2009
One persistent question that keeps coming up to me is how to merge functional programming techniques with object oriented techniques that many are used to .
My usual reply is to talk about how functional programming affects your code , programming in the big , programming in the medium and programming in the small .
What I mean by those terms is :
Programming in the large : a high level that affects as well as crosscuts multiple classes and functions
Programming in the medium : a single API or group of related APIs in such things as classes , interfaces , modules
Programming in the small : individual function / method bodies
Where functional programming has an immediate impact and probably the largest is programming in the small .
Here , we can focus on such things as immutable values , higher order functions , recursion , pattern matching and others come into play .
When we ’re talking about mixing paradigms , object oriented programming has a larger effect on programming in the medium where we ’re organizing our code and can some times offer a more elegant solution than a functional programming one .
Functional languages also have a good effect in programming in the medium when object oriented solutions such as the visitor pattern , command pattern and others could be expressed more elegantly .
Since I presented at the Continuous Improvement in Software Development Conference last year , Jeremy D. Miller has often asked about using features of F# to create the canonical Shopping Cart solution .
After a while of listening to this comment , I finally sat down and came up with a simple solution using both functional programming and object oriented ideas .
This solution uses an underlying agent based model to maintain our shopping cart state through passing messages of our intention .
First , let ’s get some basic functions and type aliases out of the way before we begin which will help us in our design :
type Agent < ' a > = MailboxProcessor< ' a > let ( <-- ) ( agent : Agent < _ > ) msg = agent .
Post ( msg )
These above pieces allow me to change the Mailbox Processor class to an Agent and also have a function which posts a message which we ’ll use later .
Now , before we go any further , let ’s talk about some typical states of a shopping cart and what kind of “ state ” is required to manage .
Typically , we ’d have the ability to add and remove items from our cart as well as the ability to check out for processing and payment .
Keeping in mind of a simplistic model , we could model our semi-realistic state classes as such :
type Cart = { Total : decimal Items :
Item list } and Item = { Name : string Quantity : int Price : decimal }
We have our Cart record which holds our total price and the list of items we which to purchase .
The Item record holds the name of the product , the quantity and the price .
Since we ’re maintaining this internal “ state ” we need some way to signal to our system of our intentions , whether it is to add an item , remove an item , clear our cart , or check out .
We might do that through a discriminated union to define our messages .
type CartMessage = | Add of Item | Remove of Item | Clear | Checkout
Above , we defined our messages of Add , Remove , Clear and Checkout .
For both Add and Remove , I need an Item to add or remove from our cart .
Now that we have some of the inner workings defined , let ’s now go about creating our agent .
First , let ’s add a couple of helper functions which helps us calculate the total price and one that removes an item from the list .
type ShoppingCartAgent ( ) = let calculateTotal items = ( 0 m , items ) | |> List.fold ( fun acc item -> acc + ( item . Price * decimal item.Quantity ) ) let remove item = List.filter (( <> ) item )
Next , inside this class , we need to define our agent and what actions we take based upon the messages we receive .
Let ’s look at a simplistic view of how we might do that :
let agent = Agent . Start ( fun inbox -> let rec loop ( cart : Cart ) = async { let ! msg = inbox .
Receive ( ) match msg with |
Add item -> let items = item :: cart .
Items let total = calculateTotal items return !
loop { cart with Total = total ; Items = items } | Remove item -> let items = cart .
Items |> remove item let total = calculateTotal items return !
loop { cart with Total = total ; Items = items } | Clear -> return !
loop { cart with Total = 0 m ; Items = [ ] } | Checkout -> //
Some logic return !
loop { cart with Total = 0 m ; Items = [ ] } } loop { Total = 0 m ; Items = [ ] })
Looking at the above code , we create our agent by calling the Agent .
Start method which gives us our inbox that we can receive messages .
Inside the Start method , we create an infinite loop which initializes our “ state ” with a new Cart record with default data .
Inside of our loop , we receive a message which we pattern match against in order to take the appropriate action .
In the case of Add , we add the item to the head of our list , recalculate the total and return a loop of our new state .
For remove , the logic is much the same , except instead of adding the item , we remove it , recalculate our price and return our new state .
The Clear case is rather self explanatory , so that really does n’t need to be covered .
Our Checkout case could be any number of things and not really the heart of what I ’m proving here .
It could be any number of things such getting the customer information on the Checkout message and then passing it along to another agent for processing .
Finally , to wrap things up , we need a way to encapsulate our agent as it does n’t need to be exposed to the outside world .
In order to do that , we simply create methods on our ShoppingCartAgent class to expose the functionality of Add , Remove , Clear and Checkout like the following :
member this .
Add( item ) = agent <--
Add item member this .
Remove ( item ) = agent <-- Remove item member this .
Clear ( ) = agent <-- Clear member this .
Checkout ( ) = agent <-- Checkout
And now we have a complete agent system that handles a single customer and uses asynchronous messaging on the back end to manage our “ state ” .
Conclusion
This of course is one of the 10,000 ways I could have modeled the canonical Shopping Cart example , but in this case , I used functional programming techniques to use immutability , recursion , higher - order functions and pattern matching for programming in the small and medium , and using object oriented techniques to encapsulate our agent .
Pragmatic multi-paradigm Languages such as F# and Scala afford us these opportunities to meld both together in an elegant solution .

WISE : Brown Dwarf Hunter Extraordinaire
Friday is a travel day for me , so be aware that comment moderation will be slow and sporadic .
I just have time to get in word about the upcoming launch of the WISE mission , slated for December 7 .
NASA is planning a media briefing next Tuesday ( November 17 ) to discuss the mission , which is designed to scan the entire sky at infrared wavelengths , spotting perhaps hundreds of thousands of asteroids and studying a wide range of stars and galaxies .
The technology is fascinating in and of itself .
WISE will image the entire sky in the infrared , using detectors kept below 15 Kelvins ( which is only 15 degrees C above absolute zero ) by a solid hydrogen cryostat .
The telescope will be oriented to look out at right angles to the Sun , always pointing away from the Earth , so that its observations sweep out a circle in the sky .
After six months , the instrument will have observed the entire sky , producing nearly 1.5 million images and creating , ultimately , an atlas of the entire celestial sphere .
This is exciting stuff .
For one thing , WISE should be able to measure the diameters of more than 100,000 asteroids .
For another ( and this may be of the most interest to Centauri Dreams readers ) , WISE will be able to detect stars much dimmer than the Sun .
These brown dwarfs , many of which have yet to be discovered , should be readily apparent to the WISE instrument , and of course we hope for one that ranks as the closest star to the Earth .
And beyond all this , WISE will be able to produce a global map of the galaxy and its associated dust .
But back to the brown dwarf issue .
WISE principle investigator Ned Wright refers to the chart below .
WISE is sensitive to radiation with wavelengths of five microns , useful for our purpose because from brown dwarfs down to Jupiter - class gas giants , a large fraction of the emitted radiation appears at five microns , as the figure shows :
About which Wright has this to say on a page of his Web site devoted to the brown dwarf hunt :
These low mass stars are expected to be more numerous than the more massive stars like red dwarfs , and thus there should be brown dwarf stars closer to the Solar system than Proxima Centauri [ italics mine ] .
The green curve shows a 200 K model atmosphere calculation from Burrows et al. ( 1997 ) for an object with the radius of Jupiter at the distance of Proxima Centauri .
WISE will easily be able to detect these nearby brown dwarfs .
Image : Plot showing nearby objects compared to the sensitivity of WISE .
A free floating Jupiter at 1 light year ( FFP ) , and a 200 K brown dwarf at the distance of Proxima Centauri ( BD ) .
Credit : Edward Wright / UCLA .
So if we are dealing with a brown dwarf closer than any other star , WISE ought to be the mission to find it .
Surveys like the Two - Micron All Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) have discovered numerous brown dwarfs , but have been unable to locate any cooler than 750 K .
We can expect WISE to see 450 - K brown dwarfs out to a distance of 75 light years , and brown dwarfs as cool as 150 - K out as far as ten light years .
All eyes may be on Kepler and CoRoT for terrestrial exoplanets , but a nearby brown dwarf would be huge , putting WISE on the front pages .

The popularity of the App Store simply cannot be overstated .
Last Friday , Apple approved their most ever apps in one day .
1394 of em .
Over 300 were games .

That 's like if the entire Blackberry App World catalog were published in just one day .
1400 is more than double the number of games currently on the PS3 ( 557 ) and just a tad short of the number of titles in the PS2's library ( somewhere around 1,900 ) .
In short , it 's a lot of freaking software in terms of pretty much any platform ... and it all came to the iPhone in just one day .

* Senate Democrats struggle to pass healthcare bill
* Lieberman says he will oppose Medicare compromise
* Bill faces make - or - break week in Senate ( Adds Senate Democrats invited to White House , paragraph 3 )
By John Whitesides and Donna Smith
WASHINGTON , Dec 14 ( Reuters ) - Democratic leaders in the U.S. Senate struggled on Monday to move forward on a sweeping healthcare overhaul sought by President Barack Obama in the face of opposition from a frequent irritant -- Joe Lieberman .
As the Senate opened a make - or - break week for healthcare , Senator Lieberman ’s threat to join Republicans in blocking the bill complicated Democratic efforts to gather the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican opposition .
Obama invited all 60 members of the Senate Democratic caucus to the White House on Tuesday to discuss a way to reach agreement , party sources said .
Democrats have no margin for error .
They control exactly 60 of the 100 votes and cannot afford to lose Lieberman , an independent who caucuses with Democrats , or any other member on a bill that is Obama ’s top domestic priority .
Many other Senate Democrats , including potential defector Ben Nelson , are waiting for cost estimates on a potential compromise before making their final decisions .
“ If Senator Lieberman is the 60th vote , I guess we will have to do what Mister Lieberman wants , ” Democratic Senator Tom Harkin told reporters .
The cost estimates were expected as soon as Tuesday , and Democrats planned a late - afternoon meeting on Monday to discuss their options .
“ We knew this was going to be tough .
The Senate is working hard trying to resolve these differences and I ’m confident they will , ” White House adviser David Axelrod said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” on Monday .
“ You do n’t get your grade until the final exam , ” he said .
“ The president said many times that healthcare would be pronounced dead five times before he signed the bill . ”
The Senate has spent two weeks debating the measure , which would extend coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans and halt industry practices like refusing coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions .
Senate Democrats hoped they had resolved a big stumbling block last week with a compromise designed to ease the concerns of moderates about a government - run “ public ” health insurance plan .
It would replace the public option with a non-profit approach featuring private insurers and run by the agency that administers the healthcare program for federal employees .
But Lieberman balked at another element of the compromise , which would allow those as young as age 55 to purchase coverage under the Medicare health program for the elderly .
It now begins at age 65 .
‘ STOP ADDING , START SUBTRACTING ’
“ We ’ve got to stop adding to the bill .
We ’ve got to start subtracting some controversial things , ” he told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” on Sunday .
“ You ’ve got to take out the Medicare buy - in .
You ’ve got to forget about the public option , ” said Lieberman , a former Democrat who won re-election as an independent in 2006 after losing the Democratic primary over his support for the Iraq war .
Lieberman has not been a reliable vote for Democrats since , and he angered the party even more when he supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 White House race .
Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , who has backed some reform efforts and could replace Lieberman as the 60th vote if he defects , also has voiced doubts about the Medicare plan .
Nelson has said he wants stricter limits on the use of federal funds to pay for abortions in the bill .
He has been working on the issue with Democratic Senator Bob Casey , who will meet at the White House with Obama on Monday .
Obama has pushed the Senate to complete work on the bill this year to avoid the issue slipping into next year ’s congressional election campaigns .
The Senate bill would then have to be reconciled in early January with a version approved by the House of Representatives on Nov. 7 .
To finish in the Senate by Christmas , Reid must file a series of procedural motions this week to cut off debate and move to a final series of votes .
In a report that could help healthcare advocates , Christina Romer , chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers , said an updated analysis showed the bill would slow the growth of health spending by about 1 percentage point per year .
A report last week estimated the rate of spending under the bill would increase slightly .
Many of the main components of the overhaul would not go into effect until 2013 or later , although the Senate bill would institute some of the insurance reforms immediately .

Learn basic kitchen ratios

It 's feeling like a lazy Sunday morning , so you want pancakes .
There 's a recipe on the box , but it does n't make the right amount .
Should you go Google-ing for just the right recipe ?
No !
Michael Ruhlman , who 's contributed some food science both here and at Gizmodo , has explained how , using a good kitchen scale and some ratio knowledge , it 's all too easy to knock out nearly any kind of baked good :
2 parts flour and liquid , 1 part egg and butter .
That will give you a perfect muffin or , baked in a loaf pan , a quickbread .
Now , you also need to have a little technique and common sense .
A teaspoon of baking powder for every 5 ounces ( cup ) of flour is needed for leavening , a pinch of salt for flavor , but that 's it .
If you want a lemon - lime cake , add lemon and lime juice and zest ; vanilla is always good , or add lemon and poppyseeds , add cranberry and orange , blueberries , bananas ...
If you season the batter with a little sugar and vanilla and pour it on a griddle , you have perfect pancakes .

Stunning and Amazing Bridges From Around The World
The Millau Viaduct - cable - stayed road - bridge , Tarn Valley
The Millau Viaduct is a cable - stayed road - bridge that spans the valley of the river Tarn near Millau in southern France .
Designed by the French structural engineer Michel Virlogeux and British architect Norman Foster , it is the tallest bridge in the world , with one mast 's summit at 343.0 metres ( 1,125 ft ) .
The viaduct is part of the A75 - A71 autoroute axis from Paris to Montpellier .
Construction cost was approximately €400 million .
It was formally dedicated on 14 December 2004 , inaugurated the day after and opened to traffic two days later .
The bridge received the 2006 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award .
Fehmarn Belt Bridge , Baltic Sea
The Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link is an immersed tunnel ( in earlier design iterations a bridge ) that is proposed to connect the German offshore island of Fehmarn with the Danish island of Lolland .
This would cross over the Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea – 18 km ( 11 mi ) wide – hence providing a direct link by railroad and highway between northern Germany and the Danish island of Lolland , and thence to Zealand .
This route is known in German as the Vogelfluglinie and in Danish as the Fugleflugtslinjen ( literally , " bird flight line " ) .
Fehmarn Island is already connected by bridge with the German mainland , and Lolland is already connected by bridge with Zealand .
Furthermore , Zealand is already connected with the Swedish coast via the Øresund Bridge ; the Fehmarn Belt fixed link would allow more direct transport between Germany and Sweden .
The Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link was tentatively expected to be completed in the year 2018 , but the date has been changed to 2020 .
Originally conceived as a bridge , in December 2010 Femern A/S announced that a tunnel was preferable to a bridge as this would present fewer construction risks , although the financial cost would be broadly similar .
Final approval is needed from the Danish government .
This was reached by a large parliamentary majority in January 2011
Gateshead Millennium Bridge , Gateshead
The Gateshead Millennium Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist tilt bridge spanning the River Tyne in England between Gateshead 's Quays arts quarter on the south bank , and the Quayside of Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank .
The award - winning structure was conceived and designed by architects Wilkinson Eyre and structural engineers Gifford .
The bridge is sometimes referred to as the ' Blinking Eye Bridge ' or the ' Winking Eye Bridge ' due to its shape and its tilting method .
In terms of height , the Gateshead Millennium Bridge is slightly shorter than the neighbouring Tyne Bridge , and stands as the sixteenth tallest structure in the city .
Erasmusbrug Bridge , Rotterdam
The Erasmusbrug ( " Erasmus Bridge " ) is a cable stayed bridge across the Nieuwe Maas ( English : New Meuse ) river , linking the northern and southern halves of the city of Rotterdam , Netherlands .
The Erasmusbrug was designed by Ben van Berkel and completed in 1996 .
The 802 metre long bridge has a 139 metre - high asymmetrical pylon , earning the bridge its nickname of " The Swan " .
The southern span of the bridge has a 89 metre long bascule bridge for ships that cannot pass under the bridge .
The bascule bridge is the largest and heaviest in West Europe and has the largest panel of its type in the world .
The bridge was officially opened by Queen Beatrix on September 6 , 1996 , having cost 165 million Dutch guilders ( about 75 million euro ) to construct .
Shortly after the bridge opened to traffic in October 1996 , it was discovered the bridge would swing under particularly strong wind conditions .
To reduce the trembling , stronger shock dampers were installed .
The bridge featured in the 1998 Jackie Chan film Who Am I ?.
In 2005 several planes flew underneath the bridge as part of the " Red Bull Air Race " .
In 2005 , the bridge served as the backdrop for a performance by DJ Tiësto titled " Tiësto @ The Bridge , Rotterdam " .
The performance featured fire fighting ships spraying jets of water into the air in front of the bridge , a fireworks barge launching fireworks beside the bridge , and multi coloured spot / search lights attached to the bridge itself .
The bridge was crossed during the prologue and the opening stage of the 2010 Tour de France .
Kintaikyo ( The Kintai Bridge ) , Iwakuni
The Kintai Bridge is a historical wooden arch bridge , in the city of Iwakuni , in Yamaguchi Prefecture , Japan .
The bridge was built in 1673 , spanning the beautiful Nishiki River in a series of five wooden arches , and the bridge is located on the foot of Mt. Yokoyama , at the top of which lies Iwakuni Castle .
Declared a National Treasure in 1922 , Kikkou Park , which includes the bridge and castle , is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan , especially for the Cherry Blossom festival in the spring and the autumn color change of the Japanese Maples .
Kintaikyo is Possibly one of the most unlucky bridges in the world , Kintaikyo was reconstructed in the town of Iwakuni in 1673 after every other attempt to cross the Nishiki River via bridge had been foiled by seasonal flooding .
Remarkably , the five wooden arches remained intact right up to 1950 when a typhoon finally destroyed them .
However , intent on not being beaten , the bridge was again reconstructed three years later and is still crossable today !
Ponte Vecchio Bridge , Florence
The Ponte Vecchio is a Medieval bridge over the Arno River , in Florence , Italy , noted for still having shops built along it , as was once common .
Butchers initially occupied the shops ; the present tenants are jewellers , art dealers and souvenir sellers .
It has been described as Europe 's oldest wholly stone , closed - spandrel segmental arch bridge , but there are far older segmental arch bridges such as Alconétar Bridge .
The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinità and the Ponte alle Grazie .
Golden Gate Bridge , San Francisco
The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate , the opening of the San Francisco Bay into the Pacific Ocean .
As part of both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 , the structure links the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County .
The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1937 , and has become one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco , California , and of the United States .
Despite its span length being surpassed by eight other bridges since its completion , it still has the second longest suspension bridge main span in the United States , after the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge in New York City .
It has been declared one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers .
The Frommers travel guide considers the Golden Gate Bridge " possibly the most beautiful , certainly the most photographed , bridge in the world " , although Frommers also bestows the most photographed honor on Tower Bridge in London , England .
Tower Bridge , London
Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London , England , over the River Thames .
It is close to the Tower of London , which gives it its name .
It has become an iconic symbol of London .
The bridge consists of two towers which are tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways which are designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers .
The vertical component of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers .
The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower .
The bridge 's present colour dates from 1977 when it was painted red , white and blue for the Queen 's Silver Jubilee .
Originally it was painted a chocolate brown colour .
Tower Bridge is sometimes mistakenly referred to as London Bridge , [ citation needed ] which is actually the next bridge upstream .
The nearest London Underground station is Tower Hill on the Circle and District Lines , and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway .
Oresund Bridge , Oresund Strait
The Øresund or Oresund Bridge is a combined twin - track railway and dual carriageway bridge - tunnel across the Øresund strait .
The bridge connects Sweden and Denmark , and it is the longest road and rail bridge in Europe .
The Øresund Bridge also connects two major Metropolitan Areas : those of the Danish capital city of Copenhagen and the major Swedish city of Malmö .
Furthermore , the Øresund Bridge connects the road network of Scandinavia with those of Central and Western Europe .
The international European route E20 crosses this bridge - tunnel via the road , and the Öresund Railway Line uses the railway .
The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link – which connects Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula – and the Øresund Bridge have connected Western and Central Europe to Scandinavia .
The Øresund Bridge was designed by the Danish architectural practice Dissing + Weitling .
The purpose for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way – rather than simply raising that section of the bridge – was to avoid interfering with airliners from the nearby Copenhagen International Airport , and also to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad , and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait .
The Øresund Bridge crosses the border between Denmark and Sweden , but in accordance with the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic Passport Union , there are usually no passport inspections .
There are random customs checks at the entrance toll booths for entering Sweden , but not for entering Denmark .
The Øresund Bridge received the 2002 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award .
Tsing Ma Bridge , Hong Kong
The Tsing Ma Bridge is a bridge in Hong Kong .
It is the world 's seventh - longest span suspension bridge , and was the second longest at time of completion .
The bridge was named after two of the islands at its ends , namely Tsing Yi and Ma Wan .
It has two decks and carries both road and rail traffic , which also makes it the largest suspension bridge of this type .
The bridge has a main span of 1,377 metres ( 4,518 ft ) and a height of 206 metres ( 676 ft ) .
The span is the largest of all bridges in the world carrying rail traffic .
The 41 metres ( 135 ft ) wide bridge deck carries six lanes of automobile traffic , with three lanes in each direction .
The lower level contains two rail tracks .
There are also two sheltered carriageways on the lower deck for maintenance access and as backup for traffic when particularly severe typhoons strike Hong Kong .
Though road traffic would need to be closed in that case , trains could still get through in either direction .
Sydney Harbour Bridge , Sydney
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail , vehicular , bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district ( CBD ) and the North Shore .
The dramatic view of the bridge , the harbour , and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of both Sydney and Australia .
The bridge is locally nicknamed " The Coat Hanger " because of its arch - based design .
Under the directions of Dr J.J.C. Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works , the bridge was designed and built by English firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough , and opened in 1932 .
According to the Guinness World Records , it is the world 's widest long - span bridge .
It is also the fifth longest spanning - arch bridge in the world , and it is the tallest steel arch bridge , measuring 134 metres ( 440 ft ) from top to water level .
Until 1967 the Harbour Bridge was Sydney 's tallest structure .
Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge , SE Asia
The in -construction Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macau Bridge is a series of bridges and tunnels that will connect the west side of Hong Kong to Macau and the Guangdong province city of Zhuhai , which are situated on the west side of the Pearl River Delta .
The proposed 50 kilometres ( 31.1 mi ) link is expected to cost USD $ 10.7 billion .
With its length , it would become one of the landmarks within the area .
Though overall length exceeds the Second Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the United States , which is 38.4 kilometres ( 23.9 mi ) long according to the Guinness Book of World Records , the longest bridge section ( between the artificial islands containing the Macau exit of the tunnel and the Macau border facilities ) , which will include three cable - stayed spans with spans between 280 and 460 m , will be 22.8 kilometres ( 14.2 mi ) long .
Construction formally began on 15 December 2009 .
It is due to be completed in 2015 - 2016 .
Bosphorus Bridge , Istanbul
The Bosphorus Bridge , also called the First Bosphorus Bridge ( Turkish : Bog( aziçi Köprüsü or 1. Bog( aziçi Köprüsü ) is one of the two bridges in Istanbul , Turkey , spanning the Bosphorus strait ( Turkish : Bog( aziçi ) and thus connecting Europe and Asia ( the other one is the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge , which is called the Second Bosphorus Bridge . )
The bridge is located between Ortaköy ( on the European side ) and Beylerbeyi ( on the Asian side ) .
It is a gravity anchored suspension bridge with steel pylons and inclined hangers .
The aerodynamic deck is hanging on zigzag steel cables .
It is 1,510 m ( 4,954 ft ) long with a deck width of 39 m ( 128 ft ) .
The distance between the towers ( main span ) is 1,074 m ( 3,524 ft ) and their height over road level is 105 m ( 344 ft ) .
The clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64 m ( 210 ft ) .
The Bosphorus Bridge had the 4th longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1973 , and the longest outside the United States .
At present , it is the 16th longest suspension bridge span in the world .
San Diego - Coronado Bridge , San Diego
The San Diego - Coronado Bridge , locally referred to as the Coronado Bridge , is a " prestressed concrete / steel " girder bridge , crossing over San Diego Bay in the United States , linking San Diego with Coronado , California .
The bridge is signed as part of State Route 75 .
The 11,179 - foot - long ( 3,407 m or 2.1 mi ) bridge ascends from Coronado at a 4.67 percent grade before curving 80 degrees toward San Diego .
The span reaches a maximum height of 200 feet ( 61 m ) , allowing the U.S. Navy ships which operate out of the nearby Naval Station San Diego to pass underneath it .
The five - lane bridge featured the longest box girder in the world until it was surpassed by a bridge in Chongqing , China in 2008 .
The bridge does n't form a direct path to Coronado , but rather has a curve .
This was done so it would be high enough for all U.S.
Navy ships to pass underneath but not too steep for vehicles to ascend and descend .
The San Diego - Coronado Bay Bridge construction started in February 1967 , and the bridge was opened to traffic on August 3 , 1969 , during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the founding of San Diego Originally , the toll was $ 0.60 in each direction .
Several years later , this was changed to a $ 1 toll collected for traffic going westbound to Coronado only .
Although the bridge was supposed to become " toll - free " once the original bridge bond was paid ( which occurred in 1986 ) , the tolls continued for sixteen additional years .
In 2002 , it became the last toll bridge in Southern California to discontinue tolls .
The original toll booths on the Coronado side remained intact for a short while , and were temporarily replaced with newer , more modern - looking toll booths for the filming of a car commercial in April 2007 .
The islands upon which the toll booths sat , as well as the canopy over the toll plaza area , are still intact , located at the western end of the bridge in the westbound lanes .
Though tolls are no longer collected , beginning February 19 , 2009 there was talk of resuming westbound toll collection .
Akashi- Kaikyo , Kobe - Naruto
The Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge , also known as the Pearl Bridge , has the longest central span of any suspension bridge , at 1,991 metres ( 6,532 ft ) .
It is located in Japan and was completed in 1998 .
The bridge links the city of Kobe on the mainland of Honshu- to Iwaya on Awaji Island by crossing the busy Akashi Strait .
It carries part of the Honshu -- Shikoku Highway .
The bridge is one of the key links of the Honshu -- Shikoku Bridge Project , which created three routes across the Inland Sea .
The Akashi - Kaikyo bridge in Japan is the daddy of all suspension bridges , over 1,200ft longer than the 2nd place Great Belt Bridge in Denmark .
Originally built to replace the dangerous Kobe - Iwaya ferry in 1998 which had suffered at the hands of numerous storms , the bridge crosses the Akashi Strait and cost around $ 4.5 billion to build .
The statistics on this build are staggering ; it took 2 million workers 10 years to build the Akashi - Kaikyo Bridge .
During that time they poured 1.4 million cubic meters of concrete , assembled 181,000 of structural steel , built 350,000 tonne anchor blocks at either end of the bridge and hooked up enough steel cable to circle the world 7 times !
Hangzhou Bay Bridge , Zhejiang
Hangzhou Bay Bridge is a long highway bridge with a cable - stayed portion across Hangzhou Bay in the eastern coastal region of China .
It connects the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province .
At 35.673 km ( 22 mi ) in length , Hangzhou Bay Bridge is the longest trans - oceanic bridge in the world , but it does not have the longest cable - stayed main span .
It is also second in the world in overall length , with the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the United States being 2.8 kilometers longer .
Construction of the bridge was completed on June 14 , 2007 , and an opening ceremony was held on June 26 , 2007 , to great domestic media fanfare .
The bridge was not opened to public use until May 1 , 2008 , after a considerable period of testing and evaluation .
The bridge shortened the highway travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai from 400 km ( 249 mi ) to 280 km ( 174 mi ) and reduced travel time from 4 to 2.5 hours .
Magdeburg Water Bridge , Magdeburg
The Magdeburg Water Bridge ( German : Wasserstraßenkreuz ) is a navigable aqueduct in Germany , opened in October 2003 .
It connects the Elbe - Havel Canal to the Mittelland Canal , crossing over the Elbe River .
It is notable for being the longest navigable aqueduct in the world , with a total length of 918 metres ( 3,012 ft ) .
The Elbe - Havel and Mittelland canals had previously met near Magdeburg but on opposite sides of the Elbe .
Ships moving between the two had to make a 12 - kilometre ( 7.5 mi ) detour , descending from the Mittelland Canal through the Rothensee boat lift into the Elbe , then sailing downstream on the river , before entering the Elbe - Havel Canal through Niegripp lock .
Low water levels in the Elbe often prevented fully laden canal barges from making this crossing , requiring time - consuming off - loading of cargo .

Folding Bridge : A folding bridge is a type of movable bridge .
Hörn Bridge , Kiel , Germany
The Hörn Bridge or Hörnbrücke is a folding bridge in the city of Kiel in the German state of Schleswig - Holstein .
One can describe it as a three - segment bascule bridge with a main span of 25.5 meters ( 84 ft ) that folds in the shape of the letter N . The bridge was designed by Gerkan , Marg and Partners .
The Hörn Bridge is a three - segment bascule bridge over the inner end of the Kiel Fjord ( called Hörn ) in the port of the German city of Kiel in Schleswig - Holstein .
The bridge is a 25.5 - meter - long , 5 - meter - wide steel structure .
This pedestrian bridge was built in 1997 and connects the city centre on the west bank of the Hörn with the Gaarden quarter and the Norwegenkai ( Norway dock ) on the east bank .
It is one of the architectural and technical attractions of the city and is an important traffic route for pedestrians and cyclists .
It was meant primarily as a route from the station to Norwegenkai for the passengers of the Oslo ferry line .
The bridge construction cost 16 million DM , and its construction was viewed skeptically by many Kielians .
There were repeated malfunctions of the mechanism upon startup , hence one of its nicknames , the " Klappt - Nix - Brücke " ( Folds - not Bridge ) .
Pegasus Bridge , Normandy , France
Pegasus Bridge is a bascule bridge ( a type of movable bridge ) , built in 1934 , that crossed the Caen Canal , between Caen and Ouistreham , in Normandy , France .
Also known as the Bénouville Bridge after the neighbouring village , it was , with the nearby Ranville Bridge over the river Orne , a major objective of Operation Deadstick past of Operation Tonga in the opening minutes of the invasion of Normandy .
A gliderborne unit of the British 6th Airborne Division , commanded by Major John Howard was to land , take the bridges intact and hold them until relieved .
The successful taking of the bridges played an important role in limiting the effectiveness of a German counter - attack in the days and weeks following the invasion .
In 1944 it was renamed Pegasus Bridge in honour of the operation .
The name is derived from the shoulder emblem worn by the British airborne forces , which is the flying horse Pegasus .
Burnside Bridge , Portland , Oregon
The Burnside Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland , Oregon .
Including approaches , the Burnside has a total length of 2,308 ft ( 703 m ) and a 251 ft ( 77 m ) center span .
While lowered this span is normally 64 ft ( 20 m ) above the river .
The deck is made of concrete , which contributes to its being one of the heaviest bascule bridges in the United States .
The counterweights , housed inside the two piers , weigh 1,700 short tons ( 1,518 long tons ; 1,542 t ) .
The lifting is normally controlled by the Hawthorne Bridge operator , but an operator staffs the west tower during high river levels .
The bridge provides shelter for the initially unauthorized Burnside Skatepark under the east end , and the Portland Saturday Market was formerly held most weekends under the west end .

At fifteen times the height of Niagara Falls , Angel Falls is the highest in the world .
Just how tall is it ?
How did it get its name ?
Did someone seriously BASE jump from the top ?
Littered amongst the stunning images below you will find the answers .

Did you know the height of the falls is so great , that before getting anywhere near the ground , the water is atomized by the strong winds and turned into mist ?
The mist can be felt a mile ( 1.6 km ) away !
The base of the falls feeds into the Kerep River ( alternatively known as the Rio Gauya ) , which flows into the Churun River , a tributary of the Carrao River
Photograph by Teen Wolf
Why is it called Angel Falls ?
Apparently , the falls were not known to the outside world until American aviator Jimmie Angel flew over them on November 16 , 1933 during a flight searching for a valuable ore bed .
Returning on October 9 , 1937 , Angel tried to land his Flamingo monoplane , El Rio Caroni atop the mountain , but the plane was damaged when the wheels sank into the marshy ground .
He and his three companions , including his wife Marie , were then forced to descend the mountain on foot .
It took them 11 days to make their way back to civilization , but news of their adventure spread , and the waterfall was named Angel Falls in his honor .
Angel ’s plane remained on top of the mountaintop for 33 years before being lifted out by helicopter .
It was restored at the Aviation Museum in Maracay and now sits outdoors on the front of the airport at Ciudad Bolívar .

Have people actually BASE jumped from the top of Angel Falls ?
Yes !

Did you know current President of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , wants to strip the name ‘ Angel Falls ’ in favour of an indigenous one ?
“ How could we accept this idea that the falls were discovered by a guy who came from the United States in a plane .
If we do that , that would be like accepting that nobody was living here , ” Chavez mused on his weekly radio and television show , “ Hello Mr President . ” – source : Yahoo !

Some states have already washed out a large portion of subprime mortgages but California holds 58 percent of all option ARMs .
This is a uniquely California problem .
People have so much blind faith in the notion that somehow the stock market leads the way before jobs even recover .
If you want to plot this trend on a chart it would look like :
At this pace , we are going to see an unemployment rate of 12 percent and a Dow of 20,000 .
Clearly there is a disconnect in the current economy .
If we dig deep into the balance sheets of many companies , many of the short - term gains have occurred because of eliminating one of your biggest line items , employees .
Now this might be a problem given employees usually use their wages to pay for a thing called a mortgage .
So a few cents in profits for shareholders might be good , but this trend cannot continue .
At some point companies need to hire AND earn solid profits .
We are not close to seeing that given that the recent GDP growth was purely based on government spending .
It is also important to understand that anything looks up when you are floating in the abyss .
One of the major wildcards in California is how the shadow inventory is going to impact the housing market .
On the surface , things might look to have stabilized but there is a growing backlog of homes that are in pre-foreclosure , set for auction , or are now bank owned that the public cannot readily see .
This has been well documented .
Initially , shills for the industry claimed that this was somehow a myth but that has been largely discredited because even banks have admitted to this !
We know that many homes are being temporarily put into mortgage purgatory into programs like HAMP .
If early re-default rates are any indicator , long - term success is not assured .
In fact , many loan defaults that are now happening are based on job and income loss and no amount of modifications can help that unless the modification includes a W - 2 job .
Prime , near prime , and subprime are all seeing spikes in defaults .
We have yet to see any trend reversing this .
But I want to focus on shadow inventory today because this really highlights the next battle in 2010 .
Many locations that are considered prime have yet to see any significant correction in California .
I pause when people say , “ only the low end fell but the middle to high end will remain fine . ”
I would agree with this if our economy was n’t seeing unemployment that is the highest on record since the Great Depression and wages have been stagnant for a decade .
Keep in mind that overall , the median price in California is still down by 50 percent .
We have not seen prices increase .
So far , what we have seen is the low end get obliterated while the mid to upper tier has fallen , but at a much slower pace .
Couple of reasons for this .
Higher end homes typically have higher incomes that provide a stronger buffer than say someone who stretched into a subprime loan .
That does n’t mean that distress wo n’t happen but they can hold out longer .
The drop in sales at the higher end means current buyers are no longer able to afford homes because :
- Their income cannot afford the place
- They ca n’t buy the home with government financing
- They do n’t have maximum leverage products like Alt - A and option ARMs anymore
This is the eye of the hurricane :
So while wave 1 was largely a nationwide issue , wave 2 is largely focused on bubble states like California , Florida , Nevada , and Arizona .
It will now become a more concentrated and targeted problem .
Contrary to popular belief , 78 percent of option ARMs have not recast and 350,000 + of these loans are still active with over 200,000 here in California .
I spent some time gathering 10 hot spots in Southern California to highlight the shadow inventory .
Some cities like Cerritos are geared to middle class families while areas like Beverly Hills are more targeted to the 90210 crowd .
Let us look at the data :
The above data I believe is the next front in the housing war in California .
If we are fighting the current battle looking at past data we are doomed to repeat additional mistakes .
We need to recall why sales increased in California in 2009 :
- Big drop in price
- Lower end sales
- First time buyers ( cheaper homes )
-FHA loans ( 3 out of 10 loans )
- Investors
- Fence sitters
The last category I believe has kept price drops in mid to upper tier markets more moderate .
I received many e-mails this year from people saying , “ me and my partner ca n’t wait any longer .
We ’ve waited for years and do n’t want to wait anymore .
We are buying because we want to [ start a family , establish roots , own a home , etc ] and are moving now . ”
Mix this in with the belief that the bottom is in and you can see why the market currently looks like it does .
But the above data tells us another story .
The data in the chart tells us a growing number of homes are in distress .
Take for example Cerritos .
A good middle class area with good schools .
60 homes are listed on the MLS but 269 homes are in distress .
The shadow inventory is nearly 5 times as large as the public data .
Many of these are major defaults waiting to happen .
Take for example this home :
The above home is 3 bedrooms and 2 baths listed at 1,252 square feet .
The most recent loan is listed as :
02/22/2006 : $ 544,000
A notice of default was filed on :
08/27/2009 : $ 20,043
Do you think people are going to be able to catch up to something like this ?
This is n’t like a $ 100,000 loan across the country where you go in arrears and you owe $ 3,000 or $ 4,000 .
You miss two or three payments in California and you are in the hole for tens of thousands .
People wo n’t be able to catch up and many of these loans do n’t qualify for HAMP because they are past the underwater requirements of the program .
This pre-foreclosure is one of many in the area .
The buffer is getting weaker and this will align with wave 2 above .
What will this do to prices ?
We ’ll wait and see but clearly anyone betting on prices rising is out to lunch .
If you look at the 4 cities with the highest shadow inventory above , they all fall in the “ middle class ” range .
Cerritos , Burbank , Culver City , and Pasadena .
These are all areas where most housing blog readers are itching to jump into .
You can also find some other unique dynamics above .
For example , Manhattan Beach although high in price , does n’t have an enormous shadow inventory number .
But then again , there is n’t many low priced housing in the area .
Including shadow inventory MB has one of the lowest inventory at current sales rates .
But looking at Beverly Hills , you ’ll notice that the public data is open yet sales have slowed down dramatically .
Studio City has off the chart inventory if we include the MLS + shadow inventory .
And this is something that has no precedent .
We do n’t have any past trends where banks held off on so much inventory with such high levels of toxic mortgage waste .
But at a certain point , home prices need to reflect local area dynamics .
There is no avoiding the long - term trend .
But looking at this data we still have a rough ride ahead .

The latest issue of GSW 's sister publication Game Developer magazine includes a postmortem of Double Fine Productions ' Brutal Legend , written by studio executive producer Caroline Esmurdoc .
Brutal Legend , a unique heavy metal - themed action and real - time strategy game , was the second original title from San Francisco - based Double Fine , founded by noted ex-LucasArts game designer / writer Tim Schafer ( Grim Fandango , Psychonauts ) .
After over four years in development , including a widely - publicized break with former publisher Sierra - cum - Activision , the game was released by Electronic Arts on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this October .
These excerpts from the December 2009 issue of Game Developer reveal various " What Went Right " and " What Went Wrong " highlights from throughout the creation of the game , revealing how the company used effective management to overcome publishing woes and a " content explosion . "
Scrum
For Brutal Legend , Double Fine adopted agile development , hoping to eradicate the rampant crunching that defined Psychonauts ' development cycle -- and it worked :
" Prior to starting work on Brutal Legend , the Double Fine team had spent the previous 5 years developing Psychonauts -- the last two years of which consisted of a giant , grueling crunch wherein the company lost its initial publisher and nearly shut its doors before ultimately releasing the game .
" When the euphoria of having shipped our first title wore off , it was apparent to all of us that Double Fine did not develop games the way other studios did , and that a different system of product development needed to be put in place .
The main cause of Psychonauts ’ horrifying crunch was due to our continued development of the game features even after the levels were built .
With each improvement to the game mechanics came a corresponding rework of all of the levels .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
Double Fine , and notably Tim , needed to play the game , live it , breathe it , let it steep over time , and iterate continuously on what makes the game fun and funny .
" After research into methodologies , we were drawn to the advantages of agile software development and decided to adopt Scrum .
Within the first few months of Brutal Legend development , the team was practicing Scrum , and the initial payoffs were impressive .
Scrum ’s emphasis on features over systems , on rapid prototyping and iteration , on cross - disciplinary teams , on people over process , and on the creation of a potentially shippable piece of software every sprint / milestone made the game playable at a very early stage in development .
" By month one we had a renderer , terrain , and a playable character ( Eddie Riggs ) , by month two Eddie could drive his hot rod ( the Druid Plow ) around the terrain , and by month three Eddie could run over endless numbers of headbangers with his Druid Plow around a terrain height field .
Hilarity ensued .
" We applied Scrum not only to meta - game creation , but to micro-projects as well .
At the very start of the development process , we had no idea how to make an RTS , and had no suitable engine with which to make one .
We solved both problems by creating prototypes with an off - the - shelf PC engine and with which a number of our team members had some familiarity : Unreal 2.5 .
" The design demands of Brutal Legend were such that trying to develop the game using an existing FPS engine would have proven difficult , but having the initial access to the flexibility of Unreal Script meant we could test some of our early RTS ideas right on our development PCs .
This approach allowed our designers and gameplay programmers to be immensely productive right away , while the programming team went to work building our new engine .
This very early glimpse at the design challenges we would face during development , and the opportunity to iterate on something quickly with Unreal Script , gave us invaluable direction into how to architect our new engine and critical insight into the mechanics that would come to define Brutal Legend . "
Content Avalanche
Content creation : the bane of HD - era video game development .
Double Fine faced a particularly difficult content challenge , as the volume of content unexpectedly increased exponentially nearly overnight :
" Brutal Legend is not a small game .
Fortunately , we thought we knew what we were facing and invested heavily in data / build infrastructure .
What went horribly awry was that we both underestimated the total content push and , more importantly , did n't anticipate the huge content spike at the very end of production .
" From the start of the game through the end of 2008 , both our rate of data churn and data growth were fairly steady and corresponded roughly to increases in staffing and team productivity .
This was expected and planned and supported by the technology .
But then , in January 2009 , everything exploded .
All at once .
After three years of development we had accumulated about 2.5 GB of optimized / packed game data .
Less than four months later , we ’d jumped to over 9 GB .
" The central cause of this was a very large increase in asset delivery from a number of teams simultaneously .
For example , we went from 0 localized files to about 100,000 in a matter of weeks .
We received the high resolution video assets for the Jack Black intro and all our main menus in one heap .
We made a late decision to contract additional audio work , and new ambiences and sound effects were quickly added to the game .
And so on .
" This simultaneous significant increase across a number of types of content put a massive burden on our entire infrastructure , in particular our build machine , Perforce server , and network backbone .
To exacerbate matters , we started to see cascade effects — where a massive hit to one system ( such as a check in of 10,000 .wav files ) would bog down Perforce , causing a bottleneck in all of the dependent systems ( like our build server and individual check ins ) and these bottlenecks would then cause other bottlenecks .
" These large content dumps also put significant strain on our runtime systems .
The per-line memory overhead in the voice system was not prepared to handle tens of thousands of lines , causing us to panic about our ability to even fit on a dual layer DVD .
Across the board , these unexpected increases in content caused ripple effects throughout our IO , memory , and processing profile .
And because the rate of increase was both high and unexpected , the engineers responsible for wrangling these systems were pulled from their assigned work and redirected to emergency firefighting .
" Moving forward , we will be much more cognizant about working with content creators to proactively estimate the total amount of data that they plan to create and to factor these numbers into our technical designs to ensure that we meet the final needs of the product .
Additionally , we plan to invest more in scalable data infrastructure in the hopes that we can be better positioned to bring new capacity online quickly should it prove necessary .
With those improvements and a little luck , hopefully content avalanche handling will be something we brag about in our future projects . "
Double Fine Gets Served
And , of course , Double Fine had to contend with the infamous three - way conflict between it , new publisher Electronic Arts , and former publisher Activision , which inherited Sierra 's publishing contract before letting the game go :
" In June 2009 , Activision Entertainment Holdings , Inc. filed suit against Double Fine , claiming breach of contract and seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the release of the game by Electronic Arts on Rocktober 13 .
Less than 2 months later , the case settled out of court .
I can't talk about any of that in this article , or any article really .
I bring up getting sued as something that went wrong because of the impact the between - publishers transition and subsequent lawsuit had on the development of Brutal Legend .
" Let ’s go back a little bit .
We had been working collaboratively and successfully with various groups at Vivendi for two years until Vivendi merged with Activision and we lost touch with both publishers while a lawsuit percolated .
The merger announcement and subsequent diminution in publisher contact with Vivendi personnel , especially after such a previously harmonious relationship , caused internal unrest and morale dips among the team .
Company meetings often included frustrating discussions about what little we knew about the current situation at our publisher , and what the various possible outcomes would mean for Double Fine .
" This demoralizing uncertainty lingered for months , during which time the leads continued to motivate the team to hit their scheduled milestones while watching our coffers run dry in the absence of any publisher payments .
We learned Activision was not going to be publishing Brutal Legend through an official press announcement issued by Activision that listed the games they would be shipping , ours conspicuously absent .
Again , the team was abuzz with anxiety — and the official hunt for a new publisher began , distracting Tim , myself , and various team leads during an already intense development period .
" Even after the game was re-signed with Electronic Arts , we enjoyed only a brief reprieve before the legal communications began among Double Fine and Activision and Electronic Arts .
Most of the team was shielded from the drama that unfolded between December 2008 when Electronic Arts announced that they had picked up the game for publication and July 2009 when the lawsuit settled .
But Double Fine ’s leadership was not , and the distraction and stress took its toll on individuals and on our deliverables .
" The lawsuit was filed just as the game went Alpha , with a stipulation that it be heard prior to Gold Master being submitted — relegating Tim and myself and a cadre of team leaders to the unenviable job of information gathering , declaration writing , lawsuit reading , witness interviewing and all around non -game - making during the crunchiest , most critical time of development .
The lawsuit took its toll on the team , on the company , on our product and on our optimism .
Wrong , any way you slice it . "

Last month , Gecko Systems announced that it had been running trials of its " fully autonomous personal companion home - care robot , " also known as a " CareBot , " designed to help elderly or disabled people to live independently .
A woman with short - term memory loss broke into a big smile , the company reported , when the robot asked her , " Would you like a bowl of ice cream ? "
The woman answered " yes , " and presumably the robot did the rest .
Robots already perform many functions , from making cars to defusing bombs – or , more menacingly , firing missiles .
Children and adults play with toy robots , while vacuum - cleaning robots are sucking up dirt in a growing number of homes and – as evidenced by YouTube videos – entertaining cats .
There is even a Robot World Cup , though , judging by the standard of the event held in Graz , Austria , last summer , footballers have no need to feel threatened just yet .
Most of the robots being developed for home use are functional in design – Gecko's homecare robot looks rather like the Star Wars robot R2 - D2 .
Honda and Sony are designing robots that look more like the same movie's " android " C - 3PO .
There are already some robots , though , with soft , flexible bodies , human - like faces and expressions , and a large repertoire of movement .
Hanson Robotics has a demonstration model called Albert , whose face bears a striking resemblance to that of Albert Einstein .
Will we soon get used to having humanoid robots around the home ?
Noel Sharkey , professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield , has predicted that busy parents will start employing robots as babysitters .
What will it do to a child , he asks , to spend a lot of time with a machine that cannot express genuine empathy , understanding or compassion ?
One might also ask why we should develop energy - intensive robots to work in one of the few areas – care for children or elderly people – in which people with little education can find employment .
In his book Love and Sex with Robots , David Levy goes further , suggesting that we will fall in love with warm , cuddly robots , and even have sex with them .
( If the robot has multiple sexual partners , just remove the relevant parts , drop them in disinfectant , and , voilà , no risk of sexually transmitted diseases ! )
But what will the presence of a " sexbot " do to the marital home ?
How will we feel if our spouse starts spending too much time with an inexhaustible robotic lover ?
A more ominous question is familiar from novels and movies : will we have to defend our civilisation against intelligent machines of our own creation ?
Some consider the development of superhuman artificial intelligence inevitable , and expect it to happen no later than 2070 .
They refer to this moment as " the singularity , " and see it as a world - changing event .
Eliezer Yudkowsky , one of the founders of The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence , believes that singularity will lead to an " intelligence explosion " as super - intelligent machines design even more intelligent machines , with each generation repeating this process .
The more cautious Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has set up a special panel to study what it calls " the potential for loss of human control of computer - based intelligences . "
If that happens , the crucial question for the future of civilisation is :
Will the super - intelligent computers be friendly ?
Is it time to start thinking about what steps to take to prevent our own creations from becoming hostile to us ?
For the moment , a more realistic concern is not that robots will harm us , but that we will harm them .
At present , robots are mere items of property .
But what if they become sufficiently complex to have feelings ?
After all , is n't the human brain just a very complex machine ?
If machines can and do become conscious , will we take their feelings into account ?
The history of our relations with the only nonhuman sentient beings we have encountered so far – animals – gives no ground for confidence that we would recognise sentient robots as beings with moral standing and interests that deserve consideration .
The cognitive scientist Steve Torrance has pointed out that powerful new technologies , like cars , computers , and phones , tend to spread rapidly , in an uncontrolled way .
The development of a conscious robot that ( who ? ) was not widely perceived as a member of our moral community could therefore lead to mistreatment on a large scale .
The hard question , of course , is how we could tell that a robot really was conscious , and not just designed to mimic consciousness .
Understanding how the robot had been programmed would provide a clue – did the designers write the code to provide only the appearance of consciousness ?
If so , we would have no reason to believe that the robot was conscious .
But if the robot was designed to have human - like capacities that might incidentally give rise to consciousness , we would have a good reason to think that it really was conscious .
At that point , the movement for robot rights would begin .

Richard Chuk , of Lombard , Ill. , said that since he lost his position as a commercial designer a year ago , when two of his firm ’s clients — both developers — lost financing for their projects , he has been looking for any job he can find to support his wife and children , ages 6 and 7 .
Mr. Chuk , 38 , began his job search in a good mood because of the wave of optimism surrounding the presidential election .
During the first three months , he sent out nearly 150 résumés , applying for many jobs he was overqualified for .
( Sears , Home Depot and Lowe ’s all turned him down for jobs as a designer because he was overqualified , he said . )
He had only one interview .
After that , he said , he applied for the rare job that popped up but spent most of his time taking care of his children , studying for his architectural licensing exam and renovating his basement .
CBS Television has rejected a Toronto - based gay dating site ’s commercial that it had hoped would run during the Super Bowl .
In a letter to ManCrunch.com , CBS Standards and Practices said it had reviewed the proposed ad , which would cost an estimated $ 3 million to air , and “ concluded that the creative is not within the Network ’s Broadcast Standards for Super Bowl Sunday . ”
In rejecting its bid for a commercial spot Kristen Bartlett , editor of CBS Program Practices , also said that CBS had difficulty verifying the company ’s credit status .
CBS officials said should the dating Web site want to explore future buys , the credit issue would have to be clarified and that the “ Standards and Practices Department would be open to working with you on acceptable creative and appropriate daypart scheduling . ”
But early afternoon Friday ManCrunch.com got word that its 30 - second ad was a rejected .
“ It ’s disappointing , ” said Dominic Friesen , a spokesman for the dating site .
“ We perceived the spot to be quite harmless .
We just think this is just another result of the discrimination that is part of Super Bowl advertising . ”
The relatively new dating Web site launched in January , 2010 .
According to dating site officials in the days since the company ’s Super Bowl pitch was reported , 32,000 men have signed up .
CBS insiders believed that the site was hoping to generate free publicity by producing a Super Bowl ad that it knew would be rejected and was unable to pay for .
But Friesen denied that .
He says ManCrunch.com spent $ 100,000 on the proposed commercial , which is posted on both the Web site ’s Web page and YouTube .
It shows two football fans watching a game on television and cheering .
Then , as they both reach for a bowl of potato chips at the same time , their hands meet .
After looking into each other ’s eyes , the two embrace and kiss passionately .
A third fan looks on and appears very shocked and surprised to see the lip lock .
“ It ’s certainly discrimination on the part of CBS , ” said Friesen who rejects the television giant ’s suggestion that the commercial was low on production values and that the company ’s credit was n’t verifiable .
“ We ’re a new company and do n’t have a huge history .
We offered to pay cash .
We did have it earmarked for that spot . ”
Friesen refused to identify who owns the dating site , saying it was a privately held company .
He also said the company is making plans to try to get air time on another network .
When asked whether they might try to advertise during the Olympics or perhaps in the Stanley Cup finals , Friesen would n’t say .
Originally ManCrunch.com hoped the Super Bowl would be a great launching vehicle to let the world know about its service .
“ We thought 90 million men watch the Super Bowl and we target men , ” Friesen said in a telephone interview with the Star .
“ Why do n’t we get the most bang for our buck ? ” he said .
The ManCrunch.com ad controversy comes on the heels of another commercial slated for the Super Bowl that has raised eyebrows for another reason .
CBS has approved a pro-life commercial with Florida quarterback Tim Tebow .
The commercial , funded by a Christian conservative group , is to be aired during the game .
From the webcast yesterday , the JooJoo ( previously named Crunchpad ) seemed flimsy and barely working .
But now that we spent a good deal of hands on time with it , we can say that Fusion Garage executed an internet tablet quite well .

Specs
Here are some new facts I gathered from the meeting .
First , the device runs a 1.6GHz Atom processor with 1GB RAM .
The guys at JooJoo said they were n't ready to reveal specs yet , but I saw the bootup sequence — a standard BIOS setup that displayed what it was booting to — and saw the specs .
Chandra , CEO of Fusion Garage , says that the demo hardware was basically the final hardware , so it 's easy to put two and two together .

As for the graphics card + CPU combination , it 's probably an Nvidia Ion chipset .
They claim that it handles 1080 p
YouTube video fine — we only got to see a few seconds of 720 p and 1080 p HD YouTube video because the internet connection was acting up — so it 's probably an Ion .
But the HD video we tested looked just fine on its 12 - inch , 1366x768 resolution screen .
Again , the Ion chipset is just an educated guess , but there are few other hardware options that can handle 1080 p video smoothly , and an Atom CPU by itself ( which we did see ) can't do it on its own .

There is a headphone jack , a microphone jack , a built - in webcam at 1.3 megapixels , a charging port and a USB slot .
The external card slot present in the prototype is n't going to make it to the final version , but they are thinking of making it available to put a 3G card in there in the future .
No TV out / HDMI out yet , but they are thinking about that .
There are built - in speakers for playing back audio without headphones , and they 're decent enough that you can actually listen to them , but you 'll want to plug them in to speakers for any kind of extended video consumption .

Performance
The tablet actually handled pretty well , with browsing web pages , transitioning between tabs ( windows ) and opening up new web pages working fine .
There 's an accelerometer in there to detect between vertical and horizontal orientations .
Advertisement
The body is solid , sturdy and graced with a bright 12 - inch screen .
The back is curved and made of a plastic that feels nice in your hand , and the whole thing does n't seem too heavy to prop up on a bed or a toilet .
In short , it 's an actual web browsing tablet that you'd be perfectly fine using .

The software
The entire system is basically a gateway to your browser , which is based off WebKit , the same code that powers Safari and Google 's Chrome .
It 's fast , and handles gestures ( pinching to go back a level , swiping to move up and down ) just fine .
There are other gestures that will be included in the final build , like two finger swiping for going back and forth in history and a bookmark swipe , but we did n't get to see that .
But , you can't zoom into text .
That 's partially because the pinching is already used for going in and out of your windows into the home screen , but also partially because the screen is 12 inches .
You do n't need to really zoom into text on a laptop - sized screen of 12 inches .
And they also said they may make LARGER sized tablets as well , with 12 being their smallest size .

JooJoo 's keyboard looks like this , and takes up only a portion of the screen .
It 's usable , but you do n't want to use it to bang out a blog post ; this is mainly for consuming media .

Fusion Garage 's concept for the product is that the " internet is the application " , which means you can't save photos or files locally and you can't access any of the 4GB of storage to do any user level stuff .
The most you can dictate is how much each internet application ( e.g. Gmail or Google Wave ) can have for a local cache .
It does support Flash as usual , except when you play HD Flash it 'll force you into fullscreen mode to render better / faster .
And if you want to read PDFs , it 'll force you into Google 's web - based PDF doc reader .
So it handles PDFs , but not " natively " .

Your home screen is composed almost entirely of icons — shortcuts — to web applications .
The screen is customizable with your own applications , eventually , and has a weird feature where it displays a different color background whenever you go back to it .
Fusion Garage is thinking of taking this out , or swapping it with some other feature .
As for multitasking , Fusion Garage says that they will have specific APIs available to webapps to incorporate in order to pass notifications up to the user .
For example , if Twitter refreshes in another window and you 're watching a YouTube video , a popup will show and tell you you have something else going on .
The APIs will be available at launch , but it 's up to websites to support them .

How good is it ?
Despite its weird birth issues this past week with all the Arrington trouble , the JooJoo is surprisingly solid .
You can tell Fusion Garage spent a good deal of time polishing the hardware , by the fact that they managed to include a 12 - inch screen that 's decent enough to not have lousy viewing angles , plus support 1080 p HD video playback .

The only trouble right now is software , which is only about 75 % done .
Fusion Garage plans to ship devices about 8 - 10 weeks after preorders , which start this friday .
If FG can manage to finish the software and get it to a point where it 's transparent to the user who just wants to get online , $ 500 is n't too outrageous a price to pay .
Decent netbooks are around that price , and it's about the price you 'd expect Apple to charge for their tablet , if not even more .
We'd of course be very happy if it were down at $ 300 or $ 400 , but it 's basically a new device in a new market , and you 'll have to hand over a little extra for being an early adopter .

So right now we 're at a wait and see status .
The JooJoo seems good , from our time with it , but it really needs to be taken home and thoroughly tested with different webapps , watching a lot of HD video and streaming music .
At the very least , we 'll see how much of that 5 - hour battery life stands up to constant use .
You can pre-order it yourself this Friday , but , since there 's some legal troubles on the horizon , you probably want to wait until the whole thing clears up first before putting any money down .

QUICK NOTES :
I wonder if George Lucas went into Avatar thinking , “ Heh , I ’ll see Jimmy Cameron ’s new movie .
I ’m sure it ’ll be good for a laugh , but we ALL know who the reigning champ of 100 % wooden digital characters is . ”
Oh , Georgie Georgie Georgie , you fat necked lummox .
If Cameron can create CG characters with realistic human emotions and less than ridiculous accents , then why ca n’t you ?
Maybe he ’ll teach a class at a community college next year and you can enroll .
The funny thing is that Cameron waited nearly 12 years until technology caught up with his vision , so Avatar could look the way he saw it in his head .
Lucas , on the other hand , made 2 awesome movies ( and a third crappy one ) , then waited 20 years until technology caught up to his vision to digitally ruin them with pointless bullshit .
I ’m trying to save my full on Avatar review for the next HE Podcast , but let ’s just say I was thoroughly entertained and impressed .
[ UPDATE !
The Podcast is posted and we talk about Avatar for nearly half the show . ]
A lot of people are complaining that the story and writing take a back seat to the visuals , but else do you expect ?
James Cameron already used three of the dimensions making the movie beautiful , so of course there ’s only one dimension left for everything else .
Seriously , if you leave that movie and find yourself complaining rather than drooling for more you might as well sign up for the junior executive program at FOX because your heart has probably been replaced by a hate - filled pineapple .
I could very easily rant for pages and pages about how visually stunning the 3D was , how lifelike the motion captured performances were or how engrossed I was in the fictional world that Jame Cameron created but I ’d rather just say this : the reason I know Avatar was well deserving of my ( and your ) entertainment time and money was that I left the theater asking questions .
What are the far reaching implications of this characters actions ?
How will the final outcome affect Earth ?
How will it affect those already in transit to the planet ( since it ’s a 6 year ride ) ?
Are there other inhabited worlds ?
Was the end really THE END ?
The list goes on and on .
I do n’t often find my curiosity so peaked over fiction without substance .
Take from that what you will , but at least ignore the hype and approach Avatar with an open ( if not childlike ) mind .
ELDORADO , Texas , Dec. 15 ( UPI ) --
A resident of a polygamist compound in Texas was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting a child , a teenager given to him as a wife .
Allan Eugene Keate , 57 , was led from a Schleicher County courtroom in handcuffs , The San Angelo Standard - Times reported .
The penalty phase of his trial begins Wednesday , and he could get a life sentence .

Prosecutors said Keate was married to the underage girl in 2006 at the Yearning for Zion Ranch , a compound founded by the Fundamentalist Church of the Latter - Day Saints , a dissident Mormon group .
Keate was arrested after a 2008 raid on the ranch inspired by a telephone call that later proved to be a hoax .
The prosecution witnesses included a DNA expert who testified Keate had fathered a baby born to the teenager .
Some of the most dramatic testimony came Monday from Rebecca Musser , who was once married to Rulon Jeffs , the FLDS prophet .
She told the jury she and other younger wives were ordered to marry Warren Jeffs after his father 's death .
She said she decided to flee when Warren Jeffs threatened her : " I will break you .
I will make you a
good wife .
You have one week . "
Duke University Professor Gary Hull has just published Muhammad : The " Banned " Images , which dares to publish images that Yale University and Yale University Press censored from Jytte Klausen ’s The Cartoons that Shook the World earlier this year .
Hull calls the book " a statement of defiance against censors , terror - mongers , and their Western appeasers . "
FIRE joined with the National Coalition Against Censorship , the American Association of University Professors , and nine other signatories on a Statement of Principle stating that " The failure to stand up for free expression emboldens those who would attack and undermine it . "
Here is the Statement of Principle , which points out that Yale ’s censorship is just one of many serious threats to free expression we have witnessed in recent years .
A number of recent incidents suggest that our long - standing commitment to the free exchange of ideas is in peril of falling victim to a spreading fear of violence .
Not only have exhibitions been closed and performances cancelled in response to real threats , but the mere possibility that someone , somewhere , might respond with violence has been advanced to justify suppressing words and images , as in the recent decision of Yale University to remove all images of Muhammad from Jytte Klausen ’s book , The Cartoons that Shook the World .
Violence against those who create and disseminate controversial words and images is a staple of human history .
But in the recent past , at least in Western liberal democracies , commitment to free speech has usually trumped fears of violence .
Indeed , as late as 1989 , Salman Rushdie ’s Satanic Verses continued to be published , sold , and read in the face of a fatwa against its author and in the face of the murder and attempted murder of its translators and publishers .
In 1998 , the Manhattan Theater Club received threats protesting the production of Terrence McNally ’s play Corpus Christi , on the ground that it was offensive to Catholics .
After initially canceling the play , MTC reversed its decision in response to widespread concerns about free speech , and the play was performed without incident .
There are signs , however , that the commitment to free speech has become eroded by fears of violence .
Historical events , especially the attacks of September 2001 and subsequent bombings in Madrid and London , have contributed to this process by bringing terrorist violence to the heart of liberal democracies .
Other events , like the 2004 murder of Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh in apparent protest against his film Submission , and the threats against Hirsi Ali , who wrote the script and provided the voice - over for the film , demonstrated how vulnerable artists and intellectuals can be just for voicing controversial ideas .
Under such threats , the resolve to uphold freedom of speech has proved to be lamentably weak : in the same year as Van Gogh ’s murder , Behzti , a play written by a British Sikh playwright , was cancelled days after violence erupted among protesters in Birmingham , England on opening night .
In response to rising concerns about fear - induced self - censorship , in 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten published an article , " The Face of Muhammad , " which included twelve cartoon images .
The cartoons became the focus of a series of violent political rallies in the Middle East in February 2006 and a subject of worldwide debate pitching free speech against " cultural sensitivity . "
For all the prominence of Islam in such debates , threats of violence against words and images are not the sole province of religious extremists .
In 2005 , a politically controversial professor ’s scheduled speech at Hamilton College in Clinton , NY was cancelled in response to alleged threats of violence .
In 2008 , the San Francisco Art Institute closed a controversial video exhibition in response to threats of violence against faculty members by animal rights activists .
Later that year , the University of Nebraska - Lincoln canceled a speech by former Weatherman and education theorist William Ayers , citing security concerns .
The possibility of giving offense and provoking violence has entered the imagination of curators , publishers and the public at large , generating more and more incidents of preemptive self - censorship : in 2006 , for instance , London ’s Whitechapel Gallery declared twelve works by Surrealist master Hans Bellmer too dangerous to exhibit because of fears that the sexual overtones would be offensive to the large Muslim population in the area ; and publisher Random House canceled the 2008 publication of Sherry Jones ’
The Jewel of Medina because " it could incite acts of violence . "
The suppression of images in Jytte Klausen ’s book is the latest , but not likely to be the last in the series of such incidents .
Words and images exist in complex socio-political contexts .
Suppressing controversial expression cannot erase the underlying social tensions that create the conditions for violence to begin with , but it does create a climate that chills and eventually corrupts the fundamental values of liberal democracy .
A Call to Action
The incident at Yale provides an opportunity to re-examine our commitment to free expression .
When an academic institution of such standing asserts the need to suppress scholarly work because of a theoretical possibility of violence somewhere in the world , it grants legitimacy to censorship and casts serious doubt on their , and our , commitment to freedom of expression in general , and academic freedom in particular .
The failure to stand up for free expression emboldens those who would attack and undermine it .
It is time for colleges and universities in particular to exercise moral and intellectual leadership .
It is incumbent on those responsible for the education of the next generation of leaders to stand up for certain basic principles : that the free exchange of ideas is essential to liberal democracy ; that each person is entitled to hold and express his or her own views without fear of bodily harm ; and that the suppression of ideas is a form of repression used by authoritarian regimes around the world to control and dehumanize their citizens and squelch opposition .
To paraphrase Ben Franklin , those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , will get neither liberty nor safety .
Sheriff 's deputies arrested 169 people and seized 114 roosters after raiding a cockfight site in North Texas on Saturday , authorities said .
Drugs and cash were seized at the north Parker County site , and at least 10 children were taken into custody by Child Protective Services workers , officials said .
Cockfight organizers had set up an arena inside a barn , said Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler .
Dead and injured roosters were also found .
Officials said the operators could face charges of gambling and engaging in organized crime .
John Goodwin of the Humane Society of the United States said cockfighting is a lucrative business .
“ There 's a little industry that has evolved around this , ” he said .
“ It 's surprising how organized these people can be .
“ If 50 people enter the cockfighting ring and each pay a $ 200 entry fee , that 's $ 10,000 in the pot .
Hopefully , people will look at this arrest and see the consequences outweigh any of the potential gain . ”
This Week at War : Google Has More Guts Than the U.S. Government
Google goes where the U.S. government has feared to tread
In a dramatic statement posted on the company ’s official blog this week , Google sparked a confrontation with the Chinese government that will likely end with the company exiting the Chinese market .
Google ’s statement all but accuses the Chinese government of " a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure . "
The Chinese government has long been suspected of directly performing , or facilitating proxies to perform , a wide range of cyberwarfare activities .
Google ’s forceful response against the Chinese government has gone further than the U.S. government , a daily large - scale victim of cyberattacks , has ever gone .
The Pentagon ’s forthcoming Quadrennial Defense Review will likely feature discussions concerning " high - end asymmetric threats " such as cyberwarfare ; but ironically it is a private company that is taking action against the Chinese government , a leading high - end asymmetric threat .
Finally , Google ’s decision to likely abandon China could reveal a major crack in China ’s authoritarian model for economic growth and development .
Google stated that the attacks targeted at least 20 other large companies and the email accounts used by prominent Chinese human rights activists .
The company did not directly accuse the Chinese government of these attacks , but its response indicates that it believes the Chinese government is responsible .
If Google thought the culprits were lone - wolf Chinese computer hobbyists or cybercriminals , one would think that their response would have called on the Chinese government to police lawless behavior .
In this case , it has obviously concluded that it is the government itself that is lawless .
Google has shown the courage to name the villain and accept the consequences for doing so .
This is more than the U.S. government has ever done , in spite of many years of regular cyber attack s from China and Russia .
Belatedly , and only after Google had acted , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a four - sentence statement calling on the Chinese government to explain its actions .
I agree with my FP colleague Blake Hounshell that this story will have long - lasting ramifications .
Google ’s break with the Chinese government exposes a crack in the Chinese government ’s model for development .
Western multinational corporations are the intermediaries through which China ( like the other Asian successes ) has obtained access to export markets .
Google had accepted the Chinese government ’s terms regarding censorship .
But this week , it decided that it would not be a branch of the regime ’s internal security apparatus , a conduit for its global cyberwarfare operations , or a victim of its theft of intellectual property .
Google ’s management has apparently decided that such complicity would be too damaging to its reputation elsewhere in the world and that its reputation was more valuable than future profits from the Chinese market .
Google is walking away from a Chinese government whose business practices it considers out of control .
This will show the way for other Western multinationals to stand up against the Chinese government ’s social coercion , frequent non-protection of property rights , and outright theft of intellectual property .
Following Google ’s action , those Western firms that do business with the Chinese government will have to respond to tougher questions from their shareholders .
China ’s future economic growth is dependent on the health of its relationships with Western firms , especially those with high intellectual property content .
Google ’s decision may show that China ’s authoritarian growth model has reached a limit .
And it may show the U.S. government how to get some courage of its own to fight the cyberwar , a war that is already underway .
Computers must take over counter - terrorism analysis
National Security Advisor James Jones predicted that the White House report on the Christmas Day attempt to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit would " shock " its readers .
Jones was presumably referring to the report ’s conclusion that U.S. counterterrorism analysts had access to all of the information they needed to prevent the suspect , Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab , from boarding the flight , but failed to search enough of the databases to which they had access and link together the information that would have revealed the threat .
Maybe what was really shocking to Jones was his discovery that the U.S. intelligence community ’s computer software was not performing the " data mining " for terrorism threats that he assumed it was .
The " Key Findings " from the White House report stated :
" Information sharing " does not appear to have contributed to this intelligence failure ; relevant all - source analysts as well as watchlisting personnel who needed this information were not prevented from accessing it .
Information technology within the CT community did not sufficiently enable the correlation of data that would have enabled analysts to highlight the relevant threat information .
There was not a comprehensive or functioning process for tracking terrorist threat reporting and actions taken such that departments and agencies are held accountable for running down all leads associated with high visibility and high priority plotting efforts undertaken by alQa’ida and its allies , in particular against the U.S. Homeland .
In a Jan. 7 interview on the PBS Newshour , former White House counterterrorism officials Richard Clarke and Juan Carlos Zarate confirmed that the U.S. intelligence community still does not have computer software that comprehensively searches and correlates data from all of the relevant U.S. government terrorism databases .
Given the flood of " dots " that arrive daily into the intelligence community ’s databases , computer automation is clearly the answer .
The White House report recognized the hard work of the counterterrorism analysts who , the report says , have foiled many plots .
But the Abdulmutallab incident shows what happens when a system relies on the endurance and judgment of an army of overworked human analysts — the bomber eventually gets through .
A software program performing the same routine as the analysts will not be a panacea .
Its parameters will require constant adjustment which will cause many to wonder whether data mining is useful .
However , 9/11 and the Abdulmutallab incident show that large - scale and systematic data management is very likely the largest part of protecting the homeland from terrorism .
It ’s been nearly nine years since the last catastrophic " connect the dots " failure .
The fact that the intelligence community still is not fully cooperating on software solutions reveals an egregious management failure inside the government .

I stole some time from my increasing non-technical workload to play with generating heat - maps of residential energy consumption in my http://gainesville-green.com project .
The initial results are promising :
There are a few neat things going on here .
I ’ve got a url handler in my lisp that looks to the query string for lat - lng bounds , image size , and some other variables to generate a PNG file .
I pass that URL to a Google Maps API GGroundOverlay to put the image onto the map .
Add some javascript event glue and I can do cool things like automatically regenerate the heat map overlay when you zoom / pan the map around , and display an animated heat map showing consumption over the course of the year .
There ’s still a lot of UI interaction to sort out , but I think it ’s a nice approach .
The heat map itself is generated using Vecto , and I think I ’m doing it wrong .
I jump through some hoops to map lat - lng to image pixel coordinates , pull from the database , and end up with a list of ( x y weight ) tuples , with the weight being a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relative consumption of the home that should be at pixel x ,y in the result image .
Then I start painting , which is where I think I should be doing more math .
For each point , I pick a color between green and red based on the weight , using the handy cl-colors library to interpolate :
( defun find - color ( percent ) ( if (> .5 percent ) ( cl- colors : rgb - combination cl-colors : + green + cl-colors : +yellow + (* 2 percent ) ) ( cl- colors : rgb - combination cl-colors : + yellow + cl-colors : +red + (* (- percent .5 ) 2 ) ) ) )
I actually have to go from green -> yellow , then yellow - >red , with some goofy adjustments to the percent to make the interpolation work out .
Once I have that , then I have my color , and my pixel , so I can start drawing .
To get a smoother look , for each point I draw concentric circles with different radius and opacity , so each individual data point is rendered like this :
This is enlarged to show some of the blockiness , it ends up looking pretty nice when they are small .
Here ’s the actual function :
( defun draw - point ( x y color max - radius ) ( iterate ( for r from max - radius downto 1 by ( max 2 ( round ( / max - radius 6 ) ) ) ) ( for alpha = ( / 1 r ) ) ( vecto : set - rgba - fill ( cl - colors : red color ) ( cl - colors : green color ) ( cl - colors : blue color ) alpha ) ( vecto : centered - circle - path x y r ) ( vecto: fill - path ) ) )
Max - radius determines how large the largest circle is , and is calculated based on how many points I ’m drawing .
There are a few drawbacks to this approach .
First , it ’s slow .
Drawing operations are n’t exactly cheap , especially when messing with alpha channels .
It takes me around 5s for 578 data points , which is fine for offline tasks , but on a web - app it needs to be super zippy or you fickle internet folk will close the tab .
I also want it to be easy to show animations , so generating a bunch of them quickly would be nice .
The time spent increases fairly linearly with data points , and I ’d like to be able to render heat maps for large areas with tens of thousands of data points .
Profiling shows practically all of my time and bytes consed are spent in the draw - point function .
UPDATE : after more profiling , vecto : fill - path is most of my time , which makes sense .
Second , I have to be really careful to draw these points from lowest weight to highest weight , because I want red dots to be painted on top of green dots .
It seems like I should decide what color each pixel should be , then draw it once , rather then accumulating the right color in the image canvas .
Right now there ’s also some bug with drawing lots of data points , I just get a big green image , when I would expect some reds or yellows .
Another issue is for apartments I have coordinates for the apartment complex , but not each individual unit .
This makes some funny results , like the big orange blob on the right side of the screenshot above where I ’ve painted a few dozen points on top of each other .
I did some googling on heat - map algorithms , and found some actionscript and java code , but the actionscript was using a similar approach and the java was incomprehensible .
I think I ’ll try making a big array for the result image , and calculating an average weight for each pixel , then loop through that and draw once .
I ’m also going to try calculating the weights using magnetic field strength or gravity math .
I think that approach will end up faster , look nicer , and should be a fun problem .
Looking for a magic formula in any industry or line of work can be a fool 's errand .
Most experts in a given field will tell you that the key to success is to think well , work diligently , and be consistent , and this is largely true .
In the world of insurance , this time - honored advice certainly applies , but that does n't mean there are n't certain strategies and arrangements that can greatly accelerate returns and help an agent catalyze their success .
You might come across several different “ magic formulas ” when looking for ways to improve your insurance business ; I know I 've found a multitude myself , and some are much more helpful than others .
But the formula I 've found to be most effective , and certainly most exciting , is the combination of using high converting leads that also help you get referrals .
Like an extra set of cherries on top of an already eye - popping ice cream sundae , referrals and high converting leads in combination can make any sales strategy especially sweet .
This formula is n't free , like so many things in life that signal excellent quality .
I 've re-couped my investment several times over though , and have no reservations about putting some cash out there to help my career as an agent take flight .
The cost is for the leads themselves , of course .
There are those who will suggest that it 's possible and preferred to go out searching for your own high - quality leads , but without the power of a huge staff and plenty of money for marketing and research , you 'll probably find yourself with some slightly above - average leads that cost several times more than their worth given the time and effort expended to track them down .
I use InsuranceLeads.com for my high quality leads , and have never regretted the decision to work with the filtered , pre-verified , and genuinely interested leads generated by the firm .
Not only are the prospects with which I talk enthusiastic about being contacted , helping the course of high conversion rates , but they 're often so thrilled with being personally catered to that they refer me to their friends and family .
This works wonders for my reputation as an agent locally and also boosts my sales through the roof , making each successful sale significantly more valuable .
Though I 'm happy with the rates I pay for leads at InsuranceLeads.com , the added bonus of picking up referred prospects of equal quality and value for free makes the initial expense seem laughable .
As you go through the course of your own career , you may well discover your own magic formula adapting your strategies to suit what works and to discard what does n't .
But if you 're looking for a way to truly rock your sales rates and get the most value possible out of leads sourcing , I challenge you to try out this magic formula .
No matter what stage you 're in as an agent or broker , it 's bound to help you make a few giant leaps .

Do you pay the milkman by cheque ?
Slip a surprise cheque in a Christmas card to a grandson or granddaughter ?
Or maybe you simply do n't trust direct debits when dealing with gas and electricity companies ?
In the future you 'll have no choice but to pay electronically , by plastic , or go online if , as expected , Britain 's banks vote tomorrow to phase out the tradition dating back more than 300 years of payment by cheque .
Cheques cost up to £ 1 each to process – and the number written has been falling steadily .
As recently as 2002 a typical consumer in Britain was writing 31 cheques a year , but the number fell to 14 by 2008 .
Big stores such as Marks & Spencer have already stopped taking cheques , and the Payments Council , which sets strategy for UK payments in Britain , says they are now used for fewer than one in 25 purchases .
Scandinavian countries and Ireland have already voted to phase out cheques , and a board meeting of the Payments Council tomorrow afternoon expected to set an " end date " of 2018 for cheque clearing in Britain .
It wants consumers to switch to cheaper and faster electronic payment processing and says it will use the eight - year transitional period to ensure alternative arrangements are put in place .
" Mapping out how the UK might move to a society where , by 2018 , there is no need to use a cheque for any type of payment is no small task , " said council spokeswoman Sandra Quinn .
" Even if the board decides to set a target date , we are clear that we would need to continue to engage with as many other bodies as possible to understand their concerns and requirements .
The demise of the cheque in 2018 is only feasible if interim targets are set and met and it can be demonstrated that no one will lose out . "
But the phasing out of cheques has led to intense concern among groups representing senior citizens .
Many elderly bank customers are unhappy about online banking , or have sight difficulties and prefer the comfort of using cheques .
Neil Duncan - Jordan , of the National Pensioners Convention , said : " Using a cheque to settle your financial affairs is extremely important to older pensioners who might struggle in later life with the use of chip and pin .
This option is effectively removing choice from a whole section of the population .
The representatives of the Payments Council are completely out of touch with the needs of older consumers and need to think again . "
Age Concern and Help the Aged say that 6.4 million over - 65s have never used the internet , and the loss of cheques will force older people to keep large amounts of cash at home , leaving them vulnerable to theft and fraud .
Andrew Harrop , head of public policy at the charities , said : " Many older people rely on cheques as their main form of payment and will be very worried about how they will manage if they are withdrawn .
" Our fear is that setting a date will give the green light to banks and retailers to withdraw cheques even earlier than 2018 , as some already have .
It is vital that before cheques are phased out , the Payments Council ensures there is a practical , safe , paper - based alternative in place which serves the needs of this group . "
Small businesses point out that , despite the decline , there are still 1.4bn cheques written every year by individuals and businesses to pay bills , traders or family members .
Stephen Alambritis , of the Federation of Small Businesses , said : " This sends completely the wrong message to the self - employed , small businesses and people who run small clubs and charities .
" We are opposed to the Payments Council dictating this , at the behest of the big banks , when cheques are still hugely popular as a method of payment .
We know that students and young adults are using the chequebook less and less , and the banks talk about things such as cheque fraud .
But it is terribly wrong to set any date as to when they can no longer be used .
They are also an important record of transactions for small businesses . "
But Quinn said that most under -30s now barely use cheques , while the under - 20s have barely heard of them .
She added : " So far , no group consulted has said 2018 is not feasible although all parties recognise that it would be a major challenge to get right and that currently sufficient and accessible alternatives to cheques do not exist for a number of individuals and users . "
The Payments Council board is made up of 16 directors , 12 from the banks and four independents .
The independent directors enjoy a power of veto , but are not expected to impose it tomorrow .
But such a temperature provision does seem rare , if not unique .
City firefighters were excused from performing inspections during “ inclement weather , ” which included when the wind - chill factor dropped to 20 degrees and below .
But the city won elimination of that restriction in 1988 .
Because of the structure of the city ’s library systems and the vagaries of labor negotiations , there are varying definitions of an extreme condition .
The city ’s public libraries are run by three nonprofit agencies , funded by the city .
Each negotiates working condition contracts with a local chapter of District Council 37 , the city ’s largest municipal union .
All three contracts require some action when the temperature drops below certain thresholds for two hours .
Librarians may be reassigned to a warmer library .
In every borough except Brooklyn , library workers can elect to continue working in the extreme conditions in exchange for paid leave , or compensatory time , to be taken later .
In Brooklyn , workers are either sent home with pay or reassigned .

But there is no agreement on what constitutes extreme cold .
The level is below 63 degrees in Queens , below 65 in Brooklyn , and below 68 for branches in Manhattan , Staten Island and the Bronx , which are all controlled by the New York Public Library .
In the last round of contract negotiations , the clause for branches controlled by the New York Public Library was modified so that workers could collect comp time and keep working , meaning the branch could stay open .
The temperature threshold was also reworded from “ below 68 ” degrees to “ 67 degrees or below , ” which , of course , means basically the same thing .
ICANN 's approval of non-Latin character domains undoubtedly is a game - changing decision in the history of the World Wide Web .
With scheduled to start popping up in the middle of next year , many people are debating if this digital support for more distinctly international sites balances with potential security threats and fragmentation of the Internet .
Here are a few pros and cons to consider as we move away from the traditional ASCII based - Web .
Pro : World Wide Web Supporting World Wide Language
Let 's face it ; millions of Internet users speak languages that are n't written using Roman characters .
Allowing
Web sites to have domains that use other characters will make Web addresses more recognizable to some and make the Web more accessible to millions of new users .
The transition will begin on November 16 when countries can apply for country codes in their own unique character sets .
" The first countries that participate will not only be providing valuable information of the operation of IDNs in the domain name system , they are also going to help to bring the first of billions more people online -- people who never use Roman characters in their daily lives , " ICANN CEO and President Rod Beckstrom said in a statement .
Con : Country Codes are Only the Beginning
Generic domains such as .com , .org and .net are n't open to international characters yet , but could be in the next couple of years .
If ICANN decides to open generic domains without extending rights to existing URL holders , international companies and brands might find themselves purchasing URLs in multiple languages to protect the use of their name , points out PC World Tech Inciter writer Tech Inciter David Coursey .
Pro : Country Codes are Only the Beginning
If done properly , opening generic domains to international characters could be a good thing .
If International corporations were granted rights to the .com URLs they already possess it could spell an end to selecting a region before entering the site .
For instance , going to intel.com could lead to the English version of the site , while using a Japanese , Russian , or Korean suffix would take you to a version of the site with that language .
It would also open doors for smaller Web sites that are just interested in serving a particular language group .
Con : A lesson from 1337 h4ck3 r $
Expanding beyond Roman characters also increases potential for site rip - offs that use homoglyphs , characters with identical or indistinguishable shapes .
This already occurs to some degree ( for instance pointing your browser to google.com takes you to a different site than go0gle.com ) but different languages might have characters that are identical to characters in other languages .
Con and Pro : No Latin Base Emphasis
Apparently homoglyphs are drawing some attention at ICANN .
Languages that use accented Latin characters are n't being supported at this time , The CBC Reports .
They attribute the lack of support to security concerns that accented characters could lead to phishing scams because , " internet users might not at first see the difference between , for example , ' google.com ' and ' goógle.com . ' "
This is bad news for French , Spanish , Turkish , and Vietnamese speakers -- all four languages use accented characters .
But , if ICANN is aware of security concerns that would arise from including these languages , maybe they have some sort of anti-homoglyph trick up their sleeve for other languages , ( here 's looking at you , Cyrillic . )
Con : Keyboards and Restrictive Access
Adding support for 100,000 international characters would make traditional keyboards insufficient input devices for accessing the entire Internet .
As fellow PC World writer Jacqueline Emigh pointed out , it would be next to impossible to produce a keyboard that could support characters from every language under the sun .
Virtual keyboards and language packs could possibly help alleviate the problem for some people , but there would n't be an easy fix .
ICANN released this video with its announcement , hoping to encapsulate the potential for opening up international character domains .
A Virginia man has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for making online death threats against the former BART police officer charged with murdering an unarmed passenger on New Year 's Day in Oakland , a prosecutor said Tuesday .
Jeffrey L. Weaver , 48 , was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson to serve three years ' probation after his release from prison .
At a hearing Monday in Roanoke , Va. , Wilson imposed a harsher sentence than the 15 to 21 months recommended under sentencing guidelines because of a " pattern of threatening behavior by the defendant ... including threatening the ( federal prosecutor ) assigned to the case , " Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Jacobsen said .
Weaver pleaded guilty in August to transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure a person .
Weaver used the identity " F - ThePIGS " while posting expletive - filled online comments threatening to kill Johannes Mehserle , 27 .
Mehserle has been charged with murdering 22 - year - old Oscar Grant of Hayward early Jan. 1 while trying to arrest him at the Fruitvale BART Station .
The online messages were reported to the FBI in San Francisco by Mehserle 's father , Todd Mehserle , on Jan .
8 . Johannes Mehserle 's defense team cited the posts as the reason he went into hiding and was moved from place to place before being arrested .
The FBI identified Weaver through the two Internet protocol addresses that were used to post the statements .
Mehserle 's murder trial has been moved to Los Angeles because of the extensive attention the case has received in the Bay Area .
On Tuesday , the former officer made his final appearance in an Oakland courtroom before Judge Morris Jacobson of Alameda County Superior Court .
Jacobson told Mehserle , who is free on bail , to appear in a Los Angeles courtroom Jan. 8 for scheduling purposes .
" Mr. Mehserle , you have to be there , " the judge said .
" With that , good luck to you all . "
Two years ago , I asked readers and friends to share with their best PF practice of the year .
The best practice is not just the coolest idea but is what made the most difference in our financial lives this year .
At that time , the best practice was debt snowflaking .
We were living on Micah ’s stipend , I was working two part - time jobs ( at that point I was actually on the verge of getting the second job ) and doing various online work .
We could n’t be sure exactly how much money we ’d make every month , so we used debt snowflaking to pick up extra bits and pieces of our unused income and put it toward debt .
Looking back at the past year , however , I ’ve realized that we ’ve shifted to another main practice ( though we still snowflake ) which has been great for our finances .
We ’re living primarily on one income .
It ’s been a year and a week since I started working at my current job , which has given me a reliable source of income .
We started living entirely on my income and began putting away Micah ’s + whatever I earned form blogging and consulting for debt repayment , retirement , and my future grad school goals .
Not only does this help us move faster toward our goals , but it has prepared us for keeping our living expenses low in case either of us loses our jobs and helped last summer , when Micah took a semester off teaching to make progress on his dissertation .
Want to share the personal finance practice that has made the biggest difference to you in your day - to - day life and your year ’s financial goals ?

I ’ll add them ( at my discretion and as I ’m able ) to the post .

Cybele :
Round up when you subtract your cheque / bank entries .
you end up with more than you thought .
Go shopping , do n’t buy anything .
if you feel compelled to go back later , do it , but do n’t feel compelled to buy at the time .
Often not what you wanted anyway .
Time will show .
Chances are you wo n’t regret the “ lack ” ( which was only Perceived , not Real ) of the thing (s ) .

Frugal Dad says :
For us , the best practice was to use sinking funds to start saving for big , annual expenses .
We ’ve talked about doing this for a couple years , but finally but it into practice , and it has made these annual events a non-event , financially .
Jeff Rose of Good Financial Cents :
This year saw us implementing a strategy that was totally outside of our usual comfort zone .
We decided to start using a credit card to run all our monthly living expenses through to take advantage of reward points .
We both get squeamish at the thought of having any credit card debt but are plan is to pay it off each month .
We began charging everything - groceries , gas , eating out , cell phone bills , satellite bill .
If we can charge it …. we do .
We were even going to do our mortgage except our lender had some silly $ 75 per month charge to do so .
What was the end result ?
It ’s been much easier to track our finances having to use the one card ( instead of trying to track down ever receipt we used for our debit cards ) and thus far this year we got back $ 600 cash just for buying the stuff that we always bought anyway .
We still do n’t carry a balance and make sure to pay it off each month .
SVB at The Digerati Life :
“ My best PF practice for the year is to shop online .
I discovered online coupons and rewards sites such as Ebates and now I am saving more money by receiving cash back for purchases , by using coupon codes or by finding deals online .
I ’m much more familiar with the use of coupon codes now than I used to , so I first check if there ’s something out there I can get on discount before opening the wallet to pay for stuff .
For more on such sites , here ’s my Ebates review . ”
From Free From Broke :
One nice thing we did was to start entering in our bill ’s due dates into Google Calendar to remind us to pay bills on time .
It also helps us track which bills are coming up .
From Ben at Money Smart Life :
Ours is n’t a new practice and nothing original or creative but maintaining a solid emergency fund has really helped from a career standpoint .
In the fall of last year I had the chance to take a better job .
My wife was worried about me making the move in the middle of the horrible economy but the fact that we had a solid emergency fund made me comfortable pulling the trigger and the new job is much better .
Then this spring when they canceled the product I was working on and I was worried about being laid off , the emergency fund kept me from staying up all night and worrying
PT Money says :
Our best practice , which reaped the greatest benefit , has been opening a Roth IRA for each of us when the stock market was down .
Of course , we ’re long term investors but it did n’t hurt to invest in the Roth ( using index funds ) when the prices were cheap .
Patrick , of Cash Money Life writes :
Our best practice this year was to see how much interest we are paying each month .
We ran a simple exercise and were amazed at how much money we send the bank each month – just for the privilege of borrowing money .
This is a great exercise to motivate you to get out of debt !
Baker of Man vs. Debt :
Our by far was making the decision to “ Simplify our Financial Life . ”
This technically includes several steps , but the point of the decision was really big turning point ! 🙂
JT from The Smarter Wallet writes :
Automating one ’s savings programs is a great way to build up one ’s savings .
You can set up direct deposit , then have your bank move a certain amount from your checking account to your savings or investment accounts on a regular basis , usually once a month .
I ’ve done this both for short - term and long term savings plans and have been successful .
I wrote about some examples of savings programs in this article on how banks pay you to save .
Mike , a.k.a Oblivious Investor says :
Find a question ( or set of related questions ) that people are asking to which you already know the answers .
Write those answers down in a book .
Sell that book .
From Lin at Tellin It Like It Is :
We ’ve been working very hard to pay off debt ( smaller balances first ) , and each time we pay off a credit card in full with no lingering balance , it feels sooooo good .
In order to make sure we could really push hard with our goals to get out of debt , we cut waaay back on Christmas gifts ( and who gets gifts ) this year , and we ’re both very excited about lowering / reducing and eliminating our debt altogether .
New Year ’s Resolution for 2010 is to knock out as much debt as possible .. , and lose a few pounds . 🙂
Jacob at Early Retirement Extreme says :
Getting out of the rat race .
Not worrying about being employed , promoted , raised , and by George , not worrying about being productive on someone else ’s terms as if that was something to strive for .
It has made me a happy man .
Funny About Money writes :
Incorporating my various freelance enterprises in a single S- corporation .
My tax lawyer believes the “ wages ” 
I will have to pay myself can be limited to $ 500 , neatly getting around the privation posed by next year ’s Social Security earnings limitation .
An S - corp ’s revenues are not taxable to the corporation .
The owner has to draw down a “ reasonable ”  wage as the corporation ’s director .
The remaining revenues may be paid out as “ dividends . ” 
Because they ’re taxed as dividend income , Social Security does n’t view the money as earned income , and so it does n’t count as part of the piddling $ 14,160 you ’re allowed to earn if you ’re canned from your job ( as I was ) before reaching “ full ”  retirement age .
This year the side business earned over $ 6,000 after it was incorporated in June .
Even after start - up costs and the purchase of a MacBook ( paid for with untaxable money as the corporation ’s business expense ) , it still will provide several thousand dollars in dividends to pad next year ’s unemployment survival fund .
If it earns at a comparable rate next year – and it may , since funny about money is beginning to earn a few shekels – it will go a long way toward making “ retirement ”  a comfortable state of being .
Meg says :
So , for 2009 , my best practice was definitely to open my 401( k ) .
I already had a Roth IRA because I did n’t have enough info on the 401 ( k ) to make a truly informed decision .
Once I found out that I got a full dollar - for - dollar match up to 4 % with immediate vesting , I did n’t hesitate to sign up .
It ’s been accumulating money ever since , and completely painless too !
( Plus , the match is free money , so it feels like I ’m getting paid extra .
Always cool . )
J. Money of Budgets Are Sexy says :
Maxing out my retirement accounts !
For the first time ever I maxed out both the 401k and Roth IRA and it was worth every penny 😉
Well , at least I ’m hoping !
haha…
My goal is to continue doing this for at least 10 years and keep building it up NOW so that I can relax and watch it work in its own down the line … kinda like that saying “ have your money work for YOU ”  , right ?
Jim from Bargaineering writes :
For us , it was cooking more at home .
You get to knock out two birds with one stone – you entertain yourself by trying to cook something new and you feed yourself .
We started it as a way to trim our expenses , we were eating out way too much , because of the recession and we ’ve really reduced our “ dining ” out budget category .
Here are a few tips on how to cook more and eat out less , including a retort to the common “ but I do n’t cook ” excuse .
Revanche of the Gai Shan Life :
Considering all income , after basic expenses were covered , fair game for saving , and making sure every dollar has a job .
I have multiple savings accounts and they all have a purpose and name which makes it much easier to stay focused on the goal and protects them from frivolous raiding

My best financial practice is no new debt .
No new debt
ThriftyGal writes :
I ’d say the one major thing we did that contributed the most financially was renewing our lease on our old apartment rather than upgrading to a bigger / better one like we had intended .
I would have loved covered parking in the winter , modern amenities like elevators , more storage and space for the little one to crawl around , but doing without those little luxuries has padded our savings account quite nicely .
From Viviana of The Lean Times :
For me the best and easiest thing was to really track my spending to find any black holes .
I am now using an app to track because I would forget to write items down in my notebook .
I use iXpenseit which give me a monthly report .
Also when you are committed to tracking your spending , you think a bit more before opening your wallet .
From Financial Samurai
For me it ’s been getting as educated as I can , both formally and on my own .
Never stop learning .
Never stop reading .
Keep learning about your own finances , about the difference between a Roth IRA & 401 ( k ) or between two funds you ’re thinking about investing in .
Do n’t assume you can know it all .

Microsoft has already appealed the original ruling
A ban on Microsoft selling certain versions of its flagship products Word and Office has begun .
The software firm was made to change elements of the software by US courts after a patent dispute with Canadian firm i4i .
Microsoft said that it had complied with the court 's ruling and would now offer " revised software " in the US .
The court ruling means that Microsoft must also pay i4i damages of $ 290 m ( £ 182 m ) .
However , the firm said on 8 January that it had filed another appeal against the injunction .
The firm wants a panel of 11 judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review the case in the hope of overturning the original judgment .
Microsoft has already challenged the ruling once .
But in December last year , a panel of three judges rejected its arguments and upheld the original decision of a Texas court that ruled that Microsoft had infringed a patent belonging to i4i .
The disputed patent relates to how Microsoft file formats , such as .docx , use aspects of XML , a language that allows formatting of text and makes files readable across different programs .
XML is used in recent versions of Microsoft 's word - processor Word .
Microsoft has now removed the disputed feature from all available versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office on sale in the US from today .
" This process will be imperceptible to the vast majority of customers , " the firm said in a statement .
Despite the firm 's compliance , Microsoft has said it will still challenge the case .
Kevin Kutz , director of public affairs at Microsoft , said the latest appeal had been filed because the firm believed the decision in December conflicted with " established precedents governing trial procedure and the determination of damages " .
" We are concerned that the decision weakens judges ' authority to apply appropriate safeguards in future patent trials , " he added .
Court Vindicates Doctor Who Questioned Fertility Study , Throws Out Kwang Yul Cha ’s Defamation Lawsuit Against Bruce Flamm
LOS ANGELES , October 24 — A study was published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine claiming that prayers from the USA , Canada , and Australia caused a 100 % increase in pregnancy rates among infertility patients in Korea .
The surprising results announced by Kwang Cha and associates were widely reported in the news media , including on the ABC news program Good Morning America .
However , the study ’s credibility was undermined when one of the co-authors , Daniel Wirth , was arrested by the FBI and later pled guilty to fraud .
Cha ’s other co-author , Columbia University ’s Rogerio Lobo , later revealed that he had not participated in the research and withdrew his name from the published findings .
Even with one of his co-authors in federal prison and the other disgraced , Korean fertility specialist Kwang Yul Cha stood by the allegedly supernatural study .
He eventually filed a defamation lawsuit against Bruce Flamm , a California physician who had published several articles questioning the validity of the Cha / Wirth “ pregnancy by prayer ” report .
The lawsuit , filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in August 2007 , was thrown out of court in April 2008 .
However , in June 2008 Cha took the case to the California Appellate Court .
Today the Court of Appeals “ affirmed in full ” the Superior Court decision and thus ruled that Superior Court Judge James Dunn had acted appropriately in tossing out the lawsuit .
In response to the ruling , Dr. Flamm issued the following statement : “ Today ’s ruling is a victory for science and evidence - based medicine .
Scientists must be allowed to question bizarre claims .
Cha ’s mysterious study was designed and allegedly conducted by a man who turned out to be a criminal with a 20 - year history of fraud .
A criminal who steals the identities of dead children to obtain bank loans and passports is not a trustworthy source of research data .
Cha could have simply admitted this obvious fact but instead he hired a team of lawyers to punish me for voicing my opinions .
Physicians should debate their opinions in medical journals , not in courts of law .
Judges have better things to do with their time and taxpayers have better things to do with their money . ”
Dr. Flamm is a physician with Kaiser Permanente and a Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of California .
He has been the senior investigator on numerous medical studies and has written several books and book chapters .

The Proof Behind the CRU Climategate Debacle : Because Computers Do Lie When Humans Tell Them To
From Cube Antics , by Robert Greiner
I ’m coming to you today as a scientist and engineer with an agnostic stand on global warming .
If you do n’t know anything about “ Climategate ” ( does anyone else hate that name ? )
Go ahead and read up on it before you check out this post , I ’ll wait .
Back ?
Let ’s get started .
First , let ’s get this out of the way : Emails prove nothing .
Sure , you can look like an unethical asshole who may have committed a felony using government funded money ; but all email is , is talk , and talk is cheap .
Now , here is some actual proof that the CRU was deliberately tampering with their data .
Unfortunately , for readability ’s sake , this code was written in Interactive Data Language ( IDL ) and is a pain to go through .
NOTE : This is an actual snippet of code from the CRU contained in the source file : briffa_Sep98_d.pro
[ sourcecode language = ” text ” ]
;
; Apply a VERY ARTIFICAL correction for decline !!
;
yrloc= [ 1400 , findgen ( 19 ) * 5.+1904 ]
valadj = [ 0.,0.,0.,0.,0. , -0.1, -0.25,-0.3,0. , -0.1,0.3,0.8,1.2,1.7,2.5,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.6]*0.75 ; fudge factor
if n_elements ( yrloc ) ne n_elements ( valadj ) then message , ’Oooops ! ’
yearlyadj=interpol( valadj , yrloc , timey )
[ / sourcecode ]
Mouse over the upper right for source code viewing options – including pop-up window
What does this Mean ?
A review of the code line - by - line
Starting off Easy
Lines 1 - 3 are comments
Line 4
yrloc is a 20 element array containing :
1400 and 19 years between 1904 and 1994 in increments of 5 years …
yrloc = [ 1400 , 1904 , 1909 , 1914 , 1919 , 1924 , 1929 , … , 1964 , 1969 , 1974 , 1979 , 1984 , 1989 , 1994 ]
findgen ( ) creates a floating - point array of the specified dimension .
Each element of the array is set to the value of its one - dimensional subscript
F = indgen( 6 ) ; F [ 0 ] is 0.0 , F [ 1 ] is 1.0 ….. F[ 6 ] is 6.0
Pretty straightforward , right ?
Line 5
valadj , or , the “ fudge factor ” array as some arrogant programmer likes to call it is the foundation for the manipulated temperature readings .
It contains twenty values of seemingly random numbers .
We ’ll get back to this later .
Line 6
Just a check to make sure that yrloc and valadj have the same number of attributes in them .
This is important for line 8 .
Line 8
This is where the magic happens .
Remember that array we have of valid temperature readings ?
And , remember that random array of numbers we have from line two ?
Well , in line 4 , those two arrays are interpolated together .
The interpol ( ) function will take each element in both arrays and “ guess ” at the points in between them to create a smoothing effect on the data .
This technique is often used when dealing with natural data points , just not quite in this manner .
The main thing to realize here , is , that the interpol ( ) function will cause the valid temperature readings ( yrloc ) to skew towards the valadj values .
What the heck does all of this mean ?
Well , I ’m glad you asked .
First , let ’s plot the values in the valadj array .
Look familiar ?
This closely resembles the infamous hockey stick graph that Michael Mann came up with about a decade ago .
By the way , did I mention Michael Mann is one of the “ scientists ” ( and I use that word loosely ) caught up in this scandal ?
Here is Mann ’s graph from 1999
As you can see , ( potentially ) valid temperature station readings were taken and skewed to fabricate the results the “ scientists ” at the CRU wanted to believe , not what actually occurred .
Where do we go from here ?
It ’s not as cut - and - try as one might think .
First and foremost , this does n’t necessarily prove anything about global warming as science .
It just shows that all of the data that was the chief result of most of the environmental legislation created over the last decade was a farce .
This means that all of those billions of dollars we spent as a global community to combat global warming may have been for nothing .
If news station anchors and politicians were trained as engineers , they would be able to find real proof and not just speculate about the meaning of emails that only made it appear as if something illegal happened .
Conclusion
I tried to write this post in a manner that transcends politics .
I really have n’t taken much of an interest in the whole global warming debate and do n’t really have a strong opinion on the matter .
However , being part of the Science Community ( I have a degree in Physics ) and having done scientific research myself makes me very worried when arrogant jerks who call themselves “ scientists ” work outside of ethics and ignore the truth to fit their pre-conceived notions of the world .
That is not science , that is religion with math equations .
What do you think ?
Now that you have the facts , you can come to your own conclusion !
Be sure to leave me a comment , it gets lonely in here sometimes .
hat tip to WUWT commenter “ Disquisitive ”
========================
NOTE : While there are some interesting points raised here , it is important to note a couple of caveats .
First , the adjustment shown above is applied to the tree ring proxy data ( proxy for temperature ) not the actual instrumental temperature data .
Second , we do n’t know the use context of this code .
It may be a test procedure of some sort , it may be something that was tried and then discarded , or it may be part of final production output .
We simply do n’t know .
This is why a complete disclosure and open accounting is needed , so that the process can be fully traced and debugged .
Hopefully , one of the official investigations will bring the complete collection of code out so that this can be fully examined in the complete context .

Tony Blair ’s admission that Britain would have backed the Iraq war even if he knew it did not have weapons of mass destruction sparked outrage Sunday and calls for his prosecution for war crimes .
The former British prime minister , who backed the US - led invasion in 2003 , told the BBC he would “ still have thought it right to remove ” Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein because of the threat he posed to the region .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawyers representing the deposed Iraqi leadership said they would seek to prosecute Blair following his remarks , while one newspaper commentator said it was a “ game - changing admission ” for the ongoing official inquiry into the war .
Former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix added : “ The war was sold on the WMD , and now you feel , or hear that it was only a question of deployment of arguments , as he said , it sounds a bit like a fig leaf that was held up . ”
Blair is due to give evidence to the inquiry into the war , led by former civil servant John Chilcot , early next year , and the commentator in the Sunday Telegraph said the investigation ’s focus must now change .
“ Mr Blair ’s game - changing admission gives them a licence to be tougher and more prosecutorial , ” he wrote , a call echoed by campaigners at Stop the War Coalition , who urged Chilcot ’s inquiry to recommend legal action against Blair .
Professor Philippe Sands , a leading international lawyer , said he believed Blair ’s comments had left him vulnerable to legal proceedings .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The fact that the policy was fixed by Tony Blair irrespective of the facts on the ground , and irrespective of the legality , will now expose him more rather than less to legal difficulties , ” Sands told The Sunday Herald .
A lawyer for Saddam Hussein ’s jailed former deputy prime minister , Tareq Aziz , wrote to Britain ’s top legal adviser Saturday asking permission to prosecute Blair for war crimes .
In a statement Sunday , Giovanni di Stefano said the former prime minister ’s comments were an admission that “ his aim was regime change .
That is without question unlawful and subject to criminal proceedings ” .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the absence of explicit UN approval , Blair justified the war on the basis of Iraq ’s possession of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and long - range missiles and its non-compliance with UN weapons inspections , in defiance of numerous UN resolutions .
The alleged chemical and biological weapons were never found , but Blair said he would have gone to war even if he had known they were not there .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I would still have thought it right to remove him ( Saddam Hussein ) .
Obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat , ” he said .
He added : “ It was the notion of him as a threat to the region , of which the development of WMD was obviously one , and because you ’d had 12 years of United Nations to and fro on this subject , he used chemical weapons on his own people — so this was obviously the thing that was uppermost in my mind . ”
Nick Clegg , leader of the center - left Liberal Democrats , accused Blair of “ breathtaking cynicism ” , while David Cameron , the leader of the main opposition Conservatives , said he was “ quite surprised ” at the remarks .
ADVERTISEMENT
While Saddam Hussein had violated many UN resolutions and was “ a menace ” to the region , Cameron — whose party backed the invasion — noted that Blair had put a “ huge amount of weight on the WMD argument ” to justify war .
A poll published three days before the invasion found widespread British support for military action as long as it was backed by the United Nations and there was proof Iraq had WMDs .
Without these conditions , support plummeted to 26 percent .
Cameron also called for Blair to give his evidence to the Chilcot inquiry in public , amid reports that closed door hearings were planned .
An inquiry spokesman denied this , saying Blair would appear “ very much in public ” .

Plasma life forms
Columnist : Jay Alfred Posted on Monday , 12 November , 2007 | 4 comments Columnist :
Article Copyright© Jay Alfred - reproduced with permission .
Life - Like Qualities of Plasma : Bohm , a leading expert in twentieth century plasma physics , observed in amazement that once electrons were in plasma , they stopped behaving like individuals and started behaving as if they were a part of a larger and interconnected whole .
Although the individual movements of each electron appeared to be random , vast numbers of electrons were able to produce collective effects that were surprisingly well organized and appeared to behave like a life form .
The plasma constantly regenerated itself and enclosed impurities in a wall in the same way that a biological organism , like the unicellular amoeba , might encase a foreign substance in a cyst .
So amazed was Bohm by these life - like qualities that he later remarked that he frequently had the impression that the electron sea was " alive " and that plasma possessed some of the traits of living things .
The debate on the existence of plasma - based life forms has been going on for more than 20 years ever since some models showed that plasma can mimic the functions of a primitive cell .
Plasma cosmologist , Donald Scott , notes that " ...a [ plasma ] double layer can act much like a membrane that divides a biological cell " .
A model of plasma double layers ( a structure commonly found in complex plasmas ) has been used to investigate ion transport across biological cell membranes by researchers ( See American Journal of Physics , May 2000 , Volume 68 , Issue 5 , pp. 450-455 ) .
Researchers noted that " Concepts like charge neutrality , Debye length , and double layer [ used in plasma physics ] are very useful to explain the electrical properties of a cellular membrane " .
Plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén also noted the association of double layers with cellular structure , as had Irving Langmuir before him , who coined the term " plasma " after its resemblance to living blood cells .
David Brin's Sundiver also speculated on plasma life forms .
This science fiction proposed a form of life existing within the plasma atmosphere of a star using complex self - sustaining magnetic fields .
Similar types of plasmoid life have been proposed to exist in other places , such as planetary ionospheres or interstellar space .
Gregory Benford had a form of plasma - based life exist in the accretion disk of a primordial black hole in his novel Eater .
An international scientific team has discovered that under the right conditions , particles of inorganic dust can become organized into helical structures which can interact with each other in ways that are usually associated with organic life .
Using a computer model of molecular dynamics , V N Tsytovich and his colleagues of the Russian Academy of Science showed that particles in plasma can undergo self - organization as electric charges become separated and the plasma becomes polarized in their paper entitled From Plasma Crystals and Helical Structures towards Inorganic Living Matter , published in the New Journal of Physics in August 2007 .
Past studies , subject to Earth 's gravity , have shown that if enough particles are injected into a low - temperature plasma , they will spontaneously organize into crystal - like structures or " plasma crystals " .
Tsytovich 's computer simulations suggest that in the gravity - free environment of space , the plasma particles will bead together to form string - like filaments which will then twist into helical strands resembling DNA that are electrically charged and are attracted to each other .
The helical structures undergo changes that are normally associated with biological molecules , such as DNA and proteins , say the researchers .
They can , for instance , divide to form copies of the original structure ; which then interact to induce changes in their neighbors that evolve into other new structures .
The less stable structures break down over time leaving behind only the structures that are most adapted to the environment .
" These complex , self - organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter " , says Tsytovich , " they are autonomous , they reproduce and they evolve " .
He adds that the ionized conditions needed to form these helical structures are common in outer space .
If that is so , then it will mean that plasma life forms are the most common life form in the universe , given that plasma makes up more than 99 % of our universe which is almost everywhere ionized .
This is in stark contrast to carbon - based life forms , which according to the Rare Earth hypothesis proposed by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee , would be rare in the universe due to a number of factors – including the need for an acceptable range of temperatures to survive .
Plasma , on the other hand , is associated with high temperatures .
Plasma life forms would be much more adapted to environments which would be considered hostile to carbon - based life forms .
It is possible that plasma life forms were already present in the gas and materials that formed the Earth 4.6 billion years ago .
Carbon - based biomolecular life forms only appeared 1 billion years later .
Tsytovich and other scientists ( including Lozneanu and Sanduloviciu , discussed below ) have proposed that plasma life forms , in fact , spurred development of organic carbon - based life on Earth .
In this connection , Tsytovich pointed out that plasma life forms can develop under more down to Earth conditions such as at the point of a lightning strike .
The researchers hint that perhaps a plasma form of life emerged on the primordial Earth which had a highly ionized atmosphere , which then acted as the template for the more familiar organic molecules we know today .
A plasma bubble could form at the end of a lightning strike and act as a mould for chemicals to conform with to form a primitive biological cell .
This is not the first time in recent years that plasma life forms have been studied .
In 2003 physicists ; Erzilia Lozneanu and Mircea Sanduloviciu of Cuza University , Romania , described in their research paper Minimal Cell System created in Laboratory by Self - Organization ( published in Chaos , Solitons & Fractals , volume 18 , page 335 ) , how they created plasma spheres in the laboratory that can grow , replicate and communicate - fulfilling most of the traditional requirements for biological cells .
They are convinced that these plasma spheres offer a radically new explanation of how life began and proposed that they were precursors to biological evolution .
The researchers studied environmental conditions similar to those that existed on the Earth before life began , when the planet was enveloped in electric storms that caused ionized gases to form in the atmosphere .
They inserted two electrodes into a chamber containing a low - temperature polarized plasma of argon - a gas in which some of the atoms have been split into negatively - charged electrons and positively - charged ions .
They applied a high voltage to the electrodes , producing an arc of energy that bolted across the gap between them , like a miniature lightning strike .
Sanduloviciu says this electric spark caused a high concentration of ions and electrons to accumulate at the positively charged electrode , which spontaneously formed spheres .
Each sphere had a boundary made up of two layers - an outer layer of negatively charged electrons and an inner layer of positively charged ions .
Trapped inside the boundary was an inner nucleus of gas atoms - which was surrounded by a luminous sheet .
An electric field was present between the boundary and nucleus , within which electrons are accelerated .
The evolved sphere appears as a stable , self - confined , layered , luminous and nearly spherical body - much like the " orbs " described in the paranormal literature and discussed below .
The amount of energy in the initial spark governed their size and lifespan .
Sanduloviciu grew spheres from a few micrometers up to three centimeters in diameter .
Lozneanu and Sanduloviciu describe a rhythmic " inhalation " of the nucleus which mimics the breathing process of living systems and results in pulsations .
The spheres could replicate by splitting into two .
Under the right conditions they grew bigger , taking up neutral argon atoms and splitting them into ions and electrons to replenish their boundary layers .
Finally , they could communicate information by emitting electromagnetic energy , making the atoms within other spheres vibrate at a particular frequency .
" This is no different from the vibrating diaphragm in a telephone which enables information to be communicated from one point to another , " says David Cohen , reporting in the journal New Scientist .
This would give these plasma spheres an ability which would be described as telepathic if we did not know how electromagnetic waves worked .
Sanduloviciu insists that although the spheres require high temperature to form , they can survive at lower temperatures .
" That would be the sort of environment in which normal biochemical interactions occur " .
According to Sanduloviciu , these plasma spheres were the first cells on Earth , arising within electric storms , and he believes that the emergence of such spheres is a prerequisite for the evolution of biological cells .
He says that the cell - like spheres could be at the origin of other forms of life we have not yet considered .
" There could be life out there , but not as we know it " he says .
Indeed , according to plasma metaphysics , the microscopic orbs ( described in the paranormal literature ) and the macroscopic subtle bodies ( described in the metaphysical literature ) are plasma - based life forms .
In 2004 ( as reported in the Physical News Update by Phil Schewe and Ben Stein ) an experiment was conducted where particles in a plasma crystal arranged themselves into neat concentric shells ( or rings - from a two - dimensional perspective ) , to a total ball diameter of several millimeters .
These orderly Coulomb balls , consisting of aligned , concentric shells of dust particles , survived for long periods .
This structure was described as an " onion - like architecture " .
( Dark matter halos around galaxies also have similar structures . )
Paranormal analyst , Allan Danelek ( in his book The Case for Ghosts ) says , " One could think of orbs as ' tiny ghosts ' moving around a room , their essence being contained within a tiny sphere of pure energy , like air inside a bubble . "
This description matches the description of life - like pulsating plasma spheres generated in the laboratory by Lozneanu and Sanduloviciu .
According to the paranormal literature " orbs " are light anomalies that appear on photographs and video as spherical balls of light but as flashes of light to the naked eye because of their rapid speed of motion .
They exhibit intentional behavior - suggesting some consciousness or awareness of the environment .
Orbs often travel in groups or clusters i.e. they exhibit swarm behavior - also a characteristic of particles in plasma - a characteristic observed by Bohm ( see above ) .
Orbs also can dart back and forth rapidly like amoebic life - forms in a Petri dish .
The balls can be transparent , translucent or in a bright solid form .
These are signature features of magnetic plasma which has the natural property of being able to change its degree of opacity when internal frequencies change .
Magnetic plasma would also allow orbs to change their output of light or luminosity .
Looking at these balls in close - up reveals that they possess an onion - like layered structure i.e. they have concentric shells - a signature feature of plasma crystals .
Danelek says , " ...' true orbs ' do not reflect light the same way a dust particle or flying insect does , but are instead generally more opaque and , in some cases , even appear to have rings within them . "
Experienced ghost hunter Joshua Warren ( in his excellent book How to Hunt Ghosts ) says , " Often , orbs appear to have a nucleus , just like a cell .
The nucleus might be surrounded by ' bands ' - concentric circles emerging from it .
In fact , it might appear like an onion that 's been chopped in half . "
All these characteristics are identical to plasma crystals generated in the laboratory .
Some believe that an orb is a human soul or the life force of those that once inhabited a physical - dense body .
Psychics claim to be able to communicate with them on a regular basis , and ghost hunters encounter them quite frequently in photographs and video .
It is thought that they are conscious spirits that have stayed behind because they feel bound to their previous life or previous location for whatever reason - a typical characteristic of " Earth - bound " physical - etheric ghosts .
According to plasma metaphysics , ( genuine ) orbs are plasma life forms and are identical to the physical - etheric nuclei observed by metaphysicists Charles Leadbeater and Annie Besant that are released from dying persons .
Subtle Bioplasma Bodies in the Metaphysical LiteratureThese include :• Networks of filamentary currents ( known as " nadis " or " meridians " in the metaphysical literature ) . •
Helical currents , aligned with the spine , which resemble helical pinches and " snakes " often found in plasma . •
Plasma vortexes ( know as " chakras " in the metaphysical literature ) caused by the helical movement of particles entering the bioplasma body . •
Jets or beams of collimated light that issue out from these vortexes which evidence a plasma discharge ( similar to what issues out of a plasma gun ) . •
A magnetized plasma ovoid which surrounds and shields subtle bodies from the environment ( just as the Earth is protected by the magnetosphere - a sphere composed of collisionless magnetized plasma ) . •
A plasma ( Langmuir ) sheath ( know as an " auric sheath " or " auric shell " in the metaphysical literature ) which encloses the ovoid . •
The ability of subtle bodies to pass through each other suggesting that they are composed of collisionless plasma . •
The ability of subtle bodies to emit light ( not simply reflect them ) that generate colorful halos . •
The ability of subtle bodies to change their degree of opacity - becoming transparent or translucent . •
The electrical feel of subtle bodies .•
The responsiveness of subtle bodies to electromagnetic fields .
All these features were described and documented more than 2,000 years ago , mainly in the Hindu and Chinese acupuncture literature ; but also alluded to in the Buddhist and Christian scriptures and literature - long before the age of electricity and magnetism which was only sparked - off in the eighteenth century .
Furthermore , the list above is not exhaustive - it is only meant to be a sample of the features of subtle bodies which unmistakably points to plasma .
Details of the above observations can be found in the previous articles and books by this author .
The Spark of LifeAccording to plasma metaphysics , subtle bodies live in a magnetic plasma sphere ( an ordinarily invisible counterpart Earth ) - an environment similar to the early ( physical - dense ) Earth .
During in vitro fertilization the human embryo is given an electrical jolt to spark - off cell division .
The purpose of this routine electrical intervention is not known .
All is known is that cell division is unlikely to occur in the absence of this electrical intervention .
According to plasma metaphysics ( Our Invisible Bodies , 2006 ) , this electrical spark is necessary to generate a plasma bubble which acts as a catalyst during embryogenesis .
Unlike a biomolecular environment , a plasma environment allows long - range correlations , without which a 3 dimensional structure could not be projected from a 1 dimensional gene .
An embryo within a human body is protected by the plasma bubble ( i.e. the physical - etheric double ) of the mother and inherits a bubble within this environment .
( In this process , it acquires what the Qigong literature refers to as " prenatal qi " . )
An embryonic bioplasma body is projected into the plasma bubble based on information in the physical - etheric double of the DNA .
In fact , subtle radiation containing holographic information was observed by researchers at the Russian Academy of Science as a surprise effect during experiments when they were measuring the vibrational modes of DNA in solution using a sophisticated laser photon correlation spectrometer .
According to Sue Benford , their research suggests the existence of a subtle radiation linked to physical DNA that supports the hypothesis of an intact energy field containing relevant ' organismal information ' .
The Russian experiments produced different measurements when DNA was present and removed from the scattering chamber .
These results were contrary to the expectations of the experimenters .
After duplicating the initial experiment many times with re-calibrated equipment , the scientists were forced to accept that some new field structure existed .
This embryonic bioplasma body within the plasma bubble ( which contains helical currents ) grows together with the physical - biomolecular body but at an accelerated rate , being aided by the long range correlations present in the plasma but absent in the biochemical field .
There is mutual affinity between the bioplasma and physical - biomolecular bodies .
In fact , the term " plasma " is derived from a Greek word meaning " to mould " and was coined by Langmuir based on his observations of the manner in which the positive column of a glow discharge tended to mould itself to the containing tube .
Similarly , the bioplasma fetus wraps around the physical - biomolecular embryo while undergoing an accelerated morphogenesis ( relative to the physical - biomolecular embryo ) .
The physical - biomolecular body therefore is cued by the bioplasma body which acts an electronic matrix and a time - resolved hologram that guides its development .
The bioplasma body , in turn , acts as a mould or a template body for the development of the single - celled physical - biomolecular embryo to the adult body .
This has frequently been pointed out by metaphysicists , including Leadbeater , Besant and Barbara Brennan .
Complex biological evolution could not have taken place on Earth without the aid of the templates provided by subtle bioplasma bodies which interacted with biochemical fields via weak electromagnetic fields .
These bioplasma bodies are composed of high energy particles and inhabit ( magnetized ) plasmaspheres which share the same space and gravitational field as the physical - dense Earth .
The lowest energy plasmasphere has been described by metaphysicists as the physical - etheric Earth .
As proposed by Tsytovich , Lozneanu and Sanduloviciu , the physical - dense plasma cell was a precursor to the biological cell in the early ( physical - dense ) Earth - acting as a template or mould for the biological cell to form in 3 dimensional space .
However , the lightning strikes that generated the physical - dense plasma cells also generated physical - etheric plasma cells in the physical - etheric Earth .
As the conditions on Earth changed and the environment became progressively less ionized , the physical - dense plasma cell was less frequently generated .
However , the physical - etheric plasma cell ( existing in the physical - etheric Earth ) remained as it participated in the development of the biological body to which it was attached to and subsequently was transmitted together with the biological cells in various forms of reproduction - both asexual and sexual .

The John Muir Trust was concerned about the turbine 's visual impact
The first large scale wind farm planned for the Western Isles has been approved by the Scottish government .
Thirty - nine turbines had been proposed for the Muaitheabhal Wind Farm on Eisgein Estate , Lewis , but permission has been granted for 33 .
The Scottish government said it would generate electricity for 55,000 homes - almost four times the number of homes on the islands .
Landscape conservation charity John Muir Trust had objected to the farm .
Among its objections was that some of the 145 metre tall turbines would be visible from the Calanais standing stones .
RSPB Scotland said more renewable energy developments were needed to help tackle climate change .
But it said the Lewis site had one of the highest densities of golden eagles anywhere in the world and was concerned about the project .
I have maintained that the Western Isles must be able to play its part in harnessing and benefitting from our vast green energy potential
Jim Mather
Energy Minister
Six turbines were now been refused permission to try to lessen the visual impact of the scheme .
When first proposed , the project featured 133 turbines .
Approval for Muaitheadbhal comes in the same week the £ 80 m
Baillie wind farm near Thurso was approved by the government .
Baillie wind farm will supply power to the upgraded Beauly to Denny electricity transmission line .
Western Isles Council , Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , said plans to upgrade the inter- connector - a power line linking the islands with the Scottish mainland - should now be pushed forward .
Energy Minister Jim Mather said the Eisgein scheme would provide jobs for 150 people during its construction and make funds available to community projects .
The developer has entered into a formal agreement with the comhairle , which commits 1 % of turnover of the wind farm to the Muaitheabhal Community Wind Farm Trust .
A further 0.5 % share of turnover will be paid to the Western Isles Development Trust .
Plans rejected Mr Mather said : " Since the first proposals for a wind farm on Lewis were put forward , I have maintained that the Western Isles must be able to play its part in harnessing and benefitting from our vast green energy potential .
Today , we are making that reality . "
Onshore wind projects offer the best economic and community benefit to the Western Isles , according to a Scottish government report published a year ago .
It identified potential for a 150 megawatt ( MW ) wind farm on North Lewis .
Muaitheabhal has capacity to generate 118 MW .
In 2008 , Scottish ministers rejected plans for a 181 - turbine scheme on Barvas Moor , Lewis , designed to generate 651 MW of electricity .
Comhairle Leader , Angus Campbell , welcomed the decision to approve Muaitheabhal .
He added : " I believe we should see this positive news as a driving force for the early upgrading of the inter - connector to the islands which holds the key to the development of future wind , wave and tidal projects . "

I WOKE up the other morning to find that I would have to confront yet another headache - inducing attempt to phase - shift my perception of reality , and that this would require wading into historical accounts of the collection and homogenisation of temperature data .
On December 8th , a climate - change sceptic named Willis Eschenbach posted what he called the " smoking gun " of climate change data manipulation : a series of graphs of the uandjusted historical record of the temperature - monitoring site at the airport in Darwin , Australia , plotted against the same data as adjusted for various error factors ( " homogenised " ) by the Global Historical Climate Network , or GHCN .
Mr Eschenbach claimed the adjustment was so arbitrary , it had to be evidence of intentional manipulation .
Here 's his graph , and at first glance it seems pretty convincing , no ?
I encountered Mr Eschenbach 's post via a dismissive response from Kevin Drum , who pointed out that given that GHCN adjustments could produce sharp changes for one region or one site ( though little or no change globally ) , it would always be possible for someone to cherry - pick a site where the adjustment looked suspiciously large .
Mr Drum noted that Megan McArdle had also posted on the " smoking gun " argument , so I went to check out what she had to say .
Ms McArdle said the post did n't really shake her trust in the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming , but that it could well be evidence of subtle confirmation bias on the part of climate scientists , and she asked for more explanatory details .
I 've now spent many hours over the course of two days looking into this .
The first guideposts , fortunately , arrived quickly , because climate - change scientists have gotten faster at responding to these things .
The day after Mr Eschenbach 's post went up , you could find its flaws picked apart by Tim Lambert here and on " Things Break " here .
If you need one quick explanation , here it is :
A change in the type of thermometer shelter used at many Australian observation sites in the early 20th century resulted in a sudden drop in recorded temperatures which is entirely spurious .
It is for this reason that these early data are currently not used for monitoring climate change .
Other common changes at Australian sites over time include location moves , construction of buildings or growth of vegetation around the observation site and , more recently , the introduction of Automatic Weather Stations .
The impacts of these changes on the data are often comparable in size to real climate variations , so they need to be removed before long - term trends are investigated .
This is n't from the GHCN , or from the East Anglia Climate Research Unit .
It 's from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology ( BOM ) .
They conduct their own " homogenisation " of Australian temperature data sites , independent of the GHCN .
And here 's the temperature plot that the BOM came up with for the Darwin site :
The plot gets thinner .
In fact , there 's more information about the Darwin site easily available on the web .
According to this conversation from 2000 , the explanation for the dramatic change in 1941 is simple .
As previously advised , the main temperature station moved to the radar station at the newly built Darwin airport in January 1941 .
The temperature station had previously been at the Darwin Post Office in the middle of the CBD , on the cliff above the port .
Thus , there is a likely factor of removal of a slight urban heat island effect from 1941 onwards .
However , the main factor appears to be a change in screening .
The new station located at Darwin airport from January 1941 used a standard Stevenson screen .
However , the previous station at Darwin PO did not have a Stevenson screen .
Instead , the instrument was mounted on a horizontal enclosure without a back or sides .
The postmaster had to move it during the day so that the direct tropical sun did n't strike it !
Obviously , if he forgot or was too busy , the temperature readings were a hell of a lot hotter than it really was !
Interestingly , Mr Eschenbach includes a link to this conversation from 2000 in his own post .
But the moved station and the equipment change are n't the whole story .
As Mr Eschenbach notes , the temperature adjustment continues to change after 1941 .
Why might that be ?
Here 's why : homogenising historical temperature data records is extremely complicated .
People who maintained weather stations starting in 1880 did n't think to themselves , " Maybe someday people will need to measure climate change , so I better put down a really accurate thermometer and then ensure nothing about the instrument or the surrounding area changes for the next 130 years . "
They were mostly just trying to do garden - variety meteorology .
The early temperature measurements we have are a broken and incomplete record of more and less good data from instruments that were often changed , moved , or that found themselves in different settings over time .
When scientists started putting together the vast library of the planet 's temperature records in the 1980s in order to do climate - change assessment , they needed to be able to weed out these changes and errors .
And they could n't always do that by reading meteorologists ' diaries .
They needed to use statistical tools to hunt for anomalies .
So they developed some .
And those statistical tools proved very good .
They picked out , for example , a station in West Africa where someone had started measuring temperatures in Kelvin for a decade or so ; the people who entered it into the global database , seeing a bunch of numbers around 300 , had assumed the temperatures were in Celsius but missing a decimal point , and had divided by 10 rather than subtracting 273.15 , which produced an inaccurate and compressed distribution for those years .
But most of the errors and biases are far more subtle .
So scientists homogenising data compare each weather station to the closest surrounding ones , creating a " reference series " , and hunt for a suspicious divergence in trends .
That 's how the GHCN arrives at its adjustments for the Darwin station .
Mr Eschenbach complains about the GHCN 's adjustments , saying that there are too few nearby stations to make an adjustment : " The nearest station that covers the year 1941 is 500 km away from Darwin .
Not only is it 500 km away , it is the only station within 750 km of Darwin that covers the 1941 time period . "
He 's talking about the Daly Waters Pub , but he 's inexplicably wrong .
The GISS website he used for his own data shows two closer stations operating in 1941 , Katherine Aer ( 272 km ) and Wyndham Port ( 454 km ) .
Both had temperature data series that ran for a long time .
Here 's what they look like , unadjusted :
A third station , Kalumburu , is essentially the same distance as Daly Waters Pub ( 504 km ) , but it did n't start getting reliable data until 1944 .
Here 's what it looks like , unadjusted :
They all show basically the same rising trend .
But look :
Mr Eschenbach himself admits the 1941 adjustment was necessary .
By the time we start looking at the later adjustments he worries about , in the 1960s and 70s , there are 22 stations within 500 km of Darwin to create a reference series .
And they all show roughly the same upward - trending series .
So is it reasonable , if the GHCN is using complex statistical tools to adjust the temperature readings at Darwin based on surrounding stations , that they might come up with the figures they came up with ?
Sure .
No .
Yes .
I have no idea .
And neither does Mr Eschenbach .
Because in order to judge that , you would have to have a graduate - level understanding of statistical modeling .
For example , one paper describing the BOM 's homogenisation approach includes this discussion :
Trewin ( 2001 ) comments that the median reference series used by Torok ( 1996 ) can have biases introduced when converting the median interannual differences back into an absolute reference series by the accumulation of rounding errors in the interannual differences ( also well documented in Peterson and Easterling ( 1994 ) ) .
This can introduce spurious trends in the reference series .
Trewin ( 2001 ) uses a distance weighted mean of highly correlated reference station anomalies to create the reference series and so avoids the problems associated with the conversion of interannual differences .
The weights ,
Wi , are given by Eqn 1 where di is the inter-station separation measured in degrees , and ri is the interstation correlation and N is the number of stations .
Wi = {ri ( 6 – dI ) 2 , r > 0.6 , dI < 6 } i=1 , ... ,N ...1 {0 , r < 0.6 , diI > 6}
I do n't understand that formula .
I do n't have the math for it .
The paper goes on to reject the Trewin formula for reasons which , again , I do n't have the math to understand .
This is academic - level statistics .
You can't render judgment on it by plugging disparate data series into Excel and eyeballing the trend lines , as Mr Eschenbach does .
Here , for example , is a recent example of the kind of stuff climate scientists have to be able to do with statistics in order to get accurate results :
Two discontinuities were detected in the air - temperature time series at the meteorological station of the National Observatory of Athens .
The first discontinuity reflects the instrumental change , which took place in June 1995 and the second discontinuity ( and most pronounced ) the application of a correction factor to the temperature values ( in January 1997 ) , after a calibration of the new thermometers .
As a result , a cooling bias was observed after June 1995 and a warming bias after January 1997 .
The magnitude of bias exhibited a seasonal variability being more pronounced and reaching up to 0.67 °C during the warm period of the year .
Judging by his post , Mr Eschenbach does n't have the expertise to assess issues like these any more than I do .
Mr Eschenbach is not a scientist ; he 's an amateur .
His first effort in climate scepticism apparently came in 2002 while working as the construction manager for a beach resort in Fiji , when he published a non-peer - reviewed article claiming to have found that sea levels in Tuvalu were not actually rising , and that claims that they were stemmed from attempts by locals to blame subsidence problems on the developed world , and cash in on it to have found that the sea level in Tuvalu was " not rising at more than the historical rate " , and that the problems being blamed on rising sea levels in fact stemmed from the locals ' rising populations and poor environmental stewardship .*
He 's been beating this drum for years ; he does not approach this issue from a position of neutral scepticism , he approaches it from a position of certainty that AGW is a hoax .
Look back , for instance , at the way Mr Eschenbach starts off his discussion of the Darwin data .
He makes it sound as if he 's just happened to stumble across this one site whilst perusing a debate over climate change in northern Australia .
But as his link to that conversation from 2000 makes clear , Mr Eschenbach is already aware that climate change denialists have been trumpeting the apparent anomalies at Darwin for nine years .
Climate - change sceptics have been trumpeting the apparent anomalies at Darwin for nine years .**
They do so because of that errant data at Darwin from before 1941 , which makes it look as though there was a cooling trend there .
The fact that climate - change researchers have to do a particularly strong correction on the data at Darwin , because they moved their dang instruments from the downtown post office to the airport , makes Darwin a perfect place to look for support if you want to claim that climate - change scientists are cooking the data .
So , after hours of research , I can dismiss Mr Eschenbach .
But what am I supposed to do the next time I wake up and someone whose name I do n't know has produced another plausible - seeming account of bias in the climate - change science ?
Am I supposed to invest another couple of hours in it ?
Do I have to waste the time of the readers of this blog with yet another long post on the subject ?
Why ?
Why do these people keep bugging us like this ?
Does the spirit of scientific scepticism really require that I remain forever open - minded to denialist humbug until it 's shown to be wrong ?
At what point am I allowed to simply say , look , I 've seen these kind of claims before , they always turn out to be wrong , and it 's not worth my time to look into it ?
Well , here 's my solution to this problem : this is why we have peer review .
Average guys with websites can do a lot of amazing things .
One thing they cannot do is reveal statistical manipulation in climate - change studies that require a PhD in a related field to understand .
So for the time being , my response to any and all further " smoking gun " claims begins with : show me the peer - reviewed journal article demonstrating the error here .
Otherwise , you 're a crank and this is not a story .
And then I 'll probably go ahead and try to investigate the claim and write a blog post about it , because that 's my job .
Oh , and by the way : October was the hottest month on record in Darwin , Australia .
* Mr Eschenbach has since sent us a copy of his article , " Tuvalu Not Experiencing Increased Sea Level Rise " , and we believe this is a more accurate description of what he wrote .
** Mr Eschenbach has written that he came across a 2000 conversation about Darwin temperature data to which his post referred after starting his investigation into the subject , and that my accusation that he already knew this temperature series was controversial is unfounded .
This is true .
I do n't know in what order he discovered his facts , so it was not fair of me to make the accusation that he already knew about the data .
I apologise .
Addendum : I spoke earlier today with Blair Trewin , a climatologist at the Australian BOM's National Climate Center .
He said the BOM was trying to reconcile its own adjustments for the Darwin station with those of the GHCN .
The BOM 's " current data set does have a number of small adjustments over that period that are step functions .
And all of those are attributed to there being quite a number of stationary locations within the Darwin Airport boundaries between 1970 and 1990s .
We in our current set have an adjustment of 0.8 of a degree at 1941 , which matches GHCN pretty well .
And then the various small adjustments between 1940 and 1990 are a cumulative 0.6 .
Whereas GHCN , that graph makes it look like it ’s about a cumulative 1 degree .
But that ’s probably within the margin of error for a single - station adjustment . "
Mr Trewin explained another reason for the adjustment at Darwin when the station moved from the downtown Post Office to the airfield : the post office was situated on a harbor where , during the dry season , ocean water temperature tends to be warmer than land temperature .
As for the nature of the BOM 's adjustments , Mr Trewin said he thinks " all of them are associated with a documented , either stationary location change or another change in local environment around the station . "
" In an ideal world , " Mr Trewin said , " we would like to have a good range of stations that have n’t moved , have n’t had changes in their local environment .
But if we want to get any information with regard to the climate over the long term , we have to make the most of what data we have . "

At least 10 people have been injured after legislators in Chaco , Argentina began punching and throwing chairs at each other during a provincial parliamentary election .
The violence broke out when officials from the governing party tried to stop the opposition from entering a session after electing the new president of the northern province 's lower house .
Images of the legislators throwing plastic chairs and seats before being stopped by local police and security were shown on local television .
The BBC's Bill Turnbull and Sian Williams describe what happened .
Hezbollah is rapidly rearming in preparation for a new conflict with Israel , fearing that Benjamin Netanyahu 's government will attack Lebanon again prior to any assault on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Last week , Israeli commandos seized a ship in the Mediterranean loaded with almost 400 tonnes of rockets and small arms – which Israel claimed was being sent from Iran to its Hezbollah allies .
In dramatic further evidence of growing tensions , the Observer has learned that Hezbollah fighters have been busy reinforcing fixed defence positions north of the Litani river .
Having lost many of its bunkers in the south , Hezbollah is preparing a new strategy to defend villages there .
Although the organisation denied last week that the weapons were intended for its use , senior commanders have done little to disguise the scale of rearmament .
" Sure , we are rearming , we have even said that we have far more rockets and missiles than we did in 2006 , " said a Hezbollah commander , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel began after an ill - advised operation by to kidnap two Israeli soldiers , prompting a massive Israeli response that lasted 34 days and killed more than 1,000 people .
" We had to blow up or leave some of our bunkers and fighting positions , but we still have plenty of capabilities in the south .
We expect the Israelis to come soon , if not this winter , then they will wait until spring , when the ground is n't too soft for their tanks . "
It was expected that the ceasefire would neutralise Hezbollah military efforts along the Lebanon - Israel border , as a newly bolstered United Nations peacekeeping force and the Lebanese army took up positions .
Instead , based on dozens of interviews and multiple trips into the country 's south , it is clear that Hezbollah believes it would face different challenges .
It has been forced to abandon the line of deeply entrenched static positions on the border with Israel and withdraw most of its men and weaponry to clusters of Shia villages .
" It 's clear that Hezbollah no longer controls the border , due to the presence of Unifil [ United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ] troops , " said Andrew Exum , a military expert on Hezbollah at the Centre for New American Security .
" They appear to be hardening the villages for this next round of fighting , while pushing their fixed positions north away from Unifil to protect the approaches to Beirut and the Bekaa Valley . "
Israel and the United States have long assumed that any military action against Iran 's nuclear programme would draw a muscular response from its close allies in Hezbollah .
According to Israeli military and intelligence analysts , any move against Iran would require a move first against Hezbollah 's capability to disrupt life in northern Israel with its rockets .
Tel Aviv seems unlikely to commit the same mistakes it did in 2006 , when the plan was for air strikes to disrupt and confuse Hezbollah 's military command , while minimising the use of ground troops .
Israeli military sources have said that they are preparing for a potential new conflict .
Cruising through the serene green wadis that connect south Lebanon to the Litani river to the north , the commander explains what happened at the end of the last war .
" We knocked out three of their tanks on the first day , as they tried to enter , " he explained at a turn - off by the village of al - Qantara .
" But after they entered the wadi , we knew they were going for the river and had to be stopped .
So we called out to all the special forces anti-tank teams in the area .
And they all swarmed the wadi .
Boys would set up and wait for the tanks , fire off their rounds and then pull back .
Then they would pull back a kilometre or so down the wadi and wait for them again . "
According to Israeli military reports , after the first and last tanks were hit by rocket fire or mines , killing the company commander , the 24 tanks were essentially trapped inside a valley , surrounded on all sides and pinned down by mortars , rockets and mines .
Eleven tanks were destroyed and the rest partially damaged and Israel lost at least 12 soldiers .
As unlikely as the Israelis might be to repeat these mistakes , they must figure out how to get their heavy armour past the Hezbollah teams that still lurk in the hills and valleys in the next round of fighting , if and when it comes .
An online campaign is targeting Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch for backing race - baiting attacks on President Obama by Fox ’s Glenn Beck .
Murdoch , chairman of Fox News Channel ’s parent company News Corp , said Nov. 6 that Beck was right when he called the president “ a racist ” on his show .
On the July 28 “ Fox and Friends ” show , Beck , the program ’s host , accused Obama of being “ a guy who has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture . ”
That was too much for his co-host Brian Kilmeade , who pointed out that many members of Obama ’s administration are white , so “ you ca n’t say he does n’t like white people . ”
Beck insisted .
“ I ’m not saying he does n’t like white people , ” he said .
“ I ’m saying he has a problem .
This guy is , I believe , a racist . ”
The online group ColorOfChange.org said Murdoch ’s statement is “ a clear sign that Fox ’s problems with race start at the very top . ”
After Murdoch ’s comment sparked a flood of negative publicity , he backtracked four days later .
On Nov. 11 , a News Corp. spokesman told Politico that Murdoch “ does not at all , for a minute , think the president is a racist . ”
But Murdoch and his spokespeople declined to criticize Beck .
“ It ’s time to force the conversation , publicly , ” says ColorOfChange .
“ Murdoch can stand by the fact that he supports Glenn Beck ’s race - baiting ; or he can tell us why he does n’t and what he ’s going to do about it . ”
“ Which is it , Mr. Murdoch ? ” the online petition asks .
“ Fox News , under your leadership , has had a long , deep history of engaging in inflammatory racial rhetoric : attacking black leaders , black culture , and black institutions .
Now you ’ve been caught defending the words and behavior of Glenn Beck , the worst of the worst when it comes to race - baiting , whom more than 80 advertisers have abandoned –because of the very comments you endorsed .
“ More and more it appears that Fox ’s problem with race starts at the top , with you .
If you support Beck and others on Fox News using race - baiting , say so .
If you have a problem with their tactics , tell us what you ’re going to do to make them stop .
You ca n’t have it both ways .
“ We can hold Beck , Fox , and News Corp. accountable .
It starts by demanding Murdoch answer a few simple questions .
Please add your voice now . ”
An online campaign launched by ColorOfChange this summer helped spur 81 companies to pull their ads from Beck ’s show .
The group says that online petition drew more than 285,000 signers .
ColorOfChange.org says it “ exists to strengthen Black America ’s political voice .
Our goal is to empower our members – Black Americans and our allies – to make government more responsive to the concerns of Black Americans and to bring about positive political and social change for everyone .

Cannabis Colleges Crop Up : New Institutions for ' Higher ' Learning Cannabis classes flourish in down economy .
Nov. 30 , 2009  --
Do n't expect to pull an all - nighter at Med Grow Cannabis College .
Michigan 's first training center for medical marijuana education does n't ask students for their homework .
There are no final exams .
" We 're more of a trade school , " said Nick Tennant , Med Grow 's 24 - year - old founder .
As states loosen their medical marijuana laws , institutions such as Med Grow are sprouting up , looking to educate potential caregivers about how to enter the cannabis industry the legal way .
Tennant opened the doors of Med Grow 's 4,800 - square - foot facility near Detroit in September , about 10 months after voters approved the state 's medical marijuana act .
Always wanting to be his own boss , Tennant had dropped out of college to manage valet and auto - detail companies .
But when his businesses contracted under the smothering recession , he looked to the medical marijuana industry for his next opportunity , months before the measure was up for public vote .
" We knew the law was going to get passed , " he said .
In addition to Michigan , 12 states have legalized medical marijuana use : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
Tennant fashioned part of his business model after California 's Oaksterdam University , which claims to be the country 's first cannabis college , opening in 2007 .
Oaksterdam has three campuses in California : Oakland , Los Angeles and North Bay .
Spokeswoman Salwa Ibrahim said the institution , which staffs about 50 employees , has graduated about 5,500 students .
Oaksterdam welcomes the country 's new crop of cannabis colleges , she said .
" We welcome competition , " she said .
" Ultimately , what we 're trying to do is change laws locally and federally . "
Hawaii activist Roger Christie says he connects the high he sustains from marijuana use as a " spiritual " ritual , a practice he believes is legal under First Amendment religion protections .
He has been an advocate of marijuana use and legalization for 23 years , he said .
Only recently did he add educational outreach to his Hawaii Cannabis Ministry .
After reading a news story about a continental cannabis college , he decided to add monthly seminars to his ministry 's repertoire this fall .
So far , he has educated about 60 people over two weekend seminars .
A $ 100 donation covers the cost of classes and a hemp seed lunch .
" We train people to grow the best cannabis humanly possible , " Christie said .
Med Grow students cover an array of topics related to the budding industry over semester - long courses or seminars .
The curriculum covers proper cultivation and breeding , cooking tips and recipes , how to start a care - giving business and Cannabis History 1010 .
" Students should feel very confident that they 're going to succeed , " Tennant said .
Medical Marijuana Classes Flourish
Tennant 's school employs 12 people , he said .
About 60 students are taking courses during this cycle .
Med Grow 's five - week semester program , which offers two tracks convening on Monday or Wednesday nights , costs $ 475 .
Unlike accredited academic institutions , there is no standard of practices for cannabis colleges in Michigan .
Tennant provides his graduates with a paper certificate anyway .
It is n't required , but a student could use it to establish credibility as a professional caregiver , proving he or she is " not just some Joe Shmoe off the street , " he said .
Graduates of Tennant 's college wo n't be leaving their training to set up mass dispensaries .
Under Michigan law , state - registered caregivers are only allowed to provide marijuana to a maximum of five patients .
In California , students of cannabis colleges have a few more options , Ibrahim said .
Students come from out - of - state to become lobbyists , dispensary managers as well as caregivers .
" They can do whatever they want to do , " she said .
Trey Daring , 26 , moved to Daly City , Calif. , after graduating from Old Dominion University , in Virginia , to work as an advocate for the cannabis movement .
His favorite course is advanced horticulture -- it 's the most useful , he said .
He 'll graduate in mid-December .
Parents ' Not Necessarily Proud ' of Cannabis College Certification
Daring 's parents are uneasy about his advocacy of the drug because marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law , the government 's most restrictive category that also includes LSD , ecstasy and heroin , he said .
" I feel like they 're understanding now but not necessarily proud , " he said .
His classrooms are not that much different from ones he had in high school and college : dry -erase boards , PowerPoint presentations and knowledgeable instructors .
Perhaps the part that 's most different is his classmates .
" There are a lot more people over 30 than probably outsiders would believe , " he said .
Med Grow students also run the demographic gamut .
Tennant said his pupils include 18 - year - old high school graduates , a 60 - year - old pastor and former clients of his old auto - detailing business , some of whom find themselves struggling to keep their own businesses afloat .
His instructors stress that their curriculum is for medicinal purposes only , not recreational tips , he said .
" I run a very tight operation here , " he said .
The medical marijuana industry could potentially help Michigan 's battered economy , provided it is not abused , Tennant said .
Ibrahim of California 's Oaksterdam University also sees cannabis as a way to contribute positively to a state 's economy .
Oaksterdam 's Oakland campus recently moved into a 30,000 - square - foot building and , she said , the school expects to educate about 1,000 students a month , double the capacity of the previous space .
" It really is flourishing in this economy , " she said .
" We 're evidence of it .
We just moved into a larger facility when everything else seems to be downsizing . "

Buh - Bye , Club Libby Lu
There 's plenty about the state of our economy to lament and plenty of stores that are going out of business that we may feel sorry for -- even miss .
But there 's one that 's closing that 's simply a good riddance : that 's Club Libby Lu .
More than a year and a half ago , we had a spirited discussion about the store , which was founded in 2000 by Mary Drolet , bought by Saks Inc. and expanded to 98 stores around the country .
Club Libby Lu stores -- which ultimately proved unprofitable for Saks -- will all be closed by the end of January , according to Club Libby Lu's Web site .
Last spring , a commenter who identified herself as Drolet described the experience at Club Libby Lu as this :
" Club Libby Lu is a place -- first and foremost -- where little girls can engage their imaginations and have fun being a girl .
Yes , that involves playing dress - up , getting their hair done and the application of a little makeup .
Those are the means to an end , though , with the end being how these activities make a little girl feel . "
The problem was that the club 's version of dress - up involved hooking girls as young as 3 on glittery tube tops , tight pants , boas , nail polish , lip gloss , tiaras and runway modeling .
Princesses and pop stars -- hence sex -- were in .
So , dress - up was cool and fun , if it was sexy .
No pilots or doctors or astronauts or firefighters to dress as in this place .
Drolet 's dream of a place where girls can spread their imaginations is a great one .
Now , girls everywhere will just have to make up those dreams themselves while " borrowing " from Mom and Dad 's closets and bathroom drawers .
Club Libby Lu's demise has pleased at least some in the blogosphere :
Writes Greg Allen at Daddytypes.com :
" So awesome .
Club Libby
Lu is closing all its stores .
...
When I first discovered Club Libby Lu as a new parent , I dreaded about someday having to fight the superficial , idiotic , pop culture - worshipping chain 's impending influence on my daughter .
But then after a snotty little CLL employee chewed me out , I ran the numbers and saw that I did n't need to worry : the Club Libby Lu concept was failing in slow motion and would only get easier , not harder , to avoid . "
That 's a far different impression of the store than the one commenter Drolet portrayed on the blog last year :
" If you teach your daughters that they have to look good to succeed and that outer beauty is what matters most , that 's what they 'll believe .
But if you teach and show them they can be anything they want to be , no matter what , and that nothing is impossible , then that 's what they 'll hang on to .
And if you take them to Club Libby Lu , they 'll have fun , they 'll feel empowered and good about themselves , and they 'll love you even more for it . "
How do you feel about Club Libby Lu's closing ?
Do you wonder whether something new will try to fill its " void ? "

Two wheelchair - bound residents of an East Village shelter got into a deadly argument early yesterday morning .
Witnesses say that 24 - year - old Ronal Garcia was killed after being stabbed repeatedly by 51 - year - old suspect Felipe Rivera - Cruz after the pair exchanged insults .
Police were first called to the Barrier - Free Living facility on East Second Street about an hour before the stabbing to break up a fight between the two men that started when the younger man took offense to something the older man said .
" [ Cruz ] was talking about his [ Garcia ’s ] genitals — you have a short one this , you have a short one that , " Garcia ’s roommate told the Post .
So Garcia struck Cruz in the head twice with the footrest of his wheelchair , knocking him to the ground and giving him a “ miniature gash ” on the forehead .
Police arrived and Cruz urged them to look at surveillance video of the altercation because he reportedly wanted to press charges , but the officers left without taking action .
Witnesses said police assumed Cruz was drunk and said he might have fallen out of his wheelchair , though the NYPD insisted that neither wanted to press charges nor needed medical attention .
After the officers exited the facility — where Cruz had lived for a year and a half and Garcia for month — the older man went up to his room , retrieved a homemade folding knife , and used his faster motorized wheelchair to catch up to Garcia , who relied on a slower manual wheelchair .
Cruz then and stabbed Garcia more than a dozen times until a security guard wrestled away the knife at around 4:20 am , according to witnesses , who said they watched the crime unfold on a surveillance video monitor .
Garcia was pronounced dead at Beth Israel Medical Center , while Cruz was charged with murder and possession of a weapon .
Residents of the building said that Garcia had " a really foul mouth " and would often get into disputes with older residents , while the suspect — who was identified as being 52 - years - old in the Post — " had been drinking and had a bad reputation for being a hothead when he consumed alcohol , " according to the tabloid .
Both men relied on wheelchairs after being injured by gunfire .
According to the Times , Garcia moved out of his family 's home on University Avenue in the Bronx to " protect his family " after being shot multiple times in May .
He reportedly called his sister between his first altercation with Cruz and the deadly stabbing : “ He told me he had a fight , ” she said .
“ He said , ‘ The police is coming .
Come pick me up . ’ ”
Measures of the quality of life in various states are closely tied to the individual levels of happiness of the people who live in those states , according to a ponderous publication on the science of happiness appearing today in the journal Science .
The careful , mathematical analysis by British researchers showed that Louisiana was the happiest state , followed by Hawaii and Florida .
California ranked a distant 46th .
Ouch .
New York is the most miserable , er , uh , least - happy state .
The researchers , led by professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick , examined data from a random sample of 1.3 million U.S. citizens on life satisfaction .
They compared those findings to a 2003 study that considered objective indicators for each individual state , such as weather , coastal land , public land , parks , hazardous waste sites , commute time , crime , air quality , teacher - student ratios , local taxes , cost of living and other factors .
When comparing the two tables , they found a very close match between how happy people say they are and the estimated quality - of - life in their state .
" The beauty of our statistical method is that we are able to look below the surface of American life -- to identify the deep patterns in people 's underlying happiness from Alabama to Wyoming , " Oswald said in a news release .
Of Louisiana 's top ranking , he noted that some of the data collection preceded Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
But Oswald stills believes the state is happy because of , well , low expectations .
" Bargains in life are usually found outside the spotlight , " he noted .
But we wanted to know , what about California ?
Is life really so bad here ?
Yes , Oswald replied in an e-mail .
" California does poorly because of its congestion , high property prices , and in parts , its air quality .
It does well on sunshine hours , of course , but not well enough to outweigh other things like the long commutes .
It may also be that Californians spend a lot of time comparing themselves with the rich citizens around them -- usually a recipe for human unhappiness . "
Happy holidays !

Washington ( CNN ) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates will unveil the Pentagon 's plan to prepare for repealing the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " law regarding gay soldiers at a committee hearing Tuesday , a Pentagon spokesman said .
" The Defense Department leadership is actively working on an implementation plan and the secretary will have more to say about this next week , " Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said on Thursday .
President Obama said in his first State of the Union address Wednesday night that he would work with Congress and the Pentagon this year to repeal the law that prohibits military members from acknowledging openly that they are gay .
According to the Senate Web site , the Senate Armed Services Committee has scheduled an hour to discuss the issue at Tuesday 's hearing on the fiscal year 2011 defense budget , which Gates will attend .
The committee revised its schedule for the hearing , announcing that Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm .
Mike Mullen will testify on the budget , as planned , as well as the " do n't ask , do n't tell " issue .
Gates and Mullen are not expected to offer a specific legislative proposal to repeal the law , but rather to detail some of the preliminary steps that need to be taken inside the military in advance of formulating a legislative plan .
Gates will discuss options for more " humanely " implementing the current ban , for example , according to a senior Pentagon official .
The secretary asked his general counsel 's office for options six months ago including how to possibly not expel personnel whose homosexuality is revealed by third parties , the source said .
The 1993 law bars gay men and lesbians in the military from revealing their sexual orientation , and prevents the military from asking about it .
Another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered include the cost of implementing a new policy , benefits for gay spouses , potential hate crimes , and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops .
According to the official , the idea of separate housing or showers was not considered a serious possibility , but would be discussed in order to rule it out .
Previously , Gates has said the transition from the existing law should be done gradually and " very , very carefully . "
" The president has been clear about where he wants to go and what he thinks needs to be done , " Gates said in April at the Army War College when asked about changing the law .
" But I think that he is approaching this in a deliberate and cautious manner , so that if we do go down that road , we do it right and we do it in a way that mitigates any downsides , problems that might be associated with it . "
At least one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Gen. James Conway , commandant of the Marine Corps -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law .
In November , Conway said through a spokesman : " Our Marines are currently engaged in two fights , and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities . "
Some Congressional opposition already is clear .
Sen . John McCain , R - Arizona , a former Navy pilot , released a statement after Wednesday night 's State of the Union address saying " it would be a mistake " to repeal the law .
" This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years , and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels , " McCain 's statement said , later adding : " At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield , now is not the time to abandon the policy . "
Others support the change .
Gen. John Shalikashvili , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said it was time to repeal the law .
" As a nation built on the principal of equality , we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military , " Shalikashvili said in a letter sent to Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand , D - New York , who supports repealing the policy .
The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , an organization that works with those affected by the " do n't ask , do n't tell " law , praised Obama 's call for repeal .
" We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010 , " the group said , later adding : " The American public , including conservatives , is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one . "
Some time ago I borrowed the book , The Sociopath Next Door by Martha Stout , Ph.D. , from a friend of mine , also a psychologist , who recommended it for its unique take on .
It is a warning to unsuspecting readers that some of the world 's most destructive individuals are not behind bars , but are our neighbors , parents , spouses , teachers , children , co-workers and friends .
The author suggests that approximately 4 percent of the population suffers from Disorder , which she refers to as the " condition of missing " and alternatively as " Sociopathy " .
Although some researchers will disagree with her interchangeable use of the two terms , such an argument , albeit worthwhile , does not detract from the message delivered in The Sociopath Next Door .
Dr. Stout begins by asking the reader to imagine a world where they have no conscience thereby freeing them from , among other downers , , , remorse and concern for others .
She then asks the reader to imagine , if they were able to conceal this psychological flaw from others , how they might live .
They would , after all , be free to seek all the power , money and influence they desired , in the quickest , crudest and most ruthless way without the nagging burden of doing what is right .
Or , maybe , Dr. Stout says , you are not ambitious , but seek only to relax and live as carefree as possible from the goodwill of others .
Without conscience , you would be free from the guilt and shame that traditionally comes from being a freeloader .
The world Dr. Stout is asking the reader to imagine is the world of a Sociopath .
This is not Hollywood 's version of a Sociopath , the social recluse with the transparently frightening demeanor , but a real snake in the grass .
It is your beautiful and tormented best friend , your overworked and out spouse or your down on her luck mother .
Dr. Stout upends the reader 's notion of a Sociopath ; warning that the real tell tale sign is not but pity .
She states , " The most reliable sign , the most universal behavior of unscrupulous people is not directed , as one might imagine , at our fearfulness .
It is , perversely , an appeal to our sympathy . "
The pity play or attempt to appeal to the sympathy of others was also addressed in research conducted by the Minnesota Department of Corrections and The Hazelden Foundation ( 2002 ) .
There , researchers concluded that criminal thinkers most often attempt to control others by portraying themselves as a victim , turning to fear tactics only when the victim stance fails to get them what they want .
The act of eliciting pity from another unequivocally makes the elicitor something to be pitied , a victim , per se .
It is human nature to aid the pitied .
Hence , the pity play , or victim stance , stands to get the Sociopath what he or she wants easily and without being found out as a bad guy .
This is manipulation .
Manipulation is the tool of choice for smart criminal thinkers and , according to Dr. Stout , the Sociopaths amongst us .
She says , " Sociopaths have no regard whatsoever for the social contract , but they do know how to use it to their advantage .
And all in all , I am sure that if the devil existed , he would want us to feel very sorry for him . "
Even experienced political observers are slightly incredulous at what has happened over the past week in Massachusetts : a Republican state senator most well known for posing nude in Cosmo 28 years ago and for his daughter ’s appearance on “ American Idol ” is within striking distance of taking Ted Kennedy ’s Senate seat – and possibly health - care reform – from the Democrats .
And Scott Brown has momentum .
“ As a resident and voter and student of politics , it feels extremely , extremely close , ” said John Della Volpe , an independent pollster and new media strategist in Boston with many years of involvement in Massachusetts politics .
“ We ’ve seen something viral in the old way of viral , people talking to one another .
That ’s what people are talking about : can you believe Scott Brown is this close ?
That ’s what everybody is talking about , ” Della Volpe said .
The question is : How did a Republican get this close to the Senate seat occupied for 47 years by Democratic political royalty ?
Washington shorthanders regarded it as evidence that the anger at government spending and the Obama health - care plan — on display in town hall meetings across the country last summer — was rearing its head even in one of the country ’s most liberal states .
“ The very fact that this race is even close is a sign of how unhappy Americans are with Democratic rule in Washington , ” Newt Gingrich wrote on his website .
Massachusetts politicos said that while anti-Washington sentiment is an element of what is happening in their state , they also blame state political dynamics in combination with presumption by the Democrats and the party ’s candidate – Attorney General Martha Coakley – that the seat would be theirs without much of an effort .
The Kennedy - anointed Coakley took nearly a week off from the campaign around Christmas .
“ A lot of Democrats in Massachusetts and certainly the Coakley campaign and myself thought this was going to be a lot easier than it ’s turning out to be , ” said David Kravitz , a Boston lawyer and opera singer who runs a liberal political blog called bluemassgroup.com .
Paul Cellucci* , the state ’s Republican governor from 1999 to 2001 , said , “ Democrats thought this was a safe seat , they were coasting and they did not measure the discontent among the voters . ”
Celucci said the issues driving voter anger are as much about state politics as they are national .
“ We ’re having fiscal problems .
The rainy day fund has been depleted .
The governor raised the sales tax .
Balancing the budget continues to be a significant issue and problem .
It just appears that they ca n’t get things done , ” Celucci said .
In addition , former House speaker Salvatore DiMasi in October became the third Democratic speaker in a row to be indicted , on charges of extorting profits from a property management company owned by friends .
He faces 185 years in jail .
Brown , who in Monday night ’s lone debate of the campaign proclaimed he would , if elected , cast the vote to stop the Democrats ’ health - care bill , has been campaigning on a platform of fiscal responsibility .
“ Scott came in and made people see he is going to be the jobs senator and focus on improving the economy and bringing jobs back to Massachusetts , ” the state GOP chairman , Jennifer Nassour , said .
Della Volpe , who no longer works with either political party but has in the past worked with Massachusetts Democrats , said that “ people are beginning to want something new . ”
“ They respect [ Brown ] in this pickup truck driving around .
Everybody identifies him as this upstart candidate in a pickup truck who ’s taking it to the establishment . ”
David King , a professor of public policy at Harvard ’s Kennedy School , said that the national health - care issue was a minor factor in the election .
“ Health care is not the issue up here .
It ’s fiscal responsibility and state - oriented issues .
It ’s almost been lost on people that this is an election with national consequences , ” he said .
Since the weekend , Brown has appeared to be the candidate with momentum , while Coakley has committed a number of missteps .
She said in the debate that al - Qaida terrorists are “ gone ” from Afghanistan and only remain in Yemen and Pakistan , she came to Washington on Tuesday to raise money at a fundraiser hosted by lobbyists for large health insurance and drug companies , and on her way out of the event one of her political operatives pushed a reporter to the ground .
Meanwhile , Brown on Monday raised $ 1.3 million , and scored the soundbyte of Monday ’s debate by rebuking moderator David Gergen for referring to “ Teddy Kennedy ’s seat . ”
“ With all due respect it ’s not the Kennedy seat and it ’s not the Democrats ’ seat .
It ’s the people ’s seat , ” Brown said .
The latest poll , released Tuesday evening by Rasmussen Reports , showed Coakley up by two points , 49 percent to 47 percent , after leading by nine points a week before .
All the major organs of the Democratic political machine lunged into motion on Tuesday .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee bought $ 600,000 in TV ads .
The Democratic National Committee bought $ 567,000 of air time .
The Service Employees International Union put out their own ad .
“ When voters learn about Scott Brown ’s true positions and the fact that he will be a lockstep vote with the extreme right - wing of his party , they will understand that Martha Coakley is the candidate who will stand up and fight for them , ” said Coakley spokesman Corey Welford , in an e-mail .
Former President Bill Clinton and Sen. John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat , are headlining a rally for Coakley on Friday in Boston .
The White House maintained Wednesday evening that President Obama had no plans to campaign for Coakley , though press secretary Robert Gibbs said there was “ a lot at stake . ”
Brown got support of his own from the outside , as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce began running ads on Tuesday and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled to campaign with him this week .

Police in Nigeria have arrested a doctor suspected of impregnating girls and selling their babies .
The police said they found five pregnant girls aged between 12 and 17 at the doctor 's clinic in the south - eastern town of Enugu .
The police said the man had confessed to getting the girls pregnant and selling their children .
He is to face charges in court .
Trafficking is common in Nigeria , with children sold for labour and sex work .
In 2008 , police raided a private hospital in Enugu which they said was a " baby farm " .
Seven pregnant young women were found .
Coverage testing is a great way to find out what parts of your code are not tested by your test suite .
You turn on coverage .py , then run your tests .
At the end , coverage can show you which lines were never executed , either by line number or visually in an annotated source file .
When your test coverage is less than 100 % , coverage testing works well : it points you to the lines in your code that are never run , showing the way to new tests to write .
The ultimate goal , of course , is to get your test coverage to 100 % .
But then you have problems , because 100 % test coverage does n’t really mean much .
There are dozens of ways your code or your tests could still broken , but now you are n’t getting any directions .
The measurement coverage .
py provides is more accurately called statement coverage , because it tells you which statements were executed .
Statement coverage testing has taken you to the end of its road , and the bad news is , you are n’t at your destination , but you ’ve run out of road .
By way of illustration , here are a few examples of 100 % statement coverage of buggy code .
Combinations of paths
With multiple branches in a function , there may be combinations that are n’t tested , even though each individual line is covered by a test :
def two_branches ( a , b ) :
if a :
d = 0
else :
d = 2
if b :
x = 2 / d
else :
x = d / 2
return x
# These tests give 100 % coverage :
two_branches ( False , False ) == 1
two_branches ( True , False ) == 0
two_branches ( False , True ) == 1
# This test fails with a ZeroDivisionError :
two_branches ( True , True )
Loops can have similar issues :
def loop_paths ( a ) :
while a :
x = 1
a -= 1
return x
# This test gives 100 % coverage :
loop_paths ( 1 ) == 1
# This test fails with a NameError :
loop_paths ( 0 )
Data - driven code
You can often simplify a function by putting complexity into data tables , but there ’s no way to measure which parts of a data structure were used :
divisors = {
' x ' : 1 ,
'y ' : 0 ,
}
def data_driven ( thing ) :
return 2 / divisors .
get ( thing )
# This test gives 100 % coverage :
data_driven ( ' x ' ) == 2
# This test fails with a ZeroDivisionError :
data_driven ( 'y ' )
Hidden conditionals
Real code often contains implied conditionals that do n’t live on a separate line to be measured :
def implied_conditional ( a ) :
if ( a % 2 == 0 ) or ( a % 0 == 0 ) :
print " Special case "
return a + 2
# 100 % coverage :
implied_conditional ( 0 ) == 2
implied_conditional ( 2 ) == 4
Although we have 100 % coverage , we never found out that due to a typo , the second condition on line 3 will divide by zero .
Conditionals can also be hidden inside functions that are n’t being measured in the first place .
def fix_url ( u ) :
# If we 're an https url , make it http .
return u .
replace ( ' https://' , ' xyzzyWRONG :' )
# 100 % coverage :
fix_url ( ' http://foo.com' ) == ' http://foo.com'
The replace method here is essentially a big if statement on the condition that the string contains the substring being replaced .
Our test never takes that path , but the if is hidden from us , so our coverage testing does n’t help us find the missed coverage .
Incomplete tests
Just because your tests execute the code does n’t mean they properly test the results .
def my_awesome_sort ( l ) :
# Magic mumbo- jumbo that will sort the list ( NOT ! )
l . reverse ()
return l
# 100 % code coverage !
l = [ 4 , 2 , 5 , 3 , 1 ]
type ( my_awesome_sort ( l ) ) == list
len ( my_awesome_sort ( l ) ) == 5
my_awesome_sort ( l ) [ 0 ] == 1
Here our “ sort ” routine passes all the tests , and the coverage is 100 % .
But , oops , we forgot to check that the list returned is really sorted .
Real world
Of course , these examples are absurd .
It ’s easy to see where we went wrong in each of them .
Most likely , though , your tests have the same underlying problems , but in ways that are much more difficult to find .
Improved tools could help some of these cases , but not all .
Some C - based tools provide branch analysis that could help with the path problems above .
But no tool can guarantee there are n’t path problems ( what if a loop works incorrectly if executed a prime number of times ? ) , and no tool will point out that your tests are n’t checking the important things about results .
For more on the problems of coverage testing , the wikipedia article on Code Coverage has a number of fine jumping - off points .
Cem Kaner has a depressingly exhaustive overview of the Measurement of the Extent of Testing .
After perusing it , you may wonder why you bother with puny statement coverage testing at all !
Statement coverage testing is a good measure of what is n’t being tested in your code .
It ’s a good start for understanding the completeness of your tests .
Brian Merick ’s How to Misuse Code Coverage sums it up best : “ Coverage tools are only helpful if they ’re used to enhance thought , not replace it . ”

Here 's breaking news that 's a double barrel blast .
A November 2009 Henry Ford hospital report claims dangerous Methicillin - Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) bacteria are approaching epidemic status , and so are other antibiotic resistant microbes .
And now :
As of January 1 , 2009 , the EU ( European Union ) has effectively banned a well known natural antibiotic , colloidal silver .
These two events could seriously affect global health if the antibiotic resistant strains continue and if the American continent mimics the EU 's colloidal silver ban .
There are numerous ways that bacteria become antibiotic resistant .
When several are being killed off by a particular antibiotic , others are genetically working out survival strategies .
It 's a war , and the survivors find ways to defend , hide , and even neutralize that antibiotic .
They can also find other genes to adopt and enhance their survival .
MRSAs were first announced as hospital infections that left you worse off than when you entered .
According to Professor Keith Scott - Mumby , MD , PhD , author of , a lot of this was due to sloppy and lazy hospital hygiene , especially among surgeons and anesthesiologists .
The reliance of antibiotics for infections replaced the importance of proper precautionary hygiene .
Community MRSAs , which originate outside of hospitals , are on the rise .
Dr. Scott - Mumby mentions a new strain that is respiratory contagious and more virulent than the skin contagious MRSAs .
If they work their way into vital organs , those staph infections can be lethal .
This is the result of over prescribing antibiotics and using an enormous amount of antibiotics on livestock in the food chain .
Not only do livestock antibiotics get passed on to health unconscious consumers , but the livestock breed antibiotic resistant bacterial mutations that enter the food chain .
Antibiotics are even appearing in some water supplies .
As more antibiotics get consumed , more antibiotic resistant bacteria will appear .
Pharmaceutical antibiotics have side effects , including the death of much of one 's necessary gastrointestinal ( GI ) friendly bacteria .
According to many health experts , a correctly synthesized colloidal silver liquid is a potent antibiotic for pathogenic bacteria only .
The good guys remain intact !
As the EU goes with its supplement bans , so eventually will the Americas go .
This is what Big Pharma wants .
They know good colloidal silver works , and they do n't want the competition .
Not all colloidal silver products are equally efficacious , but they are all expensive !
So why not make your own colloidal silver for a lifetime supply on demand with quality control no matter what happens ?
There are battery or wall current generators with silver electrodes available from under $ 100 to slightly over $ 200 .
But when you consider paying $ 20 or more for a small bottle over and over ( if these MRSAs and other bacterial pathogens become epidemic because they can no longer be restrained by antibiotics ) , it 's quite cost effective .
Besides , you can use it for any infection , epidemic or not .
These kits produce colloidal silver by running a small current through electrodes in distilled water .
Nano - particles and ions electrically discharged from the silver electrodes go into the solution .
The lower the current , the smaller the particles are .
Smaller is better with colloidal silver .
Larger particles wo n't penetrate tissues and cells where the bad bugs are causing damage .
Considering the possibilities of a bacterial epidemic in a world without antibiotics , it seems worthwhile to look into having a perpetual silver colloidal manufacturing apparatus that creates a comprehensive antibiotic while not destroying your beneficial bacteria Colloidal Silver generation Professor Keith Scott - Mumby MD , PhD lecture on antibiotic resistant bacteria 's riseMore on colloidal silver generationHow Stuff Works " how bacteria become resistant " MRSA ( staph infections ) informationDr. Rebecca CarleyPaul

Kuradal 's Dungeon Improvements
After some of your feedback about last week ’s Slayer dungeon update :
Juanita Castro , sister of Cuban leaders Fidel and Raúl Castro , co-operated with the CIA in the 1960s when the US agency was plotting to assassinate Fidel and overthrow his revolution , according to her book , published today .
Juanita , who broke with her brothers ' revolution in 1964 , hid government opponents in her home .
She incurred the wrath of Fidel , who refused to visit her house , saying it was " surrounded by worms " .
Her mother also intervened with Raúl to help jailed or fugitive opponents of the Castro regime , the Miami Herald reports .
Juanita 's revelation of her link with the CIA came as a short teaser at the end of an interview with the Miami television channel Univisión - Noticias 23 , broadcast yesterday .
" The CIA wanted to talk with me ... because they had interesting things to tell me and interesting things to ask of me , " she said .
" I was left half - shocked , but in any case I told them yes . ''
In her book , Fidel and Raúl , My Brothers : The Secret History , Juanita admits to collaborating with the CIA both inside Cuba and after she went into exile in 1964 .
Throughout the early 1960s , the CIA was involved in dozens of plots to assassinate Fidel Castro – the man himself claimed there were more than 600 – and overthrow his government .
Juanita , the fifth child of Angel Castro and Lina Cruz , has publicly and repeatedly criticised her brothers ' government since she left Cuba in 1964 .
Calling a press conference 10 days after her defection , she explained why she could no longer stay in Cuba .
" I can not longer remain indifferent to what is happening in my country , " she said .
" My brothers Fidel and Raúl have made it an enormous prison surrounded by water .
The people are nailed to a cross of torment imposed by international communism . "
In yesterday 's broadcast , Juanita , now 76 , said that hers was " just one more Cuban family ' ' until Fidel and Raúl led the 1953 attack on the Moncada army barracks , now recognised as the beginning of the revolution .
After the dictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown in early 1959 , she worked on building health clinics and hospitals in the country , but her faith in the regime failed as the brothers started cracking down on opponents and confiscating private properties .
" I begin to lose the enthusiasm when I see so much injustice and I say , this is not possible , they are wrong .
Someone here is doing things badly , '' she said on the programme .
" We tended to blame the people lower down , but the orders did not really come from the people lower down .
They came from the upper levels , from Fidel , from Che , from Raúl . "
Juanita added that her mother , Lina Ruz , also often helped government critics .
" My mother got help from whoever could help , especially Raúl because he was always very generous with her … she appealed to Fidel in some cases , " she said .
When Ruz died in August 1963 , Juanita began to feel her life was in danger , she said .
" When she died , I had a very delicate situation in Cuba because of my activities against the regime .
Of course , with my mother , I always felt more protected ...
I thought it would be harder for them to take drastic measures against me . ''
Juanita last spoke to Raúl in person on 18 June 1964 , the day before she left for Mexico , she told the report .
Her 432 - page book was co-written by Maria Antonieta Collins , a journalist who first began interviewing her for a book on her life in 1999 .
Univisión - Noticias 23 negotiated the world exclusive on Juanita 's tale with the publisher Santillana .
She was forbidden from giving other interviews until the book was published .
A bomb derailed an elite passenger train speeding through the forest from Moscow to Saint Petersburg , killing up to 39 people and injuring nearly 100 , Russian officials said Saturday .
“ We are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , ” Vladimir Markin , spokesman for the federal investigative committee , was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency .
The committee said it had found bomb fragments at the scene .

The incident occurred late Friday in an area where the same train , the prestigious Nevsky Express , was derailed after a bomb under the track ripped out a portion of the rail in August 2007 , injuring around 60 people .
Witnesses including passengers on the train and inhabitants living near the site said they heard a loud boom just before the train went off the rails , and police told AFP at the site there was a large crater under the track .
The investigative committee said in a statement that its experts had found “ elements of an explosive device ” at the scene of the disaster , a wooded expanse 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) northwest of Moscow near the village of Uglovka .
There was no immediate confirmed claim of responsibility for the attack .

Echo of Moscow radio reported that a hardline nationalist group calling itself Combat 18 had claimed the blast , but its source for that report was a blog entry from an anti-immigrant activist that could not be verified .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered several law enforcement agencies to investigate the train attack thoroughly and to assist people affected by it .
“ Make sure there is no chaos , because the situation is already tense , ” Medvedev said in a video conference with Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev shown on state television .

In a meeting later with a government commission created to manage the crisis , also shown on state television , Medvedev expressed condolences for families of the victims and stood for a moment of silence .
There were conflicting reports on the death toll , but Alexander Basulin , an official at the emergency situations ministry , was quoted by the ITAR - TASS news agency as saying “ in all , there are 39 ” dead .
ADVERTISEMENT
Basulin said this number comprised 25 victims found immediately and another 14 people discovered later , outside the train carriages .
Interfax , quoting an unnamed official , also put the death toll at 39 .
In a statement , however , the emergency situations ministry said only 26 fatalities had been confirmed while 18 passengers were still unaccounted for .
It added 96 people were injured .

The disaster struck the Nevsky Express , which is the fastest train between Moscow and Saint Petersburg and is popular among foreign tourists and Russians who commute between the two cities .
Andrei Abramenko , a police officer who happened to be travelling on the train , described a picture of human suffering .
“ Two wagons were completely overturned … .
Several people were completely crushed under the metal .
I heard screams , moaning , ” Abramenko said on the Vesti - 24 state television news channel .
Four wagons of the 14 - carriage train , carrying around 660 passengers and nearly two dozen staff , derailed at 9:34 pm ( 1834 GMT ) , according to the emergencies ministry .

At least three foreigners were on the train , ITAR - TASS reported , citing a source at Russian Railways .
Other reports said that one Italian and two Finns were among the passengers .
In Washington , the White House said it was “ deeply saddened by the terrible loss of life and injuries ” from the incident .
In Paris , French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his “ profound sadness ” over the derailment .

( CNN ) -- Mexico City , one of Latin America 's largest metropolises , on Monday legalized same - sex marriage and adoption by same - sex couples .
By a vote of 39 to 20 , the city 's legislative assembly approved revisions to the civil code to permit same - sex marriages .
Five legislators abstained .
In a separate motion , the assembly voted 31 to 24 in favor of legalizing adoption by same - sex couples , with nine abstentions .
The revision will change the definition of marriage to a union between two people , instead of the current version , which specifies a union between a man and a woman .
Civil groups in favor and opposed to the vote had gathered since early in the morning outside the legislative building .
In 2007 , the legislators approved same - sex civil unions .
Mexico City is the second major Latin American city to legalize same - sex marriage .
In November , a Buenos Aires , Argentina , court ruled that two articles in the city 's civil code that say only a man and woman can be married are illegal , paving the way for gay marriages .
The mayor of Buenos Aires , Mauricio Macri , announced that his administration would not appeal the decision , clearing the way for the gay couple who took the issue to court .
The first same - sex marriages to be held under the new law , however , was delayed after another court filed a contradictory order .
CNN en Español 's Rey Rodriguez contributed to this report .
Host Ventrilo Server
Ventrilo server is used in the gaming world , and it is also known as a vent which is used for communication .
Ventrilo is a VoIP program solution through which users communicate or chat with each other over the internet .
Apart from the video , you can also do voice communication in this game through various devices such as a microphone , headset , speakers , etc. just like conference calling .
This is very easy to install software and can run on any platform .
The sound quality depends on microphone or speaker quality and on internet connection .
The question asked how to host Ventrilo server ; the answer is you need to do server settings for hosting it which many companies give permission for such facility .
Companies provide such facility in free or at rent to users .
Things should consider before Hosting Ventrilo Server
Before server host , you have to check some things such as scalability , reliability , stability , reasonable pricing , setup settings , customer support and so on .
You also need to check control panels settings so that user will be able to manage every aspect of Ventrilo server .
Due to its voice communication , it contains different voice modes thus , you need to see that .
Suppose a user want to talk to his friend privately about the game play while playing thus he can talk without sound disturbance over the network means it should be flexible and have full access control over settings .
The control panels allow full control of server means you can make changes in settings like editing of file , file uploading , starting and stopping control and tracking of the server .
Bandwidth increment , expanding of RAM space , hard disk space , processor speed increment can also be done with the help of control panel settings .
Thus , these are some of the things you can consider before hosting server for increasing the performance of the server .
It also provided with switching location in which user can switch or change location anytime .
Ventrilo Server Features
It has cross - channel communication , sub - channels , mute channels , queue channels , text to voice speech conversion software feature , private conversation feature , the creation of dynamic channels from individual channels feature , provide security to information by providing coded password settings to the user and so on .
These are some of the features which makes Ventrilo server hosting popular and successful and assure users that their data are preserved and safe from intruders .
It permits only those users who have access permission otherwise not permissible .
You can also filter site contents for more clarity in the text as well as voice .
It is available with hot keys through which users can execute special program functions , can play wave file and send text and voice messages .
With specific codes , you can control voice quality and bandwidth usage over the internet which increases server performance .
Generally online data is not safe but on this server , you have the power to save , secure and protect it .
With these features , you can enjoy game graphics , 3D effects to the fullest and invite friends for more competitiveness .
At heart , the House and Senate versions of healthcare reform legislation are very much the same .
Both require virtually all Americans to have health insurance , while offering low - and middle - income people subsidies to make that mandate more affordable .
Both would establish new marketplaces , called " exchanges , " where individuals who do n't get insurance from employers could buy coverage .
Both would cost about $ 1 trillion over 10 years and pay for themselves via cuts in projected Medicare spending and tax and fee increases .
Both would ban insurance firms from denying anyone coverage due to pre-existing health conditions .
But though their frameworks are the same , the two bills are very different in some of the details .
So different , in fact , that harmonizing the bills could be a daunting task for a conference committee of House and Senate negotiators .
Here are three of the biggest obstacles to melding the bills together :
Financing .
The largest source of new revenue in the House version of healthcare reform legislation is a tax on wealthy Americans .
It consists of a 5.4 percent surcharge on families with annual incomes over $ 1 million and on individuals with incomes over $ 500,000 .
It 's estimated to bring in $ 461 billion over the next decade .
In contrast , the largest source of new revenue in the Senate version of the bill is an excise tax on high - cost health insurance plans .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would raise $ 149 billion over 10 years .
The Senate raises another $ 238 billion over the decade via a mix of fees on insurers and some health device manufacturers , and other provisions .
Public option .
The House version has a public option – a government - run insurance plan that would negotiate payment rates with doctors and hospitals .
( Liberals would have preferred that it use the Medicare rates set by the government , which would probably have been lower . )
The House bill allocates $ 2 billion for public option start - up money .
But premiums from beneficiaries would have to pay for the full cost of the plan after it got up and running .
The Senate bill ... well , that was kind of a struggle , was n't it ?
The Senate bill has no public option , following objections from Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I ) of Connecticut and moderate Democrats about government intervention in the marketplace .
Instead , under the Senate bill , the federal Office of Personnel Management would oversee two national health plans from private firms offered through the exchanges to individuals , families , and small businesses .
At least one of those plans would have to be operated on a nonprofit basis .
Abortion .
Under the House bill , health plans , in general , could choose whether to cover abortion or not .
But federal money could n't be used for abortions , except in cases of rape or incest , or if the life of the pregnant woman was in danger .
The public option plan would not provide abortion coverage , for instance , in the House version of the bill .
Nor could individuals who received federal subsidies to buy insurance choose a plan that covers elective abortions .
Abortion language in the Senate bill is different in important details .
As in the House version , the Senate language allows health plans , in general , to choose whether to cover abortion or not .
But states could block plans that cover abortion from being offered through the new insurance exchanges .
The Senate would allow people who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance to enroll in plans that cover abortion .
But they would have to make two separate monthly payments : one for abortion coverage , and one for all other health coverage .

It ’s time you got MIT ’s version of the sixth sense .
The creation of Pranav Mistry , the SixthSense system combines a pocket sized projector , a mirror , cell phone , and a camera to create an augmented reality experience you can carry around on your person .
We explored some of the amazing capabilities of SixthSense back in February and things have only gotten better since then .
At the recent TEDIndia conference , Mistry announced that he would be making SixthSense available through an open source license .
That ’s right , you ’ll be able to build your own device and upload the software for free .
How cool is this thing ?
Just check out the standing ovation that Mistry and his MIT advisor Patty Maes received at an earlier TED conference in the video after the break .
Patched together from off the shelf components , Mistry has stated that the SixthSense system will likely cost less than $ 350 .
To facilitate the proposed open source licensing of the device , Mistry will provide instructions in how to assemble the hardware as well as provide the free software to run the components in tandem .
That ’s great news to everyone interested in the device , and better news to everyone who believes in the open source and open hardware movements .
As more developers demonstrate that open licenses promote product improvement and create a more competitive device , we could see more innovators willing to try it .
So thanks to Mistry for creating an awesome piece of technology and even bigger thanks for having the foresight to let that technology be accessible to everyone .

Motorola announced today that it would be launching a brand new device that would allow users to have push - to - talk capabilities in a wearable badge form .
Called the Team Badge , the device is a voice - over - wireless local area networking ( VoWLAN ) technology that eliminates the need for companies to rely on cellular services for communication within a defined region , said Frank Riso , Motorola senior director for retail solutions .
Now if we could just get it in a smaller package , let 's say , in a delta shield shape , we 'd buy two .
Check out more from the article at CTOEdge below .
Although Motorola is positioning the EWB100 Team Badge as a device that can be used primarily for retail applications , a badge that allows users to communicate with each other while keeping their hands free has a broad range of applications , such as warehouses and emergency response systems .
Motorola is also rolling out a credit - card size CLP two - way radio that comes in a configuration that supports Push - to - Talk technology over a Bluetooth connection .
Like the EWB100 , the CLP two - way radio is designed to be a wearable device .
Both a single - and four - channel version of the CLP are expected to be available in the first quarter , while a Bluetooth - compatible model will be available in the second quarter .

12 : RiteSmoke E-Cigarettes Overview
RiteSmoke E-Cigarettes are one of the best selling and first electric cigarettes , but sadly for its fans , it is currently out of stock .
The RiteSmoke system was good , but its age was apparent , the device was a little too big and the charger was incredibly clunky .
It holds a charge for a good long time , but not long enough to rationalize the size and the unportability of the charger .
The age also showed through on the flavor , it was slightly chemical tasting -- somewhat bitter .
A good option for smokers , but others have luckily filled its spot .

There 's a lot of information to digest in today 's Central Scouting Mid-term Rankings .
I had considered putting together my own sort of mid-term rankings on some of the players I 'm familiar with , but it 's always easier to just critique someone else 's work .
So I 'll take a closer look at the CSB rankings and give my opinion on whether the CSB has some players ranked too high , too low , or just about in the right spot .
This is going to be fairly long , so I 'll put it after the jump .
( All rankings are for North American skaters )
5. Riley Sheahan - Notre Dame - Maybe the biggest surprise of the group to most people -- if only because people really only look at the top 5 - 10 players listed .
I 'm fine with this ranking though .
Notre Dame has sucked this year , but you always hear great thing about how Sheahan plays in all areas of the ice .
He may slide a couple spots by the end of the year , but I could see him going in the top 10 .
11 . Derek Forbort - NTDP ( North Dakota ) - I think this is about the right place for him .
I never understood the people who put him lower in their rankings .
He 's going to be a special player .
12 . Nick Bjugstad - Blaine HS ( Minnesota ) - 12th seems a little high to me , but not too much .
I think Bjugstad will probably end up more towards the end of the first round than the middle of the first round , but a first round pick regardless .
17 . Brock Nelson- Warroad( North Dakota ) - I think Nelson is way too high here .
He 's a very talented kid , but I think he 's too much of a project to spend a first round pick on in a year that is so deep with so many good players .
I see Nelson has more of a late - second or third round pick .
20 . Jon Merrill - NTDP ( Michigan ) - With Merrill taking some steps forward offensively this year , I thought he'd be a little higher .
I see him as more of a mid-first round pick .
21 . Tyler Pitlick - Minnesota State - In my annual draft along with the pros , I was determined not to let Pitlick slip past the middle of the second round , and imagine that drawing screams of bias , but , uh , I guess not .
Pitlick is a pretty safe pick , though I do n't know that he has as much potential to be a big scorer as some other prospects .
End of the first round might be a tad generous , but not much .
36 . Max Gardiner - Minnetonka( Minnesota ) - I 've always had Gardiner lower than most people , though he was starting to win me over with his play during the high school season , before he broke his wrist right after Christmas .
I still have him lower than 36th , and the injury will probably push him a little lower .
37 . Mark Alt - Cretin- Derham Hall ( Minnesota ) - Talent - wise , maybe he belongs here , but I can't see a team picking him unless he ends up 100 % committing to hockey .
There 's too many other good players out there to take on the extra risk .
39 . Joe Basaraba - Shattuck ( Minnesota - Duluth ) - This looks about right .
I do n't think Basaraba will ever develop into a big scorer , but he 's a fairly safe pick because of his physical play .
40 . Justin Faulk - NTDP ( Minnesota - Duluth ) - Faulk is bound to be an interesting player to watch in this draft .
Will teams believe that he can keep scoring at the pace he has been with the NTDP ?
For now , I 'll say he 's ranked in the right spot .
50 . Jacob Fallon -( Michigan ) - This is too high for Fallon , even before you consider the discipline issues that got him kicked out of the NTDP program .
I would n't be surprised to see Fallon get passed over altogether in the draft .
54 . Justin Holl - Minnetonka( Minnesota ) - Justin
Holl kind of reminds me of David Fischer in his draft year .
Tons of potential that has n't quite been put together yet -- and still has n't in Fischer 's case .
The difference was that Fischer was the top player in Minnesota in a weak year in his draft year , and there are a couple players better than Holl this year .
If Holl was in Fischer 's position , he might be talked about as a potential first round pick .
I have n't been blown away by Holl this year , but his potential would make me think about picking him in the late - third round where he 's ranked right now .
55 . Jason Zucker - NTDP ( Denver ) - Everyone is going to say he 's too low after seeing him play in the World Juniors , and I agree , to some extent .
Zucker is a fantastic all - around player , but I do n't know that he has the high - end offensive potential to be ranked much higher than maybe the second round .
73 . Jason Clark - Shattuck ( Uncommitted ) - I thought he was way over - rated for much of the fall , and this drop down to 73 seems to confirm my opinion .
I 'd probably put him even lower than this .
97 . Casey Thrush - Team Maryland ( New Hampshire ) - Kind of a surprise seeing a AAA player from Maryland this high , and I think maybe a little too high , but I can see Thrush as a potential draft pick .
A big speedy winger with nice potential .
I wonder how much of this is because the NHL missed out on Nick Sorkin last year playing in Maryland , and how much is because Thrush is getting more attention playing in the new North American Prospects Hockey League .
100 . Caleb Herbert - Bloomington Jefferson ( Minnesota - Duluth ) - Maybe a little bit high , given the risk involved with a smaller player that has n't seen much top - notch competition , but Herbert should be worth taking a late round pick on .
119 . Patrick Brown - Cranbrook ( BC ) - Brown is definitely the top Michigan HS player this year .
He 's got great hockey smarts and a big league shot , but I would n't pick him this high .
His skating is a big concern for me .
123 . Jared Knight - London ( OHL ) - A lot of people think this is too low , and I 'll agree .
He was bad at the beginning of the year , but was recently diagnosed with diabetes , and once he got that under control , he 's been playing really well .
He should push for a spot in the first two rounds .
136 . Brett Stern - Centennial ( Minnesota State ) - One of the more underrated Minnesota HS players this year , but a nice prospect .
He 's about where he belongs .
Centennial 's weird schedule means I have n't seen them yet this year , but I will twice this week , so I should have more on Stern later this week .
144 . Max Gaede - Woodbury ( Minnesota State ) - Woodbury has been a little disappointing this year , but Gaede probably played his way into being draft pick in the Elite League this year .
155 . Andrew Prochno- Minnetonka( St. Cloud ) - Prochno has played so well this high school season , and I 'd like to move him up , but it does n't change the fact that at his size , it 's a very uphill climb for the pros .
185 . Garrett Hendrickson - Virginia( St. Cloud ) - A very nice player , but some holes in skating will probably keep him from getting drafted .
187 . John Ramage - Wisconsin- Everyone is crying for him to get drafted after his performance at the World Juniors .
I agree , though probably not until the 5th round or so .
199 . Adam Krause - Hermantown ( Minnesota - Duluth ) - I was surprised at how low he was ranked here .
I had him ranked much higher .
A few months ago I reported on “ banana evangelists ” Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort and their project to distribute a new version of Darwin ’s “ The Origin of Species ” , including an added 50 - page creationist - minded introduction that , in their own words , “ reveals the dangerous fruit of evolution , Hitler ’s undeniable connections to the theory , Darwin ’s racism , and his disdain for women . ”
But now there is a new development .
It turns out that they plagiarized parts of the introduction directly from a biography of Charles Darwin ( here is a side - by - side comparison ) .
And the author of that biography , University of Tennessee professor Stan Guffey , is considering legal action .
It is ironic that many religious conservatives believe that morality cannot exist without religion .
And yet , these ardent evangelists , while trying to defend religious doctrine against science , ca n’t remember the eighth commandment against stealing .
Using Herceptin with chemotherapy , instead of after , clearly improves treatment of women with HER2 + breast cancer , and should be the new standard of care , says a Mayo Clinic researcher who led what is regarded to be a key clinical trial determining the best use of Herceptin .
Patients using Herceptin and chemotherapy at the same time had a relative 25 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence of cancer or death , compared with women who used Herceptin after chemotherapy , says Edith Perez , M.D. , chair , North Central Cancer Treatment Group ( NCCTG ) Breast Committee and a breast cancer researcher at the Mayo Clinic campus in Jacksonville , Fla .
She presented the findings of the study at the Cancer Therapy & Research Center - American Association for Cancer Research ( CTRC - AACR ) 2009 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium .
These findings may have global implications for women being treated for HER2 + breast cancer , which makes up 20 percent to 25 percent of all cases , Dr. Perez says .
In the United States , for example , Herceptin is approved for use on either a sequential or concurrent treatment schedule with adjuvant chemotherapy ( that is , chemotherapy following surgery ) .
In much of the rest of the world , Herceptin is used sequentially , she says .
" The results of this trial have been eagerly awaited in the U.S. and in many nations as this is the only trial developed to define the optimal way to incorporate Herceptin in the context of adjuvant chemotherapy , " Dr. Perez says .
" The goal was to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence , and we have shown that concurrent use is the best way to achieve that . "
" This could mean that up to 10,000 women around the world each year may have a better outcome if Herceptin is used along with chemotherapy .
Given that , I believe this study will lead to a global re-evaluation of how Herceptin is used , " she says .

Every year , approximately 250,000 women worldwide are eligible to be treated with Herceptin for invasive HER2 + breast cancer , says Dr. Perez .
Some data on part of the study , the ( NCCTG ) clinical trial N9831 , have been released before , such as in 2005 in the New England Journal of Medicine .
But this is the first time that mature outcome information on patients given sequential vs. concurrent treatment is available .
The trial enrolled women who had surgery to treat Stage I - III invasive HER2 + breast cancer .
The study is the only phase III randomized clinical trial to assess chemotherapy alone ( Arm A ) versus either sequential ( Arm B ) or concurrent ( Arm C ) incorporation of Herceptin in patients .
Chemotherapy used in the study was doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide then paclitaxel , and was administered for approximately six months .
Herceptin was given for 52 weeks .
Two different comparisons were made in the study .
The first looked at outcomes in Arm A ( 1,087 women ) compared to Arm B ( 1,097 women ) and found that five - year disease - free survival ( defined as no cancer recurrence ) was increased from 72 percent ( Arm A ) to 80 percent ( Arm B ) .
Researchers also tabulated 222 events ( cancer recurrence or death ) in Arm A compared to 164 events in Arm B .
The second comparison looked at 954 women enrolled in Arm B with 949 women enrolled in Arm C. Researchers found that patients in Arm C fared the best overall .
Their five - year disease - free - survival increased to 84 percent , compared to 80 percent in Arm B .
" The study demonstrated that adding Herceptin clearly improves disease - free survival , with improvement if given after chemotherapy , but even more improvement if started concurrent with taxane - based chemotherapy , " Dr. Perez says .
" So , our recommendation for practice and regulatory agencies around the world is that Herceptin be given concurrent with adjuvant chemotherapy . "
This study was conducted as a collaborative effort , with researchers participating via the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) - funded NCCTG , the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) , the Cancer and Leukemia Group B group ( CALGB ) , and the Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) .
In addition to NCI support , funding was also provided by Genentech .
Press Release of Senator DeWine DEWINE , GRAHAM , HAGEL & SNOWE INTRODUCE THE TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 2006
Contact : Mike Dawson
Thursday , March 16 , 2006
Today , Senators Mike DeWine ( R - OH ) , Lindsey Graham ( R- SC ) , Chuck Hagel ( R-NE ) , and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) introduced the Terrorist Surveillance
Act of 2006 , a measure that would provide a statutory framework , with congressional and judicial oversight for the President to conduct electronic surveillance on the international communications of suspected terrorists , while protecting the rights and liberties of American citizens .
" As the President has said , when terrorists call the United States , we want to know who they 're talking to .
This bill gives the President the limited authority to do just that , " said Senator DeWine , a member of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" It does not , however , give the President a blank check .
The Terrorist Surveillance
Act authorizes a limited , but necessary , program .
It requires the President to go to court as soon as possible .
And , it establishes an unprecedented Subcommittee with the power to oversee this program and protect the rights and liberties of American citizens . "
" My goal is to ensure the spying program , which has been effective and vital to our national security , is able to continue by ensuring we have the appropriate checks and balances in place , " said Senator Graham .
" I believe our legislation strikes that balance and will allow us to continue monitoring the enemy while protecting the rights of American citizens . "
" As communications technology and the terrorist threat evolve , we must ensure the security of the nation by updating our laws .
This legislation creates a 21st century law to address 21st century threats , " said Senator Hagel , a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
" We can not lose our focus on national security .
But we must not forget the critical roll that the legislative and judicial branches play in the governance of this nation .
This bill ensures substantive Congressional oversight and reinforces the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . "
" Today , I join with my colleagues -- Senators DeWine , Graham and Hagel -- in introducing legislation to bring the NSA 's surveillance program out of the shadows by reasserting the necessary constitutional checks and balances that both the legislative and judicial branches government have over the Executive .
Information is the bedrock of this legislation .
The more we learn about the NSA program , the better we are able to adopt measures necessary to protect our treasured constitutional rights without sacrificing our safety as a nation .
This legislation is the first of many steps , but one that is critical to safeguarding our security and freedom , " said Senator Snowe .
Under the Terrorist Surveillance Act , the President is given the limited authority to conduct surveillance of the international communications of terrorists for 45 days .
To engage in such surveillance , the President must have probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a member of or affiliated with a terrorist organization .
And , he must believe that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States from a terrorist attack .
Under the bill , the President is permitted to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program every 45 days .
To ensure that the President does not overstep his limited authority , the Terrorist Surveillance
Act adds important safeguards to current law to protect the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans .
--
The bill mandates that the President obtain a warrant for surveillance on a suspected terrorist once he has sufficient evidence to do so .
--
For those unusual cases where the President does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a court order , but still wishes to conduct surveillance on a suspect , the bill requires that the Attorney General certify , under oath , that continued surveillance is necessary to protect the United States .
-- Finally , the bill establishes a Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittee within the Senate Intelligence Committee with the exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and monitor the details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
That Subcommittee is empowered to obtain any and all information about the surveillance of any individual in order to ensure that the President is not abusing the rights of law - abiding Americans .
[ BILL EXPLANATION ATTACHED--SEE BELOW ]
Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 DeWine , Graham , Hagel , Snowe
The Terrorist Surveillance
Act provides limited statutory authority to the President to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States , greatly enhances Congressional oversight of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , and requires that electronic surveillance be conducted under FISA when the President has sufficient evidence to do so .
** Authorizes the President to conduct an electronic surveillance program , without court order , for up to 45 days , provided that --
-- The President determines that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests ; -- Protections are in place to ensure that the program is reasonably designed to acquire only international communications ; --
There is probable cause to believe that at least one party to a communication is a member of , affiliated with , or working in support of a terrorist organization .
The President must submit a list of designated terrorist organizations at least annually ; and -- Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition , retention and use of non-public information about U.S. persons .
** Requires Program Review and Reauthorization Every 45 Days
-- Every 45 days , the Attorney General must review the program and certify in writing and under oath whether the program meets the requirements set forth by Congress ; --
The President may then reauthorize the program for another 45 day period , but only if he determines that the program remains necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests .
--
The Attorney General must provide notice of the decision to continue or terminate the program to the congressional intelligence committees within 72 hours .
** Requires Review of Surveillance of Individual Targets Every 45 Days
-- Every 45 days , the Attorney General must also review the surveillance of any individual targets under the program . --
If , at any time , the Attorney General determines that he has sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant , he must seek a FISA warrant to continue surveillance on that target .
--
If the Attorney General determines that he does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant , but nonetheless wants to continue surveillance , then he must certify in writing and under oath to the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees the following four things : 1 ) that all previous surveillance complied with this Act ; 2 ) that there is insufficient evidence to obtain a warrant under FISA ; 3 ) that the President has determined that continued surveillance of the target without a court order is necessary to protect the United States , its citizens , or its interests ; and 4 ) that continued surveillance is being undertaken in a good faith belief that it will result in the acquisition of foreign intelligence information .
No target may be subject to surveillance beyond the 45 - day reauthorization period unless the Attorney General obtains a FISA warrant or files a certification , in writing and under oath , with the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees .
** Regular , Ongoing , and Vigorous Oversight of Terrorist Surveillance Program
-- The Act calls for the creation of Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees within both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees . --
To ensure confidentiality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , these Subcommittees , along with bipartisan congressional leadership , will have sole oversight responsibilities of this program .
--
The President must submit information on the management and operational details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program generally and any specific surveillance conducted by this program whenever requested by the Subcommittees .
--
Every 6 months , the President must also submit a report to the Subcommittees , which , among other things , will include : 1 ) A complete discussion of the management , operational details , effectiveness , and necessity of the program and all electronic surveillance conduced under the program during the 6 month period ;
2 ) Total number of United States persons targeted for electronic surveillance ; 3 ) For any targets subject to surveillance for longer than 45 days , an explanation why the target was subject to continued surveillance without a FISA warrant ; and 4 ) A description of the nature of the information sought under the program , the types of communications subject to the program and whether the information could have been reasonably obtained by less intrusive investigative techniques .
** Program Sunset : 5 years
** Enhanced penalties for disclosure of classified information related to the Terrorist Surveillance Program
-- Maximum fine of $ 1 million and / or 15 years in prison .
This provision does not apply to journalists .
