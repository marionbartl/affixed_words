Sixty thousand years ago , a small group of African men and women took to the Red Sea in tiny boats and crossed the Mandab Strait to Asia .
Their journey - of less than 20 miles - marked the moment Homo sapiens left its home continent .
The motive for our ancestors '
African exodus is not known , though scientists suspect food shortages , triggered by climate change , were involved .
However , its impact cannot be overestimated .
Two thousand generations later , descendants of these African emigres have settled our entire planet , wiped out all other hominids including the Neanderthals and have reached a population of 6.5 billion .
Now scientists are completing a massive study of DNA samples from a quarter of a million volunteers in different continents in order to create the most precise map yet of mankind 's great diaspora .
Last week , in Tallinn , Estonia , they outlined their most recent results .
' As the ultimate ancestor begat son , who begat son and so on , they picked up mutations in their DNA that we can now pinpoint by gene analysis , ' said project leader Dr Spencer Wells .
' When we look at these markers ' distributions we can see how our ancestors moved about . '
Scientists have known for several years that modern humans emerged from sub-Saharan Africa within the past 100,000 years .
However , the £ 25 m Genographic project - backed by National Geographic , IBM and the Waitt Family Foundation - has recently transformed that knowledge by painting in a mass of highly detailed information about our African exodus .
After emerging into the Arabian peninsula , some of our ancestors took sea routes along the south Asian coast to reach Australia 50,000 years ago .
Only later , about 40,000 years ago , did we enter Europe - its cold and its Neanderthals making it far less hospitable - while one group of Asians headed farther east over the land bridge that then connected their continent to America .
' We can also see that just before humans left Africa , about 70,000 years ago , mankind was brought to the brink of extinction when Mount Toba , in Sumatra , erupted , ' said Wells .
' It was the most powerful volcanic eruption for two million years and dropped thick ash and killed vegetation across the globe .
Our research now shows
Homo sapiens numbers dropped alarmingly at this time and we only just hung on as a species . '
Nevertheless , humanity bounced back , evolving new creative and intellectual gifts under the extreme selective pressures it then had to endure .
Since then , waves of men and women have moved round the planet and DNA analysis can detect traces of these movements - often with intriguing results .
One study by project scientists Pierre Zalloua and Chris Tyler - Smith has discovered a genetic marker typical of Europeans in modern Lebanese men .
The inference is clear they say : this distinctive Y - chromosome was left behind by 11th - century Crusaders when they invaded Lebanon and then settled in the country .
A similar sort of genetic legacy has been detected in regions where Gengis Khan ruled and which has been linked to the many male descendants he produced .
As for Africa , it has the most genetically diverse population of all the continents , as would be expected of humanity 's birthplace .
And of those living today , the Khoisan people of southern Africa are probably the closest , genetically , to the founding mothers and fathers of humanity , say project scientists .
London , September 5 : An archaeologist has identified the remains of a long dead mouse , in the wreck of a Bronze Age royal ship that sank 3500 years ago off the coast of Turkey , which makes the specimen the earliest rodent stowaway ever recorded , and proof of the ship ’s place of origin .
According to a report in New Scientist , the archaeologist in question is Thomas Cucchi of the University of Durham , UK , who identified a fragment of a mouse jaw in sediment from the ancient ship .
The cargo of ebony , ivory , silver and gold - including a gold scarab with the name of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti - indicates that the ship was a royal vessel .
Because the cargo carried artefacts from many cultures , its nationality and route is hotly debated , but the mouse ’s jaw may provide answers .
Cucchi’s analysis confirms it belonged to Mus musculus domesticus , the only species known to live in close quarters with humans .
The shape of the molars suggests the mouse came from the northern Levantine coast , as they are similar to those of modern house mice in Syria , near Cyprus .
When generations of rodents live aboard ships , they evolve larger body shapes .
Yet this mouse was roughly the same shape and size as other small , land - dwelling mice of the time , suggesting it boarded just before the ship set sail .

COMMENT : It is clear by the examples listed here that it is free speech that would be underfire here – note also that the examples of supposed disinfo include concerns about vaccine ingredients , concerns about science destroying the planet ( should we be unconcerned about the nuclear bomb as well ? ) and concerns about other ‘ conspiracy theories ’ which dare to question and / or challenge the convention wisdom accepted as fact .
The internet needs a way to help people separate rumour from real science , says the creator of the World Wide Web .
Talking to BBC News Sir Tim Berners - Lee said he was increasingly worried about the way the web has been used to spread disinformation .
Sir Tim spoke prior to the unveiling of a Foundation he has co-created that aims to make the web truly worldwide .
It will also look at ways to help people decide if sites are trustworthy and reliable sources of information .
Future proof
Sir Tim talked to the BBC in the week in which Cern , where he did his pioneering work on the web , turned on the Large Hadron Collider for the first time .
The use of the web to spread fears that flicking the switch on the LHC could create a Black Hole that could swallow up the Earth particularly concerned him , he said .
In a similar vein was the spread of rumours that the MMR vaccine given to children in Britain was harmful .
Sir Tim told BBC
News that there needed to be new systems that would give websites a label for trustworthiness once they had been proved reliable sources .
“ On the web the thinking of cults can spread very rapidly and suddenly a cult which was 12 people who had some deep personal issues suddenly find a formula which is very believable , ” he said .
“ A sort of conspiracy theory of sorts and which you can imagine spreading to thousands of people and being deeply damaging . ”
Sir Tim and colleagues at the World Wide Web consortium had looked at simple ways of branding websites – but concluded that a whole variety of different mechanisms was needed .
“ I ’m not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ rating because like people they can vary in all kinds of different ways , ” he said .
“ So I ’d be interested in different organisations labelling websites in different ways ” .
Sir Tim spoke to the BBC to publicise the launch of his World Wide Web Foundation which aims to improve the web ’s accessibility .

New study proves that pain is not a symptom of arthritis , pain causes arthritis
-end -
Pain is more than a symptom of osteoarthritis , it is an inherent and damaging part of the disease itself , according to a study published today in journal .
More specifically , the study revealed that pain signals originating in arthritic joints , and the biochemical processing of those signals as they reach the spinal cord , worsen and expand arthritis .
In addition , researchers found that nerve pathways carrying pain signals transfer inflammation from arthritic joints to the spine and back again , causing disease at both ends .
Technically , pain is a patient 's conscious realization of discomfort .
Before that can happen , however , information must be carried along nerve cell pathways from say an injured knee to the pain processing centers in dorsal horns of the spinal cord , a process called nociception .
The current study provides strong evidence that two - way , nociceptive " crosstalk " may first enable joint arthritis to transmit inflammation into the spinal cord and brain , and then to spread through the central nervous system ( CNS ) from one joint to another .
Furthermore , if joint arthritis can cause neuro - inflammation , it could have a role in conditions like Alzheimer 's disease , dementia and multiple sclerosis .
Armed with the results , researchers have identified likely drug targets that could interfere with key inflammatory receptors on sensory nerve cells as a new way to treat osteoarthritis ( OA ) , which destroys joint cartilage in 21 million Americans .
The most common form of arthritis , OA eventually brings deformity and severe pain as patients loose the protective cushion between bones in weight - bearing joints like knees and hips .
"
Until relatively recently , osteoarthritis was believed to be due solely to wear and tear , and inevitable part of aging , " said Stephanos Kyrkanides , D.D.S. , Ph.D. , associate professor of Dentistry at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
" Recent studies have revealed , however , that specific biochemical changes contribute to the disease , changes that might be reversed by precision - designed drugs .
Our study provides the first solid proof that some of those changes are related to pain processing , and suggests the mechanisms behind the effect , " said Kyrkanides , whose work on genetics in dentistry led to broader applications .
The common ground between arthritis and dentistry : the jaw joint is a common site of arthritic pain .
Past studies have shown that specific nerve pathways along which pain signals travel repeatedly become more sensitive to pain signals with each use .
This may be a part of ancient survival skill ( if that hurt once , do n't do it again ) .
Secondly , pain has long been associated with inflammation ( swelling and fever ) .
In fact , past research has shown that the same chemicals that cause inflammation also cause the sensation of pain and hyper - sensitivity to pain if injected .
Kyrkanides ' work centers around one such pro-inflammatory , signaling chemical called Interleukin 1 - beta ( IL - 1 β ) , which helps to ramp up the bodies attack on an infection .
Specifically , Kyrkanides ' team genetically engineered a mouse where they could turn up on command the production of IL - 1 β in the jaw joint , a common site of arthritis .
Experiments showed for the first time that turning up IL - 1 β in a peripheral joint caused higher levels of IL - 1 β to be produced in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord as well .
Using a second , even more elaborately engineered mouse model , the team also demonstrated for the first time that creating higher levels of IL - 1 β in cells called astrocytes in the spinal cord caused more osteoarthritic symptoms in joints .
Past studies had shown astrocytes , non-nerve cells ( glia ) in the central nervous system that provide support for the spinal cord and brain , also serve as the immune cells of CNS organs .
Among other things , they release cytokines like IL - 1 β to fight disease when triggered .
The same cytokines released from CNS glia may also be released from neurons in joints , possibly explaining how crosstalk carries pain , inflammation and hyper - sensitivity back and forth .
In both mouse models , experimental techniques that shut down IL - 1 β signaling reversed the crosstalk effects .
Specifically , researchers used a molecule , IL - 1RA , known to inhibit the ability of IL - 1 β to link up with its receptors on nerve cells .
Existing drugs ( e.g. Kineret® ( anakinra ) , made by Amgen and indicated for rheumatoid arthritis ) act like IL - 1RA to block the ability IL - 1 β to send a pain signal through its specific nerve cell receptor , and Kyrkanides ' group is exploring a new use for them as osteoarthritis treatment .
The implications of this process go further , however , because the cells surrounding sensory nerve cell pathways too can be affected by crosstalk .
If 10 astrocytes secrete IL - 1 β in response to a pain impulse , Kyrkanides said , perhaps 1,000 adjacent cells will be affected , greatly expanding the field of inflammation .
Spinal cord astrocytes are surrounded by sensory nerve cells that connect to other areas of the periphery , further expanding the effect .
According to Kyrkanides ' model , increased inflammation by in the central nervous system can then send signals back down the nerve pathways to the joints , causing the release of inflammatory factors there .
Among the proposed , inflammatory factors is calcitonin gene related peptide ( CGRP ) .
The team observed higher levels calcitonin - gene related peptide ( CGRP ) production in primary sensory fibers in the same regions where IL - 1 β levels rose , and the release of IL - 1 β by sensory neurons may cause the release of CGRP in joints .
Past studies in Kyrkanides reveal that CGRP can also cause cartilage - producing cells ( chondrocytes ) to mature too quickly and die , a hallmark of osteoarthritis .
Joining Kyrkanides in the publication from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry were co-authors M. Kerry O'Banion , M.D. , Ph.D. , Ross Tallents , D.D.S. , J. Edward Puzas , Ph.D. and Sabine M. Brouxhon , M.D. Paolo Fiorentino was a student contributor and Jennie Miller was involved as Kyrkanides ' technical associate .
Maria Piancino , led a collaborative effort at the University of Torino , Italy .
This work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health .
" Our study results confirm that joints can export inflammation in the form of higher IL - 1 β along sensory nerve pathways to the spinal cord , and that higher IL - 1 β inflammation in the spinal cord is sufficient in itself to create osteoarthritis in peripheral joints , " Kyrkanides said .
" We believe this to be a vitally important process contributing to orthopaedic and neurological diseases in which inflammation is a factor .

Usually when Lindsey Graham is on TV flaking for McCain , he looks like he had a transfusion of Red Bull , but today on FOX NEWS Sunday , after some bad poll results came out for McCain , he was not his old self and gave a one line answer to Wallace 's long question .
Chris had to make up for his lack of answer and push him to continue , Graham then announced that Obama did great in the polls after the Friday debate , he replied , " I 'm tired . "
Download Download ( rough transcript )
Wallace :
The early indication from polls are that the public in these polls that were taken overnight favored Obama --- thought he did better .
CBS
News poll of uncommitted voters 39 % thought Obama won , 24 % thought , preferred McCain 24 % , and 37 % thought it was a tie .
And while voters thought Obama did better on the economy and McCain did better on foreign policy , Here is the bottom line .
McCain 's rating on being prepared to be president did n't change , but Obama had a 16 pt jump on that same question .
Sen Graham .
McCain keeps saying that Obama is not ready to lead , but according to the several polls voters watching the debate thought he was .
Graham :
There 's an 18 pt difference between who is best able to do the job , we 'll take that .
< then a silence >
Wallace :
What you 're saying is that even though Obama got more of a bump , there 's still a lead ...
Graham :
It 's Sunday and I 'm tired and Sen Obama did well .
Sen Obama helped himself according to the polls
Wallace :
You can't be tired on Sunday morning , sir ...( laughter )
He 's tired on Sunday ?
Welcome to the club .
I think it 's frustration .... This is another indication that they are not happy with the outcome of the debate .
USA TODAY / Gallop : Obama won
" Our economy and our markets will not recover until the bulk of this housing correction is behind us . "
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , Sept 7 , 2008
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
So when will the " bulk of this housing correction " be behind us ?
Right now prices are still too high .
Here are a few ways to look at house prices : real prices ( inflation adjusted ) , price - to - rent ratio , and price - to - income ratio .
The first graph compares real and nominal Case - Shiller Home Prices through Q2 2008 ( real is current index adjusted using CPI less Shelter ) .
In real terms ( red line ) , the Case - Shiller National Home price index is off 25 % from the peak .
Real prices are now back to the Q4 2002 level ( nominal prices are back to mid-2004 ) .
This suggests real prices , based on the Case - Shiller index , could fall substantially , perhaps 15 % to maybe even 30 % more .
This decline would probably be some combination of falling nominal prices and more inflation .
And prices could definitely overshoot to the downside .
The second graph shows the price to rent ratio ( Dec 1982 = 1.0 ) for both the OFHEO House Price Index and the Case - Shiller National Home Price Index .
For rents , the national Owners ' Equivalent Rent from the BLS is used .
This graph is from this earlier post Data is available quarterly for the Case - Shiller National Index starting in 1987 .
For this graph , the price - to - rent ratio for Case - Shiller in Q1 1987 was set to the OFHEO price - to - rent for Q1 1987 .
Looking at the price - to - rent ratio based on the Case - Shiller index , the adjustment in the price - to - rent ratio is probably 60 % complete as of Q2 2008 on a national basis .
This ratio will probably continue to decline with some combination of falling prices , and perhaps , rising rents .
And the ratio may overshoot too .
The third graph shows the price - to - income ratio and is based off the Case - Shiller index , and the Census Bureau 's median income Historical Income Tables - Households Using national median income and house prices provides a gross overview of price - to - income ( it would be better to do this analysis on a local area ) .
However this does shows that the price - to - income is still too high , and that this ratio needs to fall another 20 % or so .
Once again this could be a combination of falling prices and rising incomes ( Note : this uses nominal incomes , and even if real incomes are stagnate or declining , nominal incomes are rising ) .
So by these three measures , prices have a ways to fall .
And finally , as long as inventory levels are substantially above normal ( especially inventories of distressed properties ) , prices will probably continue to decline .
So this graph is very useful :
The final graph shows the ' months of supply ' metric for existing homes for the last six years .
Months of supply increased to 11.2 months .
A normal range is 5 to maybe 8 months .
Until the months of supply decreases to the normal range , prices will continue to fall .
How much longer will prices fall ?
How much further will prices decline ?
No one knows , but these graphs suggest we still have a ways to go .
Surely you 'll give up before this does Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) , the world 's largest computer company , has developed a new generation of laptops with a 24 - hour battery life .
Its new HP EliteBook 6930 p can be configured with an ultra-capacity battery to deliver " all - day computing " .
The firm says the 24 - hour battery means travellers can take more than 10 trips on the Eurostar between London and Paris before recharging their laptop .
HP said it was an " unprecedented milestone in mobile computing " .
Ted Clark , of HP 's notebook global business unit , said : " All - day computing has been the holy grail of notebook computing .
" With the HP EliteBook 6930 p , customers no longer have to worry about their notebook battery running out before their work day is over . "
October release
The company said the record battery life arises from a combination of HP engineering and energy - efficient notebook components such as Intel solid - state hard drives ( SSD ) and mercury - free LED displays .
The optional HP Illumi - Lite LED display boosts battery run time by up to four hours compared to traditional LCD displays , while the Intel SSD provides about a 7 % increase in battery life compared to traditional hard drives .
It is worth noting that the 24 - hour figure can be reached only by purchasing the ultra- capacity battery and upgrading the base model of the 6930p to include the Illumi - Lite display and 80 gigabyte version of the SSD .
The company says in addition to preserving battery life , tests have also shown that the new Intel SSD boosts overall performance by up to 57 % , and data transfer rates are almost six times faster than traditional hard drives .
" Intel architected its new line of high - performance solid - state drives specifically to bring a new level of performance and reliability to the computing platform and make significant impact to the way people use their PCs , " said Randy Wilhelm of Intel .
" The HP milestone is an example of the impact of this new level of performance that specifically delivers on lower power consumption for longer battery life . "
The new HP EliteBook will be available in October .

What are these ?
The Shedd Aquarium and Forest Preserve are launching a mapping project of freshwater mussels , one of the most endangered groups of animals in North America .
An Elgin creek is one of the few places in Illinois where one species of freshwater mussel still lives at all .
Once a hot spot for mussel diversity , the population in the Midwest has dropped drastically because of development and invasive species .
Freshwater mussels , vitally important to the health of their aquatic ecosystems , are the “ livers ” of rivers and lakes .
Their method of filter feeding removes material from the water , including potentially harmful algae , bacteria and chemical compounds .
Mussels also play a major role in shaping the physical features of streams and reducing the probability of severe erosion .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick
Cheney must preserve a broad range of records from his time in office , a federal judge ordered Saturday , ruling in favor of a private watchdog group .
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly found that the records are not excluded from preservation under Presidential Records
Act , which gives the national archivist responsibility over the custody of and access to the records at the end of a president 's final term .
The Bush administration had sought a narrow interpretation of the act to allow for fewer materials to be preserved by the National Archives .
" Defendants were only willing to agree to a preservation order that tracked their narrowed interpretation of the PRA 's statutory language , " Kollar - Kotelly said in her order .
This position " heightens the Court 's concern " that some records will not be preserved without an injunction .
Cheney chief of staff David Addington has told Congress that the vice president belongs to neither the executive nor legislative branch of government , AP reported .
Instead , he said , the office is attached by the Constitution to Congress .
The vice president presides over the Senate .
The lawsuit -- naming among its defendants Cheney , the Executive Office of President and the National Archives and Records Administration -- was filed by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , commonly known as CREW .
In response to the ruling , Cheney spokesman James R. Hennigan said that " we will not have any comment on pending litigation , " according to The Associated Press .
The judge 's order is the most recent setback to the Bush administration 's position on openness of executive branch records .
In December , a federal judge ruled in another CREW lawsuit that the White House cannot hide behind a shield of privilege over release of its visitor logs .
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth concluded that the information was a public records request , subject to Freedom of Information Act disclosure of " agency records . "
The White House had claimed exclusive control of the documents , subject to the complete discretion of the president over their release .
CREW sought the visitor records of prominent conservatives James Dobson ( Focus on the Family ) , Wendy Wright ( Concerned Women of America ) and seven others , including the late televangelist Jerry Falwell .

102 arrested at RNC after Rage concert Associated Press
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008
Print This Email This ( Update at bottom - More than 800 arrests reported over week ) ST .
PAUL , Minn . ( AP )  Police arrested 102 protesters in downtown Minneapolis early Thursday following a concert by the rock group Rage Against the Machine , raising to more than 400 the number arrested in demonstrations related to the Republican National Convention .
Police blocked off an intersection as they processed those arrested .
Young people sat on a sidewalk , their backs against a building , or stood quietly in line , their hands in plastic cuffs behind their backs .
Protesters calling for an end to the Iraq war urged others to join their march Thursday night outside the convention as John McCain accepts his party 's presidential nomination on its fourth and final night .
The Anti-War Committee denounced the increased presence of police in riot gear and acts of " intimidation " in the streets of St. Paul .
In a warmup to the main protest , about 50 college and high school students staged an anti-war rally at the Capitol at midday Thursday .
Eight police officers watched the rally from afar , with most leaning against their cars .
None wore riot gear .
Organizers said they were trying to put on a safe , nonviolent event for the whole family .
When a musician singing and playing a guitar uttered a profanity , she was chastised by the crowd and quickly promised to clean up her language .
Minnesota Gov.
Tim Pawlenty blamed the violence this week on a small group of " anarchists , nihilists , and goofballs who want to break stuff and hurt people . "
" They need to be dealt with , " Pawlenty said in an interview with WCCO - AM of Minneapolis .
" When you want to break stuff and hurt people , you can't do that . "
St. Paul was quieter on Wednesday , the convention 's third day , when four women from the peace group CodePink were arrested after crawling under a fence a couple blocks from the Xcel Center where the convention is being held .
They were released .
CodePink also took credit for disrupting Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's speech on Wednesday night .
The group said two of its members were given tickets to the speech by a Republican delegate who was frustrated with the party and Palin .
The CodePink members , Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans , were escorted from the Xcel Center after yelling and displaying a banner .
They said they were held until after her speech but not arrested .
Police said they broke up more serious plans to disrupt the convention .
Search warrants and other police documents made public this week claim that anarchists discussed plans to throw Molotov cocktails , sabotage the Xcel Energy Center or the St. Paul Downtown Airport , stretch metal chains across freeways and kidnap delegates .
Associated Press writer Jeff Baenen contributed to this report .
Watch Rage Against the Machine play an acapella song for protesters after police barred them from performing on Wednesday night .
More than 800 arrests reported over week ST .
PAUL , Minn . ( AP ) -- Percussion grenades , tear gas and nearly 400 arrests marked the final anti-war march during the Republican National Convention .
More than 800 arrests were reported during a week of sometimes peaceful , sometimes violent dissent .
Anti-war protesters rallied Thursday at the state Capitol and then planned to march to Xcel Energy Center , where Sen. John McCain was due to accept the GOP presidential nomination .
But their permit had expired , and police - in riot gear and using horses , snow plows and dump trucks - blocked their way .
For hours , police let the protesters amble from one blocked intersection to another .
But then the arrests began in earnest .
At least 19 journalists , including two reporters from The Associated Press , were among those held by police .
Anti-war protesters briefly interrupted McCain as he addressed delegates Thursday night .
Three protesters , one with a sign that read " You can't win an occupation " on one side and " McCain votes against vets " on the other , were removed from the hall by security officers .
McCain asked that supporters not be " diverted by the crowd noise and the static . "
Earlier , the march to the Xcel Energy Center was relaxed at first and even festive .
Younger people did cartwheels .
Tourists came by to check out the spectacle .
The chants , which were political at the outset , turned silly a couple hours in .
" You 're sexy , you 're cute , take off the riot suit , " protesters serenaded those blocking their path .
When police blocked the path to Xcel , a cat - and - mouse game ensued as protesters moved around the Capitol area , splintered , and then organized into a marching force again .
The crowd varied from a high of about 1,000 down to a hundred and back to around 500 .
About three hours into the standoff , about 300 protesters sat down on a major thoroughfare and police closed the four - lane boulevard .
Officers then set off smoke bombs and fired seven percussion grenades , causing protesters to scatter .
Some of the scattering protesters entered a residential area north of the Capitol .
Later , at least three smoke bombs were discharged in the area of apartments and houses .
The event ended with about 200 protesters , along with AP reporters Amy Forliti and Jon Krawczynski and other members of the media , trapped on a bridge .
Officers ordered them to sit on the pavement on a bridge over Interstate 94 and to keep their hands over their heads as they were led away two at a time .
The arrests came three days after AP photographer Matt Rourke , also on assignment covering the protests , was arrested .
He was released without being charged Monday after being held for several hours .
Forliti and Krawczynski were issued citations for unlawful assembly and released .
Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher said the St. Paul police department and its police chief decided that members of the media would be issued citations and released .
Fletcher said he expected most of the charges would be for unlawful assembly .
" Whoever got arrested was whoever did n't disperse and was still on the bridge , " Fletcher said .
" The tactic of blocking people on the bridge could very well have prevented a lot of activity later tonight .
Clearly there were a number of people with no intention of being law - abiding tonight . "

Obama : Bush Iraq plan ' continues same mistakes '
Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Dem candidate insists McCain offers 4 more years of Bush policy Responding to President Bush 's announcement that US troop levels in Iraq would remain unchanged until the next president takes office , Democratic candidate Barack Obama said the proposal was too " modest " to be effective and accused his Republican opponent of wanting to continue Bush 's policies .
" The president 's talk of return on success is a new name for continuing the same strategic mistakes that have dominated our foreign policy for over five years , " Obama told reporters after campaign stops Tuesday in Dayton , Ohio .
Obama said Bush 's plan " comes up short " and demonstrates the need for a comprehensive overhaul of US strategy in Iraq .
Earlier Tuesday , Bush called for maintaining combat troop levels through the end of 2008 and said 8,000 troops could come home by February of next year , by which time either Obama or John McCain will be in the White House .
Continuing a harsh line of attack he began at the Democratic convention , Obama tied McCain tightly to Bush 's foreign policy , and he all but accused the president of allowing Osama bin Laden to remain on the lam since 9/11 .
" John McCain has been talking a lot about change , but he is running for four more years of the same foreign policy that we 've had under President Bush , " Obama said , charging the GOP candidate of emphasizing Iraq while losing focus of Afghanistan and Pakistan , which he called the true central fronts of the war on terrror .
" We 've still heard no explanation for why Osama bin Laden is still at large , " Obama said , " because that 's where John McCain and George Bush 's judgment have gotten us . "
Security software vendor Sophos discovered the vulnerability and notified BusinessWeek .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for Sophos , wrote on his blog that hackers tried to infect readership that used part of the site with malware .
" Hundreds of pages on a part of BusinessWeeks website which offers information about where MBA students might find future employers have been struck by the SQL Injection attack - where a security vulnerability is exploited in order to insert malicious code into the site 's underlying database , " the post said .
Gluley told InternetNews.com that hackers are focusing on SQL injection attacks because " they want to take over your desktop , and companies are protecting their e-mail now , so the other way to get to your desktop is through the browser . "
SQL injection attacks , the most common form of hacker attacks , exploit vulnerabilities on a Website to insert malicious code into the database behind the Website .
In BusinessWeek 's case , that code would lead users to a Russian Web site from which malware could be downloaded .
For its part , BusinessWeek.com was tight - lipped about its response , saying only that the malicious application was removed .
" Online security is a top priority and , while we continue to investigate the matter , we are confident that our readers ' personal information has not been compromised , " BusinessWeek spokesperson Patti Straus said in an e-mailed response to requests for comment .
She said the attack affected only one application within a specific sector of the Web site .
" We continue to work to ensure the integrity of our site and to protect it from future illegal and malicious hacking activity , " Strauss added .
Getting rid of the link is not enough , Cluley said .
" It 's easy to remove the malicious links , but BusinessWeek has to look at their infrastructure and work out how the attackers managed to hack their code or the chances are that , within a number of hours , the site will get reinfected . "
Google Safe Browsing 's diagnostic page for BusinessWeek.com showed that 214 of the 2,157 pages tested on the site downloaded and installed malware on the visitor 's desktop without the user 's consent .
However , the problem seems to have been resolved , as Google Safe Browsing 's page said the last time suspicious content was found on this site was on September 11 .
Google 's Safe Browsing extension is built into the Google Toolbar and integrated into Mozilla Firefox 2.0 .
It validates URLs against a frequently updated list of known phishing URLs .
On September 8 , BusinessWeek launched Business Exchange , a social network of sorts , which Keith Fox , its president , described as " a clear and unique step into the future of the media industry . "
Apart from carrying content from the magazine 's staff , it will pull in aggregated content from other sites , including articles , white papers and videos .
The site lets visitors connect with industry leaders and BusinessWeek staff and other professionals to discuss various issues online .
It will also let Linked In users access and leverage their personal information using their existing Linked In profiles .
Linked
In facilitates professional networking .
Business Exchange is headed by Roger Neal , senior vice president and general manager , who joined the company in 2006 after working with AOL and eBay and founding a company , Productopia , which was a casualty of the dot - com bust in 2000 .
How could a site developed by a historied publication with oodles of money and headed by someone with 12 years ' experience with pure Internet companies run into trouble like this ?
Simple -- someone somewhere did not check the code thoroughly , Sophos 's Cluley said .

New bank notes have been issued to cope with soaring prices Zimbabwe 's annual rate of inflation has surged to 2,200,000 % , official figures have shown .
The figure is the first official assessment of prices in the troubled African nation since February , when the rate of inflation stood at 165,000 % .
Zimbabwe , once one of the richest countries in Africa , has descended into economic chaos largely blamed on the policies of President Robert Mugabe .
Mr Mugabe was re-elected last month in a controversial one - man race .
The opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , pulled out of the run - off election , saying its supporters were being attacked and killed .
This situation is not sustainable .
There 's going to be some sort of implosion
Rejoice Ngwenya , economist
Zimbabwe ' getting worse '
Rising costs are forcing retailers to increase prices a number of times a day for goods purchased with billion dollar bank notes and the number of people falling into poverty is on the rise .
In May , the central bank issued a 500 m Zimbabwe dollar banknote , worth US $ 2 at the time of issue , to try to ease cash shortages amid the world 's highest rate of inflation .
This is in stark contrast with the situation at independence in 1980 when one Zimbabwe dollar was worth more than US $ 1 .
Mr Mugabe denies that he is ruining the economy , laying the blame on international sanctions he says have been imposed against Zimbabwe .
The US and the EU have imposed targeted sanctions , such as a travel ban and an assets freeze , on Mr Mugabe and his close allies .

Companies typically keep a fairly tight lid on their roadmaps ; updates tend to either be carefully controled or " accidentally " leaked .
Leaked roadmaps , official or not , always run the risk of being wrong , but there 's a new series of Intel updates making the rounds that certainly could be right , based on what we know about the CPU manufacturer 's plans .
Keep in mind , however , that all roadmaps are subject to legitimate change .
The roadmaps below might be perfectly accurate for what Intel currently plans to do within the 2008 - 2010 time frame , but the company always has the right to change its mind .
PCWatch published a set of diagrams , including multiple Nehalem breakdowns if you want to see how the Lynnfield , Havendale , Westmere , and Bloomfield cores compare to each other .
In this article , we 'll focus on Intel 's overall roadmap through 2010 , as well as recap some information on Atom you may have missed the first time around .
Remember , however , nothing here is official until Intel says it 's official .
( Click on the graph for a full version ) .
All of the current projections are accurate , and they show how well Intel has currently seeded the market with strong value parts —
Intel 's E7300 ( 2.6GHz Wolfdale , 3MB L2 ) is significantly faster than its ranking in " Essential " would indicate , for example .
Moving into Q4 , we see Nehalem 's launch ( Bloomfield - only , and only down as far as " Mainstream 3 . "
Save for the new Core i7 introduction , that 's pretty much it for Intel until the end of Q2 / early Q3 .
At that time , Intel launches a full Nehalem - flavored lineup , and pushes Core 2 all the way to the " Value 2 " segment .
At this point , it appears that Intel will push current Core 2 Duo technology into the Celeron line , and stretch Nehalem - class products into all other segments .
Below that point , we see the upcoming Atom processors , as discussed above .
Looking ahead to 2010 , we have six - core Westmere ( currently set for the first half of the year ) at the high - end of the
market .
Intel , it seems , is bound and determined to push quad - core and hexa - core processors into the mass market , despite a
dearth of applications that support that many processors .
This is n't exactly a new problem , and it's by no means a foregone
conclusion that we 'll make any great leaps in performance scaling between now and then .
Atom in 2009
There are n't any dates on this section of the roadmap , but it 's not hard to predict some given that the Atom 230 is already on the market with the 330 launching in a matter of weeks .
These new chips should drop in 2009 , though it 's not clear if Intel will launch the single - core flavor before the dual - core , as it did this year .
The two big changes , according to this roadmap , are the processor 's new platform and an integrated GPU core .
The GPU core may or may not be directly integrated into Atom ; Intel could also opt to use a multi- die package .
The fact that these new boards use DMI instead of a standard FSB indicates the presence of an integrated memory controller , even if it is n't expressly mentioned on the diagram .
This is further reason to suspect that Intel will use an MCM package for Pinefield , with the CPU +IMC on one die , and the GPU core on the other .
The DMI link is what connects the MCH to the ICH , and the term FSB is no longer applicable .
This is hopefully evidence that Atom will finally have access to a desktop chipset more friendly to its power consumption .
Both the Atom 230 and the upcoming Atom 330 are built on the decidedly rusty 945GC platform , and it shows — the 945GC chipset consumes several times more power than the Atom 230 itself .
These new chips should also be clocked higher than the current 1.6GHz offerings ; 1.8GHz is a safe bet , and 2GHz certainly is n't out of the question .
I was n't hugely impressed with the current - generation Atom 230 platform when I compared it to VIA 's Nano , but a dual - core 2GHz Atom on an appropriate platform could be a different story .
WASHINGTON  Dick Cheney is not a man given to revealing his inner thoughts .
But on the cool , clear evening in April when Mr. Cheney , the 46th vice president of the United States , presided over a literary salon at his residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory here , he seemed in a reflective mood .
The featured author was Ian W. Toll , whose book , “ Six Frigates , ” chronicles the founding of the Navy .
A collection of Washington luminaries , including former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , dined on salmon with pesto ; the Sea Chanters , a Navy chorus , performed after dessert .
As the evening wound down , the vice president offered a flash of introspection in quiet conversation with his guest of honor .
“ He said that , when he was defense secretary , he felt he was presiding over a ‘ huge grinding machine that was here before me and will be here after I ’m gone , ’ ” said Mr. Toll , who was so struck by Mr. Cheney ’s remark that he wrote it down .
“ There was almost something wistful about it , a sense that even in this day and age , no one , not even someone who ’s had a career like that of Vice President Cheney , can really hope to fundamentally reshape our institutions . ”
Mr. Cheney has , of course , fundamentally reshaped at least one American institution : the vice presidency .
Fueled by a belief in a strong presidency and American hegemony , and with the help of a president , George W. Bush , who gave him an extraordinarily free hand , he has stretched the limits of the job in ways his predecessors could not have imagined .

Can the Government Buy an Insurance Company for Cheap ?
Posted by David Zaring
Apparently so .
Good news if you have stock in the United States - boy can that country buy low .
Anyway , as you 've all probably read , the Fed opened the discount window for AIG in exchange for 80 % of its stock .
Amazing dilution .
No , I can't recall the government having ever done this before .
And yes , this sort of invitation to trade credit for equity is utterly unprecedented in the Fed 's use of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act .
The below analysis of this administrative action reserves all M&A questions to other corporate experts .
There 's really no statutory authority for the AIG takeover ( the Fed and Paulson went to the Hill , and got nothing , not that they possibly could have in a couple of Tuesday evening hours ) .
I wo n't bother noting that the DC Circuit , were it to sit in judgment on whether the Fed could buy the world 's largest insurer , would undoubtedly conclude that the plain language of its governing statute ( which is to make emergency loans , not require takeovers in exchange ) would not permit the takeover under Chevron USA v. NRDC .
And I will wait for others to opine on whether the Fed got a good deal .
Legally , the basis for Fed action - not that it is reviewable - would be that the acquisition of the petitioner is a reasonable interpetation of its ability to open the discount window to anyone .
I imagine that the legal answer to that question depends on a nice distinction between practice and plain language .
Under the plain language of the statute , interpreted imaginatively , the Fed can extend credit , upon the right showing , to any company or individual , and so why not insist on conditions on the loan ?
Heck , why could n't EPA , in the name of fishable swimmable rivers ( that 's Clean Water Act language ) , ban all pesticides , including dishwasher detergent , or nationalize water users like the steel industry ?
Maybe it can !
Which might be good news for environmental activists .
The usual reason why government agencies can't so act has something to do with settled expectations - if a government agency has never done it , and never done anything like it , then it usually can't do it , no matter how broad the grant of Depression era authority .
But , in the Fed 's legal defense , maybe , just maybe , the settled expectations are different here , based on the government 's takeovers of Fannie and Freddie , and the pleading by AIG for government involvement .
Does the very fact that the insurer hoped for Fed action suggest that the Fed could act ?
Hmmm .
The other defense would be that emergencies are emergencies , and when that happens the rules go out the window , and hopefullly regular elections mean that the officials the people trust are dealing with the emergency .
Abraham Lincoln adopted that reasoning , and he won the Civil War .
I suspect we 're at the " anything goes in an emergency " stage of things .
But maybe reasonable minds could disagree .

I graduated Waterloo Engineering in 2007 .
I now work at the Canadian Space Agency on my Master ’s degree .
Some new co-op students have arrived , and among them is Steve , a fellow Waterloo student in second year Mechatronics .
He had a great little story for me .
First , some context .
The University of Waterloo ( UW ) is known as an engineering school , and tends to have an abundance of male students as a result .
In contrast , Wilfrid Laurier University ( WLU ) is known as an arts school , and tends to have an abudance of attractive women as a result .
The two schools are quite close together , perhaps a five minute walk from campus to campus .
It ’s September , and that means that a fresh new crop of students has arrived on both campuses , more than likely with parents in tow .
I can only imagine the face of a nervous father , dropping his little princess off where she ’ll live away from home for the first time , only to see this massive banner on an overpass above the biggest highway leading to both UW and WLU …
Poor bastards .
I hope your daughter did n’t blush .

A 40 - year - old woman stands in the middle of a footpath and bursts into tears after arriving with a convoy of refugees in the embattled Georgian enclave of South Ossetia .
" When the Russians arrived , we were so happy , and after they bombed them [ the Georgians ] , " said the woman called Meri , referring to the Russian assault and air raids on Georgia that forced Tbilisi to pull back its troops from South Ossetia .
She arrived at Java , about 20 kilometres from the main city of Tskhinvali , with a group of refugees , mostly women , escorted by Russian soldiers .
They escaped from the " horror " , the one word they all used to describe the scenes of attacks by Georgian troops , battling against Russian and Ossetian rebel forces over the past three days .
One woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a Georgian tank but it " fired on their car and they were all burned " to death , said Angela , who like all the refugees only gave her first name .
In another incident , a woman eight months pregnant and two family members fleeing from the city under attack were hit by tank fire and " nothing remained of them , " Angela said .
She saw the Georgian tanks roll into Tskhinvali , the soldiers shouting " Hail Saakashvili , " who is the president of Georgia .
" They destroyed the city , " added Inna , 33 , who said she could not understand how the Georgian troops " could do that to civilians . "
" You see your friend 's home burning and there 's nothing you can do .
You just watch and cry , it 's a genocide , " Inna said .
An old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing .
" My house is destroyed , " she said .
At Java , a refugee camp of tents is being set up in a stadium by the Russian Ministry of Emergency Services , Education Minister Zamira Giova said .
" Those who have relatives in North Ossetia can go on to there tomorrow [ Monday ] , " she said .
The local authorities are also preparing to send buses to Tskhinvali to pick up more refugees - 400 were expected to be evacuated Sunday , other refugee said .
Ms Giova said the authorities would " look for children and people who are hiding in basements . "
The Russian emergency services planned to send 15 ambulances to the South Ossetia 's self - proclaimed capital to evacuate some 50 wounded people holed up in the basement of a hospital destroyed in the fighting , said Vitali Slepushkin , a coordinator of Russian services .
Some 50 wounded have already been evacuated and taken across the border to the Russian city of Vladikavkaz .
But Inna said she did not want to be a refugee : she wanted to return to Tskhinvali .
" My brother forced me to leave today , " she explained .
" I 'm not afraid .
I want to clean myself up and return there to help my brother and my husband who are in the battle .
They need someone to help them . "
Georgian troops entered South Ossetia on Thursday seeking to regain control of the breakaway territory , but that sparked Russia 's military riposte .

Seize the Time !
An essay by Cynthia McKinney
September 19 , 2008
We the people must now seize the time !
We have always had the capability of determining our own destiny , but for various reasons , the people failed to elect the leaders who provided the correct political will .
There was always some corporate or private special interest that stood in the way of the public good .
And they always seemed to have the power of the purse to throw around and influence public opinion or our elected officials .
The very foundation of the U.S. economy is crumbling underneath our feet .
This represents a unique moment in U.S. history and we must now seize the time for self - determination -- for health care , education , ecological wisdom , justice , and all the policies that will make a difference in the lives of the people including an end to all wars , including the drug war !
The crisis was staved off for a time for some of our major finance engines when they were able to obtain bridge funding from certain sovereign wealth funds .
That option grows increasingly dim as The Federal Reserve is becoming the lender of last resort .
This means that the people are becoming the owners of the primary instruments of U.S. capital and finance .
This now means that the people have a say in how these instruments are to be used and what their priorities ought to be .
The people should now have more say in how their tax dollars are spent and what the priorities of government and the public sector must be .
We the people must now set our demands to ensure and promote the public good .
Now , as we ponder the importance of this moment to do good and serve the needs of the people , some politicians have already figured out their answer for us : win or steal the next election , prepare for more war , and leave it to others to try and figure out what to do next .
While banks are failing all around us and the U.S. taxpayer is drenched with news of billion - dollar bailouts for * selected * companies , the Congress , which has utterly failed in its twin responsibilities of setting policy and Executive Branch oversight , plans to adjourn instead of setting new policies ; lessening the impact of the economic freefall on innocent victims ; or stopping war , expansion of war , new war , and occupation .
In a dizzying turn of recent events , we have all witnessed the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage providers , investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns , and insurer American International Group ( AIG ) , and other companies .
So far , at least eleven banks have filed for bankruptcy this year .
The case of the AIG bailout is particularly curious as Merrill Lynch was denied taxpayer largesse .
I wonder if AIG was the selected company for bailout because of its relationship to the U.S. intelligence community and what others would discover if AIG 's books were opened in an audit .
The last person to get close to AIG and its shady operations was Eliott Spitzer .
But some more fundamental issues must be explored here , relating to the underlying assumptions that have guided U.S. political and economic activity , particularly over the last eight years .
The Bush Administration 's " anything goes , just do n't get caught " attitude has set the tone for what we are witnessing today .
To be sure these problems did n't start in January of 2001 , but they sure were allowed to accelerate during the George W. Bush Administration .
For example , what tone was set when the Administration shipped $ 12 billion to Paul Bremer 's provisional government in Iraq in cash on wooden pallets for Iraq reconstruction ?
No wonder $ 9 billion of it was " lost . "
What I 'm constantly reminded of is that the money did n't just vanish , somebody got it .
Now it 's up to us to find out who !
However , the Administration 's blatant disregard for good governance , the rule of law , standards of moral and ethical conduct , and even etiquette , when coupled with a laissez - faire , " go- along - to - get - along " attitude from Congress meant that no holes were barred and no hands were on the deck -- a sure prescription for disaster .
In my reading over the course of the last few years , I had to become somewhat conversant with the language of the new economy : bundled mortgages , securitization , SPEs , SIVs , derivatives .
But in addition to the old concepts that always seemed to be with us -- predatory lending , redlining , no affordable housing amid " the housing bubble , " -- it soon became clear that basically folks had figured out a way to make money off of a ticking time bomb .
Kind of like prisons for profit .
And even though the Enron scandal was supposed to have cleaned up a lot of this , unfortunately , even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regularly engaged in some of these practices and that 's why you and I own them today .
I believe it is true that the very foundations of the U.S. economy and conventional political behavior have been shaken .
Now is not the time for business as usual .
And although this is by no ways exhaustive , here are a few things that I think the Democratic - led Congress could work on now instead of adjourning :
1. enactment of a foreclosure moratorium now before the next phase of ARM interest rate increases take effect ;
2. elimination of all ARM mortgages and their renegotiation into 30 - or 40 - year loans ;
3. establishment of new mortgage lending practices to end predatory and discriminatory practices ;
4. establishment of criteria and construction goals for affordable housing ;
5. redefinition of credit and regulation of the credit industry so that discriminatory practices are completely eliminated ;
6. full funding for initiatives that eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in home ownership ;
7. recognition of shelter as a right according to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights to which the U.S. is a signatory so that no one sleeps on U.S. streets ;
8. full funding of a fund designed to cushion the job loss and provide for retraining of those at the bottom of the income scale as the economy transitions ;
9. close all tax loopholes and repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 % of income earners ;
10 . fairly tax corporations , denying federal subsidies to those who relocate jobs overseas repeal NAFTA .
And since the Congress plans to adjourn early and leave these problems to The Federal Reserve , The Federal Reserve should operate in the interests of the U.S. taxpayer and not the interests of the private , international bankers that it currently represents .
This , of course means that The Federal Reserve , too , must undergo a fundamental ownership and mission change .
This crisis does not have to be treated as merely a " market correction , " or the result of a few rotten apples in an otherwise pristine barrel .
This crisis truly represents the opportunity to introduce fundamental changes in the way the U.S. economy and its political stewards operate .
Responsible political leadership demands that the pain and suffering being experienced by the innocent today not be revisited upon them or the next generation tomorrow .
But sadly , instead of affirmative action being taken in this direction , the Bush Administration ratchets up the drumbeat for war , Republican Party operatives busily remove duly - registered voters from the voter rolls , and our elected leaders in the Congress go home to campaign while leaving all of us to fend for ourselves .
For the Administration and the Democrat - led Congress , I declare : MISSION UNACCOMPLISHED .
For the public whose moment this is , I say : Power to the People !

Macho Programming
Back before I completely lost interest in debates about programming topics , I remember reading an online discussion that went like this :
Raving Zealot : Garbage collection is FASTER than manual memory management !
Experienced Programmer :
You mean that garbage collection is faster than using malloc and free to manage a heap .
You can use pools and static allocation , and they 'll be faster and more predictable than garbage collection .
Raving Zealot :
You need to get over your attitude that programming is a MACHO and RECKLESS endeavor !
If you use a garbage collected language , NOTHING can go wrong .
You 're PROTECTED from error , and not reliant on your MACHONESS .
What struck me about this argument , besides that people actually argue about such things , is how many other respected activities do n't have anywhere near the same level of paranoia about protection from mistakes .
On the guitar -- or any musical instrument -- you can play any note at any time , even if it 's out of key or , more fundamentally , not played correctly ( wrong finger placement or pressure or accidentally muting the string ) .
And people play instruments live , in - concert in front of thousands of people this way , knowing that the solo is improvised in Dorian E , and there 's no physical barrier preventing a finger from hitting notes that are n't in that mode .
The same goes for sculpting , or painting , or carpentry ... almost anything that requires skill .
( And building chickadee houses is n't universally considered a MACHO hobby , even though it involves the use of POWER TOOLS which can LOP OFF FINGERS . )
In these activities , mistakes are usually obvious and immediate : you played the wrong note , you cut a board to the wrong length , there 's blood everywhere .
In macho programming , a mistake can be silent , only coming to light when there 's a crash in another part of the code -- even days later -- or when the database gets corrupted .
Stupidly trivial code can cause this , like :
array [ index ] = true ;
when index is - 1 .
And yet with this incredible potential for error , people still build operating systems and giant applications and massively multiplayer games in C and C ++.
Clearly there 's a lot of machoness out there , or it 's simply that time and debugging and testing -- and the acceptance that there will be bugs -- can overcome what appear to be technical impossibilities .
It 's hand - rolling matrix multiplication code for a custom digital signal processor vs. " my professor told me that assembly language is impossible for humans to use . "
Would I prefer to ditch all high - level improvements , in exchange for programming being the technical equivalent of rock climbing ?
NO !
You can romanticize it all you want , but when I wrote 8 - bit games I clearly remember thinking how much more pleasant it was to tinker in BASIC than to spend hours coding up some crazy 6502 code that would lock - up the entire computer time after time ( the bug would be that changing a loop index from 120 to 130 made it initially be negative , so the loop would end after one iteration , or some other obscurity ) .
What both this retro example and the C one - liner have in common is that the core difficulty stems less from the language itself than because code is being turned loose directly on hardware , so crashes are really crashes , and the whole illusion that your source code is actually the program being executed disappears .
Problems are debugged at the hardware level , with data breakpoints and trapped CPU exceptions and protected memory pages ( this is how debuggers work ) .
It 's a project suitable as part of a single semester undergraduate class to write an interpreter for your favorite low - level language .
Write it in Scheme or Erlang or Scala .
Use symbolic addresses , not a big array of integers , to represent memory .
Keep track of address offsets , instead of doing the actual math .
Have functions return lists of memory addresses that have been read from or modified .
Keep everything super simple and clean .
The goal is to be able to enter expressions or functions and see how they behave , which is a whole lot nicer than tripping address exceptions .
All of a sudden , even hardcore machine code is n't nearly so scary .
Write a dangerous function , get back a symbolic representation of what it did .
Mistakes are now simply wrong notes , provided you keep your functions small .
It 's still not easy , but macho has become safe .

SQLt /SQL :: Translator / SQLFairy is a great tool to create ER diagrams from SQL :
SQL :: Translator is a group of Perl modules that manipulate structured data definitions ( mostly database schemas ) in interesting ways , such as converting among different dialects of CREATE syntax ( e.g. , MySQL - to - Oracle ) , visualizations of schemas ( pseudo - ER diagrams : GraphViz or GD ) , automatic code generation ( using Class : : DBI ) , converting non-RDBMS files to SQL schemas ( xSV text files , Excel spreadsheets ) , serializing parsed schemas ( via Storable , YAML and XML ) , creating documentation ( HTML and POD ) , and more .
In Ubuntu Linux and Debian Linux , this can be obtained by installing SQLFairy :
apt - get install sqlfairy
This is quite useful if you follow a bottom - up approach : create the SQL first , and then create ER diagrams – although this might not be a common development method , it does have its uses , and some of us like it 🙂
So for instance , say you have a MySQL schema named sample.sql .
To create a ER diagram with color , named sample_schema.png , run the following in the command line :
sqlt - diagram -d=MySQL -o=sample_schema.png sample.sql -- color
where -d=MySQL specified the MySQL driver .
Other available drivers can be obtained by :
sqlt -l
Additionally , sqlt can also be used to convert between various database schemas as well .
Italian energy plan to also include renewables
[ social_buttons ]
Italy ’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced the introduction of “ a national energy plan ” on Saturday , including a return to nuclear power .
A month after the conservatives and their embattled leader returned to power back in April , the Italian government said it would begin building nuclear power stations to solve the country ’s dependence on foreign oil and gas supplies .
“ A new national energy plan will be presented in spring , which will be based on three points : diversification of supplies , the start of nuclear energy production and development of renewable and alternative energy , ” Berlusconi said at the opening ceremony of a new liquefied natural gas terminal .
The decision to return to nuclear would reverse a 20 - year ban on nuclear power stemming from a 1987 referendum passed in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , a year earlier .
The country ’s four nuclear plants operating at the time were shut down , and have not produced any power since .
A return to nuclear power would be long , complicated , and undoubtedly contentious .
Under Italian law , local authorities have a final say in approval of any big industrial project .
Even proponents of a return to nuclear power say it would be extremely difficult to swing public opinion and find sites for new plants and waste storage .
“ We say ‘ No ’ to nuclear … to construction of plants which would be outdated by the time they are built … the plants which are not secure and create waste problems , ” said Marcello Saponaro , the head of Greens in the northern region of Lombardy .
But the political environment in Italy may be ripe for nuclear as the country is facing skyrocketing energy prices .
Berlusconi said the new energy plan will lower the cost of electricity for Italian consumers , which are among the highest in Europe .
Very little of Italy ’s electricity is generated domestically ; the country imports 87 percent of its energy , most of which come in the form of fossil fuels .
Renewables account for about 15 - 17 percent of Italy ’s energy mix , and most of that comes from hydroelectric power .

According to CNN , the city of Denver is purchasing tons of high - tech weapons to use on unruly DNC protesters , which may include goo - guns that shoot an impossible - to - escape sticky film , sonic ray guns that produce a blood - curdling blast of noise , and a microwave device that can make you feel like your skin is burning .
The ACLU is suing the city to see what weapons will end up in the final arsenal , but if you ’re going to the Denver , be prepared ; this could make the 1968 DNC look like a picnic .

One of the problems I had to fight for a long time when using TeX over the years was that I often found a snippet on the net that was supposed to do exactly what I ’ve been looking for , but when I then tried to use it at least one .sty or some other kind of package was missing and it was once again Google - time .
When I switched to the fruity side of computing MacPorts installed TeXLive for me .
TeXLive is a TeX distribution by the TUG , the TeX User Groups , that ’s at least according to the German news - site heise .
de the biggest TeX distribution out there .
So 2 days ago the TUG released this year ’s edition of the distribution that comes with tons of new stuff , most notably a package manager ( tlmgr ) that lets you easily add , remove and update TeX packages .
People using MiKTeX should know this whole idea of actually managing TeX packages ;-)
For a complete listing of additions , checkout the relevant page in the docs .
And perhaps , while working on my master thesis , I can finally dig a little deeper into TeX without having to google for packages every couple of seconds thanks to TeXLive :-)

One of my favorite Southern things is what we call a Three - B night : bullets , beer and barbecue .
Of course , the beer and the barbecue follow the shooting of the bullets at the gun range .
Alcohol and gunpowder are a dangerous mix .
But Three - B is a social activity I highly recommend .
Good friends , a little target shooting and then a repast of spicy barbecue and cold beer is a fine , fine way to spend an evening .
God , I love the South so much I ca n’t stand it .
I ’ve been thinking that it would n’t be a bad idea to get one of those recreational vehicles and then just travel from one bluegrass festival to the next .
Traveling around the South is like a never - ending feast .
It ’s jammed full of beauty and interesting folks .
And down South there ’s always a gun range not too far away — or , for that matter , a gun .
I ’ve no doubt that God created the South for the sole purpose of the good life , and it ’s too bad that the devil came along and made us all have to waste so much time working .
You do remember , I hope , that when that foolish Eve listened to the snake and the even more foolish Adam listened to Eve , the punishment was that they would have to go to work .
And us , too .
In the morning , when you ’re hauling yourself out of bed to go to work , just remember that it is Eve ’s fault .
She had paradise , but , being the mother of all women , she was , of course , not quite satisfied .
It ’s one of those traits that is both annoying and charming at the same time .
I knew a fellow once whose wife was like that .
He would buy a house and live there for no more than two years before his wife would be on him to move .
Fortunately , he ran some waterfront bars and a bail - bond business and made a good bit of money .
But I swear , I think the poor man must have bought six houses and moved seven times in the same city .
A divorce would have been cheaper .
At any rate , true Southerners resist the curse of work as much as they can .
I had some kin who just quit whatever job they had when the hunting season opened .
I guess they figured they could always find another job , but a day missed hunting is a day missed forever .
A friend of mine in Louisiana who works on the offshore oil rigs said that the foreman , a fellow from Ohio , came up one morning and said :
" You guys could be earning all the overtime you want .
We ’ll let you work 60 or 70 hours .
How come you guys only work 32 hours a week ? "
" Cause , " my friend replied , " we ca n’t get by on 24 . "
If you ’ve ever been to Cajun Country in Louisiana , you ’ll understand .
Those are people who know how to enjoy life .
They are famous eaters .
One of my favorite lines of history is the remark of a Virginia lady about the 10th Louisiana Regiment , which fought for Marse Robert in the War of Northern Aggression .
" The 10th Louisiana , " she said , " eats everything in its path . "
A more contemporary story some folks say is true is one in which two Cajuns , Mr. Hebert ( pronounced " Abear " ) and Mr. Quibideaux , spied a flying saucer land in a swamp .
The ramp came down , and a little green man walked out .
" What ’s that ? " inquired Hebert .
" I do n’t know , " said Quibideaux , " but get the rice started . "
Well , actually that is n’t a true story , but it is a good example of Cajun humor .
I have to remind myself that folks up North have some fantastical ideas about the South due to those Hollywood writers who snort coke and love stereotypes .
We are really the most normal people on earth , and as Hodding Carter once said , we will be polite right up to the point we get mad enough to kill you .

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- John McCain said Tuesday his vice presidential vetting process was thorough , as his campaign tried to calm concern that more surprises about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin were coming .
Sen .
John McCain says his team 's vetting of Sarah Palin was " completely through . "
" My vetting process was completely thorough , and I 'm thankful for the results , " the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said during a stop at a fire station in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
The McCain campaign said it was aware in advance of two items it revealed on Monday : Palin 's 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , is about five months pregnant and Palin 's husband , Todd , had a DUI conviction 22 years ago .
A source intimately involved in the vetting process of McCain 's choice for vice president called CNN to give an account of Palin 's background check .
This official said a 25 - person team , led by Washington attorney A.B. Culvahouse , started by compiling reports on 20 top vice presidential contenders , using only public documents like disclosure forms , public records , newspaper articles and interview transcripts .
That information was eventually presented to McCain , and to top campaign advisers Mark Salter , Steve Schmidt , Charlie Black and Rick Davis -- the only four aides involved in the highly secretive process .
Once McCain and those aides narrowed the choices to a short list , Palin and other contenders were contacted and asked for documents , including a credit check , tax returns and additional financial disclosure forms .
Watch Cafferty ask if Palin was sufficiently vetted »
The official told CNN that all of those on the short list -- including Palin -- were asked to answer 70 " intrusive " questions , including " Have you ever paid for sex ? " and " Have you ever been fairly or unfairly accused of sexual harassment ? "
The questions were also described as some basic queries now asked of presidential nominees , like whether they ever hired illegal workers or neglected to pay taxes for nannies .
In one of her answers , Palin told McCain aides about her husband 's DUI arrest 22 years ago .
Then Culvahouse , along with a few associates , interviewed Palin for three hours .
During that interview , she revealed her teenage daughter 's pregnancy -- and was warned it would become public if she were picked .
Watch analysts debate the effect of Bristol 's pregnancy »
" She said she 'd have those conversations with her daughter , " the source said .
From the start of the vetting process , one red flag was a state investigation into whether Palin improperly dismissed Alaska 's Public Safety Commissioner for not firing her ex-brother - in - law .
CNN was told that McCain investigators spent considerable time looking into the so - called " Troopergate " affair -- interviewing Palin 's lawyer and quietly talking to others involved -- and decided the facts were on her side .
Watch how ' Troopergate ' unfolded in Alaska »
The source said that aside from interviewing some of the figures involved in Troopergate , the vetters did not talk to character witnesses in Alaska .
The campaign also did not look at news articles about Palin from the newspaper in her hometown of Basilar , Alaska , because it is kept on microfilm and was hard to view without compromising their secrecy .
Sources told CNN that Culvahouse , one of Washington 's widely respected lawyers , was called by McCain one last time before McCain officially asked Palin to join him on the Republican ticket .
McCain asked Culvahouse if , based on what he unearthed , he was confident the little - known Alaska governor 's background would withstand scrutiny .
Culvahouse gave McCain a confident go - ahead , the sources said .
But it is unclear whether Culvahouse gave McCain any political advice on whether Palin was a qualified or wise choice , or left that to the small group of political advisers involved .
Watch a discussion of the ' Palin effect ' »
The McCain camp would not reveal precisely when the vetting process took place , how long it took or who else was vetted .
iReport.com : What do you think of Sarah Palin ?
close to independent Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney told CNN they were put through at least the first stage of short list vetting .
McCain met Palin in person once , at a National Governors Association meeting in February 2008 , and spoke with her by phone on another occasion two days before bringing her to Arizona to offer her a spot on the GOP ticket .

Editors note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
For the past 18 months , CNN 's Soledad O'Brien has been working on " CNN Presents : Black in America " which airs July 23 and 24 , at 9 p.m. ET .
Leah Wells , center , says she and Rosalyn Wilson , left , and EvaJoyce Woullard were unjustly detained for shoplifting .
( CNN ) -- For Atlanta native Leah Wells , it 's the humiliation she remembers most .
Not long ago , Wells sent me a note and forwarded a letter she had just mailed to Glenn Murphy , chairman and CEO of Gap Inc .
The letter detailed what happened when Wells and two girlfriends decided to ditch the gym during an office lunch break and do some " power - shopping " instead .
The three young women , all in their 20s and all black , ended up detained on suspicion of shoplifting .
" We were dressed professionally , " Wells told me .
" It was casual Friday .
We had on dresses and casual office wear .
We were racially profiled .
It was as simple as that . "
At about 1:15 p.m. , mall security contacted Gwinnett County police saying there was a group involved in shoplifting .
The police department says four officers arrived at the mall about 10 minutes later , and security pointed out Wells and her two friends as they walked away from the Old Navy store .
Old Navy is owned by GAP .
The officers asked the three to return to the store .
Wells says six officers were involved , not four , and that she and her friends were detained for " about an hour and a half " ; the police say it was 29 minutes .
In her letter to Murphy , the GAP CEO , Wells describes enduring " disdainful stares from the mothers and grandmothers and children entering the store . "
Black in America
In the next installment of CNN's Black in America series , Soledad O'Brien examines the successes , struggles and complex issues faced by black men , women and families , 40 years after the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Watch July 23 and 24 , at 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Police found no stolen merchandise on Wells or her friends .
But Wells says neither the police nor the store managers bothered to apologize .
Gwinnett Police say their officers were responding to a call and that the three women detained had thanked the officers for looking into the allegations thoroughly .
The fact remains that Wells and her friends were wrongly detained .
" No matter your education , your status or profession , some still only see the color of your skin , " Wells wrote two months after the event .
Leah Wells tells me she is " coming to an understanding " with GAP .
When I contacted GAP myself , a spokesperson told me that an internal investigation led to the firing of a manager .
Later the spokesperson e-mailed this statement : " We realize it 's probably too late .
We regret that we did not apologize for what these ladies experienced at our store , and this goes against everything we stand for as a company . "
Wells has decided to not only get mad but get active , writing and talking about what happened to her and her friends on a day they just set out to do some shopping .
Sad to say , but it 's a common refrain from black people in this country .
All of us know someone who has , or have ourselves , been stopped for no apparent reason while driving or been searched for fitting a description .
It happened to my brother Orestes .
A Harvard medical student at the time , he was visiting a friend in Brooklyn , New York , when he was stopped and searched by officers late one night .
He " fit the profile " of a robbery suspect .
They dumped his belongings in the street and made him lie face - down .
What infuriated him was that no apology ever followed when it became clear the cops got it wrong .
It seemed no one felt that one was owed .
My brother was seething when he told me the story .
It happens all the time .
And it happens across the geographic and socioeconomic spectrum : rich , poor and in between .
What surprised me most often during our production of " Black in America " were the universal stories of blacks followed or profiled .
It was shocking to me .

So many parents told me of sitting down with their sons starting at 12 years old to tell them what to do if pulled over by the police so as not to get shot .
I do n't imagine many white parents even think such a conversation is necessary with their teenage sons .
We 've spent the past 18 months trying to accurately tell the story of black people in this country , a story rarely told with the depth and fullness it requires .
Black people are seen frequently as rappers and " ballers " and sometimes exceptional , like Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
But coverage of the vast black middle class is nearly nonexistent .
Watch what blacks have to say about the documentary »
What 's the impact of that on America ?
What 's the impact of that on young black kids who do n't see themselves in mainstream media associated with academic achievement , success , hard work ?
It 's hard to know , but it can not be good .
I 'm the product of a white father who 's Australian and a black mother who 's Cuban .
They married in the United States in 1958 but had to leave their neighborhood of Baltimore , Maryland , because interracial marriage was illegal in that state .
By the time my little brother Orestes was born in 1967 -- the sixth O'Brien child -- the Supreme Court finally changed the law and lifted the ban on interracial marriage .
When I tell that story in speeches , older folks in the audience nod their heads while younger ones gasp .
It was illegal for my parents to marry , and it was n't all that long ago .
Black and white people need to talk about our shared history -- policies that have held some people back , opportunities that some have not sought .
My sense is the time is right for this dialogue on race .
With a black man running for president Americans are talking about race every day .

Katie Couric , in a segment to air tonight , asks Palin about her joke that she ’s been listening to Joe Biden ’s speeches since second grade , and whether that is n’t an odd thing to say given her own running mate ’s age :
“ Oh no , it ’s nothing negative at all .
He ’s got a lot of experience and just stating the fact there , that we ’ve been hearing his speeches for all these years .
So he ’s got a tremendous amount of experience and , you know , I ’m the new energy , the new face , the new ideas and he ’s got the experience based on many many years in the Senate and voters are gonna have a choice there of what it is that they want in these next four years . ”
There were a lot of buzz recently about Sproutcore and Objective - C , a desktop architecture and language from the Apple platform that are adapted ( or ported ) to the JavaScript world .
There is one great idea in Cocoa ( built using Objective - C ) : yes it ’s MVC but I want to talk about the Key - Value Observer .
It offers a great abstraction for creating RIA from my point of view , but let ’s start at the beginning .
aHtmlElement.onclick = function ( ) { } formerly DOM level 0 is how you can handle native events in a very simple manner .
I reminds me the C# delegate s ( that are using the += operator thus ) .
Very simple and useful ( but only one at the time , so very restrictive ) .
DOM level 1 introduces the addEventListener ( or attachEvent for MSIE ) .
I ’m sure that the Java - guys will reminds the java.util .
EventListener that you are using everywhere in any AWT / Swing application .
The main difference is that JavaScript works at the function level and not object one .
Java is not a functional languae .
Then some JavaScript framework / libraries offers a different kind of handling events .
YUI , Dojo or jQuery have interesting ones .
The great advantages of messages passing over function calls is that you separate the producer from the consumer ( decoupling ) and become more robust ; if no one care about a message , it ’s simply lost , but if something linke ten differents processes cares about it , they will for sure get it .
If you made a little bit of Qt® , Dojo have the connect method : dojo.connect ( myObject , " onclick " , function ( ) {} ) ;
It ’s still DOM level 0 method overloading , not very clean but simple .
It has the advantage to works with non-native events ( or with any functions call in that particular case ) .
YUI pandora box contains the CustomEvent , a very simple implementation of the Gang of Four ( GoF ) Observer pattern .
It ’s used in more or less in every single YUI widget .
var event = new YAHOO.util.CustomEvent ( " my type " ) ; event.subscribe(function( type , data ) { alert ( type + " : " +data ) } ) ; event. fire ( " Hello World ! " ) ;
j Query has also a custom event handling system included .
It ’s very powerful and kind of no so documented .
It reminds me the GObject signal used by GTK .
$ ( document ) .
bind ( " my - type " , function ( event , data ) { alert ( event.type + " : " + data ) ; } ) . triggerHandler ( " my - type " , [ " Hello World ! " ] ) ;
I ’d like to see a centralized system for messaging passing .
I toke example on how Bayeux is made , some XMPP parts too , and wrote a pubsub class .
It has the advantage that you do n’t have to keep track of the object that manages the events and can subscribe to meta- channels ( using the star * ) .
new pubsub ( ) . subscribe ( " / test / first " , function ( data ) { alert ( " first got : " + data ) ; } ) . subscribe ( " / test/ second " , function ( data ) { alert ( " second got : " + data ) ; } ) . subscribe ( " / test /* " , function ( data ) { alert ( " a message has been sent : " + data ) ; } ) . publish ( " / test / first " , [ 1 ] ) . publish ( " /test/second " , [ 2 ] ) . publish ( " / test / third " , [ 3 ] ) ;
Now , what are offering Sproutcore or Objective - J to JavaScript ?
Key - Value Observer .
That means you are n’t creating specific custom events , or channels but will observe objects ’ values directly .
It ’s a very simple to do , the only trade off is to access them with getters and setters only ( which sucks ) .
var label = function ( name , value ) { this .name = name| | " " ; this.value = value|| " " ; } ; // label inherits from observable label .
prototype = new observable ( ) ; label.constructor = label ; // you can also chain the followings .
var my_label = new label ( " my label " ) ; my_label.observe ( " value " , function ( value ) { alert ( this .
name + " is : " + value ) ; } ) ; my_label.set ( " value " , " Hello World ! " ) ;
With all those tools , it ’s very easy to imagine a complex rich internet application made of independent modules .
Those modules do n’t know each other directly , gets notified when something they are looking for happens .
You can transform it into a MVC - like architecture with one kind of module for each type ; displaying with HTML / CSS , reacting to HTML events , reacting to asynchronous events like XHR , storing data information .
All those issues have been handled by desktop software for years .
I think it ’s time to learn from it and get the best in terms of simplicity , reliability and strength .
It ’s also a lot easier to unit test small modules or to create brilliant mash - ups upon them .
Being unobtrusive is maybe still the first step that many JavaScript applications have to face ( with event delegation all over the place ) , the second one could be to not act as spaghetti code with as few cross references as possible .
Rich internet application is becoming serious , so make sure it ’s also as kind as possible to everyone , with ARIA for example .
The past week , by any standard , has been an extraordinary one for America ’s economy and its financial system .
Merrill Lynch , which was founded during Woodrow Wilson ’s administration , agreed to be bought for a bargain - basement price , while Lehman Brothers , which dates back to John Tyler ’s presidency , simply collapsed .
By the end of the week , the federal government was preparing to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in securities that no bank wanted .
It appears to be the government ’s biggest fiscal intervention since the Great Depression , designed to get the financial markets working again and keep a credit freeze from sending the economy into a deep recession .
The announcement of the plan changed the mood on Wall Street and sent stocks soaring at the end of the week .
But even if the economy avoids a tailspin , the next couple of years are n’t likely to feel especially good .
It ’s been a long period of excess , and the hangover could be long , as well .
For the near future , the most likely outcome remains slow economic growth , scant income gains for most workers and , for investors , disappointing returns from stocks and real estate .
If consumers begin to cut back on their debt - fueled spending things could get worse .
On Friday morning , the economists at Lehman Brothers sent out their usual weekly roundup of the news , but it came this time with a short , italicized note , explaining that the report would be the final one to appear under the Lehman banner .
That bit of understatement preceded some more : “ This episode of financial crisis , ” Lehman ’s economists explained , “ appears to be much deeper and more serious than we and most observers thought it likely to be .
And it is by no means clear that it is over . ”
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A 22 - year - old woman in the United States is publicly auctioning her virginity to pay for her college education , sparking a heated online debate about sex and morality .
Teen girls are seen in a file photo .

The student from San Diego , California , who is using the pseudonym Natalie Dylan for “ safety reasons , ” said she had no moral dilemma with her decision and found it “ empowering ” .
But few bloggers sided with her and some suspected her intentions .
“ I do n’t think auctioning my virginity will solve all my problems , ” she told celebrity television show The Insider on Wednesday .
“ But it will create some financial stability .
I ’m ready for the controversy , I know it will come along .
I ’m ready to do this . ”
“ We live in a capitalist society .
Why should n’t I be allowed to capitalize on my virginity ? ” she added .
The woman , who has earned a bachelor degree in women ’s studies and now wants to start a master ’s degree in marriage and family therapy , is hoping the bidding will hit $ 1 million .
The online auction site eBay turned her down so the auction will take place at a Nevada brothel , the Moonlite Bunny Ranch , where her sister is working to pay off her college debts .
The date for the auction was not immediately available .
In a flurry of media interviews and appearances , she admitted that her mother , a fourth grade teacher , does not agree with her decision .
Many on the Internet also disapprove .
“ Maybe this is the conservative in me coming out , but this seems so wrong , ” wrote one blogger , Mike .
“ Is n’t this prostitution ? ”
“ I must say I feel sad for the future of our society , ” said Mike from Montclair State University in New Jersey .
“ What disgusts me about this whole thing is the fact that she is promoting it so heavily .
It seems less about having some guy pay for her virginity and more about trying to get her 15 minutes and a reality show , ” said a blogger called “ Ent Lawyer ” .
She does have her supporters -- not surprisingly Dennis Hof , owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch .
“ I think it ’s a tremendous idea .
Why lose it to some guy in the backseat of a Toyota when you can pay for your education ? ” he told reporters .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- T. Boone Pickens on Tuesday laid out his " Pickens Plan " to reduce American dependence on foreign oil , with the target of cutting demand by more than a third in the next two years .
The colorful Texas billionaire , a former corporate raider and oil man turned hedge - fund manager , said wind power and natural gas could take up the slack as a viable alternative to spending $ 700 billion a year for foreign oil .
Pickens is building a mammoth wind farm in Sweetwater , Texas , and also launched Clean Energy Fuels CLNE , +5.28 % , a company that runs natural - gas filling stations for fleet vehicles .
Pickens also said he 's lobbying to have the Texas - sized price tag for foreign oil become a central theme of the presidential election between Sens.
Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and John McCain , R - Ariz .
" Neither presidential candidate is talking about solving the oil problem , " Pickens told USA Today .
" So we 're going to make 'em talk about it . "
Pickens set plans to launch a TV and Internet campaign behind his proposal .
He noted that President Nixon said in 1970 that the U.S. was importing 20 % of its oil and vowed to bring that down to zero by 1980 .
" That did n't happen , " Pickens said .
" It went to 42 % in 1991 with the Gulf War .
It 's just under 70 % now .
Where do you think we 're going to be in 10 years when our economy is busted and we 're importing 80 % of our oil ? "
Oil trader Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading Corp . the plan could backfire by causing the U.S. to become a bigger importer of natural gas , but he praised the billionaire for focusing the spotlight on critical energy issues .

In case you missed the brouhaha on Monday , United Airlines ' stock dropped from $ 12.50 to $ 3 per share in the matter of 15 minutes because of an Internet bot -- and not just any old Internet bot -- the king of all bots , the Google News crawler .
The circumstances that led up the event were confusing , fingers were pointed every which way , and conspiracy theorists cried stock manipulation .
Now that dust has settled somewhat , the pieces of the puzzle have started to come together in this odd series of events .
Apparently the origins of this butterfly effect date back to December 10 , 2002 , when the Chicago Tribune published a story titled , " UAL Files For Bankruptcy , " about United Airlines ' 2002 bankruptcy filing .
The story made its way into the online searchable database of the Sun Sentinel , where it remained available ever since .
Sometime between 1:00 a.m. and 1:36 a.m. EDT on Sunday , September 7 , 2008 , a link to this old article appeared under the " Popular Stories Business : Most Viewed " section of the Sun Sentinel 's site 's business section .
This section is dynamically updated based on the traffic volume of stories being viewed .
The Wall Street Journal reports that this old story resurfaced when a " single late - night " visitor viewed the story on the site during a " low - traffic period .
" At 1:36 a.m. EDT , the Google crawler discovered the new link on the Sun Sentinel site and noted that the link was not there previously when the Googlebot had last crawled the site 19 minutes earlier .
The crawler interpreted this as a new link and followed the link to the story .
The Tribune states that " no new story was published and the old story was not re-published -- a link to the old story was merely provided . "
Unfortunately , there was no date on the story itself , so the Googlebot used the only date it could find on the page as the context for the article , which was the actual date , September 7 , 2008 , as it appeared in the header of the page for the Sun Sentinel site ( see the image to the left ) .
Google states that " the article was indexed and then available through Google News search , but was not shown on our headlines pages .
" At some point between Sunday morning and Monday morning , the story had been picked up by the investment and advisory research firm , Income Securities Advisors Inc. , and then passed on to the Bloomberg financial - news service .
The Silicon Alley Insider reports that " a non-detail - oriented securities analyst summarized the article ( apparently without reading it first ) and uploaded the summary to Bloomberg .
" The Wall Street Journal reports that at about 10:45 a.m. EDT on Monday , September 8 , " a headline from the outdated report flashed across Bloomberg screens . "
At which point , " algorithmic trading mechanisms , which buy and sell stocks based on news headlines and earnings data , " started selling off the United Airlines stock on the mistaken assumption that the company had just filed for bankruptcy .
United 's stock plummeted over the course of the next 15 minutes until NASDAQ halted trading of the stock and United issued a statement saying that the rumors of its recent bankruptcy were greatly exaggerated .
The Wall Street Journal adds that " UAL 's stock price ended Tuesday 's session at $ 10.60 , down 2.8 % on the day and nearly 13 % off Monday 's open .
" Let 's recap ...
An automated system added an old link to a dynamic Web page .
An automated system detected the link as a new story and cataloged it as a current event .
Enter a human for the only part of this tale : an analyst picks up the story and passes it on , not realizing that it is old news .
Automated trading systems start a massive stock self off based on the old headline ... Call us doomsayers , but perhaps we 've just witnessed the birth of Skynet
( Part of an Exclusive WebEcoist Series on Amazing Trees , Plants , Forests and Flowers )
Most plants contain some level of toxins ( like alkaloids ) for defense .
After all , they ’re plants .
They ca n’t go anywhere .
Through millennia of trial and error , both animals and human beings have figured out which plants are safe , which are lethal , and which are somewhere in between .
For example , did you know that many grain - bearing plants contain a toxin known as lectins ?
And that the African staple , cassava , must be thoroughly boiled and soaked to separate it from its poisonous compound , cyanide ?
Even the humble lima bean has been bred to contain less cyanide .
Cherries , potatoes , peaches and apple seeds are all toxic – eat enough of the latter , in fact , and it will prove fatal .
Fortunately , artificial selection and cooking methods have all but eliminated the threat of toxins in everyday foods .
But you may be surprised to find out the incredibly lethal plants often hanging around the neighborhood park – or gracing your tabletop in the form of a centerpiece .
Castor Bean
Castor oil – for anyone unlucky enough to have been force spoon - fed this healthy yet disgusting fluid as a child , you may be surprised to learn that an ingredient in the castor bean just happens to be the deadliest plant poison on earth .
Literally .
Just one tiny castor bean is enough to kill an adult within a few minutes .
Castor oil is made safe ( but not palatable ) with the removable of the lethal compound known as ricin .
Amazingly , castor bean plants are grown for decorative purpose all over the place , particularly in California .
Rosary Pea
Image source unknown
As if a deadly legume were n’t bad enough , the pulses are n’t so benign , either .
The rosary pea may sound sweet and downright pious , but it ’s actually one of the most dangerous plants on earth .
Its seeds contain a particular lectin known as abrin ; if chewed and swallowed , death will follow shortly .
The seeds are easily identified with their distinctive bright red jacket and single black dot ( almost like a reverse Black Widow spider ) .
Abrin , which does its damage by inactivating ribosomes , is one of the most fatal toxins on earth .
After the vomiting , fever , nausea , drooling and G.I. dysfunction but before the bizarre hyperexcitability , edema and fatally convulsive seizures , renal tubular degeneration , bladder and retinal hemorrhage and widespread internal lesions typically develop .
Monkshood

Another unassuming plant – until you learn that the nickname for monkshood is actually “ wolfsbane ” .
That ’s owing to its once common use by farmers as a very effective wolf extermination tool .
( Not to be left out , fowl are also fatally affected by the related hensbane . )
The monkshood has the distinction of evidently being the bane of many creatures : its nicknames include womensbane and leopard ’s bane , though it is also known as blue rocket and devil ’s helmet .
It is technically part of the aconitum genus , of which there are more than 250 species .
The wolfsbane used to be a popular werewolf detection tool , by the way .
( Status was determined by holding the flower near the alleged ’s chin ; a yellow - tinged shadow on the skin was thought to be confirmation . )
Bushman ’s poison

The aptly - named Bushman ’s poison has famously been used by the Khoisan of South Africa to poison the tips of their arrows .
Though the plant produces pleasantly scented flowers and a tasty plum - like berry , the milky sap can be fatal .
The leaves , however , have medicinal properties .
Bushman ’s poison is also known as the wintersweet .
Angel ’s trumpet

What could be sweeter than the sound of an angel ’s trumpet ?
Perhaps the moaning agony of a trip that wo n’t end .
Related to petunias , tomatoes and potatoes , the angel ’s trumpet ( datura stramonium ) is a highly effective hallucinogen , but should not be consumed for recreational purposes as it can also be lethal .
According to wikipedia : “ The active ingredients are atropine , hyoscyamine and scopolamine which are classified as deliriants , or anticholinergics .
Due to the elevated risk of overdose in uninformed users , many hospitalizations , and some deaths , are reported from recreational use . ”
This common plant also goes by many other names , including jimson weed , stink weed , loco weed , and devil ’s snare .
One 18 - year - old who was house - sitting alone for his uncle recounts how he decided to prepare some angel ’s trumpet tea in curiosity and almost died ( a friend burst in on him convulsing on the bathroom floor and the authorities assumed he was on an acid trip ) .
Water hemlock

The poison hemlock famously drunk by Socrates is deadly , but the water hemlock is just as fatal .
According to the USDA , water hemlock or poison parsnip is “ the most violently toxic plant in North America ” .
The flowers and stems are safe , but the stalky roots contain chambers that are full of a deadly sap containing the convulsant cicutoxin .
Grand mal seizures are followed by a quick death if even a tiny amount is consumed .
English Yew

The English Yew , or taxus baccata ( “ taxus ” meaning toxin ) , is one of the deadliest trees on the planet .
The evergreen has a majestic and lush appearance and is fairly common in forests of Europe .
The yew is considered by scientists to be an odd and primitive conifer along with the monkey puzzle tree of Chile and Gingko biloba tree of Asia .
The yew has a rather sad history .
All parts – save for the flesh of the berries – are extremely poisonous .
Because the toxin causes convulsions and paralysis , it was once used as an abortifacient .
Apothecaries would dry and powder the leaves and stems and give desperate women minute amounts in the days before birth control was available .
Unfortunately , death would often result .
The yew has been quite popular throughout history for a number of medicinal purposes at extremely dilute levels , but it is deemed too dangerous in modern medical practice to be of use .
The yew ’s primary toxin is taxine , a cardiac depressant .
The yew acts rapidly and there is no antidote .
Snakeroot

Snakeroot is most dangerous for livestock such as cattle and sheep .
When cows consume the attractive fluffy white blooms and stems of the snakeroot , their milk and bones become saturated with the toxin tremetol and humans who consume these contaminated animal products will develop milk sickness ( tremetol poisoning ) .
In fact , milk sickness is what killed Abraham Lincoln ’s mother , Nancy Hanks .
Strychnine tree

Queen Cleopatra famously forced servants to commit suicide by means of a strychnine tree ’s fruit seeds , which contain lethal levels of strychnine and brucine , in order to determine if it would be the best means for her own suicide .
Upon seeing their agony ( which included painful vomiting , facial contortions and convulsions ) she opted for the apparently less horrific choice of the asp .
( The asp was actually an ancient term for any number of poisonous snakes , but experts think it was probably the cobra that Cleopatra chose to end her life . )
Moonseed

A otherworldly name and a plant with often fatal effects .
The seeds of this Eastern North American drupe ( stone fruit ) are extremely toxic to humans , although birds can eat them .
Moonseeds first cause paralysis but are fatal in larger doses and / or if treatment is not sought immediately .
Daphne

This plant , also called the spurge laurel , is a favorite ornamental shrub in Europe .
This drupe - producing evergreen with waxy , attractive foliage and gorgeously fragrant blooms is also highly toxic .
Consumption of the leaves or red or yellow fruits will first cause nausea and violent vomiting , followed by internal bleeding , coma and death .
The daphne plant is rich in the toxin mezerein .
Narcissus

Narcissists are toxic enough when they come in human form , but the plant for which they are named , also called the daffodil , is highly poisonous .
Poet ’s narcissus is more toxic than daffodil , but in both cases it is the bulbs , not the flower or stems , that cause illness .
One famous fatal case in Toulouse in the early 1900s occurred when the bulbs were mistaken for onions and consumed .
According to Botanical.com , “ Socrates called this plant the ‘ Chaplet of the infernal Gods , ’ because of its narcotic effects .
An extract of the bulbs , when applied to open wounds , has produced staggering , numbness of the whole nervous system and paralysis of the heart . ”
Yet , there are medicinal properties , and some cultures even believe they can cure baldness and serve as a potent aphrodisiac .
( Do not try at home . )
Oleander

The oleander is the most deadly plant in the world .
It is also tremendously popular as a decorative shrub .
Just one leaf can kill an adult , and fatal poisonings have resulted from minimal exposure to the twigs , blooms and berries .
The plant contains numerous toxins , including nerioside , oleandroside , saponins , and cardiac glycosides .
Though native to parts of the Mediterranean and Asia , it is now widely cultivated throughout the world .
Fatalities among horses and other livestock are common .
Once ingested , oleander goes to work simultaneously on the nervous system , the cardiovascular system , and the digestive tract .
Rhododendron

The toxic rhododendron , a stalky tree - like evergreen shrub with large , brilliant blooms , is famously seen throughout much of the Pacific Northwest and is the state flower of Washington .
Its relative , the popular garden shrub azalea , is also poisonous .
Both plants contain andromedatoxin , which can cause severe pain , lethargy , depression , vomiting and nausea , progressive paralysis , coma and eventual death .
All parts are deadly .
Choke cherry

Chokecherry , or wild cherry , is a North American plant that is known for its large sprays of tiny white flowers .
The cherries are small and not eaten .
The plant ’s woody stalks and leaves are full of hydrocyanic acid , which is fatal if consumed .
The poison affects the respiratory system , and rapid breathing , choking and asphyxiation result .
Nightshade

Also known as the devil ’s cherry , black cherry , great morel and belladonna , the nightshade is toxic from tip to top .
Containing atropine , a deadly alkaloid , those who ingest even a small amount of the plant will soon notice they have lost their voice .
Respiratory trouble and convulsions follow .
The plant is problematic because its cherries are so sweet and children are frequently attracted to the wild fruit .
Strangely , horses , birds , sheep , goats and pigs seem to be immune to the effects of nightshade .
Nightshade poisoning is treatable with an emetic if treatment is sought swiftly .
Plutarch spoke of armies being wiped out by nightshade , and legend has it that Macbeth ’s soldiers poisoned the invading Danes with wine made from the sweet fruit .
There are many , many more toxic plants , but these plants were chosen for inclusion in this post due to their their incredible characteristics .

There have been heaps of excitement about the official launch today of the Large Hadron Collider — whether it 's visions of protons flying around the world 's largest particle accelerator and creaming one another , or for some , the thought of those collisions creating world - destroying black holes .
But if the LHC works exactly the way many scientists hope , the results could be booooooring : finding the Higgs boson — the only particle that 's predicted by the current standard model of particle physics but not found — and perhaps a few more expected phenomena along the way .
However , nature works in weird ways , especially when you 're recreating energies last seen during the Big Bang .
So there 's a fighting chance that the LHC will be much more than a $ 10 billion validator :
It wo n't destroy the world , but it certainly could turn the physics world upside - down .
The 5^th Dimension ( and 6^th , and 7^th … )
So what would take the entire physics community by storm ?
How about any physical evidence that supports string theory ?
For all the hoopla , from amateur physicists who like the idea of universe made of rattling strings to Ph.D.s who understand the crazy calculations involved , no one has ever actually found any solid evidence for string theory .
So if you 're longing for a surprise , this could be it .
One of the central ideas of string theory is that there are other spatial dimensions than the three we 're used to ; many string theorists imagine a world with 10 of the things .
Extra dimensions tease the imagination and inspire science fiction , but dealing with them in reality often causes a lot of extra explaining , equation adjusting , and overall confusion .
The LHC could turn up evidence of extra dimensions — for example , if it shows gravitons slipping into other dimensions .
Or , if the LHC does create micro black holes ( which will quickly evaporate , not destroy the world ) , some physicists say that they could study the strange array of subatomic particles the black holes create , and use the decay rates of those particles to tell whether extra hidden dimensions exist .
Into the Dark Don't forget about our old friend dark matter .
Dark matter is so enigmatic — you can't see it , you can't taste it or feel it — that it 's bewitching .
This mysterious substance that makes up much more of the universe than regular matter may have the right " interaction strength " to show up in LHC experiments .
Some hypotheses suggest that the particles produced by collisions will decay into dark matter , which could then be studied .
But there 's no guarantee that dark matter can be " thermally created , " so it might not even show up at the LHC .
And unfortunately , since we do n't know what dark matter is made of or how to see it , the collider 's experiments could interact with it and we still might not even be able to spot it .
Physicists know it interacts only very weakly with other particles , so it would be difficult to tell dark matter from background noise .
But if the LHC creates any of the leading candidates to be dark matter — including super symmetic particles like neutralinos — that would be a good sign .
I Never Thought of That !
Some of these potential surprises would validate one model of particle physics over another , or maybe even lend some experimental credence to string theory .
But the truly exciting prospect would be the LHC finding something that nobody predicted .
Cosmic Variance 's post handicapping what will happen at the LHC gives this a 50 - 50 shot .
And if you want to jumpstart the physics world , this is the option for you .
Deathly Quiet
There is one possibility , however unlikely , that probably keeps the physicists most closely connected with the LHC up at night : that they will find nothing .
They will smash particles for years on end and find nothing major that they did n ' tknow before .
This will cause much consternation among particle physicists and much awkwardness for the LHC 's boosters .
Former CERN chief
Chris Llewellyn - Smith told The Telegraph that " it would be a little embarrassing for me , who spent years promoting the LHC and getting it funded . "
But , he says , it could also force scientists to totally rethink their view of the world , meaning finding nothing could eventually be the most exciting option .
Or maybe he 's just saying that to cover his ass in advance .
The God Particle
That brings us back to the LHC 's main stated goal — finding the Higgs boson itself .
Cosmic Variance 's post gives the CERN scientists a 95 percent chance of locating the " God particle , " a nickname the Higgs has earned because physicists hope it can start to unify the different forces of physics , and their explanations , into one theory of everything .
Particle physicists developing the standard model — the current theory explaining what we know about the makeup of the universe — have managed to find all the other particles they thought they would find , except the one that should give matter its mass : the Higgs .
We know matter has mass , so something must play that role .
Thus , the Higgs just should be there .
Surprises drive science , however , and that 's why Stephen Hawking is playing the off chance , betting against the LHC finding the Higgs .
Maybe he believes that .
Or maybe he 's just yearning for something to shake up the scientific community .
But if you 're hoping that means we 're about to have a physics revolution , I 've got some bad news :
Hawking is a notorious loser of bets .

The group America 's Voices put out this ad which exposes John McCain 's lying ad that says Obama killed immigration reform .
On Friday , Senator John McCain released what the New York Times editorial board blog has denounced as a " fraudulent " Spanish television ad , accusing Senator Obama and other Senate Democrats of " killing immigration reform . "
The Washington Post blog also weighed in with a scathing piece that argued , " Obama supported the bipartisan John McCain - Edward Kennedy efforts to enact such reforms and voted for their final proposal last year .
" Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) said in a statement released by the Obama campaign Friday .
" The man who said he would vote against his own immigration bill during the Republican presidential debates , who was unwilling to stand up to his own party when they approved an anti-immigrant platform , cannot attack Democrats on immigration in Spanish , while pandering to the extreme right Tancredo wing of the Republican Party in English
McCain seems to forget that it was Republicans and the psycho right wing blogs and talk shows that killed the immigration bill , not Obama .
McCain tries to say that he stands up to his party , but in a huge bill that he supported with Ted Kennedy , he backed down and caved .
No Maverick here , folks
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- Currents , tides and Tropical Storm Fay scattered the bodies over 30 miles along the Florida Keys in just a few days .
One of the four bodies found last week was floating off this stretch of Plantation Key .
The only thing the authorities in the Keys can say for sure is that four corpses were found floating offshore a week ago .
The men carried no identification , said the Monroe County Sheriff 's Office , which is investigating .
Authorities believe that the men started out together , perhaps on the same boat .
But it will not be easy to determine who they were , much less how they wound up in the water , where they may have spent three days .
Their bodies showed signs that sharks had fed on them .
Were they migrants who died trying to reach the United States ?
Victims of Tropical Storm Fay ?
Or the body count from a vendetta among drug smugglers ?
" The possibilities are pretty wide open at this point , " said Becky Herrin , the sheriff 's spokeswoman .
Mysterious doings are nothing new for the Florida Keys , an island chain at the state 's southern tip .
Illegal immigants from Cuba are regularly found waiting for a ride to Miami by the side of the 110 - mile - long road that links the southern tip of the United States with the mainland .
Hundreds of people each year are brought in by paid smugglers piloting go - fast boats .
Cubans who make it to dry land are permitted to stay because of a special immigration status granted to them under the so - called wet foot / dry foot policy .
Despite a crackdown on human smuggling , the Coast Guard says , the traffic is still busy .
Drug runners could be another connection .
Over the years , smuggling has became so commonplace that a watering hole on Cudjoe Key is named the " Square Grouper " - a term for bales of marijuana thrown overboard from traffickers ' boats and planes .
About 50 miles up the road , a lobsterman saw something floating on Thursday .
It was not a drug load but a body .
Deputies described the dead man as a white male , 5 feet , 10 inches tall and appearing stocky .
He had dark hair about 2 to 3 inches long .
Authorities said the man was wearing " a distinctive ring " on his left hand but are not releasing details .
" Detectives are using that information to weed out the missing person calls coming in , " Herrin said .
The next day , Friday , a family snorkeling along a reef near Indian Key came across a second body in the water , said Florida Fish and Wildlife Officer Bobby Dube .
The family called 911 from a cell phone in their boat .
The man authorities brought out of the water was described as about 5 feet , 7 inches tall , slim and having reddish - brown hair about 6 to 8 inches in length .
Hours later , two more men were found floating off the upper Keys .
One man was 5 feet , 7 inches .
The other was 5 feet , 10 inches , investigators said , with 4 - inch - long black hair .
He had what police described as a " distinctive tattoo . "
Even though the bodies were found along a 30 - mile stretch of the Keys , investigators believe that they may have been together initially .
Tropical Storm Fay 's winds were lashing the Keys around the same time the men were believed to have gone into the water , Herrin said .
The winds and resulting currents could have dispersed the bodies across the Keys .
For two days , the Coast Guard searched the waters off the Keys with a helicopter , a jet plane and boats , looking for other bodies , survivors , sunken boats or other signs that would tell them where the men came from , said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson .
They found nothing .
See where the bodies were found »
An autopsy by the Miami - Dade Medical Examiner 's office was unable to determine the men's ages or cause of death .
There were , however , no signs of trauma other than that inflicted by " marine life , " said a statement released by the sheriff 's office .
" There may have been more evidence , " Herrin said , " had there been more of the bodies . "
Investigators , she added , were able to get fingerprints from two of the bodies .
Those fingerprints are being run through law enforcement databases now , Herrin said .
Investigators are hopeful that someone who knows that the two men are missing will come forward .
" Somebody is missing them , " she said .
None of the calls from people who think they know the men has yielded a match .
If no - one comes forward to identify them , the bodies will be buried in graves that Florida reserves for the poor and unidentified .
Anyone with information about the four dead men is asked to call the Monroe County Sheriff 's Office at 305-289-2410 .

While most automakers have been struggling to sale their wares in the struggling US auto market , Honda has held its own -- and then some .
Honda 's robust selection of high volume cars has led to a 1.2 % sales increase in a market that is down a disastrous 11 % , and Honda expects things to continue next year , with new models like the redesigned Fit adding to already strong sales .
Industry - wide , though , Honda does n't expect a good 2009 .
Honda , much like Toyota , sees more of the same sullied sales for the rest of this year and next , predicting 2009 sales at a dismal 13.5 - 14 million units industry - wide due to financial struggles in the banking sector .
Honda sales VP John Mendel does n't think credit issues will affect the Japanese automaker , due to the typical Honda customer 's better than average credit .
Mendel says he has no problem with the $ 25 billion in loans sought by US automakers , but he would like to see some of the money go to the hundreds of suppliers that are also struggling to survive .
He was quick to point out that Honda did n't need any outside help , and he even went as far as to equate the loan with " getting in a bread line . "
That wo n't win him many friends in Detroit , but then again , Honda does n't have or need many allies in Motown anyway .

Sarah Palin Lies : Debunked
This blog was created to debunk the lies , distortions and personal attacks from Sarah Palin and the McCain campaign .
It 's time to hold them accountable for what they say .
Pelamis Wave Energy Converters as well ( you can see it doing its thing in the video after the break ) .
According to the patent application , that would allow the data centers to be moved closer to users to cut down on cross-country latency , and also make them ideally suited to more transient needs for computing power , such as after a natural disaster or when a military presence is needed .
Of course , there 's no evidence that Google has moved much beyond the sketch above just yet , but we certainly would n't put it past 'em to all of a sudden deploy a fleet of data centers when we least expect it .
[ Via The Earth Times , thanks Bob ]
The idea of floating data centers is hardly a new one , but Google looks like it might be set to take things a big step further than most , at least if one of its recent patent applications is any indication .
Apparently , Google not only plans to take advantage of the sea water for a cooling system , but generate power for the floating platforms using so - called
THE TAO OF THE DUDE
2. The History of Dudeism :
American Dudey
By Oliver Benjamin
The famous baseball - playing philosopher Yogi Berra had this to say about progress :  The future aint what it used to be !
That is , we all once believed that with the right know - how and a little elbow - grease , all human problems could soon be solved .
After many false starts , however , weve since awoken from this adolescent pipe - dream and recognized that the world is too complex for easy answers .
The future aint what it used to be .
For many of us , there is no longer any heaven , no utopia , no easy retirement at the end of the rainbow .
And frankly , were all a bit pissed off about it .
Modern - day dudes , however , never labored under such delusions .
The truly dudeish have always known that , like a giant tourist kiosk at a city square , life proclaims only  The time is now  and  You are here . 
All else are merely advertising brochures .
Contemporary dudeism in fact arose in opposition to the promises of modernism , industrialization and citification , and all the Faustian bargains they slyly purveyed .
The very term dude was originally coined to refer to a small group of well - heeled and educated east - coast Americans who , sensing that true life was elsewhere , traveled westward into the wilds in search of a more honest existence .
According to some accounts , the countryfolk they encountered called them dudes because of their duds  or finely - tailored clothing .
The word has been enshrined in the modern dude ranch  a place where city slickers today can engage in romanticized cowboy rituals .
The dude movement ( or dudement ) grew out of this anitmodern impulse , and has its earliest proponents in the American Transcendental movement of such writers as Ralph Waldo Emerson , Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman .
All three were champions of the idea that truth could be found not in artificial abstractions , but in simple living and individual contemplation of nature .
Of these three , however , only Whitman was a true dudeist .
Whereas the other two dabbled in dudeism only long enough to bolster their literary careers , Whitman truly hit the road  holding down a series of various jobs in scattered towns , all the while writing paeans to nature that smacked of sensuality , sex and voluntary idiocy .
Thus its only natural that Bill Clinton presented Monica Lewinsky with a copy of Whitmans Leaves of Grass , just prior to receiving his own series of various jobs .
Even presidents must prostrate to nature from time to time .
It is because of this hybrid lineage , both educated and earthy , that the modern meaning of the word dude harbors such contradictory connotations .
 Do I contradict myself ?  asked Whitman ,  Very well , then I contradict myself .
I am large .
I contain multitudes .
The categorical dude is both self - consciously cool and self - mockingly humble .
He discovers wisdom by the wayside and finds inspiration in the unexalted .
He is a man of many hats , which is why many see him as a fop .
But none of them stay on his head for long .
This is how The Dude can be both the cocky hero in Quincy Jones  1981 song  The Dude ( a scholar with the dollar you can plainly see ) as well as the sheepishly hedonistic hippie in 1997s The Big Lebowksi ( the laziest man in Los Angeles county .  )
As the latter says while being interrogated by a cranky tycoon ,  Im The Dude .
So that s what you call me .
That , or his dudeness  or duder or el duderino ,  if you re not into that whole brevity thing . 
Even at his most cocksure , The Dude strives to be accommodating .
Perhaps the most exemplary American dude of the 20th century was the Pulitzer prize - winning author Ray Stannard Baker , who not only wrote biographies of presidents and anti-racism tracts , but also secretly penned a series of popular books under the name David Grayson .
In his first installment ,  Adventures in Contentment  he tells how he abandoned the city and a life of ambition for more honest toil out in the countryside .
Despite his highbrow education , Grayson comes to discover that in many ways the life of a farmer is awash with profundity and satisfaction and offers lessons far greater than those found in the civilization he left behind .
In one telling scene that inversely mirrors The Dudes face - off with the rich old man in The Big Lebowski , farmer Grayson interrogates one of the local elite as to what benefit all his money has accrued him .
 You must prove to me ,  Grayson demands ,  that I can be more independent , more honest , more useful as a millionaire , and that I shall have better and truer friends !
To which the aristocrat evocatively replies ,  I dont believe youd have any truer friends . 
And herein lies the key to dudeism : the true dude is not in search of money , nor is he covetous of status or glory or fame .
He is only in search of that most important of all elixirs : friendship .
An acquisition , in fact , of which all those other assets serve to stand in the way .
When he abandons the city it is not so that he might find wheat fields or fresh air , but that he might find honest amigos , unsullied by the civilized mandates of ambition and competition .
Friendship for friendships sake .
Thus it came to be that David Graysons next book was entitled  Adventures in Friendship . 
His was a philosophy which all aspiring Ph. Dudes must take to heart .
At the end of The Big Lebowski , when The Dude has blown his chance at solving an unsolvable mystery , forfeited his claim to reward money that never was , and buried a friend caught in the crossfire , he falls back upon the one thing he has , and has always had : his best buddy Walter , and the eternal solace of bowling .
As the film reaches its shaggy - dog conclusion , the seemingly misplaced narrator , a cowboy called  The Stranger ruminates on the westward drift of Western culture , a quest long since culminated at this curious Los Angeles shoreline .
His last words are catch ya further on down the trail  even though this is its logical end .
Critics of the film have uniformly lambasted this seemingly superfluous narrator , but looking at dudeism in its proper historical context , it is clear why we need him : he is the cowboy that helped transform the Victorian dandy into the dude he is today .
At the limit of the land , and our territorial imperative , it is only the friendly , freethinking Dude that can determine where the next trail will lead .

The world ocean covers approximately 70 per cent of the Earth .
It has been an integral part of human history , providing food and ecological services .
Yet conservation efforts and concerns with environmental degradation have mostly focused on terrestrial issues .
Marine scientists and oceanographers have recently made remarkable discoveries in regard to the intricacies of marine food webs and the richness of oceanic biodiversity .
However , the excitement over these discoveries is dampened due to an awareness of the rapidly accelerating threat to the biological integrity of marine ecosystems . [ 1 ]
At the start of the twenty - first century marine scientists focused on the rapid depletion of marine fish , revealing that 75 per cent of major fisheries are fully exploited , overexploited or depleted .
It is estimated “ that the global ocean has lost more than 90 % of large predatory fishes ” .
The depletion of ocean fish stock due to overfishing has disrupted metabolic relations within the oceanic ecosystem at multiple trophic and spatial scales . [ 2 ]
Despite warnings of impending collapse of fish stock , the oceanic crisis has only worsened .
The severity is made evident in a recent effort to map the scale of human impact on the world ocean .
A team of scientists analysed seventeen types of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change ( e.g. , organic pollution from agricultural runoff , overfishing , carbon dioxide emissions , etc. ) for marine ecosystems .
The findings are clear :
No area of the world ocean “ is unaffected by human influence ” and over 40 per cent of marine ecosystems are heavily affected by multiple factors .
Polar seas are on the verge of significant change .
Coral reefs and continental shelves have suffered severe deterioration .
Additionally , the world ocean is a crucial factor in the carbon cycle , absorbing approximately a third to a half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere .
The increase in the portion of carbon dioxide has led to an increase in ocean temperature and a slow drop in the pH of surface waters — making them more acidic — disrupting shell - forming plankton and reef - building species .
Furthermore , invasive species have negatively affected 84 per cent of the world ’s coastal waters — decreasing biodiversity and further undermining already stressed fisheries . [ 3 ]
Scientific analysis of oceanic systems presents a sobering picture of the co-evolution of human society and the marine environment during the capitalist industrial era .
The particular environmental problems related to the ocean cannot be viewed as isolated issues or aberrations of human ingenuity , only to be corrected through further technological development .
Rather these ecological conditions must be understood as they relate to the systematic expansion of capital and the exploitation of nature for profit .
Capital has a particular social metabolic order — the material interchange between society and nature — that subsumes the world to the logic of accumulation .
It is a system of self - expanding value , which must reproduce itself on an ever - larger scale . [ 4 ]
Here we examine the social metabolic order of capital and its relationship with the oceans to ( a ) examine the anthropogenic causes of fish stock depletion , ( b ) detail the ecological consequences of ongoing capitalist production in relation to the ocean environment and ( c ) highlight the ecological contradictions of capitalist aquaculture .

Marine metabolism : biological richness , energy cycles and trophic levels
Ecologists now appreciate the complexity of biological relationships at multiple scales , including primary productivity , carbon sequestration and intricate food webs .
New light is being shed on oceanic ecosystems offering an emerging picture of the sea ’s metabolism .
In particular , research reveals great complexity and a resultant integrity among trophic level interactions ( food webs ) between microscopic organisms , plankton and larger predators .
Ivan Valiela , a marine biologist , states :
No topic within marine ecology and biological oceanography has changed more ... than our notions about components and structure of planktonic food webs .
Knowledge about marine water column food webs has been considerably enlarged and made much more complex , by recent findings about the existence and role of smaller organisms , release and reuse of dissolved organic matter and reassessment of the function of certain larger organisms . [ 6 ]
The metabolic interactions expressed among trophic levels are proving to be the underlying source of great biological wealth and ocean resiliency .
According to marine scientists , “ the genetic , species , habitat and ecosystem diversity of the oceans is believed to exceed that of any other Earth system ” .
For example , ocean environments contain seventeen different taxa of life forms compared to eleven land - based taxa .
Oceans account for 99 per cent of the volume that is known to sustain life — most of which is still unknown .
Scientists exploring the ocean ’s middle depths have discovered a host of new species composing productive ecosystems .
The deep - sea bottom , of which little more than 1.5 per cent has been explored , has recently been the object of great interest due to its abundant biodiversity .
For example , in one such Atlantic seafloor with an area of approximately twenty - one square metres , scientists sampled and found 90,672 individual organisms representing 798 species , of which 460 were previously unknown .
These new discoveries have yielded important insights regarding marine ecosystems .
At the same time , they produce an appreciation of the great uncertainty that still exists for much of the marine environment ’s processes , such as the role of currents , nutrient cycles and biomass .
7
Recent advances in trophic level understanding have developed in three areas : microbial interactions , multi-tiered trophic dynamics and upper trophic level controls .
First , the new array of facts offered by studying the base of the food web ( diatoms , dinoflagellates and other microalgae ) has led marine researchers to propose a new view of the planktonic food web that includes a “ microbial loop ” .
In the microbial loop , organic matter cycles through microbes before entering the classic food web ; this is a more complicated relationship than was previously assumed .
Second , it has been found that oceanic food webs often have five trophic levels or more , as opposed to freshwater systems where three levels are more typical .
Valiela describes this yet - unexplained discovery as a significant qualitative difference between the two environments .
Previously , trophic interactions among freshwater fish were thought to be analogous to pelagic fish and management decisions were based on such comparisons .
Exploring the multi-tiered dynamics of ocean food webs as unique from freshwater systems provides a more complex research question for the scientific community .
Uncertainty colors all speculation of how vulnerable ocean systems are compared to freshwater and land ecologies . [ 8 ]
Finally , researchers have found that species in the upper trophic positions seem to be closely coupled to food availability .
This means that the top predators exist near the carrying capacity of their environment .
This is not the case with most bony fishes in freshwater environments , which usually exist in an environment with an abundant prey population .
The life history characteristics of the upper trophic creatures suggest they are easily susceptible to overexploitation .
Little room exists in the population of top marine predators to absorb losses of food resources .
For example , the ability of whales to recover to their earlier abundance after massive human predation is now dependent on the availability of krill .
Although the large - scale hunting of whales has dramatically declined , the massive exploitation of krill as a protein source and as an animal - feed additive may now jeopardise recovering whale populations dependent on krill as a food supply . [ 9 ]
There is a significant amount of interaction and dependence of the ocean ’s top predators on lower trophic levels .
Trophic level interactions represent a marine food web based on energy flow and describe one element of the ocean ’s metabolism .
Many other relationships besides trophic level interactions exist between ocean organisms , such as the relation between organisms and their immediate habitat , which can include coral reefs and kelp forests .
Both of these realms , on which species depend , are highly vulnerable to resource exploitation .
Capitalism and marine fishery exploitation
Humans have long been connected to the ocean ’s metabolic processes by harvesting marine fish and vegetation .
Harvesting methods and processes have varied depending on the structure of social production .
Subsistence fishing is a practice woven throughout human history , beginning with the harvesting of shellfish along seashores and shallow lakes and progressing with the development of tools such as stone - tipped fishing spears , fishhooks , lines and nets .
This was originally based upon fishing for use of the fish .
What was caught was used to feed families and communities .
Through the process of fishing , human labour has been intimately linked to ocean processes , gaining an understanding of fish migrations , tides and ocean currents .
The size of a human population in a particular region influenced the extent of exploitation .
But the introduction of commodity markets and private ownership under the capitalist system of production altered the relationship of fishing labour to the resources of the seas .
Specific species had an exchange value .
As a result , certain fish were seen as being more valuable .
This led to fishing practices that focused on catching as many of a particular fish , such as cod , as possible .
Non-commercially viable species harvested indiscriminately alongside the target species were discarded as waste .
As capitalism developed and spread , intensive extraction by industrial capture fisheries became the norm .
Increased demands were placed on the oceans and overfishing resulted in the severe depletion of wild fish stocks .
In Empty Ocean , Richard Ellis states , “ Throughout the world ’s oceans , food fishes once believed to be immeasurable in number are now recognized as greatly depleted and in some cases almost extinct .
A million vessels now fish the world ’s oceans , twice as many as there were twenty - five years ago .
Are there twice as many fish as before ?
Hardly ” .
How did this situation develop ? [ 10 ]
The beginning of capitalist industrialisation marked the most noticeable and significant changes in fisheries practices .
Mechanisation , automation and mass production / consumption characterised an era of increased fixed capital investments .
Profit - driven investment in efficient production led to fishing technologies that for the first time made the exhaustion of deep - sea fish stocks a real possibility .
Such transformations can be seen in how groundfishing , the capture of fish that swim in close proximity to the ocean ’s bottom , changed through the years .
Industrialisation began to influence the groundfishery around the early 1900s , as technological developments were employed to further the accumulation of capital .
The introduction of steam - powered trawlers from England in 1906 heralded a significant change in how groundfish were caught and rapidly replaced the sail - powered schooner fleets .
Prior to steam trawling , groundfish were caught on schooners with baited lines during long journeys at sea .
Due to lack of refrigeration and freezing , most of the cod catch was salted .
The competitive markets organised under capitalist production welcomed the increased efficiency of steam - powered vessels , without a critical assessment of the consequences of increased harvest levels .
More captured fish meant more profit .
The switch to trawling was complete by 1920 and the consequences of the second industrial revolution organised under capitalist forces would soon change the human - nature relationship to the ocean , extending the reach of capital .
The expanded geographic range and speed of fishing fleets allowed for increased productivity of catch as well as increased diversity of captured species that were deemed “ valuable ” on the market .
Technological developments and improved transportation routes allowed the fishing industry to grow , increasing its scale of operations .
Cold storage ensured that fish would be fresh , reducing spoilage and loss of capital .
In * Cod : A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World , Mark Kurlansky explains , “ Freezing [ cod ] also changed the relationship of seafood companies to fishing ports .
Frozen fish could be bought anywhere — wherever the fish was cheapest and most plentiful .
With expanding markets , local fleets could not keep up with the needs of the companies ” .
Advances in the transportation infrastructure allowed people in the Midwest [ USA ] to consume the increased harvests of cod and haddock , leading to a significant expansion in the market .
Major marketing campaigns promoted the consumption of fish to increase sales .
Together these factors enhanced the accumulation of capital within the fishing industry and companies invested some of this capital back into their fleets . [ 11 ]
By 1930 there were clear signals that the groundfishing fleet ’s ability to capture massive quantities of fish had surpassed natural limits in fisheries .
A Harvard University investigation reported that in 1930 the groundfishery landed 37 million haddock at Boston , with another 70 –90 million juvenile haddock discarded dead at sea .
The sudden rise in fisheries harvest ( creating a subsequent rise in consumer demand through marketing campaigns ) resulted in stress in the groundfish populations and landings plummeted .
Competitive markets create incentives to expand production , regardless of resource decline .
Thus , in reaction to decreased stocks due to overfishing , groundfishing fleets moved farther offshore into waters off of the coast of Canada to increase the supply of valuable fish to new markets .
The fleet ’s ability to continue moving into unexploited waters obscured recognition of the severe resource depletion that was occurring .
As a result , the process of overfishing particular ecosystems to supply a specific good for the market expanded , subjecting more of the ocean to the same system of degradation . [ 12 ]
The distant water fleets were made possible by the advent of factory trawlers .
Factory trawlers represent the pinnacle of capital investment and extractive intensification in the global fisheries .
In Distant Water William Warner presents a portrayal of a factory trawler ’s capacity :
Try to imagine a mobile and completely self - contained timber cutting machine that could smash through the roughest trails of the forest , cut down trees , mill them and deliver consumer - ready lumber in half the time of normal logging and milling operations .
This was exactly what factory trawlers did — this was exactly their effect on fish — in the forests of the deep .
It could not long go unnoticed .
Factory trawlers pull nylon nets a thousand feet long through the ocean , potentially capturing 400 tons of fish during a single netting .
Industrial trawlers can process and freeze their catch as they travel . [ 13 ]
Such technological development extended the systematic exploitation and scale of harvesting of fishes .
The natural limits of fish populations combined with capital ’s need to expand led to the development of immense trawlers that increased the productive capacity and efficiency of operations .
These ships allowed fishers to seek out areas in the ocean where valuable fish were available , providing the means to capture massive quantities of fish in a single trip .
Overcoming the shortage of fishes in one area was accomplished by even more intensive harvesting with new ships and equipment , such as sonar , in other regions of the oceans .
The pursuit of vast quantities of commercial fishes in different areas of the ocean expanded the depletion of other species , as they were exploited and discarded as bycatch .
The swath of the seas subjected to the dictates of the market increased , whether a fish was sold as a commodity or thrown overboard as a waste product . [ 14 ]
Competition for market share between companies and capital ’s investment in advanced technology intensified fishery exploitation .
Competing international companies sought nature ’s diminishing bounty , causing further international conflict in the “ race for fish ” .
US President Truman responded to these disputes by attempting to expand US corporate interests .
He issued two proclamations expanding US authority beyond territorial waters trying to further territorial enclosure of its adjacent seas out to the limits of the continental shelf .
Coastal states around the world struggled to transform the property rights of the open ocean to benefit their nations .
In response to growing conflict , the United Nations convened the First United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in Geneva in 1958 .
Eventually , most nations voted to sign the UN Law of the Sea article , “ irrevocably transforming ” international law and constituting “ a fundamental revision of sometimes age - old institutions ” .
[ 15 ]
( The US Senate , however , has still not ratified the Law of the Sea Convention . )
In the end , the convention established a property regime according to the prescription of an exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) .
The EEZ put regions of the high seas adjacent to coastal waters entirely within the management purview of the coastal state , up to two hundred miles from their shore .
In this zone , states have exclusive rights to living and non-living resources for extraction and economic pursuits .
The collapse of fisheries due to overexploitation coupled with the expanding seafood market forced companies to look elsewhere for “ the most traded animal commodity on the planet ” .
African nations — such as Senegal , Mauritania , Angola and Mozambique — confronting dire economic conditions sold fishing access to European and Asian nations and companies .
In the case of Mauritania , selling fishing access provided over US $ 140 million a year , which equaled a fifth of the government ’s budget .
Few countries can resist such bait , given the need for monetary resources .
Industrialised trawlers descended into African waters , combing their seas for the treasured fish commodities .
In the past three decades , Africa ’s fish population in the ocean has decreased by 50 per cent and thousands of fishers have become unemployed . [ 16 ]
The expansion of capitalist fishing practices continues to decimate fisheries and spread ecological degradation , as profits and food are funnelled back to core nations .
Sharp declines
The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that the world capture from fisheries increased from approximately 20 million tons in 1950 to 84.2 million tons in 2005 .
A dominant narrative explains that human population growth is solely responsible for this increase in capture ; however , recent research demonstrates that social structural factors such as economic growth are also propelling the depletion .
Since around 1989 the world capture of marine fish has declined by 500,000 tons per year amidst increasing fishing effort .
There have been sharp declines in the populations of tuna , cod and marlins .
During the 1960s and ’ 70s , shelf fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean started to collapse as a result of overfishing .
Operations moved to the deep sea .
Deepwater fishing has seriously affected the populations of deep - sea fish , such as the roundnose grenadier , onion - eye grenadier , spiny eel , spinytail skate and blue hake .
The populations of these deep - sea fishes have plummeted by over 87 per cent in seventeen years .
It is expected that these fishes will be driven to the point of extinction — to the detriment of the ecosystems in which they live .
Part of the vulnerability of these fishes is that they can live to around sixty years of age and do not sexually mature until their late teen years . [ 17 ]
Changes in the market can transform the demand for particular fish species .
In the early 1900s , bluefin tuna was seen as being only suitable for use as pet food .
But given their strength and size — weighing up “ to three quarters of a ton and [ having ] a length of four metres ” — they were deemed worthy opponents to be hunted .
In the later half of the twentieth century , bluefin tuna became “ the most desirable food fish in the world ” with the spread of sushi and sashimi restaurants .
Given the machinations of capitalism , this has also caused them to become “ the most endangered of all large fish species ” .
The bluefin tuna population continues to be decimated by overfishing and the practice of capturing half - grown tuna at sea and placing them in floating pens — known as tuna ranches — where they are fed until they are ready for market has only worsened the situation .
While this helps control the production process , it involves catching the fishes “ before they are old enough to breed ” and keeping “ them penned up until they are killed ” .
As a result of this practice and overfishing , bluefin tuna are threatened with depletion . [ 18 ]
The geographic span of ocean exploitation has widened as capitalist operations of extraction continue .
Even the Antarctic waters are increasingly under assault as the fishing industry gears up to plunder the krill population .
Since the 1970s the numbers of krill have declined by 80 per cent , largely due to global warming .
But fishing operations are adding to the depletion .
These tiny crustaceans eat carbon - rich food near the surface of the water , thereby they help remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
They have long been one of the primary sources of food for seals , whales and penguins .
Progressively they have been incorporated into the insatiable appetite of global capital .
“ Suction harvesting ” swallows up huge quantities that are processed , frozen and stored on newly outfitted ships .
From here , the krill are to be used as feed for fish - farms ( aquaculture ) or transformed into omega - 3 oil and other health supplements . [ 19 ]
Fleets of ships burning fossil fuels to harvest from the open oceans have exacerbated the deterioration of marine ecosystems .
The depletion of fish stock increases the distance that is necessary to travel in order to catch certain species of fish , such as tuna and swordfish .
It also expands the regional scope of exploitation , the number of species captured as bycatch and the scale of depletion .
In 2000 , 80 million tons of fish required the burning of 13 billion gallons of fuel and the release of approximately 134 million tons of carbon dioxide .
This means that global fisheries used up to 12.5 times the amount of fuel energy that they provided as edible - protein energy . [ 20 ]
During the 1970s and ’ 80s fishing ships became more automated , with the trend toward full automation becoming common .
Today , navigational aids , such as geographic positioning systems and weather prediction models enhance the ability of fishing fleets to catch the most amount of fishes in the shortest amount of time , with the least amount of human labour .
The synthesis of technical development and transformed property rights under the competitive framework of global capitalism has resulted in the massive extraction of marine fish and an intensified social metabolism organised for the pursuit of profit .
Ecological degradation of marine ecoystems
The intensified extraction of fish from already stressed oceanic ecosystems — fueled by capital accumulation and the free appropriation of nature — has resulted in significant consequences to the metabolic interactions between marine trophic levels .
Marine scientists note that the removal of 100 million metric tons ( which includes both capture and aquaculture ) of fish from the world ocean will lead to long - term , large - scale disruptions in marine ecology .
Of direct concern are “ species level effects ” , in particular the removal of target and non-target marine life .
Continued harvest of fish species to population levels that are below the sustainable numbers required for reproduction will eventually lead to extinction .
The orange roughy , for example , began to be commercially exploited ten years ago .
This fish lives to be 150 years old and only begins to reproduce at age 25 .
By continually removing the oldest fish first , the industry has depleted the population of reproducing adults .
( Harvesting this fish generally results in the destruction of coral forests . )
The orange roughy species is now threatened with extinction .
As mentioned earlier , the depletion of fish stock for commercial fishing in coastal waters led to the capture of fishes in the deep sea — such as roundnose grenadier , onion - eye grenadier , spiny eel , spinytail skate and blue hake — subjecting them to the dictates of the market , driving them to the point of extinction . [ 21 ]
Industrialised capitalist fishing allows for vast quantities of target fish to be harvested at once .
At the same time , it leads to an immense amount of non-target marine life — bycatch — being captured .
Bycatch are commercially unviable species , thus they are seen as waste .
The “ trash fish ” are often ground up and thrown back into the ocean .
Part of the bycatch includes juveniles of the target fish , which , if the mortality is increased among this population , undercuts the success of recovery .
Obviously , the populations of the discarded species are negatively affected by this practice , furthering the depletion of marine life .
The most wasteful operation is trawling for shrimp .
The capture and discarding of bycatch disrupts the habitats and trophic webs within ecosystems .
The scale of the disruption is quite significant .
It is estimated that an average of 27 million tons of fish are discarded each year in commercial fisheries around the world and that the United States has a 0.28 ratio of bycatch discard to landings . [ 22 ]
Species extinction is the direct impact of overfishing , which is in part driven by the pursuit of capital accumulation and is facilitated by the technological innovations that are employed for this particular purpose , in what has become known as a “ race for fish ” . [ 23 ]
Capitalist practices are creating a loss of marine biodiversity and undermining the resiliency of marine ecosystems .
Valiela states ,
“ The magnitude of the fishing harvest and the examples of major alterations to marine food webs by predator removal suggest that effects of fishing are ecologically substantial at large spatial scales ” .
The “ major alteration to marine food webs ” due to overexploitation provides the clearest example of ecological degradation in the metabolic processes of the ocean . [ 24 ]
Fishing down the food chain
Equally disrupting , but less apparent than species effects , are the ecosystem effects caused by fishery exploitation , especially “ fishing down the food chain ” .
[ 25 ]
As overfishing depletes the most commercially viable top predators ( i.e. , snapper , tuna , cod and swordfish ) , competition drives commercial fishers to begin harvesting species of lower trophic levels .
The downward shift is global , according to the model analysis of UN statistics describing worldwide catches of fish over a forty - year time span .
If this quest is pursued to its logical end , scientists warn it will lead to the wholesale collapse of marine ecosystems .
Fishing down the food chain erodes the base of marine biodiversity and undermines the biophysical cornerstone of ocean fisheries .
The recent discoveries of marine trophic interactions suggest that the lower trophic levels of marine food webs provide an integral and complex foundation — disrupting this base undermines the metabolic cycle of energy flows within marine ecosystems .
Overfishing of lower trophic levels has shortened the food chain and sometimes has removed one or more of the “ links ” , increasing the system ’s vulnerability to natural and human induced stresses .
For example , in the North Sea the cod population has been so depleted that fishers are now harvesting a lower trophic species called pout , which the cod used to eat .
The pout eat krill and copepods .
Krill also eat copepods .
As the pout are commercially harvested , the krill population expands and the copepod population declines drastically .
( In other areas of the ocean , krill are captured and used as an animal - feed additive , hindering the recovery of the whales that depend upon them for food . )
Because copepods are the main food of young cod , the cod population cannot recover from initial fisheries exploitation . [ 26 ]
Fishing down the food chain illustrates how capture fisheries organised under competitive market conditions and the drive to accumulate capital are dismantling the marine ecological system that has been developing for millions of years .
In addition , fishing for lower trophic level species deceptively masks marine fish extraction , as millions of tons of fish are harvested each year from the oceans .
People continue to be provided with seafood on their menus , never realising the full impact of overfishing the top predators .
Fishing down the food chain , due to overfishing in the higher tropic levels , depletes the food resources on which predatory fishes depend .
As noted earlier , marine predatory species are extremely vulnerable to losses of prey .
Collapse of coastal marine ecosystems
The previous examples demonstrate how species extinction decreases the resiliency of trophic level interactions .
Even more problematic , however , is the widespread collapse of entire ecosystems resulting from overfishing .
Historical data suggests that species and population declines due to overfishing are direct preconditions for the collapse of entire coastal ecosystems .
The collapse of whole - scale ecosystems not only threatens the ecological resiliency of the marine environment , but also disrupts the human populations that rely on the coastal ecosystem for subsistence or livelihoods .
“ Overfishing and ecological extinction predate and precondition modern ecological investigations and the collapse of marine ecosystems in recent times , raising the possibility that many more marine ecosystems may be vulnerable to collapse in the near future ” . [ 27 ]
Kelp forests , coral reefs , seagrass beds and estuaries are examples of coastal ecosystems that have collapsed in parts of the world due to overfishing and other forms of environmental degradation .
These ecosystems provide complex habitats for a multitude of species and often are the foundation of many local fishing communities .
For example , the kelp forests of the Gulf of Maine experienced severe deforestation and widespread reductions in the number of trophic levels due to the population explosion of sea urchins , the primary herbivores that eat kelp .
The following account details such a sequence of events :
Atlantic cod and other large ground fish are voracious predators of sea urchins .
These fishes kept sea urchin populations small enough to allow persistence of kelp forests despite intensive aboriginal and early European hook - and - line fishing for at least 5000 years .
New mechanized fishing technology in the 1920s set off a rapid decline in numbers and body size of coastal cod in the Gulf of Maine .... Kelp forests disappeared with the rise in sea urchins due to removal of predatory fish . [ 28 ]
In other words , industrial fishing operations intensified the exploitation of marine ecosystems , transforming natural conditions .
A number of human activities are leading to the collapse of coral reefs .
Overfishing is one of the causes .
Deforestation is another .
Clearing forests leads to muddy rivers filled with sediment , which moves downstream and smothers coral reefs .
But the main force driving massive destruction of coral reefs is global warming .
The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to a warming and increase in the acidity of ocean water .
As a result , multicoloured , healthy coral reefs filled with a rich abundance of biodiversity are being bleached and turned into grey - white skeletons .
Without radical changes to the social metabolic order , the death of the world ’s coral reefs could take place within a few decades .
When coral reefs die , the fauna dependent upon them also die . [ 29 ]
Natural conditions , everywhere , are being transformed by the social metabolic order of capitalism .
A general progression of environmental degradation accompanies this system of growth , creating ecological crises in the conditions of life .
The most recent changes to coastal ecosystems caused by overfishing involve microbial population explosions .
The microbial loop has been found to be more sophisticated and complex than ever expected .
Population explosions of microbes are responsible for increasing eutrophication , diseases of marine species , toxic bloom and even diseases such as cholera that affect human health . [ 30 ]
Chesapeake
Bay is now a bacterially dominated ecosystem with a trophic structure unrecognisable from that of a century ago .
This rapid and drastic change in ecosystem composition is due to the overfishing of suspension feeders that filtered microbes out of the water column .
Bacterial domination of Chesapeake Bay and the deforestation of kelp beds in the Gulf of Maine serve as two examples of how depletion of top predators leads to the collapse of entire ecosystems .
The immense problems associated with the overharvest of industrial capture fisheries has led some optimistically to offer aquaculture as an ecological solution .
However , capitalist aquaculture fails to reverse the process of ecological degradation .
Rather , it continues to sever the social and ecological relations between humans and the ocean .
Aquaculture : The ` Blue Revolution ' ?
The massive decline in fish stocks has led capitalist development to turn to a new way of increasing profits — intensified production of fishes .
Capitalist aquaculture represents not only a quantitative change in the intensification and concentration of production ; it also places organisms ’ life cycles under the complete control of private for - profit ownership . [ 31 ]
This new industry , it is claimed , is “ the fastest - growing form of agriculture in the world ” .
It boasts of having ownership from “ egg to plate ” and substantially alters the ecological and human dimensions of a fishery . [ 32 ]
Aquaculture ( sometimes also referred to as aquabusiness ) involves subjecting nature to the logic of capital .
Capital attempts to overcome natural and social barriers through its constant innovations .
In this , enterprises attempt to commodify , invest in and develop new elements of nature that previously existed outside the political - economic competitive sphere :
As Edward Carr wrote in the Economist , the sea “ is a resource that must be preserved and harvested .... To enhance its uses , the water must become ever more like the land , with owners , laws and limits .
Fishermen must behave more like ranchers than hunters ” . [ 33 ]
As worldwide commercial fish stocks decline due to overharvest and other anthropogenic causes , aquaculture is witnessing a rapid expansion in the global economy .
Aquaculture ’s contribution to global supplies of fish increased from 3.9 per cent of total worldwide production by weight in 1970 to 27.3 per cent in 2000 .
In 2004 , aquaculture and capture fisheries produced 106 million tons of fish and “ aquaculture accounted for 43 per cent ” . [ 34 ]
According to Food and Agriculture Organisation statistics , aquaculture is growing more rapidly than all other animal food producing sectors .
Hailed as the “ Blue Revolution ” , aquaculture is frequently compared to agriculture ’s Green Revolution as a way to achieve food security and economic growth among the poor and in the Third World .
The cultivation of farmed salmon as a high - value , carnivorous species destined for market in core nations has emerged as one of the more lucrative ( and controversial ) endeavours in aquaculture production . [ 35 ]
Much like the Green Revolution , the Blue Revolution may produce temporary increases in yields , but it does not usher in a solution to food security ( or environmental problems ) .
Food security is tied to issues of distribution .
Given that the Blue Revolution is driven by the pursuit of profit , the desire for monetary gain trumps the distribution of food to those in need . [ 36 ]
Industrial aquaculture intensifies fish production by transforming the natural life histories of wild fish stocks into a combined animal feedlot .
Like monoculture agriculture , aquaculture furthers the capitalistic division of nature , only its realm of operation is the marine world .
In order to maximise return on investment , aquaculture must raise thousands of fish in a confined net - pen .
Fish are separated from the natural environment and the various relations of exchange found in a food web and ecosystem .
The fish ’s reproductive life cycle is altered so that it can be propagated and raised until the optimum time for mechanical harvest .
Aquaculture interrupts the most fundamental metabolic process — the ability of an organism to obtain its required nutrient uptake .
Because the most profitable farmed fish are carnivorous , such as Atlantic salmon , they depend on a diet that is high in fishmeal and fish oil .
For example , raising Atlantic salmon requires four pounds of fishmeal to produce every one pound of salmon .
Consequently , aquaculture production depends heavily on fishmeal imported from South America to feed the farmed carnivorous species . [ 37 ]
The inherent contradiction in extracting fishmeal is that industries must increase their exploitation of marine fish in order to feed the farm - raised fish — thereby increasing the pressure on wild stocks to an even larger extent .
Such operations also increase the amount of bycatch .
Three of the world ’s five largest fisheries are now exclusively harvesting pelagic fish for fishmeal and these fisheries account for a quarter of the total global catch .
Rather than diminishing the demands placed on marine ecosystems , capitalist aquaculture actually increases them , accelerating the fishing down the food chain process .
The environmental degradation of populations of marine species , ecosystems and tropic levels continues . [ 38 ]
Capitalist aquaculture — which is really aquabusiness — represents a parallel example of capital following the patterns of agribusiness .
Similar to combined animal feedlots , farmed fish are penned up in high - density cages making them susceptible to disease .
Thus , like in the production of beef , pork and chicken , farmed fish are fed fishmeal that contains antibiotics , increasing concerns about antibiotic exposure in society .
In ``Silent Spring of the Sea ' ' , Don Staniford explains , “ The use of antibiotics in salmon farming has been prevalent right from the beginning and their use in aquaculture globally has grown to such an extent that resistance is now threatening human health as well as other marine species ” .
Aquaculturists use a variety of chemicals to kill parasites , such as sea lice and diseases that spread quickly throughout the pens .
The dangers and toxicities of these pesticides in the marine environment are magnified because of the long food chain . [ 39 ]
Once subsumed into the capitalist process , life cycles of animals are increasingly geared to economic cycles of exchange by decreasing the amount of time required for growth .
Aquabusiness conforms to these pressures , as researchers are attempting to shorten the growth time required for fish to reach market size .
Recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rBGH ) has been added to some fish feeds to stimulate growth in fishes in aquaculture farms in Hawaii .
Experiments with fish transgenics — the transfer of DNA from one species to another — are being done to increase the rate of weight gain , causing altered fish to grow from 60 per cent to 600 per cent larger than wild stocks . [ 40 ]
These growth mechanisms illustrate capitalist aquaculture ’s drive to transform nature to facilitate the generation of profit .
In addition , aquaculture alters waste assimilation .
The introduction of net - pens leads to a break in the natural assimilation of waste in the marine environment .
The pens convert coastal ecosystems , such as bays , inlets and fjords , into aquaculture ponds , destroying nursery areas that support ocean fisheries .
For instance , salmon net - pens allow fish faeces and uneaten feed to flow directly into coastal waters , resulting in substantial discharges of nutrients .
The excess nutrients are toxic to the marine communities that occupy the ocean floor beneath the net - pens , causing massive die offs of entire benthic populations . [ 41 ]
Other waste products are concentrated around net - pens as well , such as diseases and parasites introduced by the caged salmon to the surrounding marine organisms .
The Blue Revolution is not an environmental solution to declining fish stocks .
In fact , it is an intensification of the social metabolic order that creates ruptures in marine ecosystems .
“ The coastal and marine support areas needed for resource inputs and waste assimilation [ is ] ... 50,000 times the cultivation area for intensive salmon cage farming . ” [ 42 ]
This form of aquaculture places even more demands upon ecosystems , undermining their resiliency .
Although aquabusiness is efficient at turning fish into a commodity for markets given the extensive control that is executed over the productive conditions , it is even more energy inefficient than fisheries , demanding more fuel energy investment than the energy produced . [ 43 ]
Confronted by declines in fish stock , capital is attempting to shift production to aquaculture .
However , this intense form of production for profit continues to exhaust the oceans and produce a concentration of waste that causes further problems for ecosystems , undermining their ability to regenerate at all levels .
Turning the ocean into a watery grave
The world is at a crossroads in regard to the ecological crisis .
Ecological degradation under global capitalism extends to the entire biosphere .
Oceans that were teeming with abundance are being decimated by the continual intrusion of exploitive economic operations .
At the same time that scientists are documenting the complexity and interdependency of marine species , we are witnessing an oceanic crisis as natural conditions , ecological processes and nutrient cycles are being undermined through overfishing and transformed due to global warming .
The expansion of the accumulation system , along with technological advances in fishing , have intensified the exploitation of the world ocean ; facilitated the enormous capture of fishes ( both target and bycatch ) ; extended the spatial reach of fishing operations ; broadened the species deemed valuable on the market ; and disrupted metabolic and reproductive processes of the ocean .
The quick - fix solution of aquaculture enhances capital ’s control over production without resolving ecological contradictions .
It is wise to recognise , as Paul Burkett has stated , that “ short of human extinction , there is no sense in which capitalism can be relied upon to permanently ‘ break down ’ under the weight of its depletion and degradation of natural wealth ” . [ 44 ]
Capital is driven by the competition for the accumulation of wealth and short - term profits provide the immediate pulse of capitalism .
It cannot operate under conditions that require reinvestment in the reproduction of nature , which may entail time scales of a hundred or more years .
Such requirements stand opposed to the immediate interests of profit .
The qualitative relation between humans and nature is subsumed under the drive to accumulate capital on an ever - larger scale .
Marx lamented that to capital , “ Time is everything , man is nothing ; he is at the most , time ’s carcase .
Quality no longer matters .
Quantity alone decides everything . ” [ 45 ]
Productive relations are concerned with production time , labour costs and the circulation of capital — not the diminishing conditions of existence .
Capital subjects natural cycles and processes ( via controlled feeding and the use of growth hormones ) to its economic cycle .
The maintenance of natural conditions is not a concern .
The bounty of nature is taken for granted and appropriated as a free gift .
As a result , the system is inherently caught in a fundamental crisis arising from the transformation and destruction of nature .
István Mészáros elabourates this point , stating :
For today it is impossible to think of anything at all concerning the elementary conditions of social metabolic reproduction which is not lethally threatened by the way in which capital relates to them — the only way in which it can .
This is true not only of humanity ’s energy requirements , or of the management of the planet ’s mineral resources and chemical potentials , but of every facet of the global agriculture , including the devastation caused by large scale de-forestation and even the most irresponsible way of dealing with the element without which no human being can survive : water itself ...
In the absence of miraculous solutions , capital ’s arbitrarily self - asserting attitude to the objective determinations of causality and time in the end inevitably brings a bitter harvest , at the expense of humanity [ and nature itself ] . [ 46 ]
An analysis of the oceanic crisis confirms the destructive qualities of private for - profit operations .
Dire conditions are being generated as the resiliency of marine ecosystems in general is being undermined .
To make matters worse , sewage from feedlots and fertiliser runoff from farms are transported by rivers to gulfs and bays , overloading marine ecosystems with excess nutrients , which contribute to an expansion of algal production .
This leads to oxygen - poor water and the formation of hypoxic zones — otherwise known as “ dead zones ” because crabs and fishes suffocate within these areas .
It also compromises natural processes that remove nutrients from the waterways .
Around 150 dead zones have been identified around the world .
A dead zone is the end result of unsustainable practices of food production on land .
At the same time , it contributes to the loss of marine life in the seas , furthering the ecological crisis of the world ocean .
Coupled with industrialised capitalist fisheries and aquaculture , the oceans are experiencing ecological degradation and constant pressures of extraction that are severely depleting the populations of fishes and other marine life .
The severity of the situation is that if current practices and rates of fish capture continue marine ecosystems and fisheries around the world could collapse by the year 2050 . [ 47 ]
To avert turning the seas into a watery grave , what is needed is nothing less than a worldwide revolution in our relation to nature and thus of global society itself .

5. Metabolism — the relationship of interchange within and between nature and humans , of regulatory processes that govern the regeneration of a system — is a foundational concept in ecology .
Marx used a metabolic approach for studying the environmental problems of his day , looking at the metabolism of natural systems .
Whereas the metabolic rift was originally described in the context of agriculture and the soil crisis , we extend its usage to study the interaction between society and the oceans .
Mészáros notes that each mode of production creates a particular social metabolic order , which can be characterised by the material interchange between society and nature .

They cost as much as $ 40 million to build and they reach the length of a football field .
There are currently over 37,000 industrial trawlers in the world ’s oceans , aiding in the total annual harvest of over 80 million tons of fish .

The concept of “ fishing down the food chain ” was first introduced in 1998 .
Since then it has received international attention .
See Daniel Pauly , Villy Christensen , Johanne Dalsgaard , Rainer Froese and Francisco Torres Jr. , “ Fishing Down Marine Food Webs ” , Science 279 ( 1998 ) : 860–63 .

In addition to fishing pressures , cod populations are confronting different environmental conditions , which are making population recovery difficult .
Global warming is increasing the temperature of the oceans .
A warm - water copepod plankton available in late summer has displaced the cold - water copepod plankton , which bloomed at the same time that baby cod needed such food .
The shifts in plankton species due to the warming of the oceans has further complicated the conditions for cod to regenerate their numbers .
Additional capture of cod in the North Sea could decimate the population to the point of no recovery .

For the purposes of this paper , we solely address capital intensive aquaculture of high trophic level species in the marine environment .
For the remainder of the essay , the term “ aquaculture ” will only be referring to this contemporary form of capitalist aquaculture .

One of the interesting aspects of this campaign is watching the scales fall from the eyes of many of John McCain ’s closest admirers among the veteran DC press corps .
I ’m not talking about the freaks on Fox News or any of the sycophants at the AP .
I ’m talking about , let ’s say , the better sort of reporters and commentators in the 45 to 65 age bracket .
To the extent that the press was McCain ’s base ( and in many though now sillier respects it still is ) this was the base of the base .
And talking to a number of them I can understand why that was , at least in the sense of the person he was then presenting himself as .
But over the last … maybe six weeks , in various conversations with these folks , the change is palpable .
Whether it will make any difference in the tone of coverage in the dominant media I do not know .
But it is sinking in .
All politicians stretch the truth , massage it into the best fit with their message .
But , let ’s face it , John McCain is running a campaign almost entirely based on straight up lies .
Not just exaggerations or half truths but the sort of straight up , up - is - down mind - blowers we ’ve become so accustomed to from the current occupants of the White House .
And today McCain comes out with this rancid , race - baiting ad based on another lie .
Willie Horton looks mild by comparison .
( And remember , President George H.W. Bush never ran the Willie Horton ad himself .
It was an outside group .
He was n’t willing to degrade himself that far . )
As TPM Reader JM said below , at least Horton actually was released on a furlough .
This is ugly stuff .
And this is an ugly person .
There ’s clearly no level of sleaze this guy wo n’t stoop to to win this election .
And let ’s be frank .
He might win it .
This is clearly a testing time for Obama supporters .
But I want to return to a point I made a few years ago during the Social Security battle with President Bush .
Winning and losing is never fully in one ’s control — not in politics or in life .
What is always within our control is how we fight and bear up under pressure .
It ’s easy to get twisted up in your head about strategy and message and optics .
But what is already apparent is that John McCain is running the sleaziest , most dishonest and race - baiting campaign of our lifetimes .
So let ’s stopped being shocked and awed by every new example of it .
It is undignified .
What can we do ?
We ’ve got a dangerously reckless contender for the presidency and a vice presidential candidate who distinguished her self by abuse of office even on the comparatively small political stage of Alaska .
They ’ve both embraced a level of dishonesty that disqualifies them for high office .
Democrats owe it to the country to make clear who these people are .
No apologies or excuses .
If Democrats can say at the end of this campaign that they made clear exactly how and why these two are unfit for high office they can be satisfied they served their country .
The Town That Was Poisoned
February 28 , 1985 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
THE TOWN THAT WAS POISONED
The SPEAKER pro tempore .
Under a previous order of the House , the gentleman from Oregon [ Mr. WEAVER ] is recognized for 60 minutes .
Mr. WEAVER .
Mr. Speaker , I have a strange and terrifying tale to tell the House .
It is about a town that was poisoned .
This town has a population of 10,000 .
When the poison struck , over 700 were taken violently ill .
There were , in fact , 715 confirmed cases of poisoning .
Another 117 had severe symptoms .
Over 45 hospitalized .
A pregnant woman and her husband were poisoned ; her baby born soon after had the effects of the poison .
Fortunately , no one died .
The poisoning was investigated thoroughly by county , State and Federal health authorities .
The investigation pointed directly to the food from salad bars in eight restaurants in the town .
Another two restaurants without salad bars were implicated , although fewer cases from these two restaurants were reported .
The poisoning occurred n two waves in September of 1984 , with an astronomical 450 cases reported on the weekend of September 23 .
The poison was salmonella typhimurium .
The town was The Dalles , OR .
To dramatize for you how unusual this outbreak of poisoning was , let me cite some figures :
The Dalles has not had a single case of reported Salmonella poisoning since 1978 .
Before 1978 , only one or two cases a year were reported .
The entire State of Oregon has reported salmonella cases ranging from 250 to 400 a year .
The Dalles outbreak had 715 .
Figures from the Federal Center for Disease Control in Atlanta , GA , for the entire country for the years 1979 , 1980 and 1981 show only one outbreak of Salmonella larger than that in The Dalles , and that of 1,200 cases stemming from pork eaten at a festival in Georgia .
The CDC figures include only those outbreaks investigated by the CDC .
Most of the outbreaks listed by the CDC run about 20 , with the range between 10 and 200 .
There are an average of 40,000 cases of reported salmonella in the United States each year .
The small town of The Dalles had about 2 percent of such cases in 1 year .
Most significant of all – highly significant – The Dalles outbreak did not come from one food source from one site nor did it occur at one time .
The sources of The Dalles outbreak were eight salad bars .
And the outbreak came in waves .
Salmonella is not easy to catch , like the common cold or flu .
It is difficult to pass from one person to another in ordinary encounters .
It almost always occurs from eating food that has been contaminated , improperly cooked , or left out of the refrigerator too long .
Salmonella feeds on protein and usually occurs in meat , poultry , eggs , fish , milk or cheese .
Not green lettuce salad .
Salmonella typhimurium is one of the most common types of salmonella .
It can cause typhoid fever in mice .
In humans , it is extremely discomforting and can be dangerous ( it can kill , but most often does not ) .
Salmonella does not like the acid in our stomachs but it thrives in our intestines where it erupts and causes diarrhea , fever , chills , headache , nausea , vomiting , fainting , hematochezia and abdominal cramps .
It is a bacteria that can grow at room temperature but reproduces at a most rapid rate at body temperature .
Let me now relate to you the horror ridden story of the town that was poisoned .
The Dalles is the county seat of Wasco County , OR .
It is situated on the Columbia River about 60 miles east of Portland .
It is a farm town , surrounded by orchards , with wheat and cattle ranches in the dry southern reaches of the county .
The big aluminum smelter in The Dalles was recently closed .
Directly across the river is the State of Washington .
It s a quiet , conservative town .
On September 17 , the Wasco County Health Department received a call from a person who complained of gastroenteritis after eating in a popular restaurant in The Dalles .
In the next 4 days the local health authorities received at least 20 more complaints involving two restaurants .
On September 21 , salmonella typhimurium was isolated from a stool sample of one of these restaurant patrons .
The resultant publicity in the local news media caused hundreds of others to report their illness .
State health investigators were called in and the Federal Center for Disease Control was contacted and asked to participate .
A full - scale investigation was on .
The health authorities interviewed and checked the hundreds of people who complained of salmonella symptoms ; and they interviewed and checked hundreds who did not .
The statistics began to show that those who had eaten at salad bars in eight restaurants were far more likely to have become infected ; in fact , the salad bars seemed the only common denominator .
Few of those who had not eaten at the salad bars suffered from the illness .
With that lead , the Food and Drug Administration investigators and other officials began checking the sources of supply for the salad bars .
They found no common source for any of the food articles on the various salad bars .
The lettuce came from different suppliers , as did the other vegetables .
The salad dressings were from different wholesalers .
Each item was traced back , some even to the growers .
The puzzled investigators even checked the kale that was used decoratively on one salad bar .
A shipment of cantaloupe from a farm across the river in Washington was suspected but nothing was discovered .
There were no other similar outbreaks of salmonella in other communities either in the vicinity of The Dalles or , for that matter , in all of Oregon or Washington .
I think that bears repeating .
This huge outbreak of salmonella was isolated in one town , and it had no common food source .
Indeed , the outbreak had no common site .
It sprang up and then erupted simultaneously from eight different restaurants and from the salad bars of those restaurants .
Even so , both water systems serving The Dalles were thoroughly checked and no evidence of salmonella was found .
The food handlers were suspected .
Most of the perplexed health authorities involved in the investigation continue to believe that in some way , somehow – no one knows how – the food handlers were the cause .
Almost all of the 325 food handlers employed in the 10 restaurants were interviewed and later interviewed again .
About 100 had been infected .
The 26 food handlers who showed positive salmonella culture in their stools denied having been ill .
I can understand the health officials turning to the food handlers as the source ; there s no other place to look .
Everything else has been investigated and nothing found .
But the food handlers came down with salmonella poisoning at the same times the patrons of the restaurants did .
One or two handlers came down a day or two before patrons became ill in one or two restaurants , but the figures are imprecise .
And at one restaurant the patrons became ill before the food handlers .
And no one has been able to discover how all the food handlers got salmonella in the first place .
There were food handlers in almost all the restaurants who became ill about the same time .
How did all of them happen to get salmonella ?
They were the victims of the poisoning just like the patrons .
They ate at their restaurants , and they were poisoned too .
And why was it only the salad bars which were almost the entire sources of the poisoning ?
As an incubator , raw vegetables are not ideal for salmonella .
Salmonella feeds on protein .
Health authorities can remember only one instance of an epidemic arising from a vegetable , some sewage contaminated celery back in 1974 .
But records list few other instances not occurring in protein sources .
So salad , lettuce salad , would be a most unlikely source for any Salmonella development , certainly not one that poisoned 715 people .
Yet no statistical evidence could be found to implicate other foods more commonly associated with salmonella .
In one restaurant involved n the first wave 49 patrons of the period September 11 to 15 were interviewed .
Seven reported becoming ill within 1 week after they had eaten there .
All seven had partaken of the salar [ sic ] bar ; but only 17 of the 42 who denied being ill had eaten salad .
And two heads of lettuce from that restaurant were analyzed and no salmonella was found .
Actually there were a number of suggested sources of the salmonella .
In one restaurant , people who ate the lettuce were unaffected but the macaroni and potato salads at the salad bar apparently were contaminated .
In another restaurant , salmonella was found in the blue cheese dressing , but none in the mix used to make the dressing , pointing to contamination in the rest during preparation ; or after preparation .
The fruit garnish in one restaurant was associated with the poisoning .
And two restaurants which had no salad bars were implicated , though with few confirmed cases .
The first wave of the outbreak occurred on September 10 and 15 percent of the cases emanated from a 3 - day period ; it was the second wave that was explosive and just like an explosion , it hit hard and was quickly over ; but about 600 confirmed cases of salmonella poisoning occurred in that terrifying second wave which began September 21 and ended a few days later .
The epidemic in The Dalles is one of the largest outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in our history for the size of the population in which it occurred .
A proportional outbreak in Los Angeles would have 350,000 people ill !
If there had been one source , hot dogs at a high school football game , chicken at a big country barbecue , then it would have been explainable though most unusual .
But there was not a single source .
All evidence pointed to contamination on the premises of the eight restaurants .
But the natural place to find salmonella – poultry , eggs , milk , meat , fish – were never implicated .
The interviews of affected persons never traced back to such foods ; if food handlers had infected salad bars , why had they not infected the more likely foods ?
Of course food handlers came down with salmonella in larger numbers than the rest of the population : almost all of them ate in the restaurants they worked in .
And they were investigated far more intensely than the general population .
But one startling fact sends all this conjecture spinning .
One restaurant , the Portage Inn ( which was one of the first two restaurants implicated ) had banquet facilities and frequent large private banquets were given there .
These banquets had salad bars all of their own in their private banquet room ; the same foods and dressings were provided the banquets as the regular salad bar in the main restaurant .
The same food handlers prepared and served the food , including salad bars , for the banquets as for the main restaurant .
But no person who ate at the restaurant only as a banquet patron came down with salmonella .
Let me repeat that .
Banquet guests in the private banquet room , eating from a salad bar prepared by the same food handlers who prepared the salad bar in the main restaurant , and serving the same food as the main restaurant salad bar , did not come down with salmonella while patrons of the main restaurant at the same time did come down with salmonella .
In large numbers .
If , during the periods of the outbreaks , you had turkey or a ham sandwich , you did not get salmonella .
Hundreds of people who ate at the salad bars did .
If you had a pizza from Shakey ’s or Pietros , you did not get salmonella .
But if you ate at their salad bars you had a good chance – dozens did – of coming down with salmonella poisoning .
But if you ate at the salad bar in the main restaurant you had a very good chance of severe illness .
If you were an employee of one of the implicated restaurants you had a very good chance of getting salmonella infection .
But even the health authorities who assumed that the food handlers were the cause could find no evidence of any kind to determine how the food handlers got salmonella in the first place .
Except by eating at the salad bars .
Consider the outbreak .
Eight salad bars in one small town within a 2 - week period were the primary source of 715 confirmed cases of salmonella .
Indeed , in the second wave when , within a few days , about 600 people were poisoned .
The salad bars accounted – according to the best statistical evidence – for most of the infections .
Then consider that there are about 50,000 salad bars in restaurants in the United States according to the National Restaurant Association and none of them have been pinpointed as the cause of any salmonella outbreaks .
They all have food handlers just as likely or unlikely to contract and pass on salmonella as the food handlers in The Dalles .
But only eight salad bars in the United States – out of those 50,000 – caused one of the largest eruptions of salmonella in our history .
All in one small town within a 2 - week period .
The Dalles is not in my congressional district but it is a town I particularly like .
When I first read of the salmonella outbreak and the investigation it appeared so strange I became most interested .
I talked with the health authorities involved in the investigation almost daily .
I poured over the statistics as I received them .
I analyzed them thoroughly .
I rechecked my facts with the authorities .
I talked with other people in The Dalles , including several of the restaurant managers .
I came to the conclusion that the town had been poisoned .
I have nothing but the highest commendations for the health authorities involved .
They were courteous and patient .
They were extremely careful and thorough .
They never violated confidences and I was given , by them , only statistical data and no names .
Their feeling – that the food handlers are the cause – is understandable .
I believe they can point to nothing else .
For there is no direct , concrete evidence that the salad bars were deliberately contaminated .
It is not [ sic ] job of the health authorities to postulate answers from circumstantial evidence .
Because I believe the crime is so horrendous , and the dangers so great , I believe it is my job to do so .
Let me repeat .
There is no direct , concrete evidence of deliberate sabotage of the food in The Dalles .
But the circumstances are so overwhelming in pointing to such deliberate contamination that – though I have agonized over the decision – I can only conclude , and very positively conclude , that sabotage did take place .
Is it possible to use salmonella for mass poisoning ?
It certainly is .
Salmonella is quite easy to culture .
Under the right conditions it grows quite rapidly .
It can be transported easily in liquid .
However , culturing salmonella and storing it and determining the proper mix for transporting it would best be done by a medical laboratory with trained lab technicians .
If one wanted to undertake a mass poisoning with salmonella , where would one go ?
The obvious places , where a customer of a restaurant comes in contact naturally and without suspicion with the food many of the other patrons will eat ; the salad bars .
A small vial of salmonella culture could be used to sprinkle the liquid in the salad dressings or salad mixes or on the lettuce or other foods on the salad bar as one helped themselves .
Who would do such a terrifying thing ?
Who would poison a whole town ; or at least 715 of its citizens ?
Whoever did could not have known how many people they would poison , or whether someone might die from the poisoning .
But the massive assault on the people of The Dalles was that : a massive assault , almost a war on the town .
Who would want to do it ?
And who would have the capability to do it ?
Is there a madman lurking in The Dalles ?
The poisoning was an insane act , an act of violent hatred , carried on with subtle means .
There must be such a person or persons with the motive and ability to assault this town , for it actually happened .
RAJNEESHPURAM
A group of people arrived in Wasco County in 1981 .
They are the followers of a native of India who calls himself the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh .
This man has attracted a worldwide following .
They bought a 70,000 - acre ranch in the southern end of the county , built a town called Rajneeshpuram , and began developing the property .
There are now about 2,000 adherents living in the town .
They call themselves Rajneeshees .
The relations between the Rajneeshees and the adjoining ranchers has not been very good .
There have also been conflicts between the Rajneeshees and the Wasco County authorities over such things as building permits and sanitation facilities .
These and other conflicts have caused the establishment of the Rajneeshees to become a statewide issue .
Beginning in early September 1984 the Rajneeshees began recruiting from throughout the United States down and outers who lived on the skid roads of major cities .
These street people began showing up , transported in buses by the Rajneeshees , around September 5 .
On the next day Rajneesh officials announced details of their program to bring 1,000 homeless to Rajneeshpuram .
As the street people poured in , other residents of Wasco County became aroused .
Among other thngs [ sic ] , they feared that the Rajneeshees would attempt to register and vote the street people in the coming election ; possibly even elect county commissioners favorable to the Rajneeshees .
Large protest meetings were held in The Dalles and other places .
The issue became very hot and heavy , with both Rajneeshees and other Oregon citizens saying some very harsh things about each other .
The person who spoke for the Rajneeshees most frequently was a woman called Ma Anand Sheela , the personal secretary of the Bhagwan .
On September 18 press reports quoted Ma Anand Sheela saying to a rally :
You tell your Governor , your attorney general and all the bigoted pigs outside that if one person on Rancho Rajneesh is harmed I will have 15 of their heads , and I mean it .
You have given me no choice .
Even though I am a nonviolent person I will do that .
Ma Anand Sheela has been photographed wearing a holster with a revolver in it .
On the next day , September 19 , Ma Anand Sheela was again quoted in newspapers : “ Wasco County is so bigoted it deserves to be taken over . ”
There were a number of reports of people who threatened to come to Rajneeshpuram with shotguns .
But there were no reports of people who actually did .
Nor were there reports of any Rajneeshees who were harmed by outsiders .
Nor were there any reports of Rajneeshees harming anyone else .
One of the things that first aroused my concern about the Rajneeshees was a statement I saw the Mayor of Rajneeshpuram make on a TV program .
He said : “ If we are forced to we will take over Oregon .
If we are forced to . ”
Recently the same man , Swami Krishna Deva , was quoted by the Associated Press as saying : “ If we need to take arms to battle bigotry , we will . ”
The Rajneesh Medical Corporation has a well equipped medical laboratory at Rajneeshpuram .
A final story .
This story was told to the Subcommittee on Mining , Forest Management and BPA which I chair at a hearing I conducted in Portland , OR in December 1984 .
It is related by County Judge William Hulse of Wasco County .
On August 29 , a few weeks before the salmonella outbreak , the three county commissioners of Wasco County drove down to Rajneeshpuram to make an inspection .
They drove into Rajneeshpuram where they were stopped and asked to continue their inspection in a Rajneesh vehicle .
As they got in , Ma Anand Sheela came to the van and said to them : “ Snakes should sit in the back seats . ”
Judge Hulse continued :
When we returned to our car , a tire was flat .
The Rajneesshees agreed to fix the tire and as we waited by the car , someone from the Rajneesh medical laboratory bought us out a pitcher of water and three cups .
We thanked her and drank the water .
The tire was fixed and we drove back to The Dalles .
Within about 8 hours I became violently ill , with some sort of stomach and bowel upset .
Later I went to the hospital .
I was in the hospital 2 days .
The doctor said I might have died .
Another county commissioner came down with what appeared to be the same thing , though he was not hospitalized .
The third commissioner was considered by us to be sympathetic to the Rajneeshees .
He did not get sick . ”
Mr. Speaker , I conclude my story by calling for an intensive police investigation of the salmonella outbreak in The Dalles .
Edinburgh 's Evening News has discovered that , when it comes to personal privacy , Google 's Street View is a strictly one - way thoroughfare .
The paper was alerted yesterday that several examples of the Orwellian spycar fleet were being prepared for action at a disused garage site in Drum Brae South .
It duly dispatched a snapper to record the action , but when he " began to capture the teams setting up the roof - mounted cameras , he was threatened with legal action " .
Photographer Ian Georgeson explained : " I was standing on public ground taking photos of the cars when one of the drivers came over and said that they did n't want us to print their faces .
He said if I used any shots of him they would sue us , because they were concerned about reprisals .
" He admitted they were a bit concerned about the way people would react to the cameras , but said they would be in Edinburgh for a couple of months at least trying to map the city . "
Guy Herbert of UK civil liberties group No2ID told the Evening News : " That is an extraordinary situation , but it does seem to be the case that while large organisations , traditionally the police or councils , are happy to photograph the public , they are less keen on being photographed themselves .
" It would be interesting to see just what legal grounds they think they have to stop their picture being used that would n't also apply to the pictures they are taking , and I think they would be on pretty treacherous ground . "
A spokesgooglette said the search monolith had " no problem with the cars being photographed , but admitted it did not want staff to be hindered in any way " .
She concluded : " We are happy for people to take pictures of the cars - they are clearly identified as working for Google .
We would not want our staff to be in any way stopped from doing their job , however . "
Well , we 're glad Google has no objection to people snapping its sinister black Opels , because here are the 110 or so sightings to date on El Reg 's splendid Spot - the - Street - View Web 0.2 mashup :

The Scientists and Engineers for America ( SEA ) released the results of a phone poll performed early in June that show the US public is strongly in favor of addressing many of the country 's problems through scientific innovation .
Although there were partisan differences on specific issues , majorities in both parties favor dedicating federal funding for scientific research , including that directed to climate change .
The poll may help the organization 's campaign to get Congressional and Presidential candidates to commit to positions on science policy issues .
The poll was conducted in mid-June , and involved a phone survey of over 1,000 US voters .
Subjects were asked whether science policy issues , including education , health care , energy , and climate change would influence their votes .
Candidates who were in favor of scientific solutions to these issues were more likely to receive the votes of a majority of those polled , in some cases much more likely .
Strong majorities ( roughly 85 percent ) favored candidates that supported science education efforts and research directed toward improving healthcare , with a majority of voters saying those candidates were much more likely to get their vote .
Nearly 80 percent would support candidates that proposed handling energy issues through scientific research , and 70 percent had a similar opinion on the related issue of climate change .
Perhaps most significantly , all of the questions were phrased specifically in terms of spending federal money .
When asked more generally about federal funding of science , over 70 percent would support candidates that favored government research funding
In general , many Republicans are on record as being against government spending , and there were partisan splits on nearly every question , with independents lining up roughly in the middle .
The smallest difference came in the area of education , where Republicans were about 10 percent less supportive than Democrats ( 80 vs. 92 percent ) .
The split was in the area of 15 - 20 percent on the remaining issues , with the exception of climate change , where 84 percent of Democrats favored candidates who were willing to fund research on the issue ; a slight majority of Republicans did .
Still , that majority places the Republican electorate well in front of their federal representatives .
At a press conference announcing the poll , Lesley Stone , SEA 's Executive Director , said the poll was decisive .
" It 's really clear to me from the poll that public policy decisions need to be based on science , " she said , " that 's what the public thinks . "
Shawn Otto , from Science Debate 2008 went further , suggesting that a preference for scientific solutions to issues have become , " an important part of the American psyche and the American way of life . "
Vint Cerf was on hand as well , and he called the US ' poor broadband service and the lack of a national policy an example of where a governmental focus on technology was holding the US back .
He suggested candidates should be willing to take some bold steps : commit to a neutral ' Net and reevaluate the way regulations have fostered a market where there 's no facilities - based competition .
Although the numbers look good for science , it 's important to keep in mind that people responding to polls often do not rationalize their answers with their other beliefs ; the public will happily decide to spend money on research , but will be less likely to favor actually paying for it through taxes .
Similarly , it 's one thing to favor an improved science education , but the public is very ambiguous about actually implementing a rigorous biology curriculum .
As Neal Lane , a former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy put it , " the public thinks about the science differently depending on how the question is asked . "
But the panelists generally agreed that the numbers from these polls make science and technology funding in line with other topics that the public cares deeply about , and that alone should be sufficient reason for candidates to spell out where they stand .
Referring to a set of questions that Science Debate 2008 has sent to the Presidential candidates , Lane said , " a thoughtful answer to these questions can do an enormous amount of good in helping the electorate understand the issues and also know where they are relative to this particular candidate 's view . "
To make it easier to pin a relevant candidate down on the Congressional level , the SEA has created a site that lets you find your candidates and send science - related questions on to them .

Science Debate 2008 has formulated 14 questions on science policy for the Presidential candidates .

The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update finds a precise tie between John McCain and Barack Obama , with 45 % of nationwide registered voters currently supporting each candidate for president .
The two have been closely matched in Gallup Poll Daily tracking for the last 11 days , with neither candidate enjoying a statistically significant lead ( though Obama has typically held a slim advantage ) .
Thus , the candidates enter this intense , back - to - back convention period even , after Obama enjoyed a slight advantage throughout the summer .
The National Democratic Convention begins Monday in Denver with the Republicans ' convention begins Sept. 1 in Minneapolis .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
On Saturday , after much speculation , Obama finally named his vice presidential running mate , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden .
Initial public reaction to Biden 's selection appears rather unenthusiastic , according to a special Biden reaction poll conducted by USA Today and Gallup on Saturday .
Typically , presidential candidates have gotten a bump in the polls after naming their vice presidential running mate .
Obama apparently received no immediate benefit in the polls from naming Biden as Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviews conducted during the day on Saturday still showed Obama and McCain closely matched in voter preferences for president .
The first Gallup three - day rolling average in which all interviews will have been conducted entirely after the announcement of Obama 's vice presidential selection will be reported by Gallup on Tuesday , and will give a clearer assessment of its impact on voter preferences in the presidential race .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Aug. 21 - 23 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,625 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

You should know by now that ignorance is what the Republicans hope for when election time comes around , and thus far , they have been blessed with an abundance of ignorance by the American people .
This is the only way that they can win an election , coupled with vote fraud .

There was a time , not so long ago , when the collapse / government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was simply unthinkable , impossible , these were semi-quasi capitalist dealers in the most stable of markets , mortgage dealers and brokers in the United States , a safe , stable , consistently rational cash machine if there ever was one .
Now both of those corporations are busted , along with the other once - unthinkable events of $ 4.00 gas , 4,000 dead in Iraq for lies , and the President trapped in DC from searing shame , shunned even at his own Party ’s convention .
No one in living memory has ever seen a VP pick chosen without vetting her , either , but the myriad of extraordinarily new and painful events assailing America has never meant dick to Republicans as long as they get elected .
The new records for those without health insurance , the record rate of ice melt at the poles from global warming , the ever - growing army of the unemployed , why , they had as much chance as being acknowledged during Hate Week -- speech after speech of personal vitriolic attacks called the Republican Convention -- as John McCain ’s marital history .
As if to cheerfully sprinkle acid on the open wounds of the country John McCain lied without compunction about Barack Obama ’s record and tax proposals , right after his campaign grossly insulted the intelligence of field mice by proclaiming Sarah Palin obtained foreign policy experience by osmosis ( living close to Russia ) and collaborating with the Alaska National Guard , a childish lie any four - year - old would n’t be stupid enough to try .
Instantly battered and buffeted in a hurricane of rightfully earned scorn and contempt at the laughable stabs at any political legitimacy at all , in any country , the McCain campaign then amazingly whined that it was the American journalism corps , yes , that enabling warmongering corporate gaggle of nauseating kiss - assers , why , they were the ones smearing Sarah Palin .
John McCain recently hired the stinking , odious consultants who racially smeared him using one of his adopted children ( Jesus save us ) in the 2000 campaign .
John McCain and the Republicans have earned the right to judge others on the horrors of smearing , you see .
Possessing no shame in the least , the McCain " campaign " then punked the American " journalism " corps , putting a total lockdown on not only questions to Palin , but any questions at all about Palin , to anyone .
Republicans yesterday spun this as smart move , saying more of this utter humiliation to America would hurt McCain and the country , an authoritarian mendacious repressive creep who ca n’t even answer questions from sycophants is what the country gets for Vice President , just shut up and take it , Americans .
The total contempt and scorn for any dignity at all for any American citizen from the McCain " campaign " and the American " journalism " corps knows no putrid depths .
How little they think of us , utterly stupid tools of manipulative capitalism , worth nothing more than snotty denial for the all the pain , death and servitude we ’re put through .
As stated before , the United States wallows in this contemptible clown show of politics because we have a screaming joke of a " journalism " corps , McCain and the Republicans have watched for years as Bush was enabled of anything , including another Vietnam , for Chrissakes , with the most childish of lies and rationalizations , they know full well they can get away with it .
I watched the odious Brian Williams last night , he who drives a $ 400,000 Porsche in the employ of General Electric , perform a laughably shallow " coverage " of the day ’s political events that could not have lasted more than 300 seconds , the last shameful story of the wrong Walter Reid image used in McCain ’s speech missing even that context , meandering around the ludicrous repeat (! ) of the green background instead .
Perky , pretty , and empty - headed Kelly O’Donnell yapped the McCain campaign still had Palin under total lockdown , as if the outrage were just the color of her dress .
After this ludicrously empty and stupid political reporting , inform the viewers we ’re still on our knees to McCain and Republicans , willing to undergo any humiliation to pretend we report news and truth ?
Heavens no .
McCain is behind in several Bush win states , is 72 years old , has lying stupid VP who ca n’t even talk to the press , lies like a carpet whenever he can himself , and has no solution for any of the crises assailing America that he himself is greatly responsible for , hell , he wo n’t even bring them up in his acceptance speech !
Not even NBC can let you get away with that , John McCain .
You and the American journalism corps are about to find out what happens when you hold the people of America is such shameful contempt , we are not idiots , and nothing is going to stop Barack Obama from being elected President , not after these latest outrages of contempt for our souls and citizenship .
First Dispatch from the war zone :
I live in a war zone .
Not a metaphorical war zone , an actual one .
Armed soldiers patrol my street daily in full combat gear with loaded weapons .
The squads have fully automatic rifles and a fifty caliber machine gun mounted on one of their Hummers .
There have been over 900 war - related deaths in this city alone this year , but I do not live in the Middle East .
I live two miles from the U.S. Border in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico .
The war is the war on drugs .
Juarez is on the other side of the Rio Grande from El Paso , Texas .
It has half the area of El Paso , but twice the population .
Even though El Paso is the fourth poorest city in the U.S. , Juarez workers ( including the police ) make about twenty five percent of what their counterparts north of the border make .
The enormous profits from the drugs going north and the guns coming south are simply too much of a temptation for many of the law - enforcement officers and other otherwise honest people to resist .
The most recent surge in violence started about a year ago when Mexican President Felipe Calderon signed a deal with President Bush called the Merida Initiative ( or Plan Mexico ) to step up enforcement in the border area .
Bush committed to provide 1.4 billion dollars in military aid to Mexico and Calderon started stepping up the pressure on the cartels and the corrupt local cops .
There were early successes , but then all hell started to break loose .
The problem was that as the local group known as La Linea started to loose it 's grip , another cartel from Sinaloa started moving in to fill the void .
President Calderon 's troops unintentionally were aiding one side in a war between two criminal organizations .
Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , the local boss , hired a group of ex-military mercenaries –known as the Zetas–to help him maintain control .
The Zetas brutally gunned down many police officers who were formerly on Carrillo 's payroll for suspected disloyalty and defection to the Sinaloa cartel headed by Joaqun Guzman Loera , known as “ el Chapo ” ( Shorty ) .
The fact that many of them did not defect–but were rather just prevented from aiding Carrillo by the Army and the other Federales–made no difference .
Most of the cops that were n't killed resigned or were fired for failing lie- detector and other “ trustworthiness ” tests .
With almost no cops left , the streets started running red with blood .
Living in a war zone is not fun .
The cost of living is low in terms of money but high in terms of risk .
I am stuck here until I can get a visa for my wife , a Mexican national .
The house across the street from us was raided by the cops a year ago , but no drugs were found .
The owners fled , but the looters took everything , including the front door .
It was a really nice house with trees and a pool .
Now the place is abandoned and decaying .
Gang signs are spray painted all over it .
The Mexican Army that was brought in has so far been relatively free from corruption although they have made no noticeable impact on the amount of violence or the quantity of drugs running through the area .
There have been growing reports of human rights violations from soldiers , who are simply a poor substitute for civilian police .
A scandal broke out when it was revealed that the U.S. military was teaching them torture techniques to obtain information .
The random warrantless searches and checkpoints make me nervous .
We are not allowed to photograph or film them .
I do n't think they are winning this war because they only operate during daylight hours ( as far as I 've seen ) and they often look scared .
How long they can resist being corrupted themselves on a $ 500 / month salary is the question I wonder about .
Obviously , all this could be avoided if drugs were legalized in the U.S. and guns were legalized in Mexico .
Sure , addictions may increase but that would be less of a problem if the drugs were more affordable .
At least addicts would n't have to prostitute themselves , steal or rob to get high .
The U.S. would have at least 1.4 billion more dollars to help addicts if we did n't have to give the aid to Mexico .
Honest Mexicans could defend themselves rather than relying on the now almost non-existent police force .
One last thing before I sign out for the night .
Many of the Zetas , the ex-military mercenaries responsible for many of the murders , were trained by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency before they switched sides to make more money .
Your tax dollars at work , folks .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Farming kangaroos instead of sheep and cattle in Australia could cut by almost a quarter the greenhouse gases produced by grazing livestock , which account for 11 percent of the nation ’s annual emissions , said a new study .
Removing seven million cattle and 36 million sheep by 2020 and replacing them with 175 million kangaroos , to produce the same amount of meat , could lower national greenhouse gases by 3 percent a year , said the University of New South Wales study .
Methane from the foregut of cattle and sheep constitutes 11 percent of Australia ’s total greenhouse emissions , but kangaroos produce negligible amounts of methane , said the study .
The study said methane was a principal concern in climate change because more than 500 million metric tons of the gas entered the atmosphere annually , which exceeds the amount that can be naturally removed .
Methane ’s warming potential over a 100 - year time frame is 21 times higher than that of carbon dioxide , but its chemical lifetime in the atmosphere is only 8 to 12 years compared with carbon dioxide ’s 100 years .
“ Therefore , reducing methane production is an attractive short - term target for mitigating global warming , ” said the study published in the latest edition of the international journal “ Conservation Letters ” .
However , the study said changing farming practices in Australia , which is one of the world ’s top wool and beef producers but sells by comparison only small amounts of kangaroo meat for human consumption , would not be easy .
“ The change will require large cultural and social adjustments and reinvestment .
One of the impediments to change is protective legislation and the status of kangaroos as a national icon , ” it said .
The kangaroo is on Australia ’s coat of arms , but farmers regard the country ’s 34 million kangaroos as pests that compete for grazing pastures with sheep and cattle .
Australia is trying to develop a carbon emissions trading system by 2010 , but the government has said agriculture would be excluded from the scheme .
Australia ’s greenhouse emissions totals 576 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent , or about 1.5 percent of world emissions .
But Australia emits 28.1 metric tons of carbon per person , the highest per capita in the developed world and five times more per person than China , due to use of coal for electricity .
Transport and energy accounts for the largest amount of emissions , at 69.6 percent , with agriculture creating 15.6 percent .
Sheep and cattle alone produce 10.9 percent of emissions .
The study said farmers had few options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than changing feed stock , reducing livestock numbers or changing species .
The study cited the growth of wildlife industries such as springbok farming in South Africa , red deer in Britain and bison in the United States .
“ Using kangaroos to produce low - emission meat is an option for the Australian rangelands ... and could even have global application , ” said the study .

A new CNN / Opinion Research poll has the presidential race has the presidential race between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack dead tied at 48 % .
Even with Ralph Nader and Bob Barr factored into the race , Obama and McCain are still tied at 45 % .
According to the poll , the 2008 presidential race has been a virtual tie for the last three weeks .
The biggest lead that either candidate has had since the end of the end of the primaries has been eight points .
Interestingly , the poll also revealed that there has been no Palin bounce for McCain .
Fifty one percent of all men said that they would vote for McCain , and 52 % of women said that they would vote for Obama .
I believe that Palin may have been able to give the McCain campaign a bounce ; if they would have let her do some network appearances alone .
So far , both the CBS poll and the CNN poll have the race tied .
You can throw out the worthless Gallup Daily poll , which both campaigns agree is trash this is why they never cite it .
( For those of you who are interested in polling , the Gallup daily poll has some serious methodology issues , which is why it often differs from Gallup ’s regular poll for this election ) .

These poll results demonstrate how pointless the political conventions have become .
Sure , they give each campaign a week of free media , but with the Internet and 24 hour cable news , voters no longer have to depend on heavily choreographed events like the conventions to get to know their candidates .
The only speeches that people watch are the acceptance speeches .
I do n’t think that the Palin selection is working out the way the McCain camp had hoped .
They wanted Palin to sway women voters , and give them a huge bounce heading into the fall .
Neither has happened .
The last two presidential elections have been so close that national polls should be taken with a serious grain of salt .
This race is going to be decided in a series of swing states .
The macro view of this campaign comes from the national polls , but it is the micro campaign on a state , and even local level , that will determine who the next president of the United States will be .
This is a close race in a polarized nation , but after the results of the last two presidential elections , would anyone expect anything less ?
On April 17 2008 US Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) introduced two bills addressing the federal penalties for marijuana possession and the use of medical marijuana .
The first decriminalization bill introduced in Congress for the last 24 years .
The first bill HR5843 , co-sponsored by Reps , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) and William Lacy ( D - MO ) would eliminate all existing federal penalties including arrest , incarceration and fines that prohibit the possession and personal use of less than 100 grams of marijuana .
According to Congressman Frank
“ It is poor law enforcement to keep on the books legislation that establishes as a crime something in which society does not seriously wish to prosecute . ”
He then followed up by saying , “ Having federal law enforcement agents engaged in the prosecution of people who are personally using marijuana is a waste of scarce resources better used for serious crimes . ”
A national poll in Oct. 2007 conducted by CNN found that 40 percent of those surveyed favored possession of small quantities of marijuana , while 70 percent thought that offenders should be fined but not jailed .
There are currently 12 states that have passed laws decriminalizing marijuana for personal use : : Alaska , California , Colorado , Maine , Minnesota , Mississippi , Nevada , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , and Oregon .
In the other bill authored by Franks , HR 5842 , cosponsored by Reps. Paul , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) , Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , and Sam Farr ( D - CA ) , would force the DEA and other federal authorities to respect states ’ current laws on medicinal cannabis and end DEA raids on facilities distributing medical marijuana legally under state law .
“ When doctors recommend the use of marijuana for their patients and states are willing to permit it , I think it 's wrong for the federal government to subject either the doctors or the patients to criminal prosecution , ” Frank said .
“ The norm in America is for the states to decide whether particular behaviors should be made criminal . ”

There are currently 12 states that have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from prosecution : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington .
To date the DEA continues to raid medical marijuana dispensaries operating in these states , enforcing the war on drugs , free Americans .
VIEW POINT :
The first time I knowingly violated the law and smoked marijuana was in 1967 … and yes I inhaled .
At that time here in California the penalty for possession of even a seed was 5 to life .
Our trusted government back then proved in laboratory studies that “ marijuana turned otherwise normal human beings into psychotic lunatics that were capable of suicide and other acts of violence without just case or provocation . ”
We 've come a long way !
Demand the immediate release of all people serving time for possession of marijuana , especially life sentences .

Just a quick word for people who may be curious about the development of OCaml Batteries Included .
Work is proceeding nicely and we ’re getting close to a first official release .
We ’ve moved things around quite a lot recently , worked on the documentation and added a few nice features ( read - only strings and arrays , uniform numeric modules with type - class - style dictionaries ) .
We ’re about to add Unicode support for inputs and outputs ( based on Camomile ) and an improved Scanf module and that should be it for a first release .
A new preview tarball has just been uploaded on the Forge , as well as a new preview documentation .
As a side - note , the Haskell community seems to be involved much in the same process as Batteries Included , with the Haskell Platform , aka Haskell Batteries Included .
Both their schedule and their list of packages seem a little more precise than ours but the overall objective remains the same : take a great programming language used mostly by academics and turn it into a complete development platform able to compete with the best the industrial world is able to offer .
The main difference , it seems , is that the Haskell Platform does n’t have a glue layer designed to uniformize APIs .
The other main difference , I ’m afraid , is that the Haskell community seems much larger these days than the OCaml community — or perhaps just more active or more verbal .
It is my hope that a larger and more convenient standard library will help draw ( back ? ) both academics and developers to the OCaml world .
A little more academic support would n’t hurt , of course .
Back to OCaml Batteries Included , I hope we ’ll be able release by October 10th .
At that point , we ’ll need beta - testing and it will be time to decide of what should get into Batteries Included 0.2 .
I ’m sure everyone has ideas and suggestions — it will soon be time to share them .

The US Airways Center will be the latest venue to benefit from alternative power , as the Phoenix Suns have announced plans to utilize solar panels , one of only a few professional sports organizations to currently do so .
Enough energy will be provided from the panels to reduce energy usage by roughly 26 home games , says Suns General Manager Steve Kerr .
In other words , it will be as if 26 Suns basketball games never occurred at the US Airways Center , which means a big improvement on power consumption .
Also , 440,000 pounds of carbon dioxide are expected to be eliminated each year .
A total of 1,100 panels at 194 kilowatts on the parking garage ’s fifth level will make this feat possible , providing a green mentality that celebrated Canadian and Suns point guard Steve Nash can get behind .
Nash has long been a big proponent for eco-friendly sports venues and green initiatives as a whole , so the star should be pleased with his team ’s efforts , which are likely to be expanded to include the use of green cleaning products by the maintenance crew , and more .
Nash is even apparently installing solar panels at his home – perhaps we should call him Apollo Nash ?
The new installation will run the Suns about $ 1.5 million , but the Arizona Public Service Co. will rebate the team $ 60,000 to $ 85,000 each year as part of their commendable renewable energy incentive program .
However , the Suns wo n’t be ponying up cash themselves any time soon , and fans wo n’t be seeing an increase in ticket prices , concession costs or anything similar to make up the difference .
Instead , the organization is teaming up with Tioga Energy , who will conduct panel maintenance for the next 20 years in return for an annual fee paid by the Suns that is contingent on the amount of solar energy produced .
All in all , it seems like a win - win situation for both parties as well as the environment .
And hey , does n’t it all just make sense for the Phoenix Suns ?
Surely there can be some additional beneficial publicity arising from this , too , given the team name .
For the record , the Suns are n’t the first to get in on the eco-friendly action .
The San Francisco Giants were the first baseball team to use solar power , installing 590 panels at AT&T park back in March 2007 .
The Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies have followed suit since , at Fenway Park and Coors Field , respectively .
In August of this year , it was announced that the Staples Center , which houses the Los Angeles Lakers , would receive their own collection of 1,700 solar panels .

My girlfriend and I would like to get married ( goddess willing , when it becomes legal ) and we have an odd problem .
Both of our last names suck .
I mean really suck .
They got both of us teased as children .
Additionally , her first name sounds terrible with my last ( Stumpf ) , and her last has 12 letters ( Braunshausen ) .
We hate them both .
We 're thinking about creating our own last name , that way our children would not be saddled with our crappy names ( since we will probably start having kids before we can legally marry , it needs to be settled soon ) .
But we both feel like that is a little silly , maybe we should just live with what we have ?
We 're debating if we should come up with a combo of them or just make up our own damn name .
What do you think ?
What would you do ?
Neuroscientists at Children 's Hospital Boston have identified the first known " master switch " in brain cells to orchestrate the formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses , essential for proper brain function .
The factor , called Npas4 , regulates more than 200 genes that act in various ways to calm down over - excited cells , restoring a balance that is thought to go askew in some neurologic disorders .
Synapses , the connections between brain cells , can be excitatory or inhibitory in nature .
At birth , the rapidly developing brain teems with excitatory synapses , which tend to make nerve cells " fire " and stimulate their neighbors .
But if the excitation is n't eventually balanced , it can lead to epilepsy , and diseases like autism and schizophrenia have been associated with an imbalance of excitation and inhibition .
The creation of inhibitory connections is also necessary to launch critical periods -- windows of rapid learning during early childhood and adolescence , when the brain is very " plastic " and able to rewire itself .
Npas4 is a transcription factor , a switch that activates or represses other genes .
The researchers , led by Michael Greenberg , PhD , director of the Neurobiology Program at Children 's , demonstrated that the activity of as many as 270 genes changes when Npas4 activity is blocked in a cell , and that Npas4 activation is associated with an increased number of inhibitory synapses on the cell 's surface .
The team further showed that Npas4 is activated by excitatory synaptic activity .
" Excitation turns on a program that says , ' this cell is getting excited , we need to balance that with inhibition , ' " explains Greenberg , who now also chairs the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School .
Finally , the researchers bred live mice that lacked Npas4 , and found evidence of neurologic problems – the mice appeared anxious and hyperactive and were prone to seizures .
Greenberg and colleagues are now trying to learn more about the wide variety of genes that Npas4 regulates , each of which could give clues to synapse development and reveal new treatment possibilities for neurologic disorders .
" If you have your hand on a transcription factor such as Npas4 , new genome - wide technology allows you to essentially identify every target of the transcription factor , " says Greenberg .
One such target is neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , which Greenberg and colleagues previously showed to regulate the maturation and function of inhibitory synapses .
Children 's researchers Takao Hensch , PhD , and Michela Fagiolini , PhD , also in the Neurobiology program , plan to study the Npas4 - lacking mice to see if they have abnormalities in the initiation of critical periods ; colleague Chinfei Chen , MD , PhD , will also study the mice , further probing how their synapses develop .
The study was supported by the F.M. Kirby Foundation , the Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation , the Lefler Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .
Yingxi Lin , PhD , was first author .

1. Flag of the United States : The Stars and Stripes
Supposedly , it was George Washington himself who proclaimed " We take the stars from Heaven , the red from our mother country , separating it by white stripes , thus showing that we have separated from her , and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty . "
Lower Left : Colonial Flag , used chiefly by Colonies of New England before the Revolutionary War. Lower Right : Bunker Hill Flag , used by New England troops at the battle of Bunker Hill .
Upper Left : Pine Tree Flag of the Navy , used by the American ships early in the Revolutionary War. Upper Right : Rattlesnake flag , used early in Revolutionary War.
Center Left : First National Flag , used in 1776 , before the Declaration of Independence .
Center Right : The Present " Star Spangled Banner " ( Image : History of the US , a high school text book in 1885 [ wikipedia ] )
At the time of the signing of the Declaration Independence , the United States of America had no official national flag .
The Grand Union Flag is considered to be the first national flag of the United States , though it did n't have any official status .
In 1777 , the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution stating that the national flag of the United States has 13 red and white stripes , and 13 white stars in a blue field .
But it did n't specify the arrangement of the stars .
One popular story is that George Washington asked Betsy Ross to design and sew the flag ( Betsy decided to use a 5 - pointed star instead of 6 to save time ) .
Though this story is accepted as historical fact by most Americans , historians doubted it as the only evidence was the words of her only surviving grandson .
Since then , a new star is added to the flag when a new state joined the Union ( in 1795 , 2 stars and 2 stripes were added when Kentucky and Vermont became states , but the number of stripes subsequently reverted back to 13 ) .
When Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood , people sent in more than 1,500 new flag designs to President Eisenhower .
One of the designs was submitted by a 17 - year - old high school student named Bob Heft , who first created it as a school project .
He got a B - for it ( for " lack of originality " ) , though his teacher agreed to change his grade if his design was accepted .
When Bob 's flag design was chosen , his teacher changed the grade to an A ! ( Source )
2. The Flag of Afghanistan
Afghanistan is a landlocked country in south - central Asia .
It is not particularly rich in natural resources , but its geographical location made it a crossroad between the East and the West .
Throughout history , Afghanistan has probably seen more wars and conquests than any other piece of land in the world .
A true reflection of its history , the Afghan national flag has had more changes during the 20th century than flags of any other countries in the world .
Phew .

3. Flag of the United Kingdom : the Union Jack
Image credit : Guilherme Paula [ wikipedia ]
The national flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the royal banner known as the Union Flag or more popularly the Union Jack .
Its current design is the combination of the red Cross of St. George ( patron saint of England ) , the white red Saltire ( or X - shaped cross ) of St. Patrick of Ireland and the white Saltire of Saint Andrew of Scotland .
Why is it called the Union Jack ?
Some people say because it was named after King James I of Great Britain ( after Jacobus , Latin for James ) who introduced the flag ; others say that the " jack " refers to the jackstaff , a small pole in the bow of the ship used to fly flags - and since Britain 's navy was formidable , the name Union Jack stuck .
If you look closely at the Union Jack , you 'll notice that the diagonal red and white stripes are n't symmetrical .
Here 's the story behind it :
In 1801 , an Act of Union which made Ireland a co-equal member of the United Kingdom made it necessary to add a symbol for Ireland to the flag , but without obliterating any of the existing symbols .
If the St. Patrick 's cross had been centered on the diagonal stripes , then St. Andrew 's cross would have been relegated to an inferior position , basically serving only as a border for St. Patrick's .
But Scotland was the senior of the two kingdoms , so this was unsatisfactory .
The solution was to divide the diagonal stripes diagonally , so that the red St. Patrick 's cross would take up only half of each stripe , and so that half devoted to St. Andrew would take the place of honor .
Thus , in the two hoist quarters , the white St. Andrew 's cross occupies the upper position , and in the two fly quarters , the red St. Patrick 's cross occupies the upper position .

But what happened to Wales ?
The Flag of Wales , The Red Dragon or Y Ddraig Goch , is n't represented in the Union Jack because Wales was annexed by England in 1282 .
With the Laws in Wales Act 1535 - 1542 , it is legally part of the Kingdom of England and thus represented under the St. George 's Cross flag .
4. Flag of Albania
Albania has one of the most kick ass flags around : the two - headed eagle design was derived from a 15th century Albanian warrior named Gjergj Skanderbeg , the Dragon of Albania ( who , ironically , had a two - headed eagle as a seal , not a dragon ) .
Skanderbeg , in turn , got the design from an ancient Byzantine heraldry .
The evolution of the flag of Albania is as follows :
5. Flag of Libya
The flag of Libya is ... green .
Green , and nothing but green - in fact , it 's the only national flag in the world with only one color and no design or insignia .
Green is the traditional color of Islam , the state religion of Libya , and also symbolizes Gaddafi's " Green Revolution , " where he overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969 .
6. Flag of the Seychelles
Seychelles is an archipelago nation of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean east of Africa .
The country has 3 flags since its independence in 1976 from the British Commonwealth .
In the current flag , the blue band represents the sky and the sea that surrounds the island nation , the yellow band is the sun , the red symbolizes the people , the white band represents social justice and harmony , and the green band depicts the country 's land and nature .
7. Flag of the Philippines
The present - day national flag of the Philippines has elements of the flags flown by the Katipunan secret society during the Philippine Revolution .
The Pambansang bandila ( " National Flag " ) was first conceptualized by General Emilio Aguinaldo during his exile in Hong Kong in 1897 and hand sewn by Marcela Agoncillo , her daughter Lorenzo and a friend named Josefina Herbosa de Natividad .
Though the Katipunan flags are n't considered national flags ( and thus not a direct precursor of the current flag ) , their varieties and designs deserve a mention ( plus what other national flag has a Jolly Roger ? )
Some of the Katipunan generals have their own personal flags :
Anyway , here is the evolution of the Philippine national flag :
Actually , the blue color has been changed at least 5 times in the Philippines flag ( read more about the blue shade debate here )
Obviously this article is woefully incomplete .
There 193 recognized countries ( more if you count special entities and territories ) in the world , and we 've only covered a handful .
So if your country is n't listed and you think that its flag deserves a mention , please write about it in the comment section .

Japanese parts manufacturer Shimano is launching an electronic shifting system for high - end road bikes that it claims will vastly improve performance and reduce maintenance .
By replacing the conventional levers that pull wound - steel cables through protective housings with solid - state switches and rubber - coated wires , there 's no chance for road gunk to clog things up and interfere with shifting , or , for that matter , your post - ride beer .
The principle of an electronically controlled drive train is to execute perfect shifts every time , thus " reducing mental overhead , " in the words of Shimano marketing manager Devin Walton .
This is a resource cyclists find in short supply during epic rides .
Thursday 's announcement that the system , called Di2 , will hit shops in January 2009 settles a question first raised in 2005 when prototypes began cropping up on the bikes of select Shimano - sponsored racers in the pro peloton .
The system 's development has been photographed , chronicled and Angsted over ever since .
But if the existence of electronic shifting comes as no surprise , its weigh - in certainly should .
During a recent telephone interview , an industry insider who spoke on condition of anonymity stopped cold amid a why - do - we - need - this diatribe , upon learning that Di2 weighs less than Shimano 's current generation of parts .
According to the company , Di2 will be 67 grams lighter than the current Dura - Ace 7800 and only 68 grams heavier than Dura - Ace 7900 , the snazzy forthcoming 2009 suite of parts .
" I 'll be going to hell , " said the source , who then fell silent – no doubt converting grams to ounces to fractions of a pound to the limitless advantages of such weight savings .
That 's at least an extra Clif Bar .
Di2's front derailleur automatically adjusts itself so the chain does n't rub as you shift .
Shimano plans to offer the electronic setup as an upgrade option within the 7900 group – which is preselling for $ 2,600 – so parts such as the two - tone cranks and brakes will be the same .
( No word yet on the additional cost for electric ; it could be double . )
Di2 consists of two brake - and - shift levers , two derailleurs whose springs have been replaced by servo-motors , a 7.4 - volt lithium - ion battery pack , and the wiring harness that connects everything .
The derailleurs , whose job is to move the chain from gear to gear as you shift , talk to each other and automatically adjust so the chain does n't rub .
They also calibrate themselves , so you do n't have to play with cable tension to maintain shift quality as cables stretch and the chain and cogs wear .
And although the control buttons have been placed in the traditional location behind the brake levers – so as not to confuse anyone or overly tax that mental overhead – they could be integrated with the ends of time - trial bars , the top of the handlebars or just about anywhere a rider might find convenient .
Still , the advantage that people who 've experienced the system talk about is how little effort it takes to change gears .
A quick nudge to one of the shift switches signals a motorized worm gear in the derailleur to instantly move the precise amount it needs to .
Fractions of a second later , the chain snaps into position .
Chris d'Aluisio , director of advanced research and development for Specialized , likens the difference between mechanical and electric shifting to the difference between driving a race car with a manual transmission and one with F - 1 style paddle shifters .
" You can stay on the gas and flip through the gears with no hesitation , " said d'Aluisio .
" It 's seamless power . "
Frankie Andreu , who raced in nine Tours de France , described the shifting as " immediate and very smooth and accurate ....
It 's super nice . "
Even my curmudgeonly unidentified source said , " The shifting is mind - blowing : I mean , you just touch the button , and it shifts . "
The shift buttons are located in the traditional place – behind the brake levers – but they could go anywhere without affecting the performance of the system .
But let 's not lose perspective .
Shimano is n't the first company to attempt electronic shifting .
Mavic introduced Zap in 1994 and then a wireless version called Mektronic in 2000 , neither of which survived .
Zap 's wires proved to be less than waterproof , and Mektronic was finicky to set up properly .
Shimano , notorious for its rigorous testing gauntlet , is betting that its engineers have solved the electricity problem – and so is Campagnolo , a competitor that is on a similar development path but has yet to announce when it will release its system .
The crux of the engineering challenge is making the battery light yet long - lasting , so Shimano 's engineers turned to the hardest - working part in any shifting system : the front derailleur .
It 's also the most temperamental , with a nasty habit of dropping or jamming the chain if the rider does n't modulate his tempo properly while shifting .
( Mavic did n't even go there – only the rear was electric . )
To be fair , the front derailleur has the notably tough job of moving a chain under heavy load between two gears of dramatically different sizes , moving at different speeds .
The Di2 crew knew going in that it would require three or four times the juice of the rear derailleur .
So , when Shimano started out in 2003 , the initial strategy was to throw a bunch of power at the problem , and take advantage of the servo - motor 's massive torque .
But this came at too high a cost , according to former Olympian Wayne Stetina , a Shimano vice president whose primary job is to test equipment and provide feedback to the engineers in Japan .
" As I recall , in 2004 we had a much larger battery that went dead on me several times during long rides , " said Stetina , who has logged 19,000 miles on various iterations of Di2 .
" It could n't last more than three or four hours between charges , and the battery pack and control system weighed nearly a pound . "
Shimano claims that the 7.4 - volt lithium - ion battery will go 1,000 kilometers between charges .
That was n't going to fly in a sport where grams can translate directly into seconds .
The trick would be to conserve power , not squander it .
Shimano 's engineers redesigned the geometry of the front - derailleur to amplify the force , so they could get the necessary output with far less input .
The greater leverage of the new derailleur allowed for a much smaller battery and ultimately shaved half a pound off the system .
Stetina claims the battery consistently lasts 2,000 miles between charges ( which takes 90 minutes ) .
Officially , Shimano says the battery will last for 1,000 kilometers ( 621 miles ) .
The front derailleur does n't actually move with more force or more speed , as you might assume .
It does receive the signal to shift faster than you can send one by cranking on your lever and fighting against friction , spring tension and a lesser mechanical advantage .
More important , it should do the same exact thing , every time , without needing to be coaxed or cursed .
Powered as it is by an electric motor , the front derailleur simply moves a calibrated distance when it 's told .
" It just jams the chain into the big ring , no matter how much load is on it , " d'Aluisio said .
" You do n't lose any momentum , and your legs never stall . "
Road - bike aficionados are much like trout : simultaneously enthralled and mortified by anything shiny and new that enters their environment .
And so it 's not surprising that the first two questions people tend to ask about Di2 are : 1 ) What if the battery dies ?
and 2 ) What if it gets wet ?
Stetina believes he 's personally answered the first .
And besides , he said , there is a battery meter on the Flight Deck computer ( which includes heart rate , altimeter , inclinometer , calorie counter and the ability to download all these details to your PC after the ride ) .
His unscientific - though - admirable strategy for testing the waterproofness of the system has been to blast the components with the high - pressure hose at a coin - op car wash .
Presumably Shimano's engineers in Japan have more - traditional testing methods .
The company prides itself on systems engineering , and has been working on this set of components for more than five years .
How will it work ?
You can find out for yourself when Di2 goes on sale in January .
Call us when you 've put 12,000 miles on it .

Video below of Mike Rogers delivering the award :
Home video footage of Mark Buse and his former partner :
Thanks to the hard work of Mike Rogers and Michelangelo Signorile for exposing this closeted gay man who is critical in helping anti-gay John McCain rise to power .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
In a sharp turnaround , Republican John McCain has opened a 5 - point lead on Democrat Barack Obama in the U.S. presidential race and is seen as a stronger manager of the economy , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
McCain leads Obama among likely U.S. voters by 46 percent to 41 percent , wiping out Obama ’s solid 7 - point advantage in July and taking his first lead in the monthly Reuters / Zogby poll .
The reversal follows a month of attacks by McCain , who has questioned Obama ’s experience , criticized his opposition to most new offshore oil drilling and mocked his overseas trip .
The poll was taken Thursday through Saturday as Obama wrapped up a weeklong vacation in Hawaii that ceded the political spotlight to McCain , who seized on Russia ’s invasion of Georgia to emphasize his foreign policy views .
“ There is no doubt the campaign to discredit Obama is paying off for McCain right now , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ This is a significant ebb for Obama . ”
McCain now has a 9 - point edge , 49 percent to 40 percent , over Obama on the critical question of who would be the best manager of the economy -- an issue nearly half of voters said was their top concern in the November 4 presidential election .
That margin reversed Obama ’s 4 - point edge last month on the economy over McCain , an Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war who has admitted a lack of economic expertise and shows far greater interest in foreign and military policy .
McCain has been on the offensive against Obama during the last month over energy concerns , with polls showing strong majorities supporting his call for an expansion of offshore oil drilling as gasoline prices hover near $ 4 a gallon .
Obama had opposed new offshore drilling , but said recently he would support a limited expansion as part of a comprehensive energy program .

That was one of several recent policy shifts for Obama , as he positions himself for the general election battle .
But Zogby said the changes could be taking a toll on Obama ’s support , particularly among Democrats and self - described liberals .
“ That hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip - flopping is hurting him with liberal voters , ” Zogby said .
Obama ’s support among Democrats fell 9 percentage points this month to 74 percent , while McCain has the backing of 81 percent of Republicans .
Support for Obama , an Illinois senator , fell 12 percentage points among liberals , with 10 percent of liberals still undecided compared to 9 percent of conservatives .
OBAMA NEEDS TO WORK ON BASE
“ Conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for McCain , ” Zogby said .
“ Obama still has work to do on his base .
At this point McCain seems to be doing a better job with his . ”
The dip in support for Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , cut across demographic and ideological lines .
He slipped among Catholics , born - again Christians , women , independents and younger voters .
He retained the support of more than 90 percent of black voters .
“ There were no wild swings , there is n’t one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago .
It was just a steady decline for Obama across the board , ” Zogby said .
Obama ’s support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 , which had been one of his strengths , slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent .
McCain , who will turn 72 next week , was winning 40 percent of younger voters .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ Those are not the numbers Obama needs to win , ” Zogby said about Americans under 30 .
The 47 - year - old is counting on a strong turnout among young voters , a key bloc of support during his primary battle with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton .
It made little difference when independent candidate Ralph Nader and Libertarian Party candidate Bob Barr , who are both trying to add their names to state ballots .
McCain still held a 5 - point edge over Obama , 44 percent to 39 percent , when all four names were included .
Barr earned 3 percent and Nader 2 percent .
Most national polls have given Obama a narrow lead over McCain throughout the summer .
In the Reuters / Zogby poll , Obama had a 5 - point lead in June , shortly after he clinched the Democratic nomination , and an 8 - point lead on McCain in May .
The telephone poll of 1,089 likely voters had a margin of error of 3 percentage points .
The poll was taken as both candidates head into their nominating conventions and the announcements of their choices of vice presidential picks .
The Democratic convention begins on Monday in Denver , with the Republican convention opening the next Monday , September 1 , in St. Paul , Minnesota ..
September 19 , 2008
The neoliberal dogmas that have dominated for more than 25 years are discredited , but they need to be replaced by more than proposals for re-regulating the banks .
THE WORLD financial system is in the grip of the most severe crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s -- and there 's worse to come , not only for the banks and speculators of Wall Street , but far beyond , in every part of the U.S. , and around the globe .
The business world has been struck by a man-made earthquake , and people will be paying for this economic disaster for years to come in a number of ways -- higher prices for food and other necessities , millions of foreclosures and evictions , greater unemployment , growing poverty , government programs cut back or eliminated , and rising tensions throughout society .
The claim will echo around the corporate media that this was the inevitable consequence of all Americans " living beyond their means . "
Do n't believe it .
The vast majority of people who will have to pay the price for this disaster are blameless .
They did nothing wrong .
The crisis was caused by an irrational free - market system and the insatiable greed of a small class of rulers who continually seek greater wealth and power , without regard for the costs .
Wall Street 's meltdown is an indictment of the capitalist system , which has , once again , proven itself " unfit to rule , " as Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote more than 150 years ago .
The immensity of this crisis demands an alternative that goes far beyond new regulations on the banks and government interventions to save whichever band of corporate parasites is failing this week .
Ultimately , it demands a vision of a different kind of society altogether - - a socialist world dedicated to the principles of solidarity , democracy and liberation , rather than the wealth and power of a tiny minority .
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE to exaggerate the scope of what has taken place in the financial world in the past several weeks .
Scenarios that would have been dismissed as the fantasies of radical doomsayers a month ago now appear as accepted fact on the front pages of newspapers like the Wall Street Journal .
The latest previously inconceivable turn of events -- latest , as of Thursday afternoon , when this article was being written , but that does n't mean it will last the week , much less the month -- was the U.S. government 's effective nationalization of the largest insurance company in the world , American Insurance Group ( AIG ) .
When desperate efforts by Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Bank officials to find a private - sector rescuer for AIG failed , the government stepped in with an $ 85 billion loan , payable over two years , in return for effective control of the company .
Set together with the takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac less than 10 days before , the U.S. government -- that neoliberal scourge of nationalization in other countries -- now owns the two largest mortgage companies and the single largest insurance company in the world .
Why , you might wonder , is an insurance company like AIG on the verge of bankruptcy because of a crisis associated with the bursting of the housing bubble and the resulting foreclosures on sub - prime mortgages ?
Good question .
AIG got into trouble almost entirely because of an obscure part of its business -- selling what are called " credit default swaps , " which amount to an insurance policy on investments in bonds .
Basically , AIG was selling financial protection to investors and companies that bought bonds -- if the seller of those bonds defaulted on the promise to pay back the principal , plus interest , investors could cover their losses .
Credit default swaps are pretty much an invention of the last 10 years .
Yet these financial insurance policies today may cover as much as $ 62 trillion worth of debt , according to estimates -- greater , that is , than the total annual production of goods and services of every country of the world .
The sales of credit default swaps accompanied a massive -- and little - examined , until now -- boom in investments based on debt , and especially mortgage debt .
Essentially , Wall Street pushed the expansion in mortgage financing and refinancing to feed a demand for bonds that packaged together large numbers of these loans for sale to big investors .
As these " mortgage - backed securities " became bigger -- and as they came to include a greater and greater proportion of risky sub - prime loans pushed on homebuyers by aggressive mortgage companies -- the big investors who bought the bonds looked for protection against investments going bad .
So the demand for credit default swaps boomed as well .
To AIG executives , it looked like easy money .
They could sell the promise to pay off in the event of defaults , which never seemed to happen while the housing market was booming .
But then the bubble burst , and AIG was suddenly on the hook for immense sums of money .
Essentially , AIG was gambling that they could take in more money by selling this specialized form of insurance than they would ever pay out .
But when this bluff was called by the mortgage crisis , AIG was busted out of the game .
Or it would have been , if AIG had to play by the rules that ordinary people do .
Instead , the insurance giant got help from " the house " -- in the form of the Federal Reserve , which made an $ 85 billion emergency loan this week that put the U.S. government on the line for AIG 's bets on mortgage - backed bonds .
Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had just finished putting their foot down against pleas that they put government funds behind a bailout of the investment bank Lehman Brothers .
Instead , Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy .
Meanwhile , another investment bank , Merrill Lynch , sold itself to Bank of America at a bargain price .
But AIG was different .
The threat of its bankruptcy was n't so much about the company itself , but all the other firms , struggling already because of the crisis , that would incur another loss if AIG went down .
And because AIG 's credit default swap business was unregulated , no one could say with assurance how extensive the damage would be if it failed .
So the government intervened , most of all to protect the other players .
Financial institutions around the world all have their own tangle of high - stakes gambles on everything from the value of mortgage - backed bonds to the future price of oil to the direction of the stock market .
Whether they survive or go under might depend on the money owed to them by a single busted insurance company .
It 's easy to get lost in the details of what has happened -- both the mind - boggling scope of the financial shell game that has been taking place for the last decade , and the unprecedented consequences as government officials and surviving players try to figure out how to unravel the mess .
But it 's important not to lose sight of a larger point :
No one could possibly claim that Wall Street 's high - stakes casino contributed anything to the good of society as a whole .
The entire world of credit default swaps , hedge funds , collateralized debt obligations and the rest of the alphabet soup concocted by Wall Street in this latest boom was directed toward one thing -- make a tiny group of people rich beyond most people 's wildest dreams .
The financial catastrophe unfolding on Wall Street is the product of blind greed and arrogance .
And now that the house of cards is collapsing , the U.S. government 's series of rescues carry another lesson :
The bigger the bet and the wider the potential damage if it loses , the more likely the Feds will have to come to the rescue to stop the whole game from coming to an end .
NOW THAT the full fury of the financial storm has struck , the neoliberal dogmas of the last several decades are out the window - - above all , the belief that the free market can only function at its efficient best if government oversight and regulation is kept to a minimum , if not eliminated outright .
Even Republican presidential nominee John McCain , in his latest speeches , is displaying a previously hidden zeal for financial reform of the " reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street . "
Unfortunately for him , McCain 's record of support for deregulation is long .
" You are interviewing the greatest free trader you will ever interview , and the greatest deregulator you will ever interview , " he told a reporter last year .
Barack Obama is likewise talking tough about Wall Street -- notwithstanding the huge sums he and fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton collected from the financial industry during this election cycle as part of a significant shift in business support away from the Republicans .
Nevertheless , Obama , like McCain , is promising tough regulations to put Wall Street 's house in order -- though that certainly wo n't have much effect on the disaster unfolding right now .
Probably , the more accurate assessment came from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who told reporters that Congress likely would n't pass legislation overhauling financial regulations this year " because no one knows what to do . "
Reid at least deserves points for honesty compared to the substance - less bluster of the two presidential candidates .
But " no one knows what to do " ?
Really ?
After all , now that the U.S. government has carried out several quasi-nationalizations on an emergency basis , an obvious question looms , as the Financial Times ' Willem Buiter pointed out :
If financial behemoths like AIG are too large and / or too interconnected to fail , but not too smart to get themselves into situations where they need to be bailed out , then what is the case for letting private firms engage in such kinds of activities in the first place ?
Is the reality of the modern , transactions - oriented model of financial capitalism indeed that large private firms make enormous private profits when the going is good , and get bailed out and taken into temporary public ownership when the going gets bad , with the taxpayer taking the risk and the losses ?
If so , then why not keep these activities in permanent public ownership ?
There is a longstanding argument that there is no real case for private ownership of deposit - taking banking institutions , because these cannot exist safely without a deposit guarantee and / or lender of last resort facilities , that are ultimately underwritten by the taxpayer .
William Greider of The Nation poses the question more bluntly : " People have the right to ask :
What exactly are the rest of us getting for our money ? "
Greider is right .
For example , now that they have bailed out the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , should n't U.S. taxpayers have a say in the companies ' operations ?
Why should n't the public owners of these companies insist on a moratorium on foreclosures on the loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie - - nearly half of all mortgages in the U.S. ?
That would do a hundred times more for working people struggling with the mortgage crisis than the weak housing law passed this summer , whose main aim anyway was to enable the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie .
Now that the federal government has gotten into the insurance business with the takeover of the largest insurance company in the world , is there any justification for anyone in the U.S. going without health care coverage , much less 45 million people ?
And when the objection comes that the U.S. government will have to cut spending to pay for the Wall Street rescues , there should be no question about where the money should come from .
The federal government could get the whole sum for the AIG takeover from the Pentagon budget and still leave the U.S. military with more money -- many times over -- than any other country in the world .
If the U.S. needs to raise some quick cash , it could end the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan -- and not only cover the cost of the Fannie and Freddie takeover in a year - and - a - half at most , but , more importantly , begin to right a terrible injustice committed halfway around the world in the name of ordinary people in the U.S .
But of course , none of this is on the agenda of any political leader in Washington , from either of the mainstream parties -- because any effective measure that would help ordinary people would strain at the boundaries of the profit system they are dedicated to preserving .
NO ONE knows what 's next in this new and frightening stage of the economic crisis .
The financial world is grasping for explanations , so it is no surprise that ordinary people , who were kept in the dark about the scale of the theft and the degree of danger , are struggling to understand what happened .
Every new day brings new questions , and answering them will be a process -- here at SocialistWorker.org , as at any other media source , independent or mainstream .
But we have no problem drawing one conclusion from the start -- that the capitalist system has proved , once again , to be a failure in serving the needs of any but a small minority of society .
For more than 25 years , the theology of neoliberalism -- with its worship of the free market and its demonization of " big government " -- has reigned supreme in the U.S .
But it is obvious that the market is in crisis precisely because of the ceaseless , irrational and unplanned pursuit of the greatest profit for a few .
And it is equally obvious -- and even grudgingly acknowledged by virtually all sides of the political mainstream -- that the state , and not some " responsible " section of private capital , is needed to stop the system from grinding to a halt .
This is not the first guilty verdict against capitalism .
As socialist filmmaker Ken Loach told the Guardian newspaper : " You look around the world , and you see massive need on the one hand , and massive wealth on the other , and the two never connect .
The market is massively inefficient , capitalism is massively unstable and turbulent , and it 's insane that we are all bound to this terrible wheel of instability . "
But the present crisis is laying bare the failure of the system for more and more people to see-- and opening up opportunities to make the case for a socialist society , where the blind and irrational pursuit of profit and power is replaced by a commitment to freedom and equality for everyone in it .
Such a society wo n't be achieved by dreaming about it .
Those who are convinced that an alternative is necessary to end the injustices of this world need to be organized to struggle for another one .
Like any breathing Rails developer , I love blogging about performance .
I do it all the time .
I ’ve done it here , here , and quite famously , here .
But one thing I have n’t done is blog about Rails performance from a perspective of experience .
But tripling in traffic for a few months in a row has a way of changing that .
So now I ’m a real Rails performance guy .
Ask me anything about Rails performance , and I ’ll tell you to get back to me in a couple months , because this aint ’ exactly yellowpages.com that I ’m running here .
BUT , these are the lessons and facts from our first few months of operation :
One combined Rails server + Mysql slice at Slicehost is handling about 3000 daily visits and 30,000 daily pageviews ( on a highly real time , interactive site ) with relative ease .
Almost all pageviews less than 2 seconds , most less than 1 .
Memcached saves our ass repeatedly
Full text searching ( we ’re using Thinking Sphinx ) saves our ass repeatedly
BackgroundRb will ruin your life , cron-scheduled rake tasks will save it
Database ai n’t nothing but a chicken wing with indexing
Now there are five salient observations to take from a growing site , but you notice that it was the last one that I chose to single out in the title of this blog ?
Why ?
Because , if I called this entry “ Rails Performance Blog , ” your eyes would glaze over and you ’d would n’t be able to read through the hazy glare .
Why else ?
Because the day I spent indexing our tables was the only time in the history of Bonanzle that I will ever bring forth a sitewide 2x - 3 x performance increase within about 4 hours time .
God damn that was a fantastic day .
I spent the second half of it writing airy musings to my girlfriend and anyone who would listen about how much fun web sites are to program .
Then I drank beer and went rafting .
Those who have n’t indexed their DB lately : do n’t you hate me and want to be like me more than you ever have before ?
Well , I ca n’t help you with the former , but the latter , that we can work on .
Download Query Analyzer Delete your development.log file .
Start your site in development mode .
Go to your slowest page .
Open your development.log file in an editor that can automatically update as the file changes .
Look through the queries your Rails site is making .
Any query where the “ type ” column reads “ ALL ” is a query on which you are searching every row of your database to satisfy the query .
Hundreds of rows ?
OK , whatever .
Thousands of rows ?
Ouch .
Tens of thousands of rows ( or more ) ?
Your request might never be heard from again .
Create indexes to make those “ ALL ” s go away .
Adding an index in Rails is the simplest thing ever .
In a migration : add_index : table_name , : column_name and you ’re done .
remove_index : table_name , :column_name and you ’re undone .
Observe that , at least for MySql , queries where you are filtering for more than one attribute in your where clause ( e.g. , select * from items where status = “ active ” and hidden = false ) are still slow if you create indexes for “ status ” and “ hidden . ”
Why ?
I think it ’s because the DB ORs them together to find its results .
But I do n’t know the exact reason , nor do I care .
What I do know is that an add_index : items , [ : status , : hidden ] creates a compound attribute that will get you back to log (n ) time in making queries with compound where clauses .
Now , if you are like me or the 50 people in the Rails wiki and forums that learn about this crazy wonderful thing called “ indexes , ” your first question is “ Indexing sounds pretty bangin .
Why not just index the hell out of everything ? ”
Answer :
Them indexes are n’t immaculately conceived , son .
Every index you create has to be generated and maintained .
So the more indexes you create , the more overhead there is to inserting or deleting records from your table .
Of course , most queries on most sites are read queries , so you will make up the extra insert / delete time by 10 x or more , but if you were to go buck wild and index the farm , you probably would n’t be much better off on balance than if you indexed nothing at all .
You see why downloading Query Analyzer was the first step ?
The general rule that is given on indexes is that most any foreign key should be indexed , and any criteria upon which you regularly search or sort should be indexed .
That ’s worked well for us .
For tables with less than 500 rows , I usually get lazy and do n’t do any indexing , and that seems fine .
But assuredly , if you ’re working on a table with 1,000 or more rows and you ’re querying for columns that are n’t indexed , you are 15 minutes away from a beer - enabling , management - impressing performance optimization that would make Ferris Bueller proud .
Normally , when you think of an energy subsidy , specifically a fuel subsidy , it ’s all good news .
With the ever increasing price of fuel , and the world ’s economy going to hell in a handbasket , any help we can get is a good thing .
But a new report from the UN Environment Program ( UNEP ) has turned that idea on its head , and for good measure .
Because once you get right down to it , would you rather the government put their moneys in to helping out sustainable and renewable energies , or propping up the old ones ?
Subsequently , the UNEP has recommended that fossil fuel subsidies should be scrapped , and that in doing so could not only decrease the amount of greenhouse gases , but also give a “ not insignificant boost to the global economy . ”
One of the main points of the report was that the subsidies that are in place , while intended to help the poor , never end up helping those intended .
These subsidies , more often than not used to artificially lower the real price of fuels like oil , coal and gas , or electricity generated from such fuels , end up helping the middle classes , rather than those beneath .
Additionally , propping up fossil fuel powered systems such as those listed above , do more things that negatively affect the populous .
First off , it deprives the government of money out of its environmental budget that could go towards helping the development of renewable energy sources , or subsidizing those greener fuels .
Secondly , and more importantly , these subsidies do further damage to the environment , and our future within it .
Such subsidies end up allowing more and more of the fossil fuels to be used , and this increases and perpetuates the greenhouse gas emissions so many of us are trying to eliminate .
Additionally , from a sustainability standpoint , decreasing the prices increases the usage , and thus decreases the resources , subsequently decreasing how long we ’ll be able to rely on these fuels .
The report does make sure to remember those subsidies that do help the proliferation of renewable energies and raise such awareness .
The authors of the report encourage governments to transplant subsidies that support fossil fuels to support cleaner energies and fuels .
" In the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy – they are thus part of the market failure that is climate change , " said Achim Steiner , UN Under - Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director .
" There are now less than 500 days before the crucial climate change convention meeting in Copenhagen in late 2009 .
Governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones that contribute to the wasteful use of finite resources and delay the introduction of renewables or more efficient forms of generation while creating disincentives and barriers to public transport up to energy saving appliances . "
The full report , entitled Reforming Energy Subsidies : Opportunities to Contribute to the Climate Change Agenda , ( PDF ) was released last week at a meeting in Accra , Ghana of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .

One method of torture used in Florentine jails during the glorious days of the Renaissance was the strappado : a prisoner was hoisted into the air by a rope attached to his wrists , which had been tied behind his back , and then suddenly dropped toward the floor as many times as it took to get him to confess .
Since the procedure usually dislocated the shoulders , tore the muscles , and rendered one or both arms useless , it is remarkable that Niccolò Machiavelli , after reportedly undergoing six such “ drops , ” asked for pen and paper and began to write .
Machiavelli had nothing to confess .
Although his name had been found on an incriminating list , he had played no part in a failed conspiracy to murder the city ’s newly restored Medici rulers .
( Some said that it was Giuliano de ’ Medici who had been targeted , others that it was his brother Cardinal Giovanni . )
He had been imprisoned for almost two weeks when , in February , 1513 , in a desperate bid for pardon , he wrote a pair of sonnets addressed to the “ Magnificent Giuliano , ” mixing pathos with audacity and apparently inextinguishable wit .
“ I have on my legs , Giuliano , a pair of shackles , ” he began , and went on to report that the lice on the walls of his cell were as big as butterflies , and that the noise of keys and padlocks boomed around him like Jove ’s thunderbolts .
Perhaps worried that the poems would not impress , he announced that the muse he had summoned had hit him in the face rather than render her services to a man who was chained up like a lunatic .
To the heir of a family that prided itself on its artistic patronage , he submitted the outraged complaint “ This is the way poets are treated ! ”
Machiavelli believed that to succeed in life a man must be adaptable .
Illustration by Lorenzo Mattotti
Machiavelli was not especially known for his poetry , and few would have called him a man with a claim to Medici support .
His family was distinguished but far from rich , and had definite republican associations .
Two of his father ’s cousins had been beheaded for their opposition to the dynasty ’s founder , Cosimo de ’
Medici , who had effectively brought the historic republic to an end , in 1434 , the better to protect the family bank ’s enormous fortune .
During Machiavelli ’s youth , his father seems to have gained him entrée to the scholarly circles around the widely beloved Lorenzo de ’
Medici , who had managed to rule Florence for decades without the Florentines ’ feeling the brunt or shame of being ruled .
But Lorenzo had died in 1492 , and , two years later , the Medici were thrown out of the city .
Machiavelli was twenty - five ; Giuliano de ’ Medici , Lorenzo ’s youngest son , was fifteen .
While Machiavelli had nothing to do with the religious regime of the Dominican preacher Savonarola , who replaced the Medici — he disdained the preacher ’s pious “ lies ” even while admiring his republican reforms — he came into his own once the city turned against its savior and Savonarola ( after suffering fourteen drops of the strappado ) was hanged .
In 1498 , when both God and Savonarola ’s supporters lost their government posts , Machiavelli found himself with a job .
For the next fourteen years , he proudly served an independent city - state that had returned to its republican form , but was now carefully buttressed to withstand Medici forces lurking at its borders , or the threat that other wealthy families might pose .
The chief safeguard of the city ’s liberty was the Great Council : an administrative body with a membership of more than three thousand citizens , which gave Florence , with a population of some fifty thousand , the most broadly representative government of its time .
At the age of twenty - nine , Machiavelli was appointed Second Chancellor , with responsibilities for the city ’s correspondence and domestic reports .
His immense physical and intellectual energy ( he casually boasted of making “ Greek , Latin , Hebraic , and Chaldean ” references ) seems to account for his additional appointment , within a month , as Secretary of the so - called Ten of War , which sent him on remote diplomatic missions , usually in the face of impending crisis .
War was never far off .
These were years when France , Spain , and the Holy Roman Empire , battling over rival claims , sent their formidable armies marching across the weak and continually sparring Italian states ; Milan , Genoa , Florence , Venice , Naples , and any number of smaller duchies , marquisates , and republics found it hard to defend themselves , for lack of a united front .
To make matters worse , the varied Italian powers relied on mercenary troops that traded sides more easily than today ’s big - league ballplayers , signing a new contract as soon as a better offer came along .
Machiavelli thrived on the urgency and the uproar , filling his saddlebags with books and galloping off to argue the Florentine case , then report back on what he had found .
In one report , he described his duties as weighing what the ruler ’s “ intentions are , what he really wants , which way his mind is turning , and what might make him move ahead or draw back ” ; he wrote of the need “ to conjecture the future through negotiations and incidents . ”
All in all , it seems that he was expected to bring the gifts of a psychologist to the task of a prophet .
He did it very well .
Although his lack of wealth kept him from achieving the rank of ambassador — officially a mere envoy , he styled himself , rather grandly , the Florentine Secretary — his unblinking judgments made him the right - hand man of the republic ’s chief official , Piero Soderini .
He was set to work at the courts of King Louis XII of France , Pope Julius II , and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian , all the while studying the differing forms of government and temperament offered to his view .
Like most psychologists , Machiavelli was insatiably curious about the human mind .
And no one he met impressed him more than Cesare Borgia , the son of the Spanish Pope Alexander VI , who was at the height of his power when , in 1502 , he received Machiavelli in the ducal palace of Urbino — by candlelight , as legend has it , dressed all in black , already a figure of self - consciously theatrical menace .
Borgia had recently conquered Urbino , along with a large swath of central Italy , by means of daring , speed , and treachery .
( Machiavelli especially admired a maneuver in which Borgia had asked the Duke of Urbino to lend him his artillery to help take a nearby town , then turned on the undefended duchy and took it instead . )
Machiavelli could not help but contrast Borgia ’s stunning effectiveness with the frustratingly slow and prudent Florentine republic , which displayed the deficiencies as well as the virtues of the need for popular consensus , and he wrote excitedly to his bosses in the Palazzo della Signoria of the lessons offered by this majestic enemy .
In the ruthless young warrior he saw a potential hero : a leader strong enough to expel the foreign armies and transform Italy from a poetic entity into a real one .
The most practical lesson that the dazzled envoy took from Borgia was the deployment of a citizen army .
At one point in his campaigns , after his hired mercenaries had conspired against him , Borgia had been forced to draft peasants from his conquered territories .
Machiavelli recognized the advantages of such a system , which were made particularly clear when Florence ’s mercenary army , warring against Pisa , ignominiously turned and fled once the fighting got too rough .
Who , after all , was willing to die for a handful of florins ( particularly the meagre handful paid by the republic ) ?
On the other hand , who was not willing to die for one ’s country ?
In 1505 , Machiavelli argued the case for a Florentine citizen militia , and on a brisk February day in 1506 several hundred Tuscan farmers paraded through the Piazza della Signoria , snappily dressed in red - and - white trousers and white caps .
Despite the commedia - dell ’arte air , just three years later Machiavelli led a thousand citizen troops in the latest of fifteen years of attacks on Pisa , and — to general astonishment — the Florentines won .
Machiavelli ’s military reputation remained sterling until 1512 , when the militia , defending the neighboring town of Prato from Spanish troops , broke ranks and ran as shamelessly as the most craven mercenaries .
Worse , the defeat left Florence on the losing side of a wider battle between France and the allied forces of Spain and Pope Julius II .
With Florence vulnerable , a long - resentful pro-Medici faction seized its chance , and the republican government was overthrown .
And so it happened that in September , 1512 , after an absence of eighteen years , the Medici rode back into the city .
Within days , Machiavelli ’s militia and the Great Council were dismissed .
Although Machiavelli soon lost his position as Secretary , he seems to have believed that he maintained some authority , writing a formal plea on behalf of Piero Soderini , whom he had helped to escape on the eve of the Medici return .
This exceptional document — published for the first time in English , as “ A Caution to the Medici , ” in “ The Essential Writings of Machiavelli ” ( edited and translated by Peter Constantine ; Modern Library ; $ 17.95 ) — presents an argument against the Medici faction ’s continued blackening of Soderini ’s name .
Machiavelli offers a political rationale ( “ The Medici government would only weaken itself by attacking a man who is in exile and cannot harm it ” ) for what seems an attempt to defend a friend and , in his name , the Florentine people .
Of course , any illusions of influence were dispelled a few months later , in February , 1513 , by jail and the strappado .
Whether Giuliano de ’
Medici ever read the sonnets that Machiavelli dedicated to him is a matter of dispute , but his intervention was not ultimately required .
After a month behind bars , Machiavelli was released , thanks to an amnesty granted upon Cardinal Giovanni de ’
Medici ’s election to the papacy as Leo X , the first Medici pope .
( “ God has granted us the papacy , ” he reportedly told Giuliano .
“ Let us enjoy it . ” )
For four days , Florence was alight with pride and the heady prospect of favors from the overflowing papal coffers : fireworks , bonfires , pealing bells , and cannonades all greeted the weary former Secretary as he made his way home .
Even now , Machiavelli hoped that “ these new masters of ours ” would find his services of use .
He was experienced , he was ( at forty - three ) extremely vigorous , and during his many years of civil service he had shown himself a trustworthy man .
“ My poverty is evidence of my fidelity and virtue , ” he confided to a friend .
And he desperately needed a job .
That spring , still unemployed , he retreated from the city to live with his wife and children on the family farm , near San Casciano , in taunting view of the tower of the Palazzo della Signoria .
It was a sprawling and ramshackle place , and he was sadly out of his element , catching birds and playing cards ; his worldly friends sent mocking regards to the chickens .
But in the evening , approaching his study , he stripped off his muddy clothes and put on his ambassadorial attire .
“ Fitted out appropriately , I step inside the venerable courts of the ancients , ” he wrote , in one of the most famous letters of the Renaissance , “ where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question them about the motives for their actions , and they , out of their human kindness , answer me . ”
Livy , Cicero , Virgil , Tacitus : he wrote their answers down and , adding observations from the history he had witnessed , toward the end of 1513 he completed a little book about statecraft — a book of strictly practical matters , dealing with armies and fortresses , with ways of holding on to power — that he resolved would demonstrate his usefulness once and for all to Giuliano , since it discussed people and their actions “ as they are in real truth , rather than as they are imagined . ”
Never before or since has a writer so clearly proved that the truth is a dangerous thing .

“ The Prince , ” Machiavelli ’s how - to guide for sovereigns , turned out to be “ a scandal that Western political thought and practice has been gazing at in horror and in fascination since its first publication , ” to quote from Albert Russell Ascoli ’s introduction to Peter Constantine ’s new translation ( Modern Library ; $ 8 ; also included in “ The Essential Writings of Machiavelli ” ) .
Circulated in manuscript for years , the book was not published until 1532 — nearly five years after Machiavelli ’s death — and received its first significant critique within the decade , from an English cardinal who pronounced the author “ an enemy of the human race . ”
Machiavelli stood accused of having inspired Henry VIII to defy papal authority and seize ecclesiastical power for the crown .
Some thirty years later , in France , the book was blamed for inciting Queen Catherine de ’
Medici to order the massacre of two thousand rebel Protestants .
( There seems to have been little besides her family connection to warrant the Machiavellian association . )
His notoriety grew , less through knowledge of the offending book than through the many lurid and often skewed attacks it prompted , with titles on the order of “ Stratagems of Satan . ”
Wherever a sovereign usurped power from the church or the nobility , whenever ostentatious deceit or murderous force was used , Machiavelli was spied in the shadows , scribbling at his desk amid the olive groves , his quill dipped in a poison so potent that it threatened the power structures of Europe .
What caused the furor ?
Here , out of context and placed end to end ( a method not unfamiliar to his attackers ) , are some of Machiavelli ’s most salient and satanic points : “ A prince , particularly a new prince , cannot afford to cultivate attributes for which men are considered good .
In order to maintain the state , a prince will often be compelled to work against what is merciful , loyal , humane , upright , and scrupulous ” ; “ A wise ruler cannot and should not keep his word when it would be to his disadvantage ” ; “ Men must be either flattered or eliminated , because a man will readily avenge a slight grievance , but not one that is truly severe ” ; “ A man is quicker to forget the death of his father than the loss of his patrimony . ”
And , the distilled spirit of this dark brew : “ How one lives and how one ought to live are so far apart that he who spurns what is actually done for what ought to be done will achieve ruin rather than his own preservation . ”
To underscore how shocking such notions were , they should be compared with other examples from the genre in which Machiavelli was consciously working : the “ Mirrors of Princes , ” a type of professional primer offered by advisers to young or recently elevated monarchs , meant to shape their judgment and , with it , the future of the state .
A philosopher could not hope for a more direct influence on the fate of mankind than by writing such a book ; or , practically speaking , for a better advertisement for a royal job .
Erasmus , whose “ Education of a Christian Prince ” was written two years after Machiavelli ’s work — he presented his treatise first to Charles of Aragon and , after it failed to elicit the desired financial result , to Henry VIII — spun his pious counsel around the central thesis “ What must be implanted deeply and before all else in the mind of the prince is the best possible understanding of Christ . ”
Machiavelli , on the other hand , proposed the best possible understanding of the methods of Cesare Borgia .
There is a context , however , that , if not ameliorating , is richly complicating and easily overlooked in the light of Machiavelli ’s aphoristic skill .
One does n’t wish to fall back on the excuse that this is the way that rulers ( or other people ) often behave , although it is true that Machiavelli no more invented political evil by describing it than Kinsey invented sex .
Like all the celebrated artists of his time and place — and statecraft was one of the Renaissance arts — Machiavelli was in thrall to ancient pagan models .
But there is a crucial difference : a painter could situate a Madonna within a classical portico without disturbing the figure ’s Christian meaning .
Works that delve beneath the surface of classical forms to get at classical thinking — works of literature , philosophy , politics — require a recognition , at least , of the conflict between pagan and Christian ideals : strength versus humility , earthly life versus the hereafter , the hero versus the saint .
For Machiavelli , the choice was not difficult .
The Roman republic was for him the undisputed golden age ; even before writing “ The Prince , ” he had begun a commentary on Livy ’s “ History of Rome , ” closely analyzing the Roman system of liberty and leaving no doubt that he was a republican at heart .
( “ It is not the particular good but the common good that makes cities great .
And without doubt this common good is observed nowhere but in a republic . ” )
But Christian piety had sapped the strength needed to bring this heroic form of government back to life .
The great republic of his own era had failed because the men entrusted with its liberties did not know how to fight for them .
He had seen his friend Soderini forfeit Florence by refusing to limit the freedoms ultimately employed against him by his enemies ; that is , by trusting that goodness and decency could triumph over the implacable vices and envious designs of men .
The plan was for Track to be the good kid in the Palin family .
The athletically - named son of VP nominee Sarah Palin — who 's set to ship out soon for Iraq — was portrayed as a symbol of patriotism on stage at the Republican Convention .
But did he only join the Army to escape a life of drugs and crime back in Alaska ?
The newly famous enlistee gets the full investigative treatment from the Enquirer — which always saves the best stuff for the print version .
Which we now have in hand !
The young man has partied with some very talkative people .
So : while Track was watching his mom enthrall the nation , was he really daydreaming of mainlining sweet , sweet Oxycontin and playing " master " criminal back home ?
We quote : Track is portrayed as the biggest bad boy in Wasilla .
A serious drug problem , vandalism , theft , and partying are his main pastimes , allegedly .
Which really would n't be that remarkable if the Republican party was n't holding him up as , you know , a role model .
If true , this would make the Palins a caricature : the country family with a pregnant teen , son on OxyContin , and a mom desperately trying to present a respectable face to the world .
And failing .
And honestly , everyone : the Enquirer does not represent the media elite .
So the liberal media should be safely insulated from the backlash on this one .
The best quotes from the Enquirer 's story :
" Before joining the Army last September , Track partied all the time .
I saw him do so many keg stands , and all he ever talked about was getting stoned . "
" Track was a master at playing people and paying them to get drugs , alcohol , steal car rims , Xbox games , you name it . "
" All the girls loved Track , but he was more into drugs and himself .
He used his local celebrity status with the other guys to get them to steal things he wanted . "
" I 've partied with Track for years .
I 've seen him snort cocaine , snort and smoke OxyContin , drink booze and smoke weed .
OxyContin was definitely his drug of choice . "
Track was a full - on OxyContin addict in 2006 and 2007 , the Enquirer says , and was mainlining the drug .
Which is very bad .
" I 've smoked weed with Track many times .
He was one of two kids in school that had a fake ID . "
And his sister was a party animal , too .

Doctors also advise against taking non-steroidal inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) .
In both cases , these drugs can cause severe reactions .
Paracetamol has been recommended as a safe alternative .
Researchers compared the use of aspirin and paracetamol by 664 asthmatics and 910 people without asthma over a period of 12 months .
The study participants were aged between 16 and 49 , and drawn from 40 general practices in south London .
Frequent use of paracetamol was also associated with more severe asthma , and with inflammation of the lining of the nose ( rhinitis ) .
Very few asthmatics were taking paracetamol frequently for asthma symptoms .
Body changes
The authors suggest that frequent use of paracetamol decreases circulating levels of the antioxidant glutathione , high levels of which are found in the lining of the airways and the nose .
Glutathione is thought to protect the lungs from the harmful effects of pollutants and free radicals .
Free radicals are charged particles that damage the tissues of the body .
They are found in high levels in the lungs of asthmatics .
The authors warn that their findings should not encourage asthmatics to switch from paracetamol to aspirin or NSAIDS , as this could be dangerous .
But they do suggest that , if possible , asthmatics who regularly take paracetamol should try to cut down their use .
' Adults only '
The National Asthma Campaign issued a statement stressing that the study related to adults only .
The statement said : " This study suggests that daily use of paracetamol may be linked to a higher possibility of the worsening of asthma symptoms in adults .
" It does not show that paracetamol is linked to any increased chance or risk of developing asthma .
" In both children and adults , the patient information provided with this type of medication states that it must not be given for more than three days without consulting a doctor .
" Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice when giving painkillers to your children , especially if they are currently taking any other treatments - either prescribed or over the counter medicines . "
Aspirin should not be given to children because of the risk of Reye 's syndrome , a rare but potentially fatal condition .
The research , by the Department of Public Health Sciences , Guy's , Kings ' and St Thomas 's School of Medicine , London , is published in the journal Thorax .
On December 2 , 2007 , a 40 - year - old man named Juan Mendoza Farias was arrested and booked into the Maricopa County Jail .
Like a lot of people who come through Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's doors , Farias ' offense was DUI - related , a probation violation .
Farias wound up with a death sentence .
After three days , he was clearly going through alcohol withdrawal .
According to written accounts from detention officers , Farias became hostile and started resisting their orders .
Info Juan Mendoza Farias
When that happened , officers cuffed Farias and put his legs in shackles and moved him to an isolated " safe " or " soft " cell , designed to prevent him from hurting himself or others .
The officers fired six rounds of crowd - control " pepper balls " at Farias and shocked him with at least two Tasers .
Later , jail officials moved Farias into the psychiatric ward , according to the reports they wrote after his death .
Eleven officers teamed up to move Farias .
They swarmed him , wrapped a blanket over his head , and strapped a leather restraint , known as a " belly belt , " around the blanket to hold it in place .
Then they put him in a wheelchair with restraints .
" Get me out of here .
They just kidnapped me .
They are trying to shoot me .
They just [ shot ] me on my legs .
Somebody is trying to kill me , " Farias yelled as the officers surrounded him , according to one sergeant 's report .
Another officer wrote that Farias was " talking nonsense . "
Maybe not .
Photos show that he was , indeed , shot in the legs — by Tasers and pepper balls .
And he did stop breathing minutes after shouting that he was being killed .
As officers pulled Farias out of the wheelchair , they wrestled a " spit mask " over his mouth .
Spit masks are used to cover an inmate 's face below the nose ; they 're supposed to be used only if an inmate is biting or spitting .
Officers then pushed Farias face down on his stomach — a deadly position that can lead to suffocation if guards push down too hard .
It 's well known in law enforcement that an inmate on his stomach can easily die from " positional asphyxiation . "
If the inmate is cuffed behind the back and officers apply too much pressure , the lungs simply can't function .
A mask over the mouth — limiting airflow — can exacerbate the situation .
Two officers held Farias ' legs and other guards pinned down his arms and back while yet another " held his head down " for nearly 10 minutes , according to the reports .
Farias was fighting for his life .
The county medical examiner documented " blunt force injuries " on his face , torso , and limbs .
His neck muscles hemorrhaged internally from the strain , and a gash was notched out of his nose — either from being struck or from being pressed into something .
As the guards held him face down , one noticed that Farias was no longer moving or breathing .
The guards rolled him over and pulled the spit mask off his mouth .
It was filled with blood .
So were his nostrils .
The guards attempted CPR , but it did n't work .
Farias was transported to St. Joseph's Hospital , where he was pronounced dead .
Juan Mendoza Farias is not the first inmate to die after a violent exchange with guards in Arpaio 's jail .
In the past 12 years , at least four other men have died after exchanges with guards .
And those are just the ones we know about , the ones whose families sued Arpaio and won hefty payments .
In one case , a jury found officers responsible for killing 33 - year old Charles Agster , a mentally retarded man who weighed 125 pounds .
That jury awarded $ 9 million to Agster 's family in 2006 .
It was one of more than 2,500 inmate lawsuits against Arpaio that have cost the county more than $ 43 million ( see " Inhumanity Has a Price , " John Dickerson , December 20 , 2007 ) .
This is the first time you 're reading about Farias , even though he died in December .
That 's because Arpaio is n't open - mouthed when it comes to the deaths of his inmates .
If not for an anonymous tip to New Times , Farias ' death would still be secret .
Even after New Times requested specific records about Farias ' death , the sheriff refused to hand them over , citing an " ongoing investigation . "
The Maricopa County medical examiner released the records , in response to a public - records request from New Times .
Otherwise , the details of Farias ' death would be unknown to all but his family , anyone with unrestricted access to the sheriff 's records , and the medical examiner who inspected his corpse .
The examiner concluded that the manner of Farias ' death was undetermined .
But she reported " complications of chronic alcoholic withdrawal associated with cardiopulmonary arrest during subdual for combative and violent behavior , " adding " hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy with coronary artery disease . "
The " prone restraint on bed , " the spit mask , and the altercation with the guards also contributed to Farias ' death , she wrote .
In other words , the excitement required more oxygen in Farias ' lungs , but the mask over his mouth and the weight on his back restricted his lungs from functioning .
An underlying and non-lethal heart disease meant that Farias ' heart could n't handle the combined weight and lack of oxygen .
New Times asked an out - of - state medical examiner to review Farias ' records .
He concluded that Farias was beaten and then suffocated .
MCCAIN STILL STRUGGLING WITH THE BASICS ….
There ’s been ample discussion of late about Sarah Palin being sequestered , away from the media , because the McCain campaign is n’t confident in her ability to answer questions about , well , much of anything .
But what about McCain ’s ability to answer questions ?
AmericaBlog posted a clip of an interview McCain did , via satellite , with Rob Caldwell at WCSH in Portland , Maine .
Caldwell noted , for example , that McCain insisted that national security and counter - terrorism is the number one issue facing the United States .
McCain denied ever having said that .
Caldwell moved on , asking about Sarah Palin ’s experience in national security .
McCain responded by attacking Barack Obama .
“ Well , you say you ’re sure she has the experience , but again , I ’m just asking for an example , ” Caldwell said .
“ What experience does she have in the field of national security ? ” McCain responded :
“ Energy .
She knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America .
She ’s a governor of a state where 20 % of America ’s energy supply comes from there .
And we all know that energy is a critical and vital national security issue .
We ’ve got to stop sending $ 700 billion of American money to countries that do n’t like us very much .
She ’s very well versed on that issue .
“ And , uh , she also happens to represent , be governor of a state that ’s right next to Russia .
She understands Russia . ”
I ’m afraid this is just embarrassingly incoherent .
First , the notion that Palin ’s proximity to Russia counts as national security experience continues to be unusually stupid , even for McCain .
Second , “ Energy ” is not a response to the question , “ What experience does she have in the field of national security ? ”
And third , to insist , publicly and on the record , that Sarah Palin “ knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America ” is , quite literally , laughable .
We are , after all , talking about a politician who is n’t sure about the human impact on global warming , and has n’t demonstrated any real expertise on the issue .
Ever .
As Yglesias recently noted , “ Give Sarah Palin this much — her understanding of the geopolitics of energy is every bit as daft as that of much more seasoned conservative pseudo - experts .
She can spin out outlandish and ultimately nonsensical scenarios about Iran ( or Venezuela ) deploying the mythical ‘ oil weapon ’ and she , too , can ignore the fundamentally global nature of hydrocarbon markets by prattling about ‘ energy independence . ' ”
Stepping back , it ’s striking that McCain still , even now , ca n’t answer obvious questions about his own running mate .
Caldwell ’s question was direct , but hardly an unexpected curveball .
Indeed , the obvious answer for McCain is that Palin does n’t have a background in national security , but neither do most governors who seek national office , and he ’s confident in her judgment , her ability to learn quickly , etc .
But , no .
Asked an obvious question , McCain offers a confused response that does n’t make any sense .
Maybe the next time the Republican handlers prep Palin on how to answer questions , McCain should sit in and take a few notes .
Estelle Getty : Golden Girls Sophia Petrillo Dies ( Photos )

The actress starred in many films but is best known for her role as Sophia Petrillo on The Golden Girls sitcom that ran from 1985 - 1992 , also starredand
Getty suffered a long battle with Lewy Body Dementia , similar to Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
Born in NY in 1923 , she played the wise - cracking Sicilian mother Sophia Petrillo and made her a household name .
Paying tribute to the star , her longtime caregiver Paul Chapdelaine said :
" Sadly today July 22 , 2008 at 5:35 a.m.
Pacific time , we said our last goodbye to our little friend Estelle , who passed away and made her journey to the great beyond .
She went gracefully , surrounded by family . "
" She always stood up for the underdogs , fought for equality for all , and always pictured a world filled with love and laughter . "
The Golden Globe and Emmy award winning actress is survived by two sons from her marriage to , who passed away in 2004 .

Hans Reiser ’s arrogance , self - centered attitude and lingering hatred toward his wife were some of the reasons the jury convicted the 44 - year - old computer programmer of first - degree murder , according to one of the jurors .
Vince Dunn , a schoolteacher , said Reiser ’s testimony in his own defense and his constant bashing of his estranged wife turned him and other jurors off .
“ He just constantly attacked her , ” Dunn said .
“ He hated her . ”
Reiser was convicted Monday of first - degree murder in the killing his wife , Nina , who was last seen alive Sept. 3 , 2006 .
He faces 25 years to life in prison .
The couple had been undergoing a bitter divorce at the time of her disappearance .
Despite exhaustive searches of the Oakland hills and other areas , Nina ’s body has never been found .
Nor had any evidence emerged that she fled to her native Russia , as the defense had suggested .
At an arraignment hearing Tuesday , Alameda County Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman set July 9 as the date for Reiser ’s sentencing .
Reiser attended the hearing wearing a red jail jumpsuit – a stark contrast from the shirt and jacket he wore during his five - month trial .
According to Dunn , one reason Reiser found himself wearing that jumpsuit was because of a recording of a wiretapped phone call from Sept. 23 , 2006 that the prosecution played in court .
In that call – between Reiser and his mother , nearly three weeks after Nina went missing – Reiser ’s mother says Nina did not deserve whatever happened to her .
“ Yeah , well neither did I , neither did Rory , ” Reiser said , mentioning the couple ’s oldest child .
Prosecutor Paul Hora said the phone call was an admission to his mother that he had killed Nina .
“ It was like he was trying to justify what he did , ” Dunn said .
“ It really showed where his head was . ”
Dunn admitted that the lack of a body or a murder weapon made the jurors ’ decision more difficult .
But in the end , he said , there was too much circumstantial evidence against Reiser .
In addition , the strange coincidence that the cell phone battery had been detached from Nina ’s cell phone after she went missing and the fact Reiser had detached the battery from his own cell phone was “ a big piece of the puzzle for me , ” the juror said .
When the jurors left the courthouse for the weekend Thursday – after slightly more than two days of deliberation – they were mainly trying to decide between first - and second - degree murder convictions , Dunn said .
The jury ultimately voted for first - degree murder because Reiser ’s weird behavior after Nina disappeared – as described in court – seemed to be that of someone who had planned and carried out a murder , Dunn said .
Finally , Dunn called Prosecutor Paul Hora a “ hero ” for all the work he put into the case .
“ You could see he really worked hard on this case , ” Dunn said .
Steven Clark , a former prosecutor in Santa Clara County and now a criminal defense attorney based in San Jose , agreed .
He said that without a body , Hora was working with one hand tied behind his back , but in the end got a conviction .
“ The prosecutor was absolutely masterful , ” Clark said .
“ He was tough and aggressive .
He pulled the case together .
And he was able to get under the defendant ’s skin when the defendant took the stand for 11 days . ”
Michael Cardoza , a former prosecutor in both San Francisco and Alameda counties and now a criminal defense attorney , also agreed Hora presented his case well despite working with largely circumstantial evidence .
“ I would trade no body for more evidence , ” Cardoza said .
Furthermore , Reiser ’s 11 days on the witness stand did n’t help his cause , Cardoza said , because it seemed as if the jurors did not like him or believe his testimony .
“ I think Hans Reiser may have dug Nina Reiser ’s grave , but he definitely did a better job of digging his own grave , ” Cardoza said .
Both Clark and Cardoza also commented on speculation swirling about the possibility of Reiser receiving a lighter sentence if he gives up the location of Nina ’s body .
Both said that would be extremely unusual , and that there seemed to be little incentive in it for the prosecution to agree to such a deal .
Outside the courtroom Tuesday , Reiser ’s defense attorney , William DuBois , would n’t discuss the possibility of a deal .
He said only that Reiser was coming to terms with being convicted and that , in a conversation with the now - convicted murderer Monday night , Reiser was contrite and apologized to DuBois for not following the attorney ’s advice on some issues .
DuBois also was cryptic when answering questions about future proceedings in Reiser ’s case , saying , “ There may be significant developments . ”
Agda , like many dependently typed functional languages , recognises a variation of structural recursion .
We need some tricks to encode general recursion .
With well - founded recursion , you add an extra argument to the general - recursive function you would like to define .
The extra argument is a proof that one input of the function and the successive value passed to the recursive call are related by a well - founded ordering .
Therefore , the recursion cannot go on forever .
The function passes the termination check because it is structural recursive on the proof term .
I like well - founded recursion because it relates well with how , in my understanding , termination proofs are done in relational program derivation .
For real programming , however , the extra argument clutters the code .
For more complex cases , such as the McCarthian maximum function where the termination proof depends on the result of the function , the function has to be altered in ways making it rather incomprehensible .
It would be nice to if we could write the program and prove its termination elsewhere .
Adam Megacz published an interesting paper : A Coinductive Monad for Prop - Bounded Recursion , in which he summarised a number of approaches to perform general recursion in a dependently typed language before presenting his own , an extension to Venanzio Capretta ‘s General Recursion via Coinductive Types .
As a practice , I tried to port his code to Agda .
A Monad for Non-Terminating Computation
The codatatype Comp , representing a possibly non-terminating computation , is a monad - like structure :
codata Comp ( a : Set ) :
Set where
return : a ->
Comp a
_⟩⟩=_ : Comp a -> ( a -> Comp a ) ->
Comp a
While the monadic bind operator has type M a -> ( a -> M b ) ->
M b , the _⟩⟩=_ operator for Comp has a more specialised type .
This suffices when we use it only at the point of recursive calls .
I suspect that we may need to generalise the type when we construct mutually recursive functions .
General - recursive programs are written in monadic style .
For example , the function div , for integral division , can be written as :
div : ℕ -> ℕ -> Comp ℕ
div zero n ~ return zero
div ( suc m ) zero ~ return ( suc m )
div ( suc m ) ( suc n ) ~
div ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( suc n ) ⟩⟩= \h ->
return ( suc h )
An example harder to tackle would be McCarthy ’s 91 function .
To be consistent with my earlier blog entry ( well , the real reason is that I am lazy .
And Megacz has proved the termination of the 91 function anyway ) , consider the following simplification :
f : ℕ -> ℕ -> Comp ℕ
f k n with k ≤′′ ?
n
... | inj₁ k≤n ~ return n
... | inj₂ n<k ~ f k ( suc n ) ⟩⟩= \x -> f k x
The function , seen in Bengt Nordström ‘s Terminating General Recursion , returns the maximum of k and n , and will be referred to as the McCarthian Maximum function .
Terminating Computation
In the definitions of div and f , we have merely built some ( potentially infinite ) codata objects representing the computations .
Now we will build an interpreter that would actually carry out a computation , provided that it is terminating .
The idea here is similar to what we did in well - founded recursion : construct a proof that the computation terminates , and the interpreter would be structurally recursive on the proof term .
The datatype _↓ characterises terminating computations :
data _↓ {a : Set} : Comp a ->
Set where
↓ - return : forall {x} -> ( return x ) ↓
↓ - bind : forall {m f} ->
m ↓ -> ( forall x -> m ↓= x -> f x ↓ ) -> ( m ⟩⟩= f ) ↓
Certainly , return x for all x always terminates .
For m ⟩⟩= f to terminate , both m and f , given the input from m , must terminate .
It would be too strong to demand that f x terminates for all x .
We only need f x to terminate for those x that could actually be returned by m .
For that we define another datatype _↓=_ such that m ↓= x states that a computation m terminates and yields a value x :
data _↓=_ {a : Set} : Comp a -> a ->
Set where
↓= -return : forall {x} -> ( return x ) ↓= x
↓= -bind : forall {m f x y} ->
m ↓= x -> ( f x ) ↓= y -> ( m ⟩⟩= f ) ↓= y
I also needed the following lemmas .
The lemma ↓= - unique states that if a computation yields only one value , if it terminates at all :
↓=-unique : {a : Set} {m : Comp a} {x y : a} ->
m ↓= x -> m ↓= y -> x ≡ y
↓=-unique ↓=- return ↓=-return = ≡-refl
↓=-unique {x = x} ( ↓= - bind m↓=x fx↓=y ) ( ↓=- bind m↓=x ' fx '↓=y ' )
with ↓=- unique m↓=x m↓=x '
... | ≡- refl with ↓= - unique fx↓=y fx'↓=y '
... | ≡-refl = ≡-refl
The next lemma says that a computation that yields a value terminates :
↓=⇒↓ : {a : Set} {m : Comp a} {x : a} -> m ↓= x -> m ↓
↓=⇒↓ ↓=-return = ↓-return
↓=⇒↓ ( ↓= - bind { m}{f} m↓=x fx↓=y ) =
↓ - bind ( ↓=⇒↓ m↓=x )
( \z m↓=z -> ≡- subst ( \w -> f w ↓ ) ( ↓=-unique m↓=x m↓=z ) ( ↓=⇒↓ fx↓=y ) )
Safe Computation
Now we construct a function eval evaluating terminating computations .
Recall , however , that an important thing about well - founded recursion is that the datatype Acc consists of only one constructor .
Thus , like the newtype construct in Haskell , the constructor is superfluous and can be optimised away by the compiler .
For eval , we would like the proof of termination to be a one - constructor type too .
We define the following datatype Safe .
A computation is safe , if all its sub-computations are :
data Safe {a : Set} : Comp a ->
Set where
safe - intro : forall m ->
( forall m ' -> InvokedBy m' m -> Safe m' ) ->
Safe m
Given computations m and m ' , the relation InvokedBy m' m holds if m ' is a sub-computation of m .
The relation InvokedBy can be defind by :
data InvokedBy {a : Set} : Comp a -> Comp a ->
Set where
invokes - prev : forall {m f} ->
InvokedBy m ( m ⟩⟩= f )
invokes - fun : forall {m f x} ->
m ↓= x ->
InvokedBy ( f x ) ( m ⟩⟩= f )
Notice that Safe is exactly a specialised version of Acc .
Safe m states that m is accessible under relation InvokedBy .
That is , there is no infinite chain of computations starting from m .
Programmers prove termination of programs by constructing terms of type _↓ .
The following lemma states that terminating computations are safe :
↓- safe : {a : Set} -> ( m : Comp a ) -> m ↓ ->
Safe m
↓ - safe ( return x ) ↓- return = safe - intro _ fn
where fn : ( m ' : Comp _ ) ->
InvokedBy m' ( return x ) ->
Safe m'
fn _ ()
↓ - safe ( m ⟩⟩= f ) ( ↓ - bind m↓ m↓=x⇒fx↓ ) = safe - intro _ fn
where fn : ( m ' : Comp _ ) ->
InvokedBy m' ( m ⟩⟩= f ) ->
Safe m'
fn .m invokes - prev = ↓ - safe m m↓
fn ._ ( invokes - fun m↓=x ) = ↓- safe _ ( m↓=x⇒fx ↓ _ m↓=x )
We can then use the lemma to convert m ↓ to Safe m , which will be used by eval - safe :
eval - safe : {a : Set} -> ( m : Comp a ) ->
Safe m -> ∃ ( \x -> m ↓= x )
eval - safe ( return x ) ( safe - intro ._ safe ) = ( x , ↓=- return )
eval - safe ( m ⟩⟩= f ) ( safe - intro ._ safe )
with eval - safe m ( safe m invokes - prev )
... | ( x , m↓=x ) with eval - safe ( f x ) ( safe ( f x ) ( invokes - fun m↓=x ) )
... | ( y , fx↓y ) = ( y , ↓= - bind m↓=x fx↓y )
It is structurally recursive because safe is a sub-component of safe - intro ._ safe .
Our eval function simply calls eval - safe :
eval : {a : Set} ( m : Comp a ) -> m ↓ -> a
eval m m↓ with eval - safe m ( ↓ - safe m m↓ )
... | ( x , m↓=x ) = x
Example : Div
Recall the function div :
div : ℕ -> ℕ -> Comp ℕ
div zero n ~ return zero
div ( suc m ) zero ~ return ( suc m )
div ( suc m ) ( suc n ) ~
div ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( suc n ) ⟩⟩= \h ->
return ( suc h )
To prove its termination we use strong induction : if div k n terminates for all k < m , we have div m n terminates as well .
The strong induction principle is given by :
strong - induction : ( P : ℕ -> Set ) ->
( forall n -> ( forall m -> m <′ n -> P m ) -> P n ) ->
( forall n -> P n )
strong - induction P Pind n = Pind n ( ind n )
where ind : forall n -> forall m -> m <′ n ->
P m
ind zero _ ()
ind ( suc n ) ._ ≤′ -refl = strong - induction P Pind n
ind ( suc n ) m ( ≤′- step m < n ) = ind n m m<n
Notice how it resembles the accessibility proof ℕ. Indeed , accessibility is strong induction .
We are doing the same proof , but organised differently .
There is a little extra complication , however .
In Agda , co-recursively defined functions do not automatically unfold .
We have to unfold them manually , a trick mentioned byUlf Norell and Dan Doel on the Agda mailing list .
The following function unfold , through pattern matching , expands the definition of a coinductively defined function :
unfold : {a : Set} -> Comp a ->
Comp a
unfold ( return x ) = return x
unfold ( m ⟩⟩= f ) = m ⟩⟩= f
To prove a property about m , we could prove the same property for unfold m , and then use the fact that unfold m ≡ m , proved below :
≡-unfold : {a : Set} {m : Comp a} -> unfold m ≡ m
≡ - unfold {_}{return x} = ≡-refl
≡ - unfold {_}{m ⟩⟩= f} = ≡-refl
Here is the proof that div m n terminates for all m , using strong induction :
div↓ : forall m n -> div m n ↓
div↓ m n = strong - induction ( \m -> div m n ↓ )
( \m f -> ≡- subst _↓ ≡-unfold ( ind m f ) ) m
where
ind : forall m -> ( forall k -> k div k n ↓ ) ->
unfold ( div m n ) ↓
ind zero f = ↓-return
ind ( suc m ) f with n
... | zero = ↓-return
... | ( suc n' ) = ↓- bind ( f ( suc m ∸ suc n' ) ( sm- sn < sm m n' ) )
( \h _ -> ↓- return )
where sm - sn < sm : forall m n -> ( m ∸ n ) <′ suc m .
Example : McCarthian Maximum
Now , let us consider the McCarthian Maximum :
f : ℕ -> ℕ -> Comp ℕ
f k n with k ≤′′ ?
n
... | inj₁ k≤n ~ return n
... | inj₂ n<k ~ f k ( suc n ) ⟩⟩= \x -> f k x
Two peculiarities made this function special .
Firstly , for n < k , the value of n gets closer to k at each recursive call .
The function terminates immediately for n ≥ k .
Therefore , to reason about its termination , we need a downward induction , where n = k is the base case and termination for n = i is inducted from n = i+1 , i+2 , .. , k .
To make this induction easier , I created another datatype expressing " less than or equal to " :
data _≤′′_ : ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set where
≤′′ -refl : forall {n} -> n ≤′′ n
≤′′ -step : forall {m n} -> suc m ≤′′ n -> m ≤′′ n _ ℕ ->
Set
m
Secondly , to reason about the termination of f we need information about the value it returns .
In the branch for inj₂ n<k , termination of the first recursive call follows from downward induction : suc n is closer to k than n .
On the other hand , we know that the second call terminates only after we notice that f returns the maximum of its arguments .
Therefore , f k ( suc n ) yields k , and f k k terminates .
I proved the termination of f in two parts , respectively for the case when k ≤ n , and n < k :
k≤n⇒fkn↓=n : forall k n -> k ≤′′ n -> f k n ↓= n
n< k⇒fkn↓=k : forall k n -> n <′′ k -> f k n ↓= k
It then follows immediately that :
f↓ : forall k n -> f k n ↓
f↓ k n with k ≤′′ ?
n
... | inj₁ k≤n = ↓=⇒↓ ( k≤n⇒fkn↓=n k n k≤n )
... | inj₂ n<k = ↓=⇒↓ ( n < k⇒fkn↓=k k n n< k )
Both k≤n⇒fkn↓=n and n<k⇒fkn↓=k , on the other hand , were proved in two stages .
I needed to prove an unfolded version of the lemma , which may or may not be mutually recursive on the lemma to be proved .
Take n<k⇒fkn↓=k for example :
mutual
n < k⇒⟨fkn⟩↓=k : forall k n -> n< ′′ k -> unfold ( f k n ) ↓= k
n < k⇒⟨fkn⟩↓=k k n n<k = ...{- tedious proof , I do n't think you want to read it -} n<k⇒fkn↓=k : forall k n -> n <′′ k -> f k n ↓= k
n < k⇒fkn↓=k k n n<k =
≡ - subst ( \m -> m ↓= k ) ( ≡ - unfold {_}{f k n} ) ( n< k⇒⟨fkn⟩↓=k k n n
As mentioned above , this two - stage pattern was discussed on the Agda mailing list .
I do not know whether this will be a recommended programming pattern .
Some follow up discussions seemed to show that this is not always necessary .
I have got to read more .

If you ’re a baby boomer , than you will appreciate this blog post .
I was born in 1962 and raised in Queens , NY .
We had to be creative when we were kids in order to have fun .
We did n’t have gadgets , internet or computers .
So how did we have fun ?
We played Stick Ball in alleys – Played just like baseball , but with no bases .
You scored runs depending on how many sewers your ball traveled without being caught .
We played Punch Ball – You hold a ball in one hand and throw it up so slightly and punch it .
The game is played like baseball , with bases .
We played Stoop Ball – It ’s a game where you throw a Spalding ball against steps and your opponents have to catch it .
It ’s played like baseball and depending on the distance the ball travels could range from a single to a home run .
We played War – This was a lot of fun because we had such a large playing field that consisted of alleys , doors and basements .
Other games included : Touch Football , Hide and Seek , Kick Ball and Wiffle Ball .
When it was raining out – we built models , painted , or played board games .
We even played roller hockey in the basement .
Today , kids have digital addiction that can be good and bad .
The good part about technology is that kid ’s and even adults have information at their finger tips , but there is a bad side .
Kids today are far less physical , and that is why we have health issues that suggest more kids today are over - weight than kids from the baby boomer era .
You hardly ever see kids playing outside , but if you go inside , you will notice that almost every kid is on a computer or playing on a game console .
Whatever happened to the good old days of playing outside ?

Posted on June 30 , 2008 , Chris Rumor : Xbox 360 Price Drop is Real , 60 GB to Replace 20 GB SKU
Last week , we reported on a purported K - Mart circular ad that showed a price drop on the Xbox 360 Premium , Microsoft ’s mid-range console that packs a 20 GB hard drive .
The page looked real enough , but with Photoshop these days , you could make a convincing photo of a massive Oreo being erected in New York City .
That rumor has gotten a vote of confidence from an anonymous source that has contacted Ars Technica claiming that the 20 GB price drop is real and is part of a move to discontinue that particular SKU in favor of one containing a 60 GB hard drive .
The source , whom Ars Technica refers to as being “ usually trustworthy , ” forwarded the following communication to Ars : “ At E3 Microsoft will make an official announcement that we are dropping the 20 GB pro console to $ 299 …
As we launch the 60 GB SKU throughout July , the 20GB SKU will DISCONTINUE .
You will see the new SKU on your 7/1 price list . ”
As I said regarding the original rumor , I ’d wait to see if this is true before buying a 360 .
If you can get a bigger hard drive or save some cash , why not do it ?
Unless you ’re dying to play Guitar Hero : Aerosmith or Hellboy : Science of Evil , there ’s nothing releasing right now to warrant buying a 360 right this very second .

While addressing the annual VFW convention in Orlando , FL today , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama fought back against attacks on his patriotism , and laid out his foreign policy vision .
First he refuted McCain ’s attacks against him yesterday , “ Yesterday , Senator McCain came before you .
He is a man who has served this nation honorably , and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the American people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as Commander in Chief .
But instead of just offering policy answers , he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks .
He said that I have changed my position on Iraq when I have not .
He said that I am for a path of “ retreat and failure . ”
And he declared , “ Behind all of these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the ambition to be president ” – suggesting , as he has so many times , that I put personal ambition before my country . ”
Obama continued , “ That is John McCain ’s prerogative .
He can run that kind of campaign , and – frankly – that ’s how political campaigns have been run in recent years .
But I believe the American people are better than that .
I believe that this defining moment demands something more of us . ”

The Democrat called on McCain to stop challenging his patriotism , “ These are the judgments I ’ve made and the policies that we have to debate , because we do have differences in this election .
But one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people can’t disagree without challenging each other ’s character and patriotism .
I have never suggested that Senator McCain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition .
I have not suggested it because I believe that he genuinely wants to serve America ’s national interest .
Now , it ’s time for him to acknowledge that I want to do the same . ”
“ Let me be clear : I will let no one question my love of this country .
I love America , so do you , and so does John McCain .
When I look out at this audience , I see people of different political views .
You are Democrats and Republicans and Independents .
But you all served together , and fought together , and bled together under the same proud flag .
You did not serve a Red America or a Blue America – you served the United States of America , ” Obama said .
He called for a debate on the merits of policy not personal attacks , “ So let ’s have a serious debate , and let ’s debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not personal attacks .
And no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run , I will honor Senator McCain ’s service , just like I honor the service of every veteran in this room , and every American who has worn the uniform of the United States . ”
Most of Obama ’s remarks were the same standard foreign policy and vets speech .
He talked about Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , more GI benefits , and his personal back story .
Policy wise the interesting news is that he mentioned Joe Biden by name in the speech , and backed Biden ’s proposal of $ 1 billion in emergency aid for Georgia .
McCain ’s personal attacks are a slippery slope for Obama .
He needs to answer the attacks without being taken too far off message , and distracted from the issues .
This balancing act is one that Obama will have to perform throughout the campaign , because if the election is just about issues , then the Democrat will win , but McCain ’s best hope of winning is to persuade voters that Obama ’s judgment and character ca n’t be trusted .
This is the underlying battle of this entire campaign .

States that perform local - level background checks for firearms purchases are more effective in reducing firearm suicide and homicide rates than states that rely only on a federal - level background check , according to a new study by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee .
The study , led by Steven A. Sumner , B.S. , a third - year medical student , and Peter Layde , M.D. , professor of population health and co-director of the Injury Research Center at the Medical College , is published electronically in the May 2008 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , ahead of print .
Local - level background checks were found to be associated with a 27 percent - lower firearm suicide rate and a 22 percent - lower homicide rate in adults aged 21 years or older .
The retrospective study observed the association between the Department of Justice classification of agencies conducting firearm background checks for each state from 2002 to 2004 , and firearm suicide and homicide rates for the same years from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control .
Federal minimums for gun-control laws were established in 1993 with the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act .
The Brady
Act disqualifies any persons from purchasing firearms who are under indictment or convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison .
Other disqualifiers include persons who are a fugitive from the law ; are unlawfully a user of a controlled substance ; have been adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to a mental institution ; have been dishonorably discharged from the armed services ; have renounced United States citizenship ; are subject to a restraining order ; or have been convicted of domestic violence .
There are three entities that perform background checks for firearm purchases .
The FBI , a single state agency or a local law enforcement department such as a municipal police or sheriff 's office are the bodies contacted to perform background checks .
All states consult the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) , which scans federal databases .
This is the minimum background check that must be performed .
States that use state and local checks have access to the same information available to the FBI , as well as information that is available only to state agencies .
" Depending on which agency is conducting the background check , additional records may be accessed , resulting in a more detailed and effective check , " says Dr. Layde .
Federal - level background checks are used as the only level of background checks in 21 states .
Seventeen states use state - level background checks in addition to the federal checks .
Only 12 states rely on local - level background checks , which consult local law enforcement offices , such as a sheriff 's department , in addition to the federal system .
States that performed only federal - level checks saw a firearm suicide rate of 11.64 people per every 100,000 in the population .
States that performed state - level or local - level checks were found to have substantially lower rates of firearm suicides , at 8.45 and 5.74 per 100,000 , respectively .
A similar trend was observed with firearm homicide rates , with 4.28 per 100,000 for federal checks ; 4.02 per 100,000 for state checks ; and 2.81 per 100,000 for local checks .
" As with suicides , the reduction in firearm homicide rates associated with local - level background checks , if confirmed , would also have an important impact on public health and economic outcomes , " says Dr. Layde .
" Assaults involving a firearm are more lethal and more costly for patients and hospital systems than non -gun assaults . "
" This is the first study to analyze the effects of differences among states doing background checks for firearm purchase , " explains Dr. Layde .
" We hope that future research will evaluate the impact of changes in the background checking process that may emerge in the next few years . "
###
The study was funded in part by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Co-author of the study was Clare Guse , M.S. , biostatistician in the Injury Research Center and the department of family and community medicine at the Medical College .

XMonad
Introduction
Do you know a little Haskell and want to see how it can profitably be applied in a real - world situation ?
Would you like to quickly get up to speed on the xmonad source code so you can contribute modules and patches ?
Do you aspire to be as cool of a hacker as the xmonad authors ?
If so , this might be for you .
Specifically , this document aims to :
Provide a readable overview of the xmonad source code for Haskell non-experts interested in contributing extensions or modifications to xmonad , or who are just curious .
Highlight some of the uniquenesses of xmonad and the things that make functional languages in general , and Haskell in particular , so ideally suited to this domain .
This is not a Haskell tutorial .
I assume that you already know some basic Haskell : defining functions and data ; the type system ; standard functions , types , and type classes from the Standard Prelude ; and at least a basic familiarity with monads .
With that said , however , I do take frequent detours to highlight and explain more advanced topics and features of Haskell as they arise .
First things first
You 'll want to have your own version of the xmonad source code to refer to as you read through the guided tour .
In particular , you 'll want the latest git version , which you can easily download by issuing the command :
git clone https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad
I intend for this guided tour to keep abreast of the latest changes ; if you see something which is out of sync , report it on the xmonad mailing list , or -- even better -- fix it !
You may also want to refer to the Haddock - generated documentation ( it 's all in the source code , of course , but may be nicer to read this way ) .
XMonad uses stack which can be used to build the documentation .
Go to the root of the xmonad source directory and issue the command :
stack haddock
which will generate HTML documentation in .stack-work/dist/<GHCVersion>/<CabalVersion>/doc/html/xmonad/.
Of course , the documentation of the latest release can also be found online .
Without further ado , let 's begin !
StackSet.hs
StackSet.hs is the pure , functional heart of xmonad .
Far removed from corrupting pollutants such as the IO monad and the X server , it is a beautiful , limpid pool of pure code which defines most of the basic data structures used to store the state of xmonad .
It is heavily validated by QuickCheck tests ; the combination of good use of types and QuickCheck validation means that we can be very confident of the correctness of the code in StackSet.hs .
Continue reading about StackSet.hs ...
Core.hs
The next source file to examine is Core.hs .
It defines several core data types and some of the core functionality of xmonad .
If StackSet.hs is the heart of xmonad , Core .hs is its guts .

Dear Seth ,
You ’re only three years old , and at this point in your life you can’t read , much less understand what I ’m going to try to tell you in this letter .
But I ’ve been thinking a lot about the life that you have ahead of you , about my life so far as I reflect on what I ’ve learned , and about my role as a dad in trying to prepare you for the trials that you will face in the coming years .
You wo n’t be able to understand this letter today , but someday , when you ’re ready , I hope you will find some wisdom and value in what I share with you .
You are young , and life has yet to take its toll on you , to throw disappointments and heartaches and loneliness and struggles and pain into your path .
You have not been worn down yet by long hours of thankless work , by the slings and arrows of everyday life .
For this , be thankful .
You are at a wonderful stage of life .
You have many wonderful stages of life still to come , but they are not without their costs and perils .
I hope to help you along your path by sharing some of the best of what I ’ve learned .
As with any advice , take it with a grain of salt .
What works for me might not work for you .
Life Can Be Cruel
There will be people in your life who wo n’t be very nice .
They ’ll tease you because you ’re different , or for no good reason .
They might try to bully you or hurt you .
There ’s not much you can do about these people except to learn to deal with them , and learn to choose friends who are kind to you , who actually care about you , who make you feel good about yourself .
When you find friends like this , hold on to them , treasure them , spend time with them , be kind to them , love them .
There will be times when you are met with disappointment instead of success .
Life wo n’t always turn out the way you want .
This is just another thing you ’ll have to learn to deal with .
But instead of letting these things get you down , push on .
Accept disappointment and learn to persevere , to pursue your dreams despite pitfalls .
Learn to turn negatives into positives , and you ’ll do much better in life .
You will also face heartbreak and abandonment by those you love .
I hope you do n’t have to face this too much , but it happens .
Again , not much you can do but to heal , and to move on with your life .
Let these pains become stepping stones to better things in life , and learn to use them to make you stronger .
But Be Open to Life Anyway
Yes , you ’ll find cruelty and suffering in your journey through life … but do n’t let that close you to new things .
Do n’t retreat from life , do n’t hide or wall yourself off .
Be open to new things , new experiences , new people .
You might get your heart broken 10 times , but find the most wonderful woman the 11th time .
If you shut yourself off from love , you ’ll miss out on that woman , and the happiest times of your life .
You might get teased and bullied and hurt by people you meet … and then after meeting dozens of jerks , find a true friend .
If you close yourself off to new people , and do n’t open your heart to them , you ’ll avoid pain … but also lose out on meeting some incredible people , who will be there during the toughest times of your life and create some of the best times of your life .
You will fail many times but if you allow that to stop you from trying , you will miss out on the amazing feeling of success once you reach new heights with your accomplishments .
Failure is a stepping stone to success .
Life Is n’t a Competition
You will meet many people who will try to outdo you , in school , in college , at work .
They ’ll try to have nicer cars , bigger houses , nicer clothes , cooler gadgets .
To them , life is a competition — they have to do better than their peers to be happy .
Here ’s a secret : life is n’t a competition .
It ’s a journey .
If you spend that journey always trying to impress others , to outdo others , you ’re wasting your journey .
Instead , learn to enjoy the journey .
Make it a journey of happiness , of constant learning , of continual improvement , of love .
Do n’t worry about having a nicer car or house or anything material , or even a better - paying job .
None of that matters a whit , and none of it will make you happier .
You ’ll acquire these things and then only want more .
Instead , learn to be satisfied with having enough — and then use the time you would have wasted trying to earn money to buy those things … use that time doing things you love .
Find your passion , and pursue it doggedly .
Do n’t settle for a job that pays the bills .
Life is too short to waste on a job you hate .
Love Should Be Your Rule
If there ’s a single word you should live your life by , it should be this : Love .
It might sound corny , I know … but trust me , there ’s no better rule in life .
Some would live by the rule of success .
Their lives will be stressful , unhappy and shallow .
Others would live by the rule of selfishness — putting their needs above those of others .
They will live lonely lives , and will also be unhappy .
Still others will live by the rule of righteousness — trying to show the right path , and admonishing anyone who does n’t live by that path .
They are concerned with others , but in a negative way , and in the end will only have their own righteousness to live with , and that ’s a horrible companion .
Live your life by the rule of love .
Love your spouse , your children , your parents , your friends , with all of your heart .
Give to them what they need , and show them not cruelty nor disapproval nor coldness nor disappointment , but only love .
Open your soul to them .
Love not only your loved ones , but your neighbors … your coworkers … strangers … your brothers and sisters in humanity .
Offer anyone you meet a smile , a kind word , a kind gesture , a helping hand .
Love not only neighbors and strangers … but your enemy .
The person who is cruelest to you , who has been unkind to you … love him .
He is a tortured soul , and most in need of your love .
And most of all , love yourself .
While others may criticize you , learn not to be so hard on yourself , to think that you ’re ugly or dumb or unworthy of love … but to think instead that you are a wonderful human being , worthy of happiness and love … and learn to love yourself for who you are .
Finally , know that I love you and always will .
You are starting out on a weird , scary , daunting , but ultimately incredibly wonderful journey , and I will be there for you when I can .
Godspeed .
Love ,
Your Dad
The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) , which represents movie studios , is calling on local ISPs to follow the example of British operators in issuing warning letters .
The letters will offer alternative legitimate content sources and are one of three possible actions by the ISPs .
Speed reduction and browser lockdown would be applied to repeat offenders , who would be left with only email and voice - over - IP access .
The federation 's executive director , Adrianne Pecotic , says recent technological advances make it possible for the organisation to monitor file - sharing traffic and accurately determine users '
IP addresses and whether the content being downloaded is illegal .
It would be possible , for example , to tell if a copy of The Dark Knight was pirated or authorised by filmmakers who are among those using BitTorrent Entertainment Network for legal distribution .
The model could easily be applied to music .
Ms Pecotic wants to supply offending IP addresses to their respective ISPs and have them co-operate in the fight against copyright infringement by contacting subscribers .
But the Internet Industry Association , which represents ISPs , says the proposal is asking them to become law enforcers .
Executive director Peter Coroneos says it is akin to holding Australia Post liable for what people send in the mail .
" The ISPs have made a counter proposal , that they are prepared to support streamlining the process to allow the copyright holders access to subscriber details so they can take legal action , " he says .
" But ISPs stop short of taking action themselves .
" AFACT claims to have the IP addresses , but it 's alleged .
Even then the ISP can't say who at the address did the downloading .
The due legal process must be followed in our legal system .
The existing usage terms and conditions talk about illegal activity and not alleged illegal activity .
People are presumed innocent until found guilty by a legally constituted court . "
Mr Coroneos says the technology is not accurate and recent attempts to warn US users caused erroneous notices to be sent to " teenagers and dead grandmothers " .
Ms Pecotic says movie piracy cost the local industry $ 230 million in 2005 .
Increased broadband penetration since then would have meant even higher losses over the past 18 months .
The losses stem from a decrease in film and television program distribution profits and the consequent decline in financial backing from investors .
According to the federation , a confidential US trial by two ISPs and 100 universities showed nine out of 10 students who received warning letters stopped their illegal behaviour .
" They never did it again .
It 's a very effective way of educating users , " Ms Pecotic says .
An Optus spokesperson says the company takes illegal file - sharing seriously and is watching developments overseas , but referred inquiries to the IIA .
Telstra and iiNet did not return calls .
The federation is also working with other industry bodies to educate children in schools about the illegality and dangers of file - sharing , which include leaving the computer open to unauthorised access and identity fraud .
Parents should teach their children not to steal copyrighted work online , just as they teach them not to steal from stores , Ms Pecotic says .
But Mr Coroneos says the matter must be resolved by due legal process .
" I 'm not sure people would be comfortable in living in a society where their internet connection can be terminated without ( the allegation ) being tested in court . "
For 37 - year - old online user Tim , who did not want his last name revealed , the lure of file - sharing is not as attractive as it once was because much of the content he enjoys can now be bought legally online .
But , he says , if film - makers delay the internet release of films to protect their deals with TV stations , they have only themselves to blame .
" The frustration for consumers is when there 's something good that people are talking about in the rest of the world like Flight of the Conchords that was available elsewhere six months before ( here ) .
By the time ( commercial TV ) shows it , half of the audience has probably already seen it on download .
The networks have to learn that if they do n't show this stuff they 'll just lose out to the pirates .
" People go for illegal choices because there is no legal way to download this stuff . "
Ms Pecotic says there is no doubt there is appetite for content , " but movie makers can't compete with theft " .

Researchers have for the first time found that the neurotransmitter dopamine is central to the human brain network governing motivation and a sense of reward and pleasure — and that it changes with age .
The finding could provide clues to healthy , happy aging and pave the way to new treatments for neurological disorders , including Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia as well as addictive behaviors from alcoholism and drug abuse to compulsive gambling .
The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) team used two imaging methods , positron emission tomography ( PET ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , to examine the normal human brain reward circuit , a complex neurochemical network that centers around a path from the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain ( where dopamine is synthesized ) to the nucleus accumbens in the forebrain ( where it is released ) .
Comparing brain activity in volunteers playing video slot machines , the researchers identified processes involved both in anticipating a reward and actually getting one — and discerned age - dependent changes in those processes .
Wolfram Schultz , a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge in England , says the researchers " have tried to push the frontier " by combining two imaging techniques : fMRI , which measures time course , and the PET study , which measures dopamine synthesis rate .
" This is a very smart combination , " he says .
The study , published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA , compared brain activity in 20 younger subjects ( mean age 25 ) with that in 13 older ones ( mean age 66 ) , all in good health .
" This is building a foundation upon which we can search for interventions when aging is not so successful or when this reward system is abnormal , " says senior study author Karen Berman , chief of the integrative neuroimaging at NIMH 's Clinical Brain Disorders Branch .
Bruce Jenkins , director of neurochemical imaging at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , praised the study , although he noted the small number of subjects .
The next step , he said , should be to investigate the mechanism underlying the age - related changes .
On tap : similar studies of people whose aging has not been successful or who suffer from dopamine - related states such as Parkinson's , depression and addictions .
Berman says she and her NIMH colleagues have already launched such a study of schizophrenia , a disorder characterized both by hallucinations and loss of motivation .
The malady has long been known to involve dopamine circuits .
I recently heard that Marlboros were originally marketed to women .
Amy L. sent in these examples from the 1950s ( found here ) .
She writes :
Notice how “ in one picture the baby actually asks mom to have a cigarette instead of scolding him .
It plays up the women - as - hysterical stereotype and also shows changing expectations about good motherhood . ”

I can't have been the only Briton to shift awkwardly in their seat throughout the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic games the other week .
The Chinese mounted an unprecedented spectacle .
Thousands of synchronised drummers , acrobats , fireworks , impossible floating rings made of electric dust ( surely alien technology , that ) , dancers , prancers , singers and flingers .
Maybe not flingers .
I just threw that in to complete the rhyme .
But you get the picture .
It was amazing .
It cost around £ 50 m and was probably rehearsed at the shooty end of a machine gun .
Dance , beloved populace !
Miss three steps and we take out your kneecaps .
Miss five and we go for the head .
Dance till your homeland is the envy of the world !
Stop weeping and dance !
Yet even as my eyes took delight in the colour and magic , my spirits sank .
I 'm no patriot , but I feared for our national pride come the 2012 London Olympics .
How the hell are we going to top a display like that ?
Our plans currently consist of six roman candles , Bernie Clifton riding his ostrich , and some Britain 's Got Talent prick - a- ma - boob beatboxing on a trampoline .
It would be less shameful if we all marched into the arena one by one , dropped our trousers , yanked our bumcheeks apart and let the entire globe gaze right up our apertures for an hour , while the Kaiser Chiefs perform their latest single in the background .
If nothing else , it would give the rest of the planet something to think about .
They 'd never mess with us again , that 's for damn sure .
But my defeatism , for once , was misplaced .
The ceremony was n't as spectacular as it seemed .
An impressive swooping aerial shot of fireworks bursting in footprint - shaped constellations turned out to be a computer - generated lie .
And the cute little girl singing the Chinese anthem was only miming to the voice of another girl , whom the authorities considered too hideous to warrant airtime .
Actually , they were right .
The original girl was an absolute pig , with teeth so higgledy - piggledy you could be mistaken for thinking her skull was trying to chew its way out of her face .
You could possibly use her head as the basis for the lead puppet in a children 's programme set in Ugly Wood , provided you did n't mind your kids vomiting in fear and disgust each time she wobbled on screen .
Oh shut up .
I 'm joking .
Anyway , the deception did n't end with the opening carnival , but bled into the events themselves .
Hordes of volunteers , known as " cheer squads " , have been been planted in the stands during under - attended events , to disguise empty seats and goad the rest of the crowd into whooping on cue .
What 's remarkable about all this trickery is n't the trickery itself - but how ineptly it 's been maintained .
Even a six - year - old knows that once you tell a lie , you stick to it .
You never admit the truth .
Never .
And when confronted with irrefutable evidence of your guilt , you dig your heels in further still - loudly denying reality until your accusers die of exasperation .
It 's a brilliant strategy that 's kept the Bush administration going for years .
But the Chinese ?
A few timid queries and they admitted it all with a shrug .
Yeah , they were computer - generated image ( CGI ) fireworks .
Yeah , the kid was miming .
Yeah , we 're using cheer squads .
So what ?
We 're not arsed .
Stop wetting your pants .
What are you going to do about it anyway ?
Did you know that if we all stood up and sat down at the same time , the resulting tidal wave would destroy your capital cities ?
Ask us again if we 're arsed .
Go on .
Fire away .
They did n't even try to cover it up properly before they were rumbled .
The " cheer squads " , for instance , were hardly subtle - they were decked out in bright yellow shirts and huddled together in conspicuous clumps .
They could n't have been more noticeable if they 'd had searchlights for faces and foghorns for hands .
All of which provides an effective blueprint for us to follow circa 2012 .
First up , the opening ceremony , in which a volcano rises from the Thames , spewing flaming Olympic rings into the night sky while Big Ben - or rather , a genetically enhanced version of Big Ben , one with straighter teeth and bigger tits - pirouettes in the background , miming to the Kaiser Chiefs ' latest single .
This goes on for 15 hours or until the nearest superpower threatens to bomb us .
Then the events themselves begin .
None of them takes place in the Olympic stadium because there is no Olympic stadium .
We 've not bothered building one .
Instead , we 've got a host of exciting made - up CGI sports .
Moon Snooker !
Unicorn Wrestling !
Quantum Deathball !
Dissenter Beheading !
Pac - Man with Guns !
Naturally , none of the other countries has been allowed to practice any of these games , whereas we 've had four solid years to develop and perfect them .
So we 're guaranteed , ooh , at least three bronze medals .
We 'll thrash Paraguay , that 's for damn sure .
And as our virtual athletes ( who are n't really there ) take their place on the podium ( which is n't really there either ) , thousands of specially trained spectators will loudly voice their appreciation at gunpoint .
Then we 'll kick the shit out of one or two overseas journalists and claim the whole thing 's been a roaring success .
Again and again , till we 're blue in the face .
Bish bash bosh .
Job done .
As a twat might say at the end of a column .

The chief of China ’s food and product quality agency was forced to resign Monday in a growing scandal over the country ’s tainted milk supply , which has already sickened more than 50,000 infants and killed at least three children , according to the state - run Xinhua news agency .
The official , Li Changjiang , is the most senior government official to lose his job in the scandal .
His resignation was announced Monday evening , as the government widened its investigation into how an industrial chemical contaminated powdered baby formula and milk products made by some of the country ’s biggest dairy companies .
It is one of the nation ’s worst food safety scandals in memory , exceeding the troubles of a year ago when China was found to have exported tainted pet food ingredients , toothpaste , seafood and dangerous lead - contaminated toys .
The government has already arrested 19 people suspected of intentionally spiking milk supplies with melamine , an industrial chemical made from coal that is normally used in the production of plastics and fertilizer .
Barack Obama today pledged to increase US troops in Afghanistan by a third if he becomes president , sending 10,000 more to reinforce the 33,000 already there .
He was speaking after the US lost nine soldiers at the weekend in the deadliest attack on its forces in the country since 2005 .
Obama has promised , soon after becoming president in January , to begin scaling back the 156,000 US troops in Iraq and Kuwait , and shift the focus to Afghanistan .
He is to fill out his plans in a major foreign policy speech in Washington tomorrow ahead of his first visit to Iraq and Afghanistan since he launched his presidential bid early last year .
Details of his trip have been kept secret for security reasons but a senior Palestinian spokesman , Saeb Erekat , disclosed today that Obama will be in the region next week , with a meeting in the West Bank on July 23 with the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas .
Bill Burton , a spokesman for Obama , said today 's speech " will focus on the global strategic interests of the United States , which includes ending our misguided effort in Iraq " .
He added that a gradual , phased withdrawal of US troops " will allow the US to properly address the growing threat from a resurgent al - Qaida in Afghanistan " .
Previewing the speech in an article written for the comment page of the New York Times today , Obama wrote : " As president , I would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in Afghanistan .
We need more troops , more helicopters , better intelligence - gathering and more non-military assistance to accomplish our mission there . "
He said that ending the war in Iraq is " essential to meeting our broader strategic goals , starting in Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Taliban is resurgent and al - Qaida has a safe haven . "
In a separate comment on the campaign trail , Obama said the killings yesterday reinforced the need to switch resources from Iraq to Afghanistan .
" I continue to believe that we 're under - resourced in Afghanistan , " he said .
" That is the real centre for terrorist activity that we have to deal with and deal with aggressively . "
As well as visiting Iraq and Afghanistan , he is to go to Germany , France and Britain and call on Germany and France , in particular , to increase their involvement in Afghanistan .
His Republican rival , John McCain , is also to discuss Afghanistan this week .
Randy Scheunemann , a senior McCain foreign policy adviser , noted today that Obama had voted in the Senate last year against increased resources for US troops in Afghanistan , including helicopter defences against hand - held rockets and for new body armour , as well as training Afghan forces and for building up the country 's infrastructure .
" Senator Obama is not trying to have it both ways , he 's trying to have it every way , " Scheunemann said .
McCain 's team said the fact that he was making the speech before going to Iraq suggested he would not be going with an open mind .
Although eclipsed by the US 's economic slide as the main election issue , the war in Iraq remains one of the clearest points of division between Obama and McCain , who is committed to remaining in the country until stability is achieved .
Obama , in the New York Times article , reiterated his promise to have all US combat troops out by the summer of 2010 , with a " residual " force left in place to fight al - Qaida and training Iraqi forces .
He did not specify how big the residual force would be - one of his advisers has speculated it could be as big as 60,000 - 80,000 troops _ but Obama said " we seek no presence in Iraq similar to our permanent bases in South Korea " .
Obama argues that withdrawal will help the US save on the $ 10bn ( £ 5 bn ) to $ 12bn it spends on Iraq each month and that money can be used elsewhere .
As well as troop increases in Afghanistan , Obama said he would use the freed resources to increase the US army overall by 65,000 and the marines by 27,000 .
A virus that commonly infects potatoes bears a striking resemblance to one of the key proteins implicated in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , and researchers have used that to develop antibodies that may slow or prevent the onset of AD .
Studies in mice have demonstrated that vaccinations with the amyloid beta protein ( believed to be a major AD contributor ) to produce
A antibodies can slow disease progression and improve cognitive function , possibly by promoting the destruction of amyloid plaques .
Some early human trials have likewise been promising , but had to be halted due to the risk of autoimmune encephalitis .
One way to make Alzheimer 's vaccinations safer would be to use a closely - related , but not human , protein as the vaccine , much like cowpox virus is used for smallpox immunizations .
In the August 15 Journal of Biological Chemistry , Robert Friedland and colleagues used this concept on an amyloid - like protein found in potato virus ( PVY ) .
They injected PVY into mice followed by monthly boosters for four months .
The researchers found that the mice produced strong levels of antibodies that could attach to amyloid beta protein both in both solution and in tissue samples of Alzheimer 's patients .
And although the levels were lower , mice also developed A antibodies if given injections of PVY - infected potato leaf as opposed to purified PVY .
Friedland and colleagues note that potato virus is a fairly common infection that poses no risk to humans ( many people have probably eaten PVY infected potatoes ) .
While tests of PVY antibodies will ultimately determine how useful they can be , they may be a promising lead to treating this debilitating disease .
I do n't mind Canadians making fun of us and vice versa .
What bugs me is that there are a number of Canadians and Europeans who genuinely hate Americans and treat us all like we are each a clone of George W . Like the guy I saw in a Chili 's restaurant in Calgary wearing a shirt that said " Yanks Go Home " .
Just idiotic .
Dude , you 're eating in an American restaurant chain for one thing .
Anyway , it 's become somewhat of a fad to hate Americans lately .
But these folks need tokeep in mind that America is huge and extremely diverse , and many of us have a balanced view of the world and a decent head on our shoulders , unlike our monkey - faced president , who many of us have been waiting EIGHT LONG YEARS to replace .
Democrat Barack Obama has made strides in convincing Americans that he can handle the toughest challenges facing the country , including the financial meltdown and international crises , according to a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg survey taken after Friday ’s presidential debate .
The poll of registered voters who watched the first showdown in Oxford , Miss. , also showed a slight increase in Obama ’s lead over Republican John McCain .
The Illinois senator extended his advantage to 49 % to 44 % , compared with last week , when the same respondents gave him a 48 % to 45 % edge .
Obama ’s incremental advance , which followed a week in which McCain controversially inserted himself into the congressional debate over a $ 700 - billion market bailout , tracked with larger gains Obama made among debate - watchers in showing himself ready for the Oval Office .

Obama ’s youth and relative inexperience have long been a vulnerability , and one that McCain tried to exploit at the debate Friday .
Though more voters still see McCain as more knowledgeable , Obama was seen as more “ presidential ” by 46 % of debate - watchers , compared with 33 % for the Arizona senator .
The difference is even more pronounced among debate - watchers who were not firmly committed to a candidate : 44 % said they believed Obama looked more presidential , whereas 16 % gave McCain the advantage .
The Republican candidate also has lost ground on several measures of voter confidence , including trust .

After the debate , 43 % of registered voters who saw the event said Obama had more “ honesty and integrity , ” compared with 34 % for McCain .
A week ago , the same voters were evenly divided , with each candidate winning the trust of 40 % of respondents .
Voters are also less confident than a week ago that McCain will strengthen the economy and less convinced he cares about voters like themselves .
The Times / Bloomberg poll surveyed 448 registered voters who had participated in a poll a week earlier and who watched the debate .
The poll was conducted by telephone Friday evening through Sunday .
The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points .
The shift in perceptions captured by the poll almost certainly was shaped by more than Friday ’s debate .

In the last week , McCain has labored to respond to the deepening crisis on Wall Street and fend off news reports about his advisors ’ ties to failed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
McCain last week abruptly announced he would suspend his campaign , skip the debate and return to Washington to help with negotiations over a bailout package on Capitol Hill .
A day later , after being accused of disrupting the delicate talks , he reversed course and flew to Mississippi for the debate , the first of three scheduled between the presidential contenders .
The maneuver was viewed unfavorably by 46 % of debate - watchers , who said they believed McCain was “ playing politics ” ; 38 % said he was “ acting for the good of the country . ”
“ It just seemed like there was an element of self - serving politics , ” said Dan Wiethorn , 49 , of Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , who described McCain ’s behavior as “ a little flaky . ”
Advertisement
Wiethorn , who works for a subsidiary of General Motors , had been leaning toward Obama before the debate , and said he was now more likely to vote for him .
He said he was particularly concerned about McCain ’s age after watching him Friday night .
National surveys too show that Obama is opening up a more substantial lead over McCain , with the latest Gallup tracking poll giving the Democrat an 8 - percentage - point advantage , one point less than his biggest lead of the year .
At the debate itself , however , Obama did not appear to have scored a major victory .
More voters in the Times / Bloomberg poll -- 34 % -- thought the debate was a draw than believed either candidate had prevailed .
And 33 % of debate - watchers said Obama did the best job , a four - point margin over McCain .
Advertisement
More than 8 in 10 registered voters who watched the debate said it had not changed their opinion about either Obama or McCain .
“ There were times that Obama expressed himself better than McCain did , ” said Joan Pruiett , 72 , of West Terre Haute , Ind .
“ But McCain did a good job of expressing himself in the latter part of the debate , ” which focused more on foreign policy .
Pruiett said she planned to vote for McCain .
The Times / Bloomberg poll also showed that the two candidates continue to have distinct strengths .
Voters still tend to trust McCain more on international affairs , while they think Obama has better ideas for strengthening the economy .
But there are indications Obama is building on his strengths and chipping away at some of McCain’s .
After the debate , the Democratic nominee enjoyed a 12 - point advantage on the question of which candidate could be trusted to handle the nation ’s financial crisis , twice the margin he had a week earlier with the same voters .
Advertisement
Obama opened an even bigger gap on the question of empathy , with 51 % of debate - watchers saying they believed he “ cares about people like you , ” compared with 27 % who said the same about McCain .
A week ago , Obama had an 11 - point lead on the question .
Obama also appears to have convinced more voters he could handle international affairs .
After the debate , 69 % of registered voters said they were confident in Obama ’s ability to deal wisely with an international crisis , up eight points from a week earlier .
Even some McCain supporters seemed satisfied with Obama ’s performance .
Advertisement
“ He gave better answers than I would have expected , ” said Lloyd Grames , 80 , of San Mateo , Calif .
“ If Obama should win , I would be a bit more comfortable with him .
He really made me nervous before . ”
Confidence in McCain ’s ability to deal with an international crisis remained about the same , with 76 % saying they were confident in him , down three points from a week ago .
McCain has also lost ground on the issue of Iraq , despite growing sentiment that the troop buildup he championed had succeeded in helping curb the violence .
He now has a 13 - percentage - point edge over Obama on the question of who would best achieve success in Iraq , compared with a 17 - percentage - point edge last week .

シミができるメカニズムと消える過程
トレチノインとハイドロキノンを使用することで、シミはどのようになくなっていくのでしょう。
シミのもとでもあるメラニン色素が作られるメカニズムと共に見ていきましょう。
メラニン色素は、角質層の奥深くにある真皮を紫外線から守るために作られる色素です。
紫外線には肌に悪影響を与える有害物質が含まれており、それらを真皮に侵入させないためにメラニン色素が作られるのです。
いわば、紫外線から肌を守る防御作用と言っても良いでしょう。
皮膚が紫外線を浴びると、ケラチノサイトと呼ばれる表皮細胞で活性酸素が作られます。
活性酸素というと有害物質のように思いますが、本来の働きは体内に侵入した細菌などの病原体から細胞を保護する役目を持っており、必要量が保てていれば体に良いものなのです。
しかし、紫外線を浴び続けることで活性酸素が過剰に増えてしまうと、逆に保護しなくてはならない細胞にダメージを与えてしまうのです。
肌細胞がダメージを受け続けると、今度は皮膚の伝達細胞が、メラニンを作り出すメラノサイトに皮膚を守るように指令を出します。
指令を受けたメラノサイトでは、酵素のチロシナーゼを酸化させてチロシンという物質を作り出します。
これが徐々にメラニンへと変化していくのです。合成されたメラニンは、角質層の上へと押し上げられ肌が黒くなるのです。
日焼けをしても、シミになるのは肌の一部分です。
これは、肌のターンオーバーによってメラニン色素が古い角質と共に剥がれ落ちるため、しばらくすると今までのような白い肌に戻るのです。
しかし、加齢などの要因によってターンオーバーの期間も延び、肌の活性化機能も徐々に低下してしまうことで、一部がシミとなって皮膚に残ってしまうのです。
ハイドロキノンとトレチノインで肌細胞を作る トレチノインとハイドロキノンを肌に塗ることにより、皮膚の表面の角質から表皮のさらに奥にある真皮へと到達します。
真皮にはメラニンを作り出すメラノサイトがあり、ハイドロキノンはここでチロシナーゼの活動を弱らせると共に、メラノサイトの働きを抑制してメラニン合成を止めます。
同時に、トレチノインがコラーゲンやヒアルロン酸の生成を促進させ、細胞と細胞の間に十分な水分を与えます。
これにより、肌細胞が活性化して細胞分裂を促進させ、どんどんと新しい肌細胞を作り出していきます。
新しい肌細胞が生まれると、古い皮膚は角質へと押し上げられていきます。
新しい皮膚は、表皮層に留まっていたメラニンも一緒に角質の表面へと押し上げていきます。
皮膚の表面まで押し上げられたシミは、トレチノインのピーリング作用によって古い角質と共に剥がされ、新しい角質へと生まれ変わります。
これを繰り返していくうちに、徐々に肌がきれいになっていくのです。
So we saw him off .
Last week , in a victory for both medicine and free speech , Matthias Rath dropped his libel suit against the Guardian .
But it seems amazing that the courts of this country allowed him to pursue this case .
Rath , a German doctor , appears to have encouraged South Africans with HIV to stop using anti-retroviral drugs , and take his vitamin pills instead .
Several of them died .
It 's an important story , which shows journalists are of some use after all .
But the Guardian stood to lose hundreds of thousands of pounds for having the impudence to publish it .
This newspaper is big enough to look after itself .
But the legal net that Rath used is now being cast to catch ever smaller fry .
In the past few days , Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has dropped its cases against some of its fans .
I am now allowed to write about the worst example of legal bullying I have ever seen .
The club has had serious problems , on and off the pitch , and many of its fans use an internet forum - owlstalk .co.uk - to discuss them .
They make the kind of comments you would expect to find on any talk board , and which would normally be forgotten within 15 minutes .
Two and half years ago the club launched its first suit .
Only now have the people who posted these comments emerged blinking from the labyrinthine nightmare of English law .
As Geoffrey Robertson and Andrew Nicol explain in their excellent book , Media Law , England 's defamation laws date back to a statute created in 1275 .
The criminal offence of scandalum magnatum was devised to protect " the great men of the realm " from stories which could stir the people against them .
Three centuries later , the Star Chamber allowed noblemen to launch civil actions for libel , to provide them with an alternative to duelling .
They made prolific use of this privilege until Fox 's Libel Act of 1792 determined that the claimant ( the person bringing the case ) had to prove that the words used against him were false , malicious and damaging .
This means that libel law 216 years ago was more liberal and more in tune with the principle of free speech than it is today .
During the 19th and 20th centuries , Robertson and Nicol show , " the common law was re-fashioned to serve the British class system from the perspective of ... the Victorian club " .
To protect wealthy people from criticism , the courts reversed Fox 's burden of proof .
They created a presumption that any derogatory remark made about a gentleman must be false .
This remains the case today .
Defamation differs from all other civil or criminal laws in Britain : the burden of proof is on the defendant .
The law remains the privilege of gentlemen , by which I mean people who are able to afford costs that often exceed £ 1 m on each side .
Cases tend to be resolved by sheer financial might , as the plaintiffs bankrupt the defendants , or force them to give in before their money runs out .
This ensures that the law retains its 13th - century function .
It guarantees that most attempts to hold the wealthy to account founder before they are launched , as people bite their tongues for fear of losing their homes .
Since 1879 , corporations have also been able to sue for libel .
The inequality of arms this causes is compounded by the fact that there is no legal aid for defamation cases .
Lawyers are now allowed to fight these suits on a no - win , no - fee basis , but this freedom is double - edged : if a defendant loses , he could end up paying double the claimant 's legal costs .
This is the context in which Sheffield Wednesday went to court to demand the names and email addresses of 14 people who had posted comments on owlstalk .
Here are some of the comments over which the club complained .
" What an embarrassing , pathetic , laughing stock of a football club we 've become . "
" Another day , another blunder .
I doubt even Leeds were in such a mess this time last summer , and look what happened to them . "
" I am waiting with bated breath to hear who the Chuckle Brothers have signed after their trip to watch players abroad .
With the amount of money they have to spend and the wages they can offer the best we can hope for is that little known Transvestitavian International I Sukblodov , who last scored in a brothel . "
Such comments were deemed by Sheffield Wednesday 's lawyers to be " false and seriously defamatory messages " which had caused grievous injury to the delicate flowers who ran the club .
( They should try posting an article on the Guardian 's Comment is Free site . )
The lawyers threatened " proceedings to include claims for injunctions , damages , interest and legal costs ( which could be substantial ) " .
The judge threw most of the application out , but instructed the forum 's host to reveal the email addresses of four of the posters , whose remarks seem to me to be almost as trivial as those he dismissed .
This took place a year ago , and the long shadow of the law hung over the posters until the club 's lawyers dropped the case last week .
Another case dates back to February 2006 , when the club sent a warning letter to a fan called Nigel Short .
When he received the letter he offered to apologise and to change his comments , but the club rejected this .
He was able to fight it only because he found a lawyer - Mark Lewis of George Davies Solicitors in Manchester - who was incensed by this case and was prepared to represent him .
" I 've had two and a half years of worrying I was going to lose my house , " Short tells me .
" It 's been hell .
If Mark had n't done this no win , no fee , I would have been bankrupt by now . "
In November 2007 , Short was diagnosed with throat cancer .
The case continued .
But on Wednesday September 3 he announced that his treatment had been successful .
On Friday September 5 , the club dropped the case and agreed to pay his costs .
It issued a press release which suggested it had done so because of " Mr Short 's medical condition " .
I asked the club whether it had abandoned the case because it knew that Short would now live to fight the action .
It has refused to answer my questions .
The point of this story is not that the directors of Sheffield Wednesday have behaved like a bunch of petulant bullies .
It 's that the law equips them to do so .
Most people see this as an issue only for journalists .
But the internet ensures that the law of defamation now threatens anyone who stands up for what he believes to be right .
This autumn the English branch of PEN , which defends the freedom to write , will launch a campaign against our libel law .
But where are the rest of you ?
Where are the petitions , the public protests , the lobbies of parliament ?
Why is this 13th - century law still permitted to stifle legitimate dissent ?
Wake up , Britain : your freedoms are disappearing into the pockets of barristers and billionaires .

· Silver for Russia with Georgia 's Salukvadze winning bronze · ' We should n't stoop so low to wage wars against each other '
A Russian and a Georgian shared a podium today , putting aside the conflict that has erupted between the two countries and providing a lift to a Georgian team that had contemplated withdrawing from the Games .
Nino Salukvadze took bronze for Georgia in the women 's 10 m air pistol , with Russia 's Natalia Paderina collecting silver .
After the medal ceremony the two posed together for photographers , their arms on each others ' shoulders , and Paderina gave Salukvadze a kiss on the cheek .
" This medal is good for Georgia , especially during times like this , " Salukvadze said .
" I am very nervous today .
It 's very difficult for my people . "
The Georgian government has decided to keep its 35 - member team at the Olympics , and Salukvadze expressed the hope that the Games ' ideals of peace would provide an example to those watching .
" If the world were to draw any lessons from what I did there would never be any wars , " she said .
" We live in the 21st century , after all .
We should n't really stoop so low to wage wars against each other . "
" It 's very difficult for us as Georgians because of everything that 's going on at home .
It was nice that Natalia Paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake , " Salukvadze added .
" Yesterday I thought the Georgian Olympic team might withdraw . "
" As far as the hugging and kissing goes , I do that with many friends .
I have many friends around the world and will always do that .
There should be no hatred among athletes and people , " she said .
" Politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they do n't , we 'll have to get involved . "
A team spokesman said the Georgian athletes were ready to leave the Olympics if it would help , but the International Olympic Council announced on Sunday morning that both the Georgia and Russia teams had decided to remain in Beijing .
Georgia has now won 13 Olympic medals , including a pair of golds in Athens in 2004 .
This was the country 's first shooting medal .
The 10 m air pistol gold was won by Guo Wenjun of China .
The End of Arrogance America Loses Its Dominant Economic Role

With his children asleep in bed , Hans Reiser stole away from his home two nights in a row to dig his wife 's grave , while her body sat in a duffel bag in his car .
That 's one of the details to emerge in this grisly 34 - page transcript ( .pdf ) of Reiser 's belated August 21 confession to prosecutor Paul Hora .
An excerpt is below .
One note : it becomes unpleasant after the jump .
HORA : First of all , did you use shovels to dig the hole or picks or ?
A : I used a shovel .
Q : Ok .
It did n't look like the kind of hole you could dig with your bare hands ?
I mean if you , part of it yes , but so you did use a shovel .
Where is the shovel ?
A : Uhm , I do n't think I can find the spot .
I threw it away .
Q : Can you describe for me sort of where ?
Best you can , where the shovel is .
A : I think , I think I threw the backpack in , you know , I threw it all in various garbage things .
One of the garbage places I remember was actually the park near where you guys found the CRX .
Q : Ok .
The uh , when you left Nina 's van on Fernwood , uhm , did you ...
A : But I was like , you know , I would try to put not so much that anybody would pay attention to and anyone would recover ( unintelligable ) .
Q : What , if anything , did you ever do to Nina 's purse or any items inside of her purse ?
You might , that might include ...
A : Not a thing .
I was going to come back .
Q : All right .
A : You guys picked up the minivan one day too early .
Q : Ok .
What about her cellphone ?
A : Yeah .
I removed the cover on it and pulled out the battery .
Q : Ok .
Did you do that while the purse was still at your house or did you not think of that until you dropped it off on Fernwood ?
Do you remember when you did that ?
That 's what I was getting at , did you take the battery out and you said you did .
A : Uhm , I removed the battery while the minivan was in the driveway but exactly at what time of night , I can't tell you .
Q : But you left the van in your driveway all night ?
A : Yeah .
Q : Uhm , and instead because you lost the keys to the van ...
A : I was worried that I would n't find the keys and I would have to have it towed .
A : Uhm-hmm .
That would have made life easier for us Because if you would have had tow records that might have made it quicker .
But uh , the ...
A : It could have been a faster trial .
Q : Yeah , well , hindsight is 20 / 20 , as they say .
Uhm , let me ask you more , a little bit more specifically .
You said you , basically you said you killed Nina in what I would call the living room of Exeter .
I mean it , I know there is a hallway there .
A : No . I killed her on the stairs . , , , , ,
Q : You killed her on the stairs themselves ?
A : Yeah .
Q : The stairs that go from the 2nd Floor where the living room is , the main and ...
A : Uh-huh .
Q : . . . the kitchen floor and then there 's a set of stairs that goes to the bedroom ?
A : Yeah .
Q : The garage level ?
A : Yeah .
Q : She was on those stairs when you killed her ?
A : Yes .

First let ’s talk about the United Airlines - Google News fiasco .
Then I ’ll get to the London Stock Exchange ’s use of Windows .
Death of a prominent CEO for instance ?
Or a filing for bankruptcy ?
Why not program your computers to search the news for key phrases like “ < Company_Name > files for bankruptcy ? ” .
If it is too hard to build a crawler yourself just create a Google Alert on “ Company_Name ” and parse each alert for “ files for bankruptcy ” .
Computers are wonderful things .
Do you want to make a lot of money in the stock market ?
Well , you know that stock prices move up or down when companies report their earnings .
If you have a theory about which way those stocks move you can program a computer to automagically buy or sell stocks based on your theory .
But wait , everyone else does that too .
By the time you enter the data the market has already moved .
So ?
Just program your computer to read the news .
Within seconds of a company posting its reports you can jump in with your stock trades .
Cool .
What about surprise events that move stock prices ?
This week we learned that quite a few of these programs actually exist .
In a convoluted sequence of events United Airlines ’ stock was pummeled by just such a program .
Here is the latest theory :
1. Because of hurricane Ike passing nea Florida a lot of searches on " United Airlines " Saturday night resulted in a story at the Sun - Sentinel getting enough hits to pop it up to the “ most read ” section of their website .
2. Google ’s crawler , which pings the Sun-Sentinel every 19 minutes saw the story , classified it as new and sent it out to anyone with a Google Alert set up for United Airlines .
The story was titled “ United Airlines files for bankruptcy ” .
3 . The story spread across Wall Street and triggered automatic trading programs .
4. UAL ’s stock plummeted to 3 from 12 before trading in the stock was halted .
Wall Street Journal as much as a quarter of all stock trades are initiated by such “ algorithmic trading mechanisms ” .
According to the
Thirugnanam Ramanathan is one such scammer sentenced to two years prison just this week .
This incident has highlighted a major vulnerability that I predict will be exploited almost immediately by stock scam artists .
Pump and dump schemes are common amongst these guys .
If they can force a stock up or down they know how to profit from it .
One technique you have seen many times is to simply spam the world about a stock to drive its price up .
Another technique is to break into brokerage accounts , liquidate holdings , and purchase a penny stock .
The increased activity drives the stock up and the scammer / hacker sells at the new high .
According to the Department of Justice , at least 60 customers and nine brokerage firms have been identified as victims with losses of approximately $ 300,000 .

If you have used Google Alerts you have probably seen Google get confused by dates many times .
I follow such things as “ haephrati ” and of course “ Stiennon ” .
One common glitch I have seen is Google will re-send an alert on the anniversary of the original news story .
Stiennon on Security blog for instance .
A headline reading “ United Airlines files for bankruptcy ” would be picked up and posted to Google news .
( Go ahead , do a Google News search on that phrase : voila !
You see this blog do n’t you ? )
Then , anyone with an alert on United Airlines would see it and their automatic trading programs would Sell , Sell , Sell !
Assume the hacker can hijack a blog or news site that Google reads .

A scammer could have previously sold the stock short or even set up a buy order at some low price and then sell the stock when it bounced back up after the mistake was revealed .
The stock markets have been woven together with the Web .
This is a dangerous situation .
Anytime you use algorithmic mechanisms you are asking for trouble as soon as the unexpected occurs .
This is an application vulnerability of the highest order and risk .
While Google should tighten up their own algorithms just to avoid the bad publicity and possible liability it is paramount that stock traders build in protections against this vulnerability .

I have to chime in on this Monday ’s failure at the London Stock Exchange .
Over the weekend the US Federal government took the extraordinary step of nationalizing the two huge institutions that back most home mortgages .
Monday was going to be a big day in the stock markets ; too bad that the computer system used by the London Stock Exchange experienced a Blue Screen of Death ( BSoD ) .
That ’s right , one of the biggest stock exchanges in the world uses Microsoft Windows to transact billions of pounds of trades every work day .
I am adding to my list of Top Ten Stupid Uses for Windows .
This one goes to the top .
I thought every major financial institution in the world used Sun , Tandem , IBM , running some flavor of Unix to handle critical transactions .
Ever the optimist , I am wrong once again about the overall intelligence of the world .
The LSE has made its technology a major selling point in its marketing campaigns .
From their website :
TradElect™ is the Exchange ’s new trading system .
It brings unprecedented levels of performance , enhanced functionality and new services to our markets whilst maintaining our exemplary record for reliability .
They may have to change that “ exemplary record ” part .
one source : TradElect was developed by Accenture in India :
From
Tradelect will run on the same " Extranex " privately managed IP network as Infolect and will rely on high - speed middleware developed in - house , which was created using Microsoft 's C# programming language and the .net Framework .
The system will run on Hewlett - Packard servers powered by 2.2GHz dual - core AMD Opteron processors .
You mean PCs ?
There is considerable anger in London over this outage .
I hope the LSE is forth coming with a detailed analysis of the root cause so that others can learn from this situation .
Tiny water bears become first creatures to survive in space
They are the toughest animals on the planet - and now scientists have discovered that they can even survive in space .
The tiny creatures , known as tardigrades or water bears , are certainly strange - looking with their eight chubby legs , little claws and probing heads .
Some experts have compared their shape with jelly babies or moles but tardigrades they should not be judged by their ' cute ' appearance .
They are virtually indestructible - they will not die even if they are boiled , frozen , squeezed under pressure or desiccated .
Tardigrades or ' water bears ' are the toughest creatures on the planet
In fact , they can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened .
Now researchers have revealed that tardigrades - which usually measure no more than a millimetre in length and live in moss - have withstood the airless extremes of space .
A year ago , 3,000 of them were dried out and fired into space to see if they could handle the cosmic rays , a near vacuum and freezing cold .
Amazingly , after ten days , some of them did .
They became the first animals to survive exposure in space without protection .
The experiment , supported by the European Space Agency , was headed by Dr Ingemar Jonsson , of the University of Kristianstad , Sweden .
' Our principal finding is that the space vacuum , which entails extreme dehydration , and cosmic radiation were not a problem for water bears , ' he said .
But admitted that exactly how they survived ' remains a mystery . '
The water bears were kept in a chamber on board the FOTON - M3 spacecraft as it orbited 270 km above the Earth 270km .
A slide was opened to expose them to the vacuum and the cold .
Some were also subjected to the Sun's UV rays which are 1,000 times stronger in space than on Earth and , incredibly , survived for the return trip .
They continued to breed successfully .
Dr Jonsson and his colleagues in Stockholm , Stuttgart , and Cologne published the results of the space study in the journal Current Biology .
He said , ' The ultraviolet radiation in space is harmful to water bears , although a few individuals can survive even that .'
He believes that even if they suffered DNA damage , the little water bears could somehow repair it .
The next challenge is to try to understand the creatures ' ' exceptional tolerance ' to extreme conditions , he said .
It could help scientists learn how to treat cancer .
' All knowledge involving the repair of genetic damage is central to the field of medicine , ' Dr Jonsson said .
' One problem with radiation therapy in treating cancer today is that healthy cells are also harmed .
If we can document and show that there are special molecules involved in DNA repair in multicellular animals like tardigrades , we might be able to further the development of radiation therapy , ' he added .
German scientist Dr Ralph Schill , who also worked on the project , said , ' I hoped they would make it but I could hardly have expected this result - you can't simulate some of the space conditions in the lab ' .
Water bears exist in nearly all ecosystems of the world .
What makes them unique is that they can survive repeated dehydration and can lose nearly all the water they have in their bodies .
When dehydrated , they enter into a dormant state in which the body contracts and metabolism ceases .
In this death - like dormant state , water bears manage to maintain the structures in their cells until water is available to ' reactivate ' them .
In 1998 , Japanese scientists subjected the creatures to pressures up to 6,000 greater than our atmosphere .
They lived .
In tests , they have also survived X - rays and being frozen to just above absolute zero - that 's minus 273.15C , the coldest temperature possible .
' No animal has survived open space before , ' says developmental biologist Bob Goldstein of the University of North Carolina .
' The finding that animals survived rehydration after days in open space - and then produced viable embryos as well - is really remarkable . '
TPM : Here ’s the Pelosi floor speech that Republicans claim so enraged them that they decided to change their votes on the bailout :
Do you hear ANYTHING that is n’t accurate ?
I guess the truth hurts ..

The first photo is of the El Paso police from 1917 in front of their paddy wagon and the second is a modern SWAT Team .
As the first photo shows , it was once standard practice for police officers to wear long jackets to cover up their guns , apparently lest they offend civilians .
The cop of the beat in just about any Hollywood movie in the 1930s dressed similarly .
Apparently , this was a vestige of an anti-militarist tradition .
Now , of course , the police seem to proudly brandish their guns in public at every opportunity .
Does anyone know any of research on when and why the shift from the old tradition of covering up guns ?
Who pushed the change and who , if anyone , opposed it ?
1 The Woman Who has 200 Orgasms every day
UK ’s Sarah Carmen , 24 , is a 200 - a - day orgasm girl who gets good , good , GOOD vibrations from almost anything .
She suffers from Permanent Sexual Arousal Syndrome ( PSAS ) , which increases blood flow to the sex organs .
” Sometimes I have so much sex to try to calm myself down I get bored of it .
And men I sleep with do n’t seem to make as much effort because I climax so easily . ”
She believes her condition was brought on by the pills .
“ Within a few weeks I just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and I just kept having endless orgasms .
It started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times I would orgasm .
Then it would happen after sex .
I ’d be thinking about what we ’d done in bed and I ’d start feeling a bit flushed , then I ’d become aroused and climax .
In six months I was having 150 orgasms a day — and it has been as many as 200 . ”
She and her boyfriend split — and new partners struggle to keep up with her sex demands .
“ Often , I ’ll want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as I can so they stop and I can get some peace , ” she said .
2 The Man Who Ca n’t Get Fat
Mr Perry , 59 , can eat whatever he likes – including unlimited pies , burgers and desserts – and never get fat .
He can not put on weight because of a condition called lipodystrophy that makes his body rapidly burn fat .
He used to be a chubby child , but at age 12 the fat dropped off “ almost over night ” .
He initially tried to eat more to gain weight , but it had no effect .
Mr Perry , of Ilford in Essex , endured a decade of tests before the illness was diagnosed .
It finally emerged that his body produces six times the normal level of insulin .
Doctors have admitted that the condition would be a “ slimmer ’s dream ” .
3 The Man Who Does n’t Feel Cold
Dutchman Wim Hof , also known as the Iceman , is the man that swam under ice , and stood in bins filled with ice .
He climbed the Mt. Blanc in shorts in the icy cold , harvested world records and always stands for new challenges .
Scientists can’t really explain it , but the 48 - year - old Dutchman is able to withstand , and even thrive , in temperatures that could be fatal to the average person .
4 The Boy Who Could n’t Sleep : stayed awake 24 hours a day for years
Rhett Lamb is often cranky like any other 3 - year - old toddler , but there ’s one thing that makes him completely different : he has a rare medical condition in which he can’t sleep a wink .
Rhett is awake nearly 24 hours a day , and his condition has baffled his parents and doctors for years .
They took clock shifts watching his every sleep - deprived mood to determine what ailed the young boy .
After a number of conflicting opinions , Shannon and David Lamb finally learned what was wrong with their child : Doctors diagnosed Rhett with an extremely rare condition called chiari malformation .
“ The brain literally is squeezed into the spinal column .
What happens is you get compression , squeezing , strangulating of the brain stem , which has all the vital functions that control sleep , speech , our cranial nerves , our circulatory system , even our breathing system , ” Savard said .
5 The Girl Who is Allergic to Water
Teenager Ashleigh Morris ca n’t go swimming , soak in a hot bath or enjoy a shower after a stressful day ’s work – she ’s allergic to water .
Even sweating brings the 19 - year - old out in a painful rash .
Ashleigh , from Melbourne , Australia , is allergic to water of any temperature , a condition she ’s lived with since she was 14 .
She suffers from an extremely rare skin disorder called Aquagenic Urticaria – so unusual that only a handful of cases are documented worldwide .
6 The Woman Who Can’t Forget
That ’s the story of AJ , an extraordinary 40 - year - old married woman who remembers everything .
McGaugh and fellow UCI researchers Larry Cahill and Elizabeth Parker have been studying the extraordinary case of a person who has “ nonstop , uncontrollable and automatic ” memory of her personal history and countless public events .
If you randomly pick a date from the past 25 years and ask her about it , she ’ll usually provide elaborate , verifiable details about what happened to her that day and if there were any significant news events on topics that interested her .
She usually also recalls what day of the week it was and what the weather was like .
The 40 - year - old woman , who was given the code name AJ to protect her privacy , is so unusual that UCI coined a name for her condition in a recent issue of the journal Neurocase : hyperthymestic syndrome .
7 The Girl Who Eats Only Tic Tacs
Meet Natalie Cooper , a 17 - year - old teenager who has a mystery illness that makes her sick every time she eats anything .
Well , almost anything .
She can eat one thing that does n’t make her sick : Tic tac mint !
For reasons that doctors are unable to explain , Tic tacs are the only thing she can stomach , meaning she has to get the rest of her sustenance from a specially formulated feed through a tube .
8 The Musician Who Ca n’t Stop Hiccupping
Chris Sands , 24 , from Lincoln , hiccups as often as every two seconds – and sometimes even when he is asleep .
He has tried a variety of cures , including hypnosis and yoga , but nothing has worked .
Mr Sands thinks his problem stems from an acid reflux condition caused by a damaged valve in his stomach .
” If the acid levels are severe enough they are going to do keyhole surgery and grab part of my stomach and wrap it around the valve to tighten it , ” he said .
Mr Sands , who is a backing singer in the group Ebullient , said the condition has hampered his career as he has only been able to perform four times .
In the next couple of weeks –as of the day of the report– , doctors at Nottingham ’s Queen ’s Medical Centre will put a tube into his stomach to monitor acid levels and decide if keyhole surgery is possible .
9 The Girl That Collapses Every Time She Laughs
Kay Underwood , 20 , has cataplexy , which means that almost any sort of strong emotion triggers a dramatic weakening of her muscles .
Exhilaration , anger , fear , surprise , awe and even embarrassment can also cause sufferers to suddenly collapse on the spot .
Kay , of Barrow - upon - Soar , Leicestershire ( UK ) , who was diagnosed with the condition five years ago , once collapsed more than 40 times in a single day .
She said : “ People find it very odd when it happens , and it is n’t always easy to cope with strangers ’ reactions . “
Like most cataplexy sufferers , Ms Underwood is also battling narcolepsy – a condition that makes her drop off to sleep without warning .
Narcolepsy affects around 30,000 people in the UK and about 70 per cent of them also have cataplexy .
10 The Woman Who is Allergic to Modern Technology
For most people talking on a mobile phone , cooking dinner in the microwave or driving in a car is simply part of modern living in 21st century Britain .
But completing any such tasks is impossible for Debbie Bird – because she is allergic to Cell Phones and Microwaves .
The 39 - year - old is so sensitive to the electromagnetic field ( emf ) or ‘ smog ’ created by computers , mobile phones , microwave ovens and even some cars , that she develops a painful skin rash and her eyelids swell to three times their size if she goes near them .
As a consequence , Mrs Bird , a health spa manager , has transformed her home into an EMF - free zone to try and stay healthy .
‘ I can no longer do things that I used to take for granted , ’ Mrs Bird said .
“ My day - to - day life has been seriously affected by EMF ” .
As Ms. Palin takes to the road to campaign with Mr. McCain , invoking the pipeline as a major victory , some Alaska lawmakers who initially endorsed her plan now believe it was a mistake .
State Senator Bert Stedman , a Republican who is co-chairman of the finance committee , said that in its contract with the chosen developer , TransCanada , the state bargained away too much leverage with little guarantee of success .
“ There is no requirement to lift one shovel of dirt or lay down one inch of steel , ” he said .
A spokesman for Ms. Palin , Bill McAllister , denied that her recent statements about the pipeline were misleading .
He said they should be viewed within the context of the project ’s long and frustrating history , dating back to the Carter administration .
“ When the governor signed the legislation giving her administration the authority to grant the gas line license to TransCanada , Alaska came closer than it has ever been to seeing the project actually happen , ” Mr. McAllister said .
“ There is no denying that a major milestone in the project has been reached . ”
Ms. Palin ’s pipeline plan has its roots in longstanding efforts to access the trillions of cubic feet of natural gas under the North Slope , where some of the world ’s major oil companies , including BP , Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips , have exploration and development rights .
Congress has prodded all parties involved to develop a plan to tap the gas since at least the 1970s , but the private sector has been unwilling to assume the huge cost of building a pipeline without considerable government tax breaks and other concessions .
Ms. Palin ’s push for a pipeline is central to her view that Alaska , with its North Slope gas resources , is a key to helping the United States develop an energy policy that embraces increased domestic production of gas and oil and the development of renewable and alternative energy sources .
Her predecessor , Frank H. Murkowski , had negotiated an exclusive pipeline deal with the major oil producers that proved unpopular with lawmakers and was never acted on .
In the 2006 Republican primary , Ms. Palin wielded Mr. Murkowski ’s pipeline proposal against him , calling it a sweetheart deal for Big Oil , which treated Alaska like a colony and faced little resistance from past governors .
Once elected , Ms. Palin set about fashioning an alternative that was essentially a 180 - degree turn , intended to open up the bidding process to other companies .
It also did away with incentives that a consultant for the Legislature estimated would have saved the oil companies an estimated $ 10 billion over 30 to 40 years .
Ms. Palin also rehired key state oil and gas officials , including Marty K. Rutherford , who had quit , and Tom Irwin , who had been fired , after opposing Mr. Murkowski ’s approach .

The announcement is set for 9 a.m. AKDT time .
The Alaska state senator running an investigation of Gov. Palin had accused the McCain campaign of using stall tactics to prevent him from releasing his final report by Oct. 31 , four days before the November election .
" It 's likely to be damaging to the Governor 's administration , " said Senator Hollis French , a Democrat , appointed the project manager for a bi-partisan State Senate Legislative Counsel Committee investigation .
The radical right wo n't care if Palin 's image as a high - minded reformer and competent executive is tarnished .
I think the rest of America will care , just as it will care about other hypocritical actions of Gov. Palin that may be revealed as the campaign progresses .
The selection of Gov. Sarah Palin shows John McCain 's failure to properly vet her and his bad judgment .
He went for a Hail Mary pass to save his fledgling campaign and he put the interests of the radical right ahead of the interests of our country .
That 's not what a hero does .
His hero days are long behind him .
He sold us out .
Let the chips fall where they may .
McCain , regardless of his years of service , does not deserve to be our President .

Enough is enough ! "
Here is the text of the petition and a link to it :
" We the undersigned wish to protest in the strongest possible terms against the inclusion of Dr. Kenneth Zucker in the Royal Society of Medicine 's conference on " Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents " .
We believe that his methods are harmful to young people and that his theories on transgenderism are both outdated and rejected by most of the psychological community as they are based on personal bias and flawed methodology .
We respectfully ask that you replace him with a contributor to the conference who does not give such offence to the transgendered community . "

Cuil - still pronounced " Cool " - has apologized for its quantum porn , blaming the incident on " a serious corruption of [ its ] files . "
After serving up random mid-masturbation graphics ( NSFW ) in response to searches for a Grenoble - based quantum computing researcher , the strawberry - and - muffin - fueled search engine now sees the error of its ways .
In a personal email to said researcher , Cuil general counsel Pete Szymanski insists the company 's groundbreaking Schrödinger 's schlong experiment has been retired .
" We very much regret this incident and offer you our sincerest apologies , " Szymanski tells loyal Reg reader Jonathan Grattage .
" It was indeed a serious corruption in our files that resulted in the inappropriate image being displayed .
We understand this may have caused you embarrassment and inconvenience .
We have taken down the inappropriate materials and have identified and fixed the issue that caused the problem . "
Indeed , searching on Jonathan Grattage no longer reveals arbitrary gay porn .
And similarly lewd and irrelevant images have disappeared from searches such as " work permit " and " download movies . "
For some , this is sad news .
But Cuil has left its mark .
At the very least , the would - be Google killer has brought joy to the lives of physicists everywhere .

Ex-CIA official : WMD evidence ignored ' 60 Minutes ' report : White House disregarded good intelligence President Bush awards a medal to ex-CIA boss George Tenet in 2004 as retired Gen. Tommy Franks looks on .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT
Interactive :
Who 's who in Iraq Interactive : Sectarian divide Timeline : Bloodiest days for civilians Coalition Casualties Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Iraq Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) CBS Ed Bradley or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
A retired CIA official has accused the Bush administration of ignoring intelligence indicating that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and no active nuclear program before the United States - led coalition invaded it , CBS News said Sunday .
Tyler Drumheller , the former highest - ranking CIA officer in Europe , told " 60 Minutes " that the administration " chose to ignore " good intelligence , the network said in a posting on its Web site .
Drumheller said that , before the U.S. - led attack on Iraq in 2003 , the White House " ignored crucial information " from Iraq 's foreign minister , Naji Sabri , that indicated Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction .
Drumheller said that , when then - CIA Director George Tenet told President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and other high - ranking officials that Sabri was providing information , his comments were met with excitement that proved short - lived .
" [ The source ] told us that there were no active weapons of mass destruction programs , " Drumheller is quoted as saying .
" The [ White House ] group that was dealing with preparation for the Iraq war came back and said they were no longer interested .
And we said ' Well , what about the intel ? '
And they said ' Well , this is n't about intel anymore .
This is about regime change . ' " Drumheller said the administration officials wanted no more information from Sabri because : " The policy was set .
The war in Iraq was coming , and they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy . "
CBS said the White House declined to respond to the charge and that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said Sabri was just one source and therefore not reliable .
But Drumheller said it was not unusual for the administration to rely on single - source stories when those stories confirmed what the White House wanted to hear .
He cited a report the CIA received in late 2001 that alleged Iraq had bought 500 tons of uranium - containing compounds from Africa .
" They certainly took information that came from single sources on the yellowcake story and on several other stories with no corroboration at all , " he said .
Bush included the reference , which was attributed to the British and turned out to be false , in his 2003 State of the Union Address .
The CIA in 2002 had sent former ambassador Joseph Wilson to Niger to investigate the claims , and he went public in July 2003 criticizing the Bush administration 's case for going to war in Iraq .
The subsequent publication of his wife 's identity as a CIA employee spawned an investigation that resulted in the indictment of Cheney 's chief of staff and is still ongoing .
( Full story ) " It just sticks in my craw every time I hear them say it's an intelligence failure , " Drumheller told CBS ' Ed Bradley .
" This was a policy failure .
I think , over time , people will look back on this and see this is going to be one of the great , I think , policy mistakes of all time . "
The White House earlier this month reacted angrily to a report that Bush had cited trailers suspected as biological weapons labs as proof of the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after intelligence officials knew that the trailers were not part of a WMD program .
( Full story ) " I can not count how many times the president has said the intelligence was wrong , " White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters .
He added that the administration has implemented reforms to make sure that " the executive branch and the Congress have the best possible intelligence as they move forward to deal with the threats that face this country and face this world . "
Another retired CIA official in February said the Bush administration disregarded the expertise of the intelligence community , politicized the intelligence process and used unrepresentative data in making the case for war .
In an article published in the journal Foreign Affairs , Paul R. Pillar , the CIA 's national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia from 2000 to 2005 , called the relationship between U.S. intelligence and policymaking " broken . "
( Full story )
In November 2005 , CNN obtained a 2003 CIA report that raised doubts about a claim that al Qaeda sent operatives to Iraq to acquire chemical and biological weapons -- assertions that were repeated later by then - Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations in making the case for the invasion of Iraq .
( Full story ) A day after that report surfaced , Bush gave a speech on Veteran 's Day in which he accused critics of the Iraq war of distorting the events that led to the U.S. invasion .
Bush said that " intelligence agencies from around the world agreed with our assessment of Saddam Hussein " and that a Senate Intelligence Committee report issued in July 2004 " found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence community 's judgments . "
( Full story ) The Silberman - Robb commission , which was appointed by Bush , also found no evidence that political pressure skewed the intelligence .
But neither that commission nor the Senate panel addressed how the administration made its case for war .
Senate Democrats have pressured the Intelligence Committee to complete a second phase of its report that would focus on how the prewar intelligence was used by the administration , rather than how it was produced .

And , worse , writing apps that run - unmodifed - on both the desktop and the web is impossible if you want to stick to Free Software development principles and ethics .
AJAX " toolkits " as they are known , such as YUI , Google Web Toolkit and Pyjamas are the " middle - ground " to making Web application development look and feel that much more like you 're developing a real desktop application .
In the case of GWT and Pyjamas , you 're even programming in Java or Python , respectively , and the tool is actually a javascript compiler !
The next logical step is to ask the question , " If these toolkits look , feel and smell like Desktop applications development APIs , why are they not * actually * Desktop applications development APIs ? " .
Pyjamas - Desktop is the answer to that question , effectively making Pyjamas a de-facto standard for cross - browser , cross-platform , cross-desktop , cross-environment and , ultimately , a cross - widget - set Free Software applications development API .
Finally , there 's a way for free software developers to write applications that run - unmodified - as both a web app and a desktop app .
What is pyjamas - desktop ?
based on webkit , it 's a cross- platform application development API .
like pygtk2 , like python -qt4 and wxWidgets , only much cooler because you can , if you want , load * complete * html pages , * complete * stylesheets , and even execute bits of javascript if you 're feeling particularly obtuse .
wow . how ?
because it 's based on webkit .
so you get access to the DOM model , you get full HTML compliance , wickedly - fast javascript execution , media plugins , CSS stylesheets - everything .
whoaaaa - bbb .. back up a bit : what 's pyjamas ?
based on google webkit , pyjamas is a cross - browser _web_ application development API .
it looks and smells like a desktop API , but underneath , pyjamas is an AJAX library and a comprehensive widget set ( implemented as AJAX but you * never * go anywhere near javascript , because at the core of pyjamas is a python - to - javascript compiler ) .
the only actual exposure you really have to have to your app being a Web application is the initial ten line " loader " HTML page and an optional CSS file .
even the CSS file is optional because you are provided via the Pyjamas API with access to some of the more useful CSS features such as setting the width and height , and you can if you wish directly manipulate the CSS style properties from your application .
in short , you get to write apps that _look_ like they ought to be running on a desktop , and pyjamas takes care of all the nasty browser tricks that you would normally take _months_ to code up - if you bothered at all - for safari , opera , IE7 , IE6 , firefox , mozilla , midori ... .. even konqueror nearly works if you twist its arm hard enough .
what 's the fuss , then ?
pyjamas - desktop is a project to port pyjamas - the toolkit that was ported to java - the one that looks like it _ought_ to run on the desktop - to the desktop .
i still do n't get it .
so what ??
you get to run the SAME application source code ( written in python ) as EITHER a web application - on 99 % of browsers in use today - OR as a desktop application - on as many environments as webkit ( well , actually , pywebkitgtk at the moment ) will compile on .
effectively , pyjamas becomes a " standard " for application development .
cross -browser .
cross-platform .
even cross _widget_ set , if someone wants to create pywebkitqt4 and the associated qt DOM model webkit bindings .
and a python - wxWidgets one .
yeah - and ?
i've been able do DOM model manipulation with Konqueror for years yes ... and you get all the KDE baggage , too .
and KDE 's multi-million lines of code is being very slowly ported to Win32 .
and there 's no serious possibility of running KDE on an embedded platform , which is a tantalising possibility for webkit and pywebkitgtk , using gtk - directfb .
you ... huh ??
i'm having difficulty getting my head round the significance free software from ground up home - grown alternative to silverlight .
free software from ground up home - grown alternative to adobe AIR .
except more than that - you can't get silverlight or AIR to run on anything but the platforms that those proprietary vendors choose to run it on ( yes , i know there 's Moonlight / Mono ) .
why ??
because , as it's web - based , being based on webkit , any media plugins that webkit support , now and in the future , you can " embed " , control , and interact with , through the webkit API .
e.g. flash plugins .
what else ?
got a kitchen sink to throw in with that ?
this is n't burger king , you can't have fries - but you _can_ have an event sink , rather than a kitchen sink .
and yes , you _can_ , through the newly - created glib - gobject bindings , access and control webkit 's DOM model through perl , * mm , or whatever obtuse language you choose .
my obtuse language of choice is python ; h2defs.py / pygtk - codegen made short work of turning the glib header files into python bindings , and we 're off .
( btw - yes , actually , there is an example in Pyjamas and GWT called " kitchen sink " ) .
basically , if you 're a perl - lover , you get to write your own kitchen sink , if you have n't already done so .
what 's the catch ?
[ update : pyjamas - desktop 0.1 , which is useable , was released 06sep2008 ] the catch is : pyjamas - desktop is in development .
the version known as " pyjamas - desktop / pywebkitgtk " is about ... 16 hours old !
do n't be fooled , though : in python terms , that 's an awful long time .
the DOM model support went from 0 % to 5 % , enough to run Hello.py , in an hour .
5 % to 20 % , enough to run GridTest.py , in about 30 minutes .
20 % to 40 % , enough to run Mail.py , took another half hour , and so on .
i'm up to KitchenSink.py and it 's pretty much been a walk in the park .
i've a little bit of thinking to do , to handle events properly : the only type of event supported at present is mouse " click " but pywebkitgtk now has support for all the browser event types : it 's just i have n't added them in to pyjamas - desktop yet .
also , i'm adding in glib bindings that i missed out and put on the " TODO " list as i go along .
when i encounter a feature that i need for pyjamas - desktop , " TODO " becomes " Today " .
where on earth did you get this idea from ?
it seemed obvious .
i remember seeing - it could have been a trick of my imagination - back in 1992 , a Windows NT 3.51 application toolkit where you could run Win32 apps - unmodified - through a web browser .
exactly how this was done i really do n't know , but the idea stuck .
so , last month , i made three separate attempts to get started .
the first attempt was with GTK - Sharp and IronPython .
It was the most promising of the attempts , but , missing a JSONRPC Proxy , and not wishing to get involved in Mono / .NET socket and XML at this early stage , i quickly skipped to pygtk2 ( where it was easier to create a client - side JSONRPC proxy ) .
i did a part - port of pyjamas to gtk2 in a few days - enough to tell me that i was wasting my time ... ( pyjamas - pygtk2.tgz if anyone 's interested ) .. due to the lack of support for libgtkhtml3 which has a crucial feature i needed ( for Pyjamas " FlowPanel " ) .
i did a part - port of pyjamas to qt4 in about _two_ days ... ( pyjamas - pyqt4.tg z if anyone 's interested ) ... enough to know that , despite the rich - text support , the layout mechanism in Qt , and the lack of support for being able to remove layouts from grid layouts .... i just ... gave up and made a beeline for webkit ... now , in under 8 hours , with the DOM model access glib bindings to webkit , pyjamas - desktop has 80 % of the functionality completed !
what 's the other possibilities ?
there exists some _really_ exciting tantalising possibilities with this , which takes a bit of explaining .
the first time i saw pyjamas , i went " cool !
a web - based widget set that looks like a desktop widget set .
i wonder if it can be _made_ to be a desktop widget set ? " .
then , i saw that llampies - one of the pyjamas developers - had ported pyjamas to gtk .
i got really excited , only to find that _actually_ what he'd done was the OTHER WAY ROUND : he 'd ported _gtk_ to pyjamas !
GsocLlpamies llampies , basically , has written " wrappers " - alternative implementations of gtk.py , glib.py and gobject.py , which get compiled with the python - to - javascript compiler , pyjamas , along with your pygtk2 app , to run your pygtk2 apps UNMODIFIED as * web* applications .
so , you write your app as a python - gtk app , you compile it up using pyjamas , and it runs as a web application .
even though it 's actually python - gtk - compliant source code .
bear with me whilst i outline why that work is so significant .
take a python - GTK application , and run it through pyjamas , and it's a web app ... but if you run it under pyjamas - desktop , it runs ... as a web app .
that does n't sound significant ... (... in fact it sounds mad .
you 're taking a desktop app and running it ... err ... on a desktop , adding massive overhead and missing out bits of the pygtk2 API as well , _and_ you 're limiting me to the subset of python that the pyjamas compiler supports !!! ) whooa , hold your horses - it sounds mad ... until you remember earlier that i mentioned the possibility of running webkit under python - qt4 if someone writes the bindings .
and running webkit under python - wxwidgets if someone does the python bindings for that , too .
so ... you get to write an app as a python - gtk2 app , conforming to the pygtk API , and ... through pyjamas - desktop / webkit with llampie 's gtk2 wrappers , you get to run your python - gtk2 app UNMODIFIED in a qt4 environment .
or a wxwidgets environment .
or ... any - other - kind - of - environment .
including a web app , remember , if you dump pyjamas - desktop and just use llampie 's compiler .
wow ! yeah .
it 's still madness yeah .
quit bitching about it .
oh - and you _should_ be writing your apps to conform to a MVC framework _anyway_ , so there 's no need to complain about being limited to a subset of the python library .
you have JSONRPC ( yes , i've written a JSONRPC proxy , which is a useful JSONRPC client library in its own right ) , you have pimentech 's JSONRPC server - side django plugin , so you can write the front - end in a limited subset of python ( it 's not _that_ limited ) and get it to talk to the back - end , which happens to be running on loopback HTTP as a twisted app or a django service , where you have full and complete access to the entire range of python libraries .
and , then , if you 're ready to make it a web app , compile it to AJAX with pyjamas and ... well ... that 's it .
you 're done .
and your code is nicely subdivided into front - end , back - end , just the way it should be .
gimme some examples !
okaaay ... from ui import Button , RootPanel , Label import Window def greet ( sender ) : Window.alert ( " Hello , AJAX ! " ) class Hello : def onModuleLoad( self ) : b = Button ( " Click me " , greet ) l = Label ( " hello world " ) RootPanel ( ) .add ( b ) RootPanel ( ) .add( l ) one button .
one " hello world " label .
one alert popup .
one vision .
( just gimme gimme fried chicken ) that 's it ??
yeah .
well .. ok ... here 's the associated HTML , too .
< html > < head > < meta name= " pygwt : module " content = " Hello " > < title > Hello</ title > </ head > < body bgcolor = " white " > < script language= " javascript " src= " pygwt.js " ></ script > </ body > </html > strictly speaking , you do n't need the pygwt.js library in there , but you might as well leave it there .
sure , webkit will try to load it , but if it does n't exist , so what .
but .. but ... that 's just the pyjamas " hello world " example !
yes , and it 's unmodified , too , that 's the whole point , and it _still_ runs as a desktop application under pyjamas - desktop , using the modified pywebkitgtk ( see code references below ) .
basically , i'm taking all the " javascript " code fragments in the pyjamas ui.py and other library functions , and replacing them line - for - line with pure python , calling pywebkitgtk DOM bindings functions !
( ideally , of course , the work would go a lot quicker if i had a javascript - to - python compiler . ) so , for example , in pyjamas , there 's some voodoo trickery going on to walk the Hello . html document , looking for that special " meta " tag with the name " pygwt : module " .
i've replaced __pygwt_processMetas javascript function with one that accesses the DOM model directly in python rather than in javascript , and , once the names of the modules are obtained , this is done : for m in pygwt_processMetas ( ) : exec " " " \ from %s import %s m = %s ( ) m.onModuleLoad ( ) " " " % ( m , m , m ) which , for each of the modules found , directly runs the onModuleLoad ( ) function .
so , in the Hello . html example , you get this being executed : from Hello import Hello m = Hello( ) m.onModuleLoad ( ) and thus your app gets prepared , ready to run the gtk main loop .
can i _really_ still run bits of javascript even though it 's a desktop app ? yes. ctx = main_frame.gjs_get_global_context( ) doc = ctx.get_by_name(" document " ) ctx.eval ( " console.error ( ' hello ' ) ; " ) doc.execute ( " " " node = document.createTextNode (' Some content . ' ) ) ; document.getElementById('body ').appendChild( node ) ; " " " ) that 's disgusting !
yes it is , is n't it ?
even more disgusting is that after you 've done that , you can go and access the DOM model directly through the glib - object python bindings and mess with it some more ! gdoc = main_frame.get_gdom_document ( ) body = gdoc.get_element_by_id(' body ' ) node = gdoc.create_text_node ( ' some more content ' ) body.append_child( node ) of course , that 's using the new pywebkitgtk bindings directly ( just like in KDE except without ... KDE : see example and bugreport context ) .
but - you do NOT have to do this - that 's pyjamas - desktop 's job , to take you entirely away from the " mess " of performing DOM model manipulation , and providing you with a neat widget - set instead .
just like it 's pyjamas 's job to take you entirely away from the mess of AJAX programming .
like they say on Braniac - " STOP !
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME !
We do these experiments , so you do n't have to ! " what ... what _is_ this !!!
it's a new widget set API , effectively .
it 's like python - qt4 , it 's like python - gtk2 , it 's like python - wxWidgets , except without the limitations of those widget sets .
gtk2 has the look - and - feel of an abandoned urinal .
qt4 i love but it still has limited " rich text " - nothing like the power and flexibility of CSS stylesheets .
when i or someone gets round to it , there will even be DOM bindings to the SVG document features of webkit .
so , you will be able to create very powerful and flexible applications , drawing direct to a canvas .
but , that might take a few days of work , so i'm putting it on the " TODO " list .
i want one .
how can i get it ?
now !
right now , you 'll need patches to webkit and pywebkitgtk ( see below ) .
then you get to play .
in the meantime , you can always write your apps as web apps , using the pyjamas compiler , confident in the knowledge that you will be able to run them as desktop apps in the very near future .

The Javascript barrier , posted 31 Aug 2008 at 03:35 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
I 'm glad you wrote an article on this .
I 've been seeing your outbursts of excitement in your diary entries , but it 's hard to piece together from just that .
I was hoping for a little more technical details and background information , but I can ask the dumb questions here and save others the trouble . :-)
The idea of writing a GUI application once and being able to compile it for the desktop or the web is something that has struck me too , after some long laborious work with PHP .
So pyjamas - desktop looks like a giant step in the right direction to me .
As a GUI developer , I do n't want to worry about the low level details of gtk2 or win32 or html or javascript .
I 'd really like one API that does it all for me .
The fly in the ointment is that I am not interested in web applications that require Javascript in order to function .
Neither as a user or a developer .
There are many people who decide to use the web without Javascript , for various reasons , and the web is perfectly useable in those cases ( albeit , rather slow ) .
Websites should not turn those users away .
And plain old HTML does have the bare basic widget set for a GUI application : buttons , fields , labels , combo boxes , lists , radio buttons .
This should be enough for an API to provide limited functionality across the web and desktop barrier .
Since pyjamas and friends makes use of AJAX for its functionality , I 'm assuming that an out - of - band channel is required for handling the event - driven nature of a GUI , in the super - cross - platform way it does .
Does this make plain old HTML impossible to implement ?
Is the architecture so tied to AJAX that my dream of a truly cross - web experience is dead before it starts ? :-)
Because if I 'm writing a website , I must support the non-Javascript users as well , and while pyjamas - desktop gives me a great desktop experience for free , if I have to write an HTML - only version of the site as well , there 's not much gain for me .
pure HTML , posted 31 Aug 2008 at 11:01 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
Since pyjamas and friends makes use of AJAX for its functionality , I 'm assuming that an out - of - band channel is required for handling the event - driven nature of a GUI , in the super - cross - platform way it does .
if i understand you correctly , i do n't believe that is correct [ that an out - of - band channel is required ] .
in the pyjamas - javascript original version , element.onclick and friends all get over - ridden with a global function that " vets " events .
the framework allows you to register " listeners " in a per-element list .
so , the global function will receive an event call , look at the element 's listeners and call them all - e.g. ClassName.onClick( event ) or InputClassName.onChange( event ) , that sort of thing .
in the pyjamas - gtk2 version , i simply ... added those very same listeners to the " connect " glib signal - click , focus , mousemove - all of them .
there was a _direct_ correspondance between the functionality provided by the javascript - based framework and the gtk2 framework .
likewise for the pyjamas - qt4 version .
for the pyjamas - webkit version , i've managed so far to add in a callback mechanism connecting addWindowEventListener to a signal that i'm naming " browser - event " , and i've just very kindly received a reply from someone on the webkit - dev mailing list , giving me enough clues on how to add per-element event listening , corresponding to " click " , " mousedown " , " mouseover " etc. etc .
so it may come as a surprise , and it may not , to know that there is direct one - to - one equivalent functionality , making the task of converting pyjamas - javascript to pyjamas - desktop / webkit pretty damn easy .
the " HTML " version you talk about ( see below for way on how it can be done ) now that _is_ slightly trickier , because many desktop and web apps _rely_ on that " mouseover " and " focus " functionality .
so , if you _genuinely_ have to do PURE html , end - of - story , you would have to code up your app to cope with that possibility .
however , i feel reasonably confident in saying that if you could put up with a _tiny_ bit of javascript - over - riding " element.mouseover " and " window.onresize " for example , you would , i am sure , be able to get the entire framework functionality .
Because if I 'm writing a website , I must support the non-Javascript users as well , and while pyjamas - desktop gives me a great desktop experience for free , if I have to write an HTML - only version of the site as well , there 's not much gain for me .
well , in another rather obscure project i did , i did actually successfully do exactly this : a framework which had two modes .
1 ) AJAX mode 2 ) plain HTML mode .
( and i planned to do mode 3 : iframe mode , you 'll see why that would be possible , from the description below ) .
the basic principle was that " areas " of the screen were subdivided into python - functions ( corresponding to widgets ) .
the AJAX version had empty < div > tags set up to represent those areas , and on the server - side , additional code was outputted in the form of a < script lang= " javascript " > code - fragment , containing an AJAX - based function with the div " id " as one of the arguments .
as you can guess , that AJAX function called _back_ to the server , to obtain the bit of server - side - generated HTML content to be substituted into the < div > innerHTML .
that HTML could of course contain _further_ < div > tags and yet _more_ javascript calls for the user 's browser to execute , and in this way , the page gets constructed bit - by - bit .
there was also a bit of arseing about to make < script > tags being inserted into the innerHTML actually _work_ , because as you may be aware , you can't just insert javascript or CSS into a running HTML page without going through some voodoo magic that gets the JS or CSS properly into the browser 's DOM model .
in this way , in fits and starts , and with a horrendous amount of AJAX calls , the site was " constructed " , from the outside in .
as the actual amount of HTML being loaded was really quite small , it _was_ actually very quick - it just looked odd .
then , version 2 : the " HTML - only " option , was to " bypass " the AJAX loop entirely .
for this case , the server - side would actually call the function which created the sub - content DIRECTLY , resulting , potentially , in sub -sub - content server - side calls and sub - sub - sub - content server - side calls .
and , on receiving each bit of sub- content , the framework would template - substitute the sub-content into the EXACT same location that the client 's browser _would_ have substituted the innerHTML of the corresponding < div > tag .
so it _can_ be done .
the bottom line is that there 's no reason why the same trick should not be done , making a version called Pyjamas - HTMLServer which , instead of creating Javascript , creates HTML fragments .
or , better yet , XHTML nodes .
you could use python - libxml2 to construct the DOM node tree in pretty much the same way , with very little modification to the actual pyjamas framework ( replace DOM. py with a libxm l2 - aware version ) and you simply spew the XML document out as a text file .
I was hoping for a little more technical details and background information , i've put in a proposal to do a talk and a tutorial at ukuug on the subject - but let me get at least my 7,000 - line app working as a test example , first ! :)
update , posted 31 Aug 2008 at 20:11 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
update on progress : i have all the examples now working except for the " contributions " , which includes the canvas - manipulating one .
for that , i would need to add SVG support in the DOM bindings .
so - to confirm , i have : * KitchenSink.py - runs fully , including text selection , iframes , treeview , event handling .
the only thing slightly odd is that Vertical Panel content seems to go " middle " rather than " top " ( there had to be something ... ) oh - and the treeview does go a bit weird when " hiding " .
* FormPanelExamply .py - this was the real surprise : being able to submit and upload files , using , yes , you guessed it - a hidden iframe !
of course , that 's implementation details but it was just ... icing on the cake to have this one going .
* JSONRPCExample.py - yep , even this one works : it was one of the first i got going .
* Mail.py - yes , even the resize notification works , which is captured in this example and resizes the content displaying the " fake email " to fit on the page .
i'm just ... i'm amazed .
now i do n't really know what to do next !
Documentation , posted 3 Sep 2008 at 18:25 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
always useful .
the API docs are auto - generated from the code , and are now available at : PyJD api
the 7,000 lines of python i wrote , for my interactive video chat application , now successfully runs under pyjamas - desktop .
given that that includes the flash plugin , so you can do realtime video chat ( via a red5 hosted server ) i'd say that was pretty impressive .
installing flashplugin for amd64 was a bit of a lairy mess , i have to say : nspluginwrapper did _not_ want to play nice , and i had to do a couple of accidental upgrades of random obtuse debian packages to make it work .
all in all , with the event handling including window onload , window resize , mouse drag , move , up down click , keyboard event handling and even XMLHttpRequest working , all of which i needed in my videochat app , i'd say that was enough for most people to be able to start developing apps , and so i've done a first release : Pyjd 0.01 now all that 's needed is for the webkit and pywebkitgtk people to include the patches .
I think that 's crucial .
I want a framework that degrades gracefully in the presence of a browser that does not support having the client run any software provided by the server written in Turing complete languages .
In this case , Javascript , but I wanted to use a broad category to forestall talk about Flash or Silverlight or what - have - you .
I 've seen far too many examples of server provided software who 's sole purpose is to trick the platform running it or the user into doing something for the benefit of the software author but against the user 's own self - interest .
ok :) i get the message :) i'll try at some point to do a _basic_ demo , but i have to warn people : it will hammer the stuffing out of any server using it , unless cacheing is caaarefully integrated .
auto - generating _every_ bit of HTML , from source code ... that 's ... something that .. well ... :) think about it : when you execute some python code ( on the server , now , not some python - converted - to - javascript , or some python on the user 's desktop ) , you 'll end up calling a widget class which will create an XML DOM node , ultimately resulting in some XHTML being " constructed " and returned .
that 's gotta hurt .
very little " static " content returned , anywhere .

ok - i dug up my old zct application , and hacked it into submission , using lxml .
it 's a start .
you can obtain the git repository , here : git@github.com :lkcl/pyjamas-desktop.git look for pyjamas - web .
the principle is as - described , above : look in mainpage .py for where it " starts " ( i did say i had done a hatchet - job on my old code ! ) .
there 's a global variable , xml_doc , which stores the XML document .
the initialisation is done with init_doc ( ) ( hatchet - job loading Hello.html ) .
then , onModuleLoad ( ) can get at the xml document - eventually - via RootPanel ( ) via ui.py via DOM .
py _eventually_ back to the global variable xml_doc in __pyjamas__.py , and then , finally , back in index ( ) , return etree.tostring (doc ( ) ) converts the XML document to HTML .
looovely :) slightly tricky : how to do button submits etc. i'm going to have to create an HTML form with a GET method around the entiiiire document , to receive any input .
it 's _not_ going to be pretty , but it will work .
anybody who would like to help out , you 're more than welcome .
i've done quite a lot of work already on pyjamas - desktop and pyjamas ( without financial gain or incentive ) ; i've started the ball rolling on pyjamas - web , and it 's quite straightforward : keep trying the examples , and if you get " error " from Window .
JS , you know you have a bit of code to replace from the old javascript with a bit of lxml manipulation :) one small thing you have to remember : errors cause the apache process to " hang around " .
eventually , you end up with every single apache process " frozen " at the last error message , and you need to restart apache to clear them all .
FORM submit thing , posted 5 Sep 2008 at 14:51 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
remember : the history behind pyjamas is that you do _not_ have a " form " anywhere on the page ( except for file upload , and even then that 's a hidden iframe target with oodles of AJAX lurking horribly underneath ) .
consequently , not a single app designed for pyjamas widget set is going to even _remotely_ consider the " form " concept which every good web designer loves .
that leaves very few options to consider , and about the most sensible one is to just ... have ... a single " form " for submission of absolutely everything on the xml - created page .
the only other possibilities involve javascript , which is exactly what you want to avoid :)
well , i got " Hello World " working , by cheating somewhat .
" Grid Test " indicates a bit more of a serious issue .
" Grid Test " has a previous and next button , which you click on to make the contents of the grid go " up " and " down " from 1 to 10 .
the code i have so far , you can get the first page ( 1 of 10 ) .
you can get to page 2 - fine .
but ... you ca n't go any further .
the reason is because the numbering is supposed to go from where the user previously left off , and i'm recreating the page from scratch ( page 1 ) .
this tends to indicate that actually what i need to do is to serialise the entire " object " ... the GridTest ( ) instance - store it in memory somehow and then re-access it and carry on .
this is pretty advanced stuff for a throw - together application .
it smells of zope persistent objects [ and me and zope do n't get on :) ] i'll have a look see if there 's a solution / code kicking around .
... nnnope. , posted 5 Sep 2008 at 21:47 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
thinking about it : the only _sensible_ option is to create a separate process ( or daemon ) which is responsible for maintaining the state information , in its entirety .
the front - end web server will communicate with this , using a cookie or other session information to identify the connection .
the XML content would be communicated from the persistent back - end , via the front - end web server .
ideally of course the back - end would actually be webkit - based , resulting in a rather insane but highly accurate rendition of the page .
including javascript execution .
and , every now and then , content is thrown out for the user to see .
uuurgh :) but - i do n't think that 's sensible to do , as a first cut : working on webkit was long enough and it's a _big_ dependency to add .
i think i can get away with running a back - end daemon , and a " persistent session daemon " is something i've been meaning to write , anyway , for various other reasons , including managing IRC , IMAP , Database and other connections on behalf of user sessions , all of which cannot be " stuffed " into a sql database , a la zope .
FastCGI , posted 5 Sep 2008 at 22:44 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
Speaking of a " state daemon " ...
One of the things I 've always wanted to play with in more detail was FastCGI , after having read Peter Simon 's paper FastCGI - The Forgotten Treasure .

Editor 's note : Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University .
A Libertarian , he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan .
Economist Jeffrey Miron says the bailout plan presented to Congress was the wrong solution to the crisis
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- Congress has balked at the Bush administration 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street .
Under this plan , the Treasury would have bought the " troubled assets " of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown .
This bailout was a terrible idea .
Here 's why .
The current mess would never have occurred in the absence of ill - conceived federal policies .
The federal government chartered Fannie Mae in 1938 and Freddie Mac in 1970 ; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis .
The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts , so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk .
Worse , beginning in 1977 and even more in the 1990s and the early part of this century , Congress pushed mortgage lenders and Fannie / Freddie to expand subprime lending .
The industry was happy to oblige , given the implicit promise of federal backing , and subprime lending soared .
This subprime lending was more than a minor relaxation of existing credit guidelines .
This lending was a wholesale abandonment of reasonable lending practices in which borrowers with poor credit characteristics got mortgages they were ill - equipped to handle .
Once housing prices declined and economic conditions worsened , defaults and delinquencies soared , leaving the industry holding large amounts of severely depreciated mortgage assets .
The fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place , not attempt to fix bad government with more government .
The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy .
Bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company .
Bankruptcy does not mean the company disappears ; it is just owned by someone new ( as has occurred with several airlines ) .
Bankruptcy punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable .
In contrast , a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending .
Thus , the bailout encourages companies to take large , imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government .
This " moral hazard " generates enormous distortions in an economy 's allocation of its financial resources .
Thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective , but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse .
According to this view , lenders are not making loans , even for worthy projects , because they can not get capital .
This view has a grain of truth ; if the bailout does not occur , more bankruptcies are possible and credit conditions may worsen for a time .
Talk of Armageddon , however , is ridiculous scare - mongering .
If financial institutions cannot make productive loans , a profit opportunity exists for someone else .
This might not happen instantly , but it will happen .
Further , the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street 's hope of a bailout ; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30 , 50 , or 80 cents .
The costs of the bailout , moreover , are almost certainly being understated .
The administration 's claim is that many mortgage assets are merely illiquid , not truly worthless , implying taxpayers will recoup much of their $ 700 billion .
If these assets are worth something , however , private parties should want to buy them , and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value .
Far more likely is that current owners have brushed under the rug how little their assets are worth .
The bailout has more problems .
The final legislation will probably include numerous side conditions and special dealings that reward Washington lobbyists and their clients .
Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take .
The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets .
So what should the government do ?
Eliminate those policies that generated the current mess .
This means , at a general level , abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay .
This means , in particular , getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , along with policies like the Community Reinvestment
Act that pressure banks into subprime lending .
The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place .
Someone has to pay for that .
That someone should not be , and does not need to be , the U.S. taxpayer .

College football is slowly creeping upon us and today as they get together in Newport , RI , the Big East has released the 2010 Preseason Big East Football rankings .
The Pittsburgh Panthers are the overwhelming favorites to earn the Big East ’s BCS bid receiving 22 - of - 24 first place votes .
The West Virginia Mountaineers received one first place vote and were picked to finish second along with the Cincinnati Bearcats .
Obviously someone out there liked the UConn Huskies chances as they received the other first place vote but are picked to end up fourth .
This is the highest ranking the Huskies have received since joining the Big East in football .
The Huskies will begin practicing next Monday ( August 9th ) in anticipation of the opening game against the Michigan Wolverines on September 4th in Ann Arbor , MI at the Big House .
Here is the complete Preseason Big East Football rankings :

At this year 's startup school , David Heinemeier Hansson gave a talk in which he suggested that startup founders should do things the old fashioned way .
Instead of hoping to get rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a " liquidity event , " founders should start companies that make money and live off the revenues .
Sounds like a good plan .
Let 's think about the optimal way to do this .
One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that you have to keep running it .
And as anyone who runs their own business can tell you , that requires your complete attention .
You can't just start a business and check out once things are going well , or they stop going well surprisingly fast .
The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom and security .
They want enough money that ( a ) they do n't have to worry about running out of money and ( b ) they can spend their time how they want .
Running your own business offers neither .
You certainly do n't have freedom : no boss is so demanding .
Nor do you have security , because if you stop paying attention to the company , its revenues go away , and with them your income .
The best case , for most people , would be if you could hire someone to manage the company for you once you 'd grown it to a certain size .
Suppose you could find a really good manager .
Then you would have both freedom and security .
You could pay as little attention to the business as you wanted , knowing that your manager would keep things running smoothly .
And that being so , revenues would continue to flow in , so you 'd have security as well .
There will of course be some founders who would n't like that idea : the ones who like running their company so much that there 's nothing else they 'd rather do .
But this group must be small .
The way you succeed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive to customers ' needs .
What are the odds that your own desires would coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful , external force ?
Sure , running your own company can be fairly interesting .
Viaweb was more interesting than any job I 'd had before .
And since I made much more money from it , it offered the highest ratio of income to boringness of anything I 'd done , by orders of magnitude .
But was it the most interesting work I could imagine doing ?
No .
Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic or merely large , there are certainly a lot of them .
For them the right approach would be to hand the company over to a professional manager eventually , if they could find one who was good enough .
_____
So far so good .
But what if your manager was hit by a bus ?
What you really want is a management company to run your company for you .
Then you do n't depend on any one person .
If you own rental property , there are companies you can hire to manage it for you .
Some will do everything , from finding tenants to fixing leaks .
Of course , running companies is a lot more complicated than managing rental property , but let 's suppose there were management companies that could do it for you .
They 'd charge a lot , but would n't it be worth it ?
I 'd sacrifice a large percentage of the income for the extra peace of mind .
I realize what I 'm describing already sounds too good to be true , but I can think of a way to make it even more attractive .
If company management companies existed , there would be an additional service they could offer clients : they could let them insure their returns by pooling their risk .
After all , even a perfect manager can't save a company when , as sometimes happens , its whole market dies , just as property managers can't save you from the building burning down .
But a company that managed a large enough number of companies could say to all its clients : we 'll combine the revenues from all your companies , and pay you your proportionate share .
If such management companies existed , they 'd offer the maximum of freedom and security .
Someone would run your company for you , and you'd be protected even if it happened to die .
Let 's think about how such a management company might be organized .
The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing the total pool of companies they were managing .
When you signed up , you 'd trade your company 's stock for shares of this pool , in proportion to an estimate of your company 's value that you 'd both agreed upon .
Then you 'd automatically get your share of the returns of the whole pool .
The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo , you could n't switch management companies .
But there 's a way they could fix that : suppose all the company management companies got together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in all their pools .
Then you could , in effect , simultaneously choose all the management companies to run yours for you , in whatever proportion you wanted , and change your mind later as often as you wanted .
If such pooled - risk company management companies existed , signing up with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the route David advocated .
Good news : they do exist .
What I 've just described is an acquisition by a public company .
_____
Unfortunately , though public acquirers are structurally identical to pooled - risk company management companies , they do n't think of themselves that way .
With a property management company , you can just walk in whenever you want and say " manage my rental property for me " and they 'll do it .
Whereas acquirers are , as of this writing , extremely fickle .
Sometimes they 're in a buying mood and they 'll overpay enormously ; other times they 're not interested .
They 're like property management companies run by madmen .
Or more precisely , by Benjamin Graham 's Mr. Market .
So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled - risk company managers , you need a window of several years to get average case performance .
If you wait long enough ( five years , say ) you 're likely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you .
But you can't choose when it happens .
You can't assume investors will carry you for as long as you might have to wait .
Your company has to make money .
Opinions are divided about how early to focus on that .
Joe Kraus says you should try charging customers right away .
And yet some of the most successful startups , including Google , ignored revenue at first and concentrated exclusively on development .
The answer probably depends on the type of company you 're starting .
I can imagine some where trying to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design , and others where it would just be a distraction .
The test is probably whether it helps you to understand your users .
You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the type of company you 're starting , so long as you 're profitable .
Being profitable ensures you 'll get at least the average of the acquisition market — in which public companies do behave as pooled - risk company management companies .
David is n't mistaken in saying you should start a company to live off its revenues .
The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposed to starting a company and selling it .
In fact , for most people the latter is merely the optimal case of the former .

Teachers in Scotland are to toughen up their " mollycoddled middle - class " pupils with classes on how to cope with disappointment and failure , it emerged today .
At least 100 primary and secondary schools in Scotland plan to teach a course called Bounce Back from September .
Pupils will be taught ways to accept and solve their problems themselves , rather than turn to their teachers and parents .
The course advises teachers to emphasise how characters in stories combat adversity .
Dr Toni Noble , a senior education lecturer at the Australian Catholic University and co-author of the course 's textbook , said : " We can't protect young people from the stress of all potential adverse life events , but we as educators can make a significant contribution to their welfare and life - long learning by teaching them coping skills . "
The Glasgow - based Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing has helped schools find out about the course by inviting Noble to speak to teachers .
Carol Craig , the centre 's chief executive , said : " Schools are having to teach some of these skills to children because parents are n't .
We think that young people 's lack of resilience is a big issue at the moment .
Until parents understand this , schools will have to do something about it . "
She said over the last 20 years , children had become less independent and had had more responsibility taken away from them .
" This is most acute in middle - class areas , although it is happening elsewhere as well , " she said .
Parents contact teachers if their children fail tests , are left out of the school pantomime or fall out with friends , she said .
Instead children should learn to take life 's hard knocks .
" Years ago parents would get the kids to sort these things out themselves , " she said .
Now parents mollycoddle children into their late teens .
" When young people go to university open days , it is often the case they bring their parents , and get them to do a lot of the talking , " she said .
" But when my mother was 14 she was already working in a laundry and was an independent woman .
The change has been massive . "
Sandy MacLean , an adviser at the Scottish Further Education Unit , said : " Young people are not fragile , they can be likened to springs or balls .
People can bounce back psychologically after being knocked out of shape , just like in nature .
" People are frightened of negative emotion .
This encourages them to try and suppress their emotions .
Research shows this causes more of the negative sensations they did n't want . "
Nothing More Than Duct Tape Used to Seal Door at Biosafety Lab
Tape used to seal containment door at lab where bioterror bacteria are studied .
June 25 , 2008  --
At the government 's $ 214 million infectious disease laboratory in Atlanta , scientists are experimenting with dangerous bacteria in a room where the door has been sealed with duct tape for over a year .
The tape was attached to the door when the laboratory was shut down for decontamination last May after the building 's ventilation system malfunctioned and nine workers were tested for potential exposure to the Q fever bacteria .
Q fever , which has been studied at the lab and causes fatal heart problems , is considered a possible bioterror agent because it is easy to spread via contaminated animal waste .
None of the workers were infected , says Centers for Disease Control spokesman Tom Skinner , who emphasized that the incident happened in the middle of the night , there were no specimens of bacteria in the lab at the time and that the ventilation system has worked properly since then .
Duct tape is used to seal other doors in the facility during decontamination , says Skinner who adds that the procedure adheres to biosafety standards .
" We did not take the duct tape off the door , we probably could have , " says Skinner .
" We will be replacing that door with a different door later this year to further enhance safety . "
Biosafety watchdogs questioned the safety of the procedure .
" That 's shoddy , " says Edward Hammond , a researcher who studies biosafety issues .
" And this is the organization that 's supposed to be setting the standard for what everyone else is doing ? "
Hammond claimed that the use of duct tape does n't appear to conform to the CDC 's own biosafety standards manual , which states that " Seams , if present , must be sealed . "
Another biosafety expert , microbiologist Richard Ebright , told the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , " I do not believe the CDC would approve this arrangement in a laboratory other than their own . "
The issue has been investigated by the Government Accountability Office in two recent reports on the safety of high - containment biosafety labs where scientists study some of the world 's most dangerous infectious disease agents such as Ebola , smallpox and avian influenza .
" Because they are intended to contain dangerous microorganisms , usually in liquid or aerosol form , even minor structural defects — such as cracks in the wall , leaky pipes , or improper sealing around doors — can have severe consequences , " said Nancy Kingsbury , the GAO 's managing director of applied research and methods , in written testimony to Congress last month , reports the Journal - Constitution .
Kingsbury told ABC
News that the incident will " probably " be examined by GAO investigators in their follow - up report which is expected to be ready in the spring .
One of the GAO 's concerns was that there was no single federal agency with oversight of these facilities , which have increased from 5 before 2001 to at least 15 , and that there was not a single set of standards governing safety issues , many of which stem from human error .
" One of the issues raised in our hearing was that while we agree that the technology has become much better in terms of protecting against releases , those incidents that we know about at CDC and at Texas A&M tend to come down to human error issues . "
Last year , two officials at Texas A& M 's biosafety lab resigned in the wake of a CDC report that documented unauthorized access to the high - security labs and misplaced vials of dangerous agents .
And three researchers became ill after being exposed to the potentially lethal bacterium tularemia at Boston University 's biosafety lab in 2004 .
The CDC laboratory in Atlanta is not the only facility to use duct tape , the old stand - by of contractors and home repair buffs .
In 2003 , workers sealed windows and doors with duct tape at New York 's Plum Island Disease Laboratory when a three - hour power failure undermined containment systems .

[ UPDATED -- CANCELLED DUE TO WEATHER ]
While Barack Obama is speaking about international affairs in Germany before thousands of fans tomorrow , John McCain will be talking about a pressing domestic issue with an equally striking if very different backdrop .
Weather permitting , McCain will helicopter from Louisiana to an oil rig in the Gulf Coast to make the case for expanded off - shore drilling , says a McCain aide .
The GOP nominee will be joined by a small press pool of reporters and photographers on a trek sure to offer memorable images .
Because of space constraints , Louisiana Gov. and veep prospect Bobby Jindal will not make the trip .
Since first disclosed Monday , McCain 's visit to the state has been shrouded in mystery .
Campaign aides have been watching weather patterns , including the path of Hurricane Dolly , closely and are hopeful they can pull off the visit .
UPDATE : Just over an hour after finalizing plans to visit an oil rig tomorrow , the McCain campaign has cancelled the visit .
“ The meeting with Governor Jindal has been postponed and we are cancelling the trip to the rig due to weather , " said spokesman MIchael Goldfarb .
McCain will now fly from Pennsylvania to Ohio .
He had originally planned to fly tonight from Pennsylvania to New Orleans to be staged there for morning departure to the rig .
The campaign declined to comment any further about the quick decision to spike the trip other than to cite the weather .

Today , after almost a year , the OiNK investigation came to an end .
Earlier today we reported that OiNK administrator Alan Ellis was charged with " conspiracy to defraud " .
Now , just hours later the alleged uploaders are charged with copyright infringement for uploading one CD .
This May , five men and one woman were arrested for sharing music on OiNK .
The suspects were taken in for questioning , and required to provide DNA samples and fingerprints .
Two months later , two of the six alleged uploaders were released from further investigation , but ( at least ) two of the remaining four have been charged today .
The alleged uploaders were charged with copyright infringement for uploading one CD .
The “ conspiracy to defraud ” accusations vanished , as they were not mentioned .
The case (s ) will be heard in two weeks at a Magistrates Court , after which there is a possibility that it will be passed onto a Crown court .
Torrent Freak had the chance to talk to one of the charged uploaders .
“ I think it ’s a sledgehammer to crack a walnut , ” he said .
The alleged uploader is convinced that he is being used to set an example .
It is indeed strange that thousands of UK residents get off with a friendly warning letter from their ISP , while the four OiNK uploaders are being charged for doing exactly the same thing .
The fact that it is only one CD makes the case even more bizarre .
OiNK was one of the largest private BitTorrent trackers , hosting hundreds and thousands of torrents .
The site was shut down in a joint effort by Dutch and British law enforcement in October 2007 , based on intel from the IFPI and the BPI , two well known anti-piracy organizations .
The police have yet to release an official statement , so more details about the charges may come available in the coming days .
Until then , the BPI told us they can not comment on the case .

Sweden has passed a law allowing all cross - border internet and telephone traffic to be monitored , despite public protests and opposition from civil rights groups .
The law , announced on the parliamentary website , allows the military National Defence Radio Establishment to monitor Swedes ' internet usage as well as content from emails , phone calls and text messages .
The bill was passed 143 to 138 , Sweden 's national news agency said .
Initially set to pass on Wednesday morning ( local time ) , the bill was sent back to the Defence Committee for modification after several government lawmakers indicated they would break ranks to defeat it unless it was altered to improve protection of citizens ' rights .
The revised proposal provides for increased oversight from the Swedish Data Inspection Board , a public authority , and a new parliamentary committee .
These two bodies will oversee monitoring activities by the authorities until 2011 .
Currently , Swedish police can apply for permission to monitor phone and internet traffic in the investigation of serious crimes .
The new bill will allow the authorities to eavesdrop on conversations and communications by default .

In an ad that aired on TV in New York , a man named Burton Aldrich stares at the camera and tells the viewer , " I am in extreme pain right now .
Everywhere .
My arms , my legs , are feeling like I 'm dipped in an acid . "
Aldrich is a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair , and the best treatment for his overwhelming pain , he says , is marijuana .
He continues , " Within five minutes of smoking marijuana , the spasms have gone away and the neuropathic pain has just about disappeared . "
­­To some , medical marijuana is a contradiction in terms , immoral or simply illegal .
But to Aldrich and numerous people in the United States and around the world , marijuana , or cannabis , represents an essential medicine that alleviates debilitating symptoms .
Without it , these people would n't be able to treat their conditions .
Aldrich thinks he would be dead without marijuana .
Others , like Dr. Kevin Smith , who was also featured in these pro-medical marijuana ads , can't treat their conditions for fear of breaking the law .
Smith says that , save for a trip to Amsterdam where he tried marijuana , the autoimmune disorders he suffers from have prevented him from sleeping soundly through the night for the last 20 years .

In states in which it 's legal , doctors recommend medical marijuana for many conditions and diseases , frequently those that are chronic .
Among them are nausea ( especially as a result of chemotherapy ) , loss of appetite , chronic pain , anxiety , arthritis , cancer , AIDS , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis , insomnia , ADHD , epilepsy , inflammation , migraines and Crohn 's disease .
The drug is also used to ease pain and improve quality of life for people who are terminally ill .
So how , exactly , does medical marijuana work to treat these conditions ?
Why , if this medicine is so effective for some people , does it remain controversial and , in many places , illegal ?
In this article , we 'll take a look at the medical , legal , and practical issues surrounding medical marijuana in the United States .

IN THE spring of 2006 Robert Bigelow needed to take a stand on a trip to Russia to keep a satellite off the floor .
The stand was made of aluminium .
It had a circular base and legs .
It was , says the entrepreneur and head of Bigelow Aerospace in Nevada , “ indistinguishable from a common coffee table ” .
Nonetheless , the American authorities told Mr Bigelow that this coffee table was part of a satellite assembly and so counted as a munition .
During the trip it would have to be guarded by two security officers at all times .
Exporting technology has always presented a dilemma for America .
The country leads the world in most technologies and some of these give it a military advantage .
If export rules are too lax , foreign powers will be able to put American technology in their systems , or copy it .
But if the rules are too tight , then it will stifle the industries that depend upon sales to create the next generation of technology .
It is a difficult balance to strike and critics charge that America has erred on the side of stifling .
They claim that overly strict export controls have so damaged the space industry that America 's national security is now threatened by its dwindling leadership in space technology .
The system , they complain , fails to distinguish between militarily sensitive hardware that should be controlled and widely available commercial technologies , such as lithium - ion batteries and solar cells .
The zealous application of the export rules is the American space industry 's biggest handicap .
Egocentric orbit
The controls governing America 's export of satellites are part of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation ( ITAR ) and they are handled in the Department of State .
At one time the Department of Commerce had the job .
But in the mid-90s a great controversy arose when information was shared between American satellite makers and the Chinese .
Politicians reacted to fears that secrets had been passed to China by moving control of space exports to the State Department .
Michael Beavin , a programme analyst at the Office of Space Commercialisation in America 's Commerce Department , says that the wording of the legislation is open to broader interpretation than Congress intended .
An international GPS ground station may have to get export approval to buy a new screen for its
Dell laptop , because it is part of a system that is controlled .
Pierre Chao , a senior associate at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , a think - tank in Washington , DC , says that as soon as satellites were put on the munitions list “ the little screw and the commodity wiring became a munition ” .
Furthermore , anything modified for a munition is a munition .
This clause , he says , captures all the little “ doodads ” .
In fact , he explains , it 's the extremely sophisticated “ part X ” that you want to keep out of the enemy 's hands , not the whole box .
“ You are using an extremely blunt instrument for sophisticated policy needs . ”
You may think that is the price of security , but Lon Rains , the editor of Space News , says that ITAR has “ sped up the inevitable proliferation of advanced technology , by forcing other countries to find other means of obtaining satellite components that had previously been manufactured only in the United States . ”
Joe Rouge , the director of the National Space Security Office at the Pentagon , thinks that ITAR probably made sense a decade ago but agrees that it is now a blunt instrument .
“ The problem is that today you can buy international equivalents that are as good as what American industry is producing . ”
The result is a system that is too successful in keeping American technology out of foreign hands .
Before 1999 , when the State Department took over the export regulation of satellites , America dominated commercial satellite - making with an average market share of 83 % .
Since then , this share has declined to 50 % , according to Space Review .
ITAR 's critics blame the change in export controls .
As bidding opened in July this year for the € 3.4 billion ( $ 5 billion ) of contracts for Galileo , a constellation of 30 positioning satellites being built by the European Union and the European Space Agency , European officials cited export controls as a reason for avoiding anything to do with America wherever possible .
At the start of the decade , Alcatel Alenia Space ( now Thales Alenia ) announced that it would create an “ ITAR - free ” spacecraft , purged of all American components .
Between 1998 and 2004 the company doubled its market share to over 20 % , becoming perhaps the greatest beneficiary of export policies .
Export controls also prompted the European Space Agency to pay to develop a European supplier of solenoid valves , so that European space - propulsion systems do not depend on this American part .
Similarly , Telesat , Canada 's satellite - fleet operator , has said that ITAR is one of the reasons it has selected European satellite builders in recent competitions .
And in 2005 EADS Sodern , a French maker of satellites ' control and positioning systems and subsidiary of the Franco - German company EADS , said it would start to phase out its American supplier base .
Meanwhile , American components and satellites are suffering because of the cost and delays in doing business with the firms that make them .
International companies cannot access an inventory of vital American satellite components and place orders as the need develops because each component must run the gauntlet of export controls .
Whether the component is a motor , a control valve , a star tracker , an antenna or a chip , it is simpler to look for non-American alternatives .
For years , critics have grumbled about the export controls at meetings .
Until recently , the State Department ignored such complaints .
Mr Chao , of CSIS , reckons this attitude is changing .
The marketing of the ITAR - free satellite woke people up .
More than that , though , he says that data have started to accumulate .
In 2006 a survey of American industry executives found that ITAR 's licensing requirements were hard to understand and took an unpredictable amount of time to negotiate ; this hindered strategic decisions .
And in 2007 a survey of around 200 space companies by the Air Force Research Laboratory cited export controls as the highest barrier to foreign markets .
Just across the border , in Canada , the effects were just as profound .
A study in 2006 of Canadian space companies found that 70 % faced delays of three to 12 months because of ITAR .
All of them could find non-American suppliers for the technologies they were looking for .
And after 1999 in Canada , there was also a big dip in the number of American - Canadian projects .
Reducing the revenue and profit of the space industry might be a reasonable thing to do if such constraints supported military objectives .
But critics accuse ITAR of imposing such a burden on smaller companies that it is harming the entire industry , and thus national security .
Prime contractors , such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin , can absorb ITAR 's costs as part of doing business .
But the second - tier contractors that support them and the third - tier component suppliers are having much more trouble .
The burden of compliance on the component - makers was nearly 8 % of foreign sales in 2006 .
For prime contractors this was 1 % .
A spokesman for the State Department says that it would be wrong to assume export controls directly caused the weakness of third - tier component suppliers .
He added that they could be suffering from any number of difficulties , including “ offsets , globalisation , foreign industrial priorities and policy , even the domestic corporate - tax structure . ”
Whatever its cause , a CSIS study published in February concluded that America was being harmed .
Second - and third - tier companies are important innovators .
Moreover , in fields like solar cells , travelling - wave tubes and read - out integrated circuits , there is either only one domestic supplier or a financially weak supplier .
The situation is so bad , say some , that the Pentagon fears it may have to start buying satellite components overseas — rather as NASA , America 's space agency , is scrabbling around to find transport to carry its astronauts to the international space station ( see article ) .
Mr Rouge thinks the health of the industry should be a matter of military concern .
It is not only private companies that are suffering .
In 2005 the European Space Agency concluded that ITAR made its co-operation with NASA 's Mars rover “ too complicated to be feasible ” and that it had to become more autonomous .
Others have warned that delays in agreements allowing Americans to speak with foreigners ( known as technical - assistance agreements ) are a threat to the safe operation of the International Space Station .

Mr Beavin explains that ITAR may define technology “ exports ” as any disclosure to foreign nationals , such as web posts , international scientific meetings and exchanges , conferences and technical data .
“ The academic world is used to sharing and it really makes it hard for scientific exchange .
Nobody wants to be slapped with a gigantic fee or go to jail .
It is scaring everyone into not talking , and that 's crippling for science . ”
Around the world , space - faring nations such as China and India are making great progress , whether they have access to American technology or not .
Mike Gold , director of Bigelow Aerospace 's office in Washington , DC , has nothing good to say about the country 's export policy : “ if the purpose of ITAR is to lose billions of dollars of business , ship jobs overseas , and the Iranians and the Chinese get the same technology anyway , then mission accomplished . ”
The regime , he says , is obsolete and counterproductive .
Mr Gold believes that the State Department has failed to take the time and effort to distinguish between space technologies , as the law allows .
Instead , he charges , the bureaucracy has taken the “ safe and easy ” option and declared everything to be a munition until proven otherwise .
Given the fuss over the way the Commerce Department administered the legislation , perhaps that should come as no surprise .
Escape velocity
In December Bigelow Aerospace filed a commodity - jurisdiction request which would oblige the Directorate of Defence Trade Controls to rule whether one of its products , a set of inflatable space habitats , should be on the State Department 's munitions list .
Although it is unclear how far the request will get , it may be the first direct challenge to the department 's implementation of ITAR for space technology .
There are signs of change .
In late January the White House made some small adjustments to the way the ITAR regulations would be administered .
The most important was a promise that licensing decisions would be taken within 60 days of an application .
Mr Rouge says that work is also afoot to update the munitions list , which contains the set of military technologies that must be protected .
The idea is to make sure the right technologies are controlled .
“ We are in the process of setting up to do that .
We now understand the problem and its ramifications . ”
And Mr Rouge says that Congress and the White House are weighing whether to change the ITAR legislation itself .
When might this happen ?
“ It 's a pre-decisional situation , ” he says obliquely .
Mr Chao thinks that such a reform would represent a sea-change in export legislation .
Such change is overdue .
There can be a trade - off between trade and security , but America 's regime is so badly designed that it can have more of both .
This means spending less time on schemes to control the movement of coffee tables , and more on what really matters .
By Rhodes Cook - July 17 , 2008
Speculation abounds these days about whether this fall 's presidential election will produce a dramatically different electoral map than the virtually static one of the last two contests .
Will Colorado and Virginia lead an array of longtime Republican states that might be won this time by Democrat Barack Obama ?
Or might Michigan and Pennsylvania be in the vanguard of Democratic strongholds picked off by Republican John McCain ?
Those are among the more intriguing questions as the 2008 general election campaign heats up .
But one thing 's for sure : changes in the electoral map require some alterations in the electorate itself .
And that seems to be happening .
In the 29 states ( plus the District of Columbia ) where voter affiliation is kept by party , the Democrats have scored perceptible gains since the presidential election of 2004 while the Republicans have suffered significant losses .
To be specific , the number of registered Democrats in party registration states has grown by nearly 700,000 since President George W. Bush was reelected in November 2004 , while the total of registered Republicans has declined by almost 1 million .
To be sure , the changes have taken place within a huge pool of voters that totals 96 million in the party registration states .
In short , even with the loss of nearly a million voters , the number of registered Republicans is still 97 percent as large as it was at the time of President Bush 's reelection .
Yet this overall trend -- Democrats up , Republicans down -- is also mirrored in many of the states that already have been identified as battlegrounds for 2008 .
And with only a comparative handful of votes needed to swing key states such as Iowa and Nevada the Democrats ' way , the latest registration numbers can only fuel the party 's considerable optimism .
There are a variety of reasons why the Democrats are gaining new voters , starting with demographic change .
In fast - growing Nevada , for instance , a 4,400 - vote registration advantage for the Republicans in November 2004 has been transformed into an imposing registration edge of more than 55,000 for the Democrats .
That represents nearly three times Bush 's margin of victory in Nevada four years ago .
In states that voted near the end of the primary calendar this spring , the spirited Democratic contest between Obama and Hillary Clinton brought tens of thousands of new voters into the party 's ranks .
In Pennsylvania , there was a Democratic registration surge of more than 300,000 in the six months between November 2007 and the April presidential primary .
In Oregon , Democratic registrations increased by more than 100,000 between last November and the May primary .
In both states , which went narrowly for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 , the number of registered Republicans conspicuously dropped during the same per .
And there are states where Democratic gains seem related less to the excitement of the recent Clinton - Obama contest than to the general nature of the times - in which President Bush enjoys little support beyond the GOP base and the appeal of the Republican " brand " is questioned even by party loyalists .
Case in point : Iowa .
At the time of the state 's precinct caucuses in early January , the number of registered Democrats across the state was essentially unchanged from the 2004 election .
But in the months since the caucuses , Democratic registrations have surged by nearly 70,000 , while the Republicans have gained barely 7,000 voters - all this in a state that Bush carried in 2004 by barely 10,000 votes .
The same Democratic registration trend is evident on an even larger scale in California .
Since the state 's presidential primary in early February , Democratic registrations have mushroomed - growing by more than 300,000 , while Republican registrations have increased by just 15,000 .
The disparity underscores why California 's 55 electoral votes should be safely found once again in the Democratic column this fall .
To make matters worse for the Republicans , they continue to follow the path to obscurity in much of the Northeast , an area of the country where just a half century ago the GOP 's then - large moderate wing was rooted .
Nowadays , barely one quarter of all registered voters in New York are Republicans .
In Massachusetts and Rhode Island , the GOP share now is down to 12 percent or less .
The saving grace for Republicans is that this does not appear to be a " base " election like the two won by George W. Bush .
In 2000 and particularly 2004 , both parties emphasized registering and turning out their own voters .
This time , independents will be extremely important - a group that comprises roughly a quarter of the voters in party registration states .
McCain 's longtime appeal to independents gives him an opportunity to offset losses caused by a shrinking GOP base .
Voter registration tallies will be updated on a regular basis between now and the election as both parties and their allies become fully engaged in registering new voters .
But in a campaign that is already uphill for McCain and the Republicans , this is another important area where they will be playing catch up .
Republicans were forced to strip the comment wall and discussion board from the page attached to its new Facebook parody , BarackBook.com , which just went online early this morning , because of comment posts that were racist and anti-Muslim … and some that were anti-Republican too .
The site had been designed by the Republican National Committee as an imitation of the popular social networking site , Facebook , and the comment wall appeared on the application page that allows users to link BarackBook to their personal Facebook profiles .
In addition to some vulgarities , the site also became the target of liberal bloggers at DailyKos.com , who urged their readers to “ befriend barackbook and add the application and basically turn it into a pro-Obama site . ” [...]
Before the comment wall and discussion board were taken offline , more than a few users appeared to take up that call .
And the backlash also caught the attention of the Obama campaign .
As Tommy Vietor , a spokesman for Mr. Obama , put it : “ I agree with the first comment thread on their discussion board : ‘ The site is lame . ’”
Alex Conant , a spokesman for the R.N.C. , said the ultimate goal of scrubbing the Facebook application page was to make sure the content was “ consistent with a respectful campaign . ”
Tenafly man charged with filing 18 false tax returns
The man allegedly got stolen Social Security numbers and forms that he used to submit at least 18 fake returns at tax preparation services .
The public - corruption investigation that paralyzed Cuyahoga County government Monday unraveled the political and business ties of the county 's most powerful and colorful players : Commissioner Jimmy Dimora and Auditor Frank Russo .
The federal investigation centers on allegations that they traded jobs and contracts for thousands of dollars of free improvements to their homes and properties .
The investigation went public when nearly 200 agents from the FBI and IRS simultaneously raided county offices , businesses and homes at 9 a.m .
The operation was so broad that the FBI brought in agents from Pittsburgh and used three U - Haul trucks to take away cartons of documents and other items .
Dimora and Russo , who have spent their political careers in the limelight , stayed out of sight all day and were not available for comment .
The nearly inseparable duo built a Democratic machine by hiring friends and allies , which is the subject of a continuing Plain Dealer investigative series .
And the two have helped the party control every elected office in the county for decades , partly through Dimora 's role as county Democratic Party chairman .

Lazy is good .
One Python trend I 've noticed quite a bit is the severe under - usage of generators .
I often see list comprehension being used in situations where building a temporary list is not only wasteful , but more work .
Example :
In this case , LC is being used to build a temporary list whose only purpose is to be iterated by " sum " .
Instead of constructing this list , why not pass an iterable object to " sum " and have it accumulate the sum from that ?
Well , not only can you , but it 's even less to type ( a whopping two characters less ) :
Simply excluding the square brackets takes it from a list - comp to a generator expression , which is lazily evaluated .
To demonstrate , proof that generators do n't actually compute anything until they are pulled :
So naturally , these can be a really useful and compact way to transform a sequence .
But the generator - expression syntax does n't really allow for very complex stuff ...
Lucky Python also supports generator functions using the " yield " keyword that allows you to lazily preserve state between calls to " next " And then , another thing I see is similar use of the map , filter , zip functions , which here in Python2.5 land return an entire list ( this wo n't be an issue in Python3 , however ) .
For the time being , if you need a lazy map / filter , either use generator expressions or use the itertools moduleIn this case , the imap / ifilter works better than generator expressions ( IMO ) because of the need for the strings as integers in the " even " function .
With GE
I 'm forced to either call the int function twice , or to break it up across lines :
But , since this is lazy , the filtering is done as the mapping takes place ( neither are bundled into any temporary lists or anything ) Likewise , using " range " instead of " xrange " for integer iteration is also a wasteful practice ( this will be fixed in Python3 as well ) .
To wrap it up , just for fun ( no practical value to a Python coder at all ) , how would you make a lazy sequence in Python if it did n't support generators or iterators ?
The way the lisp gods did before us ... ( lazy cons streams ) ( I know , I cheated with the lmap function , but Pythons recursive limit makes it a bit impractical )
Observation on today 's online journalism : in my book , Death is not News .
Neither is the weather , nor the actions of religious or famous people .
out of a possible 20 " news " items on CNN.com , a full 15 focus on death ( usually violent death ) , crime , weather , religion , or celebrity .
of the remaining 5 items , 2 are related to politics , 1 is related to business / entertainment , 1 is science , and 1 is random .
in other words , about 80 % of news is simply death , weather , or fame .
think i'll go back to reading TechMeme and ESPN .
Japan to Send their Ships Solar
August 26th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
With the entire planet in a crazy attempt to make everything from transport to washing green , it comes as no real surprise to see another industry take up the challenge .
And , as with a lot of things technological , Japan is leading the way .
Japan ’s biggest shipping company – Nippon Yusen KK – is going to be working with Nippon Oil Corp to develop solar panels capable of partially powering their vessels .
The plans will see Nippon Yusen invest approximately 150 million yen , $ 1.4 million USD , into the development of the solar panel system to be designed by Nippon Oil .
The panels will be capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity , compared to a 3.5 kilowatt generating solar panel that you might install on your own home .
The panels will be placed atop 60,000 ton car carriers being used by Toyota Motor Corp , and save up to 6.5 % of fuel oil normally used in powering the large diesel engines .
Such a system is hoped to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by between 1 an 2 percent , which equates to about 20 tons a year , according to Hideyuki Dohi , general manager at Nippon Oil ’s energy system development department .
And when are they looking to do this ?
“ If it ’s possible , we want to aim for the full commercialization of the system in the next three to five years , ” Nippon Oil Executive Vice President Ikutoshi Matsumura told reporters .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
It 's fascinating that John McCain lies not only about the big things ( his desire to stay in Iraq for decades , his claim that he 's a " reformer " when his staff is chock - full of lobbyists , etc. ) but he has an uncanny ability to fib even about the most mundane of items -- like filing out campaign questionnaires :
John McCain at the NAACP convention today assured a questioner that he will indeed fill out the group 's civil rights survey , a comment that prompted a smattering of applause .
" I 'll look forward to filling it out , " McCain said .
" We fill out literally every survey , so I 'll be more than happy to do that . "
Literally ever survey .
Except , as Hotline points out , the Project Vote Smart Survey :
Every survey ?
Well ... not quite .
Rewind to April 10 , 2008 , when Mother Jones reported that McCain was booted from the Project Vote Smart board for not completing the organization 's Political Courage Test .
Mother Jones : " PVS contacted the McCain campaign 25 times from June 2007 to February 2008 in the hopes of avoiding the embarrassment this move entails for both the organization and one of its long - time board members . "
And as a commenter at Hotline points out , he also did n't fill out the AFL - CIO survey .
He also did not respond to the Midwest Democracy Network questionnaire .
Or the Human Rights Campaign questionnaire .
Or the Oregon Fair Trade questionnaire .
Or the American Association of People with Disabilities questionnaire ...
You get the idea .
When a verse is repeated almost word for word from one book to another , I wo n't repeat it in this list , unless for some reason it seems to bear repeating .
( Which is why there 's a lot more from Matthew than any of the other four books . )
And I 'm quoting from the Revised Standard Version .
I 'm also not going to bother with factual errors ( like " there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom " ) , or internal contradictions ( such as the whole " Should you do your good Christian works openly or secretly ? " question ) , or instances of Jesus just being a jerk ( like blighting the fig tree , and the whole " dissing his mother and brothers " thing ) .
And I 'm not going to nitpick every little idea in the Gospels that sort of bugs me ..
I 'm just going to talk about seriously troubling ethical and political ideas .
I will , however , talk about both the hell stuff and the " I am God " stuff when it points to some other troubling aspect of the Jesus philosophy ... such as the oft - repeated " Believing that I am God and following my teachings is the only right way to practice religion " trope .
And I 'm not going to cite the self - aggrandizing " I am God " stuff , as it seems like a rhetorical dead - end .
After all , the whole question of whether Jesus was or was not God is exactly the point on which Christians and I disagree , so pointing to it as an example of a problematic philosophy is a bit too circular for my taste .
Instead , I 'm going to focus on ideas in the Gospels that most progressives would find troubling ... completely apart from the question of Jesus 's divinity ( or , indeed , his existence ) .
I 'm not going to cite references to hell and damnation .
I do think that 's one of the most profoundly messed - up ideas in the Gospels , and it's one of the most prevalent ; but I 've already catalogued it previously .
I 'm talking here about my own opinion about what is or is not a screwed - up idea .
But I am going to focus on ideas that most modern progressives agree are screwed - up ( or would , if the ideas had n't come from Jesus ) .
There are some seriously screwed - up ideas in the Gospels .
And they 're ideas that run counter to some of the most treasured principles of most modern progressives ... including progressive Christians .
But it 's a very mixed bag indeed .
And while a mixed bag is okay if you 're just talking about human ideas -- every one of the thinkers I admire have some ideas I think are coo-coo or messed up or just plain wrong -- it 's a lot more problematic when you believe that the ideas in question come straight from the mouth of a perfect God .
I 'll grant that the philosophy of the Jesus character in the New Testament is , in many ways , an improvement over the Old Testament .
It 's a lot lighter on the genocidal brutality and violence , for one thing .
And some of the ideas in the Gospels are pretty decent ones .
" I 'm not a fundamentalist .
I do n't believe in every word of the Bible .
But I do believe in the teachings of Jesus .
They 're so full of love and peace and tolerance .
That 's where I get my divine inspiration from . "
There 's a common trope among many progressive Christians ( and among many progressives who are n't Christian but who want to be ecumenical ) .
It goes something like this :
Matthew 5:18 : " Whosoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . "
The first in a long line of " You have to do exactly what I tell you " teachings .
None of this " Different people find God in different ways " ecumenical crap for Jesus .
No , sir .
My way or the highway .
Matthew 5:21 - 22 : " You have heard it said that it was said to the men of old , ' You shall not kill ; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment . '
But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment ; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council , and whoever says ' You fool ! ' shall be liable to the hell of fire . "
So now we have thought crimes ?
Being angry is as bad as as killing , and as deserving of punishment ?
Not to mention speech crimes .
Insulting people and calling them fools makes you deserve to be burned in fire ?
I do n't think the ACLU would look very kindly on this one .
Matthew 5:27 - 28 : " You have heard that it was said , ' You shall not commit adultery . '
But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart . ' "
Ditto above .
Thought crimes .
Thinking about prohibited sex is as bad as having it .
Nice .
Plus , we have the whole idea of prohibited sex and consensual sex crimes in the first place .
Not to mention the sexist and heterosexist assumption that only women get looked at with lust ... and only men's lust counts .
Matthew 5:31 - 32 : " It was also said , ' Whoever divorces his wife , let him give her a certificate of divorce . '
But I way to you that every one who divorces his wife , except on the ground of unchastity , makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery . "
So now divorce is out , too .
Not only do we have the idea that the consenting ( if often dishonest ) act of adultery is a sin .
We now have the idea that marriage must be permanent , and divorce is tantamount to adultery .
Unless , of course , the woman is unchaste .
Then divorce is okay .
What happens if the man is unchaste is n't mentioned .
Matthew 5:38 : " But I say to you , Do not resist one who is evil .
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . "
So much for Martin Luther King ; the abolitionists ; the resistance movement in Nazi Germany .
They were n't following Jesus 's teachings , I guess .
After all , they did n't just stand there and let themselves get hit .
They resisted one , or ones , who were evil .
Bad move , apparently .
Matthew 7:24 - 27 : " Every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock ; and the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house , but it did not fall , because it had been founded on rock .
And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand ; and the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house , and it fell ; and great was the fall of it . "
Yet another in the " You have to do exactly what I tell you and follow all my teachings " trope .
Again , not exactly the spirit of groovy progressive ecumenicalism .
Matthew 8:21 - 22 : Another of the disciples said to him , " Lord , let me first go and bury my father . "
But Jesus said to him , " Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . "
Sheesh , dude .
How callous can you get ?
Okay , he 's making a point about how you should focus on life and not death , or something .
But he 's not going to let his disciple off to go to his dad 's funeral ?
Even heartless multinational corporations let you off to go to your dad 's funeral .
Even heartless multinational corporations recognize that a big part of honoring life is acknowledging death and grief .
That is some fucked - up shit right here .
Matthew 10:14 - 15 ( said to the twelve disciples , instructing them on how to spread his word ) : " And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town .
Truly , I say to you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town . "
Well , I like the part about not pestering people to death about your beliefs .
In fact , I wish a lot more Christians would take that to heart .
But yet again , we have the theme of " anyone who does n't listen to my teachings and believe them is doomed . "
Nice .
Very tolerant .
Matthew 10:32 - 33 : " So every one who acknowledges me before men , I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven ; but whoever denies me before men , I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven .
Once again , it 's the " You have to believe in me if you want to be saved " theme .
This theme comes up a lot in the words of Jesus , and I do n't have a snarky comment for every single instance of it .
But it is ( a ) an unbelievably common theme , and ( b ) a theme that runs completely counter to the tolerant , ecumenical , " there are lots of different ways to find God " values of progressive Christianity ... not to mention the tolerant , diversity - loving values of progressivism generally .
So I 'm going to list every single clear - cut instance of it that I can find .
Matthew 10:34 : " Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth ; I have not come to bring peace , but a sword . "
Let 's hear it for peace and unity !
You know , considering that the one message progressive Christians hammer on about more than any other is " peace on earth , " I find it very interesting that the Jesus character actually said , in actual words , " Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth . "
( This is a point I 've made before -- liberal Christians can be just as bad about cherry - picking as conservative ones . )
Matthew 10:35 - 37 : " For I have come to set a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law ; and a man 's foes will be those of his own household .
He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . "
Some nice family values you got there .
Peace , unity , brotherhood ?
I do n't think so .
And again , we have the " You have to follow me or else " theme .
Only now we 're starting to see the " at the expense of your family and everything else in your life " side of it .
Sometimes , the guy sounds like Jim Jones or the Bhagwan Rajneesh .
Matthew 11:21 - 23 ( said to crowds in cities , for not repenting when they saw his miracles ) : " Woe to you , Chorazin ! woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
But I tell you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ?
You shall be brought down to Hades .
For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you . "
And again : Anyone who does n't believe in me and follow me will burn in hell .
Matthew 12:30 : " He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters . "
Again with the " If you 're not totally on my side , you 're hosed " theme .
You can't get it much plainer that this , actually .
Matthew 12:31 - 32 : " Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come . "
And again .
In possibly the harshest language of all .
This is the thing that the Blasphemy Challenge is all about -- the idea that blaspheming against the Holy Spirit is the one unforgivable sin .
I 'm not going to talk here about the idea of an unforgivable sin .
There are people who I 'll probably never forgive -- George W. Bush comes to mind -- and I 'm more or less okay with that .
So I 'm going to say this instead :
If you were going to pick one sin to be unforgivable , would you pick " denying Jesus 's divinity and blaspheming against the Holy Spirit " ?
Would n't you pick , say , torture , or genocide , or child molestation ?
This , in my opinion , is Jesus at the absolute peak of his intolerance .
Matthew 19 : 9 : " And I say to you : whoever divorces his wife , except for unchastity , and marries another , commits adultery . "
Again with the " nix on divorce " theme .
Very much not in keeping with modern progressive values .
And again with the " female unchastity being the one acceptable excuse for divorce " thing .
Nice .
Matthew 22:35 - 39 :
And one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , to test him .
" Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the law ? "
And he said to him : " You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind .
And a second is like it , You shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
Okay .
The " love your neighbor as yourself " part , I 'm down with .
But note , please , which of these Jesus clearly says is the most important .
According to Jesus , it is less important to love your neighbor than it is to believe in God .
It is less important to treat other people well than it is to be true to the tenets of your religion .
Pretty much the exact opposite of what progressive Christians say they believe .
And very much the exact opposite of most modern progressive ideals .
Mark 4:28 - 29 : " Truly I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever blasphemies they utter ; but whoever blasphemies against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin . "
And again with blasphemy against the Holy Spirit -- and not believing in Jesus 's divinity -- being the one unforgivable act .
The single worst thing you could possibly do .
Yuk .
Mark 8:11 - 12 : The Pharisees came and began to argue with him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , to test him .
And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said , " Why does this generation need a sign ?
Truly , I say to you , no sign shall be given to this generation . "
This is a theme that actually comes up more than once in the Gospels , although it 's rarely stated so baldly as it is here .
The theme :
You should believe in Jesus -- in his divinity , in his miracles -- without any signs or evidence .
The people who believe in him because they saw his miracles , they 're pretty cool ... but the people who believe in him without having seen any miracles , they 're totally awesome .
Which very much runs counter to the modern progressive ideals of ( a ) valuing truth , ( b ) not just believing what you 're told , and ( c ) not getting taken by charlatans .
To be fair , in other places Jesus is happy to point to his miracles as proof of his divinity .
But I said I was n't going to get into internal contradictions , so I 'm not going to .
If I did , we'd be here all day .
Mark 10:2 - 12 : And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? "
He answered them , " What did Moses command you ? "
They said , " Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce , and to put her away . "
But Jesus said to them , " For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
But from the beginning of creation , ' God made them male and female . '
' For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . '
So they are no longer two but one flesh .
What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder . "
And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter .
And he said to them , " Whoever divorces his wife and marries another , commits adultery against her ; and if she divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery . "
And again with the ix-nay on the ivorce - day .
The prohibition on divorce comes up in every one of the four Gospels .
I 'd just like to point that out .
Plus we have the homophobia of the " God made them male and female " bit ...
Mark 16:16 : " He who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who does not believe will be condemned . "
Yet again with this familiar trope .
' If you believe me and do what I tell you , you 'll be fine .
If you do n't , you 're screwed . "
Luke 7:46 : " Why do you call me ' Lord , Lord , " and not do what I tell you ? "
And again .
Obedience to Jesus : good .
Independent thought : bad .
The parable from Matthew 7:24 - 27 , about the wise man who built his house on a rock and the dummy who built his house on sand , is repeated at this point , so I wo n't list it again .
But the line about doing what we 're told is so baldly stated here in Luke that I could n't resist .
Luke 10:38 - 42 : Now as they went on their way , he entered a village ; and a woman named Martha received him into her house .
And she had a sister called Mary , who say at the Lord 's feet and listened to his teaching .
But Martha was distracted with much serving ; and she went to him and said , " Lord , do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ?
Tell her then to help me . "
But the Lord answered her , " Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ; one thing is needful .
Mary has chosen the good portion , which shall not be taken away from her . "
Maybe I 'm being nitpicky here .
Maybe this just bugs me because I 've thrown a lot of dinner parties , and if my sister sat in the living room listening to some guru while I did all the work myself , I 'd get annoyed , too .
But to me , this seems like yet another example of the " Listening to Jesus is more important than helping the people in your life " principle .
It 's another example of " Loving God is more important than loving other people and treating them well . "
And that 's ain't right .
Luke 9:61 - 62 : Another said , " I will follow you , Lord ; but let me first say farewell to those at my home . "
Jesus said to him , " No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God . "
Another in the " Geez , callous much ? " category .
It fits right in with the " Can I at least go bury my father first ? " story of Matthew 8:21 - 22 ( and in fact , that story is repeated here as well ) .
Again , we have the " It 's more important to follow your religious leader than it is to be kind and thoughtful to your family " theme .
And again , we have the creepy , cult - leaderish , " You 're not worthy if you 're not willing to abandon your family for me " theme .
These are n't the values of anyone I know .
And there 's a reason for that .
Luke 15:26 : " If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life , he can not be my disciple . "
Nice .
Do I have to say it again ?
Obedience to Jesus over affection and respect for your family ; the dividing of people from their families to a degree that 's creepy and cultish .
Ick .
Luke 18:29 - 30 : And he said to them , " Truly , I say to you , there is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God , who will not receive manifold more in this time , and in the age to come eternal life . "
Again with the " abandon your family , treat the people who love you shabbily , in order to follow me and obey my teachings " trope .
John 6 : 53 - 54 : So Jesus said to them , " Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood , you have no life in you ; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day . "
Yet again , with the " you wo n't have any life -- i.e. , eternal life -- unless you believe in my divinity and follow my religious practices . "
( FYI : This sort of stuff is all over John , and it 's after midnight as I write this and I want to go to bed ; so I 'm only going to list the more egregious examples of it from now on . )
John 8:29 : " I told you that you would die in your sins , for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he . "
( " He " meaning the Messiah / Son of God . )
And again .
The only way to salvation is through a specific religious belief .
All other beliefs are incorrect , and nothing else can save you .
John 12:48 : " He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge ; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day .
And again .
Reject Jesus and his sayings , and be judged -- no matter what else you do in your life .
( I told you : this stuff is all over the book of John ... )
John 14:6 : " I am the way , and the truth , and the life ; no one comes to the Father , but by me . "
And again .
Just one way to God. Jesus 's way .
John 20:24 - 29 : Now Thomas , one of the twelve , called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus came .
So the other disciples told him , " We have seen the Lord . "
But he said to them , " Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails , and place my finger in the mark of the nails , I will not believe . "
Eight days later , his disciples were again in the house , and Thomas was with them .
The doors were shut , but Jesus came and stood among them , and said , " Peace be with you . "
Then he said to Thomas , " Put your finger here , and see my hands ; and put out your hand , and place it in my side ; do not be faithless , but believing . "
Thomas answered him , " My Lord and my God ! " Jesus said to him , " Have you believed because you have seen me ?
Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe . "
This story has always , always bugged me .
I think Thomas was completely reasonable .
If someone told me that my dead friend had come back to life , I 'd bloody well have to see them and put my hands on them before I believed it was really them .
But Jesus has to get all snarky about it , and give Thomas a hard time for not believing the wildly improbable without having some actual evidence .
Again , the message : Blind faith good .
Independent thought bad .
Finally .
Throughout every book of the four Gospels , we have verse after verse after verse after verse about servants .
I 'm not even going to list them all .
And from what I understand , " servant " should more accurately be translated as " slave . "
In some verses it actually says " slave . "
Slavery was a widespread reality in Jesus 's day .
And not only did he not speak out against it -- he used it to illustrate points .
He even used the beating of servants and slaves to illustrate points .
Ew .
*****
I 'm not saying there 's no good content in the Gospels .
There is .
I 'm not even saying that the bad verses outweigh or outnumber the good .
I do n't feel like doing a tally right now of which verses I think are cool and which I think are messed - up .
Some other time , perhaps ... but it 's really beside the point .
The point is this :
The bad stuff -- the stuff that runs completely counter to the most important values of most progressives I know , including progressive Christians -- is not hard to find .
It 's all over the place .
I basically just spent a few hours with a Bible in one hand and my laptop in the other , and came up with this rather frighteningly long list .
And it 's not like these are the minor teachings , either -- some of them are among the most famous and beloved teachings of everything Jesus supposedly said .
Now .
Again .
The fact that the philosophy of the Gospels is flawed and inconsistent would not be a problem if you saw Jesus simply as a person : a far - seeing person with many important and indeed radical ideas , but one who was also somewhat limited by the culture in which he lived .
If that 's how you saw the Gospel teachings , you could easily take what you need and leave the rest ... just like you would with any other thinker you admired .
But when you believe that Jesus was / is the divine Son of God , and that the Gospels are a more or less accurate representation of his teachings ... then you 're in trouble .
Yes , the Jesus character in the Gospels spoke of love and respect and humility , healing the sick and taking care of the poor .
But he also spoke of the wickedness of thought crimes , and the sinfulness of divorce ; of the value of surrendering rational thought , and the nobility of abandoning family and responsibility to pursue a religious practice .
He spoke with approval of the calm acceptance of evil and oppression in this world .
And he spoke -- over and over like a broken record -- about the all - importance of believing that he was God , and obeying his commands .
He spoke again and again about how there was just one right way to practice religion , and how doing this was a far greater priority than being a good person in the world .
If you believe that it 's normal and healthy to think about things that you would never actually do ; that expressing anger is often useful and healthy ; that good people should resist evil and oppression ; that people 's sexual and marital lives are nobody 's business but their own ; that people of different faiths , perhaps even of no faith at all , can still be good people ; that you should n't just believe what you 're told ; that women and men should have equal marital rights ; that actions speak louder than words and beliefs ; that religion should n't divide people ; that fact - checking is a valuable skill ; and that it 's more important to treat each other well than to have the exact right religious doctrine ... then good for you .
I think so , too .
But if you believe that the Gospels reflect the reality of his life and teachings , then apparently Jesus did n't .

Hunting Bin Laden
Osama bin Laden is charged with masterminding the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa , believed to have had a role in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden , and now is a prime suspect in the Sept. 11 , 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center and the bombing of the Pentagon .
This report features reporting by a Pulitzer - Prize nominated team of New York Times reporters and FRONTLINE correspondent Lowell Bergman .
Tracing the trail of evidence linking bin Laden to terrorist attacks , this updated report includes interviews with Times reporters Judith Miller and James Risen and former CIA official Larry Johnson .
They discuss the terrorist attacks which are linked , or are likely linked , to bin Laden 's complex network of terrorists , outline the elements of his international organization and details of its alliances and tactics , and address the challenges confronting U.S. intelligence in trying to crack it .
Wow .
Just when you think the GOP Senate obstructionists can’t sink any lower , they do .
Brandon Friedman at VetVoice posed the question : “ Will Senate Republicans Vote Against the Troops ? ”
We have our answer .
Yes , the Senate Republicans did vote against the troops .
Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans have basically been filibustering every bill til the oil companies get what they want .
But , surely , they would n’t put the oil companies over America ’s defense needs when we ’re in the middle of two wars ???
Wrong .
They did .
Seriously , they they filibustered a bill , S. 3001 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 , which , among other things , provided pay raises for troops , health care and protection from IEDs .
The bill needed 60 votes .
Thirty - eight Republicans voted NO against moving forward .
Harry Reid ( who voted no for procedural reasons ) had this to say ( via email ) :
“ As has been their hallmark this Congress , Bush - McCain Republicans have once again run away from an important debate , failing to back up their words with action .
Despite their strong rhetoric on supporting our troops , they have refused to give them a well - deserved pay raise , denied our troops mine - resistant vehicles to keep them safe and said no to ensuring our servicemen and - women get the health care they need .
“ It is this kind of misplaced priorities that is making America less secure .
Our military readiness is down , Afghanistan is slipping further into violence , Pakistan remains in crisis , and Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri are still on the loose nearly seven years after 9/11 .
The Iraq war is not only costly , but President Bush and John McCain have provided no plan for responsibly ending the war and returning to the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The Republicans are despicable .
But , it pays .
Siding with the oil companies worked financially for John McCain :
Campaign contributions from oil industry executives to Sen .
John McCain rose dramatically in the last half of June , after the senator from Arizona made a high - profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling .
Oil and gas industry executives and employees donated $ 1.1 million to McCain last month — three - quarters of which came after his June 16 speech calling for an end to the ban — compared with $ 116,000 in March , $ 283,000 in April and $ 208,000 in May .
Now , the GOPers are putting their oil interests over America ’s soldiers .
Sick .
Slice of baby , anyone ?
Whilst looking for wedding cake ideas last night , my fiancée came across this amazing video ( yes , I ’m delighted to say that I got engaged last week ) .
It ’s a woman who does some incredible ‘ sugar art ’ .
But one of the pieces really disturbed us .
You see , the whole point of a cake to me is that you eat it .
You take a big sharp knife , cut yourself an unhealthy slice and swallow it down with a nice cup of tea .
Am I wrong , people ?
So this creation just gives me the heebie - jeebies .
I just do n’t understand what kind of person would order this cake .
Somebody who ’s organising a birthday party for mad psychopathic child - killer ?
If you want to see more , she ’s even done a YouTube video of the creation of this monstrosity .
Needless to say , we wo n’t be ordering this design for our big day .
Ethan Persoff scanned this insane homophobic comic book from 1986 called Homosexuality : Legitimate , Alternative , Deathstyle .
Equipped with a style that could have played well in Mad or even Playboy , Hafer was the right - wing 's Jack Davis : a man who could , and did , lampoon any chosen target of what one could tent together as " Republican Interests " .
Gays , Hippies , Abortion , Ted Kennedy , the National Education Association , all sorts of terrible demons .
But for everything he hated , he sure seemed fixated on talking - at length - about the nasty stuff .
What would a psychologist say ?
We decided to jump right off with his most offensive work .
But it 's great reading too , obsessed with sodomy , urine , masturbation , all the x-rated ideas .
But be forewarned :
These comics were not intended for you .
No .
In the world of pitching and catching , this is something intended for the other team .
Reading these pages is like jumping into a bizarro world of bent pent - up pop-culture where the wrong is right , the shirt and haircut does n't match , and most of the food shopping is done in bulk through QVC .
Full of religious radio , weekly gun rallies , dittoheads , the 700 club , casserole potlucks …
There are tops and bottoms to this discussion , clearly , and this comic was intended for the humans over the homos .
We can't even type the title of what we 're about to present without laughing a bit .
But that 's what Hafer fans lovingly refer to as " the ol ' dick magic " .
Dick Hafer really was that sort of an asshole .
Palin , raising money on the left
The latest mark of what a polarizing figure Sarah Palin has quickly become : A viral email , of unknown origin , urging readers to contribute in Palin 's name to Planned Parenthood has raised nearly a million dollars for the group .
From the press release :
Call it the ultimate in grassroots activity , a viral email urging people to donate to Planned Parenthood “ in honor of Sarah Palin ” generated more than 31,313 donations totaling more than three - quarters of a million dollars ( $ 802,678 ) as of today .
With contributions from all 50 states , more than two - thirds of the individuals making a contribution “ in honor of Sarah Palin ” are first - time Planned Parenthood donors .

A Scottish man , who was wrongly diagnosed with cancer by doctors who told him he was dying , decided to distribute all his life savings to friends and relatives and ended up as a broke .
Andy Lees , a 72 year old grandfather , handed out his В_12,000 savings to his children , grandchildren and friends and spent the rest В_6,500 on his funeral planning , after he was told of his terminal condition .
Last year the man was taken to the St. John 's Hospital in Livingston , where doctors announced him he had the lung and liver cancer in its final stage .
However , one year after , the doctors told him that he did not have cancer , but a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which is a serious condition , but is not a terminal illness .
" I couldnв_Tt believe it .
I gave away my life savings because I didnв_Tt think I would need them .
We just presumed that the doctor would be right .
Now I am broke , " Mr Lees said .
The man considers suing the hospital for the mistake that caused him financial loss .
Mr. Lees told that now he cannot afford buying the mobility scooter and cannot leave his house because of the illness .
The National Health Service officials said that investigation of the case is already under way .
The medical director of the hospital met with Mr.Lees and his family to apologize for the distress and told that the necessary measures will be taken to prevent such blunders .

McCain Would Privatize Social Security
The Republicans have already turned to sick sexual innuendo and nonsense about their vice - presidential candidate , pigs and lipstick in order to distract the public from the real issues in this campaign .
One of the items that should be on top of the list of real issues is Senator McCain 's plans to privatize and cut Social Security .
McCain has repeatedly expressed interest in privatizing Social Security along the lines proposed by President Bush .
For those who have forgotten that nightmare , Bush 's plan would have reduced benefits by approximately one percent a year for many workers .
Workers who retired 10 years after the plan was put in place would see a 10 percent reduction in benefits compared with the currently projected levels .
Workers who retired 20 years after the plan was implemented would see approximately a 20 percent cut in benefits and workers who retired 40 years after the plan started would see their benefits cut by close to 40 percent .
This schedule of cuts would apply to workers who earn $ 100,000 a year .
Workers who earn $ 60,000 a year would see cuts of about half this size .
The losses to retired workers could mean big benefits for the financial industry .
Under some versions of the plan , the financial industry would rake in hundreds of billions of dollars in fees and commissions over the next 40 years .
According to a recent World Bank analysis , the financial industry pocketed 15 - 20 percent of the money paid into the privatized Social Security system in Chile , which has often been held up as a model by privatizers in the United States .
Given the losses that the millionaire Wall Street bozos have incurred with the housing crash , it is understandable that Senator McCain would want to help the very rich needy .
Privatization would be especially painful coming now , in the wake of the collapse of the housing bubble .
The huge baby boom cohort that is just now reaching retirement age has seen most of their wealth wiped out by the housing crash .
A recent analysis that I did with David Rosnick , my colleague at the Center for Economic and Policy Research , showed that a typical late - baby - boomer household ( between the ages of 45 and 54 ) will have less than $ 100,000 in wealth in 2009 .
This figure includes 401 ( k ) s , IRAs and other retirement accounts , personal savings and home equity .
A relatively small share of these late baby boomers has traditional defined - benefit pensions .
In other words , these families are going to have very little to support themselves in retirement other than the Social Security that Senator McCain is so anxious to cut .
While the Bush - McCain crew has long been trying to whip up fears about Social Security 's finances , the reality is that the program is financially solid .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) recently updated its analysis of the program 's finances .
The analysis projects that Social Security will be able to pay all scheduled benefits through the year 2049 with no changes whatsoever .
Even after 2049 , when the program is first projected to face a shortfall , the payable benefit is projected to be more than 30 percent higher than what the average retiree gets today , and the payable amount would continue to rise from that level every year .
The privatizers have worked hard to convince the public that Social Security is on its last legs , but this is simply a lie .
We are going to face many problems that dwarf the dimensions of the projected Social Security shortfall .
For example , the annual costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are approximately three times as large as the annual revenue that would be needed to eliminate the projected Social Security shortfall .
The 2049 date when Social Security is first projected to face a shortfall is more than three decades after the latest date when the next president can leave office .
John McCain will be 113 when Social Security is first projected to be unable to pay full benefits .
In a country where millions of families are struggling to hang onto their homes , and tens of millions are struggling to pay for health care and child care , a distant and relatively minor problem like the projected Social Security shortfall hardly warrants center stage .
The public should know that Social Security is fundamentally sound today and is projected to be sound far into the future .
The line about Social Security going bankrupt is just a scare tactic pushed by the privatizers .
The presidential debate must return to Social Security and other issues that affect people 's lives .
The sleaze that Senator McCain and his vice - presidential candidate throw out as a distraction should be left to the pigs .

How a cash - strapped teacher beat credit crunch by living on £ 1 a day for a YEAR after drunken bet
Anyone finding it hard to cope with the credit crunch will find little sympathy from teacher Kath Kelly .
The cash - strapped teacher had an alcohol - induced wager with friends that she could beat the credit crunch by living on just £ 1 a day for a whole year - and won .
Miss Kelly , 47 , ate at free buffets , shopped at jumble sales and scavenged food discarded by grocery stores and restaurants .
English teacher Kath Kelly had a bet with friends that she could live on £ 1 a day for a whole year - and won
She picked fruit from bushes and trees and collected £ 117 in loose change dropped in the street - a third of her annual budget .
She even managed a free trip to France by hitchhiking through the Channel Tunnel .
And to cap it all , she found love while working as a volunteer on an organic farm during the holidays .
Miss Kelly was sharing a house in Hotwells , Bristol , when she complained to her friends over a few glasses of wine that she could not afford a wedding present for her brother Danny .
She boldly announced that she would survive on £ 1 a day for the 12 months up to the wedding .
Thrifty : Kath picked fruit from bushes and shopped in jumble sales to live on £ 1 a day
' I woke up the following morning and instantly regretted it but it was too late - I 'd told my friends and now I had to go through with it .'
With her rent and utility bills already paid for the year , her budget had to cover transport , food , clothes and socialising .
She soon learned to spot a bargain and after working at the English Language Centre in Clifton , where she teaches for 20 hours a week , she regularly visited super - markets and butchers at closing time to buy reduced food .
She added : ' I had a freezer full of stuff .
I was out all the time with a bag on my back and if I saw bread for 10 p at the end of the day , or reduced vegetables - anything - I bought it .'
Miss Kelly would hunt down market researchers in the street as they often have samples to give away .
Kath 's daily shopping bills , consisting mostly of fresh fruit and veg , would often come to just under £ 1
She ditched her mobile phone and cycled to friends ' houses if she wanted to speak to them , leaving a note if they were out .
She used the library for free internet access and developed a taste for mince pies - which she would stockpile at Christmas when they are given away at stores .
' I went to the public lectures at Bristol University that had a buffet afterwards , and I went to the library 's 100th birthday where they had a buffet as well .
I was the queen of the buffet .
' Every time there was a public event and a crowd was needed , I was there .
' I dragged my mates out to free events , too .
' I could n't buy rounds at the pub or anything like that so I 'd take them to art openings and book launches . '
Miss Kelly says one of her best tips is to hand out small gifts where you can - what you receive in return will usually be of a greater value .
Her trip to France came when she decided to visit her brother , who was restoring a house in Brittany .
' I hitchhiked to the Channel Tunnel , got a free ride as the passenger of a French woman and hitched to Brittany , ' she said .
' On the way back I travelled on the ferry with a lorry driver , and even had dinner at the drivers ' canteen . '
By the end of the year Miss Kelly was able to use some of the £ 10,000 salary she had banked to spend £ 1,300 on a lifetime membership to the National Trust for Danny and his bride Sarah .
She had also formed a relationship with 38 - year - old Bruce Taylor , manager of the farm where she worked as a holiday volunteer .
The couple now live together in Bruton , Somerset , and Miss Kelly has written a book about her year of living frugally - How I Lived On Just A Pound A Day , published by Redcliffe at £ 6.99 .
She now grows her own fruit and veg , and says the experiment has changed her outlook .
' I'm a lot more sensible with my money now and live a completely different lifestyle . '
1 . What has caused the startling rise over the last 12 months ?
2 . Why has the price risen steadily for the past 6 years ?
3 . Why should n't we get back to the $ 20 / barrel we enjoyed in the 1990's ?
4 . What caused the noticeable dip in price from mid 2006 to early 2007 ?
5 . Why does the oil price seem to be going up at an accelerating rate since the dip in 2007 ?
6 . Has the price stopped going up yet ?
7 . What prices might we expect over the next 1 , 3 or even 5 years to come ?
In Australian dollar terms we have seen the price of oil rise by " only " 3 ½ times in 6 years .
Within Australia we have been somewhat insulated from the latest sequence of price rises by the falling value of the US$ , so our petrol and diesel prices have risen by comparatively less as the A$ has climbed to around US95 cents , as shown in the chart below .

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu /cabs/AOMC/Overview.html
Starting with Questions 1 and 2 , the accelerating curve of recent price rises is due to the growth in oil supply not keeping up with steadily growing demand around the world .
Oil is getting more expensive because surplus production capacity has diminished and continues to diminish , as shown in the chart on the next page .
Oil industry volumes are of enormous scale ( 86 million barrels per day – a barrel is 159 litres ) , and the costs of supply infrastructure are in the billions and trillions of dollars .
Lead times for new industry infrastructure are typically 3 to 10 years .
All new mega - projects on the production side are well known out as far as 2012 , and few seem likely to boost global supply by enough to overcome declines in old oil fields .
See the comprehensive listing of oil megaprojects at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Oil_Megaprojects/2008 .
Note that major oil projects are developing a history of running late , often years late , as they encounter challenging technical difficulties operating in extreme environments like deep ocean or freezing Arctic conditions .
Rapid demand growth is often blamed for rising prices – demand growth in developing countries , particularly China and India , and in key oil supplying nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia .
But the decline of mature oil fields throughout the world is an even greater source of demand for new oil supplies than the growth of end user demand .
Declining fields are losing 5.2 % of total oil production per year thus requiring about 3.5 million barrels / day of new oil each year for the global oil supply to stay the same .
( Nobuo Tanaka , International Energy Agency ) http://www.iea.org/Textbase /press/pressdetail.asp?PRESS _REL_ID=267 .
Recent annual growth in end user demand , on the other hand has not exceeded 1.5 million barrels / day .
The balance between growing capacity from new infrastructure investments and declining output from old infrastructure has seen global production capacity climb at a slower rate than consumption for the past 25 years , as shown in the following chart .

Convergence of the two curves shown above indicates serious supply tightness over the last 2 years which explains much of the recent price surge , with perhaps $ 5 – 10 per barrel in volatility added by an influx of investment funds seeking a safe haven from the falling US $ .
The analysis by Goldman Sachs in the next chart below suggests that price rises to date have already destroyed demand amounting to about 5 million barrels / day or 6 % of current world consumption .
Any further price rises may be expected to cause further demand destruction and consequent hardship for those being priced out of the fuel market .
This brings us to Question 3 – Why should n't we get back to the $ 20 / barrel we enjoyed in the 1990's ?
It 's simple – the world has used up practically all the easy " light sweet " crude oil that used to pour out of desert sands for $ 3 – 4 / barrel and be easily refined into saleable products .
Discovery of oil peaked more than 40 years ago – see the chart below .
Not only is it costing much , much more to find and extract each new barrel of oil ( typically $ 60 / barrel for new deep offshore wells ) but most of the oil we can now get is shifting towards " heavy " and / or " sour " grades that require billions of dollars of new investment in refineries to process them .
" The oil is getting harder to extract .
Most oil comes from ageing , waning giant fields discovered long ago .
There are no more giant fields to find , only lots of small ones , difficult ones or fields deep under the ocean .
The remaining crude oil is heavier , thicker , dirtier , quite simply cruder !
It 's difficult to get out , expensive to get out , slower to get out .
So , the rate of oil extraction will decrease . "
Michael Lardelli on Perspective , ABC Radio National , 26 June 2008
There is no going back to $ 20 / barrel short of a world recession that shuts down demand for oil , and for everything else .
Now let 's look at recent price volatility .
Question 4 – What caused the noticeable dip in price from mid 2006 to early 2007 ?
Prices climbed during 2005 due to Hurricane Katrina and fears of war with Iran , then kept on climbing until August 2006 .
" Oil was in a bit of a bubble in July 2006 .
The way you could tell it was in a bit of a bubble was that speculators were net long by a large number of contracts ( 115,000 ) and inventories were high .
. . .
The oil situation now is very different .
Speculators are now net short .
Inventories are very low of the products and types of oil in demand . "
http://www.theoildrum.com/node /4227#comment-370311 – 26th June 2008
When the 2006 hurricane season passed without incident and oil supplies remained marginally ahead of demand the market appeared to decide that risks had been over - priced , and prices fell by $ 10 - $ 15 / barrel for the start of 2007 .
Then they began rising again .
Is our situation getting worse ?
Question 5 - Why does the oil price seem to be going up at an accelerating rate since mid 2007 ?
Actual oil prices are set by refiners bidding to buy tanker - loads .
Recent media fuss about speculators refers largely to oil futures prices rather than actual spot prices for which a buyer and a seller have to actually exchange funds for a tanker - load of crude oil costing between US $ 100 and US $ 400 million .
Not many speculators have this sort of cash or know what to do with a 250,000 tonne tanker .
This year many refineries have been finding it harder to buy oil of a grade they can economically refine , especially the 50 % of US refineries located in the Gulf of Mexico who are suffering steep declines in overseas supply from their nearby sources in Mexico , Venezuela and Nigeria .
Mexico is in oil - induced political and financial turmoil because its one massive oilfield Cantarell has gone into rapid decline for geological reasons while Mexico's ( subsidised ) domestic oil consumption is growing .
Mexico is seeing its largest single source of foreign income decline every month , while domestic demand for oil is growing at a pace that will see Mexico become an oil importer by 2014 according to some estimates .
( http://www.theoildrum.com/node /4092 )
Mexico ’s Oil Production is Collapsing
At the same time
Venezuela 's output is declining , partly due to Hugo Chavez 's ejection of foreign oil companies .
Nigeria 's output has been reduced to its lowest level in 25 years by terrorist attacks from local guerrillas
Russia 's output ( which is only exceeded by Saudi Arabia 's ) has unexpectedly declined by 0.9 % this year
Britain's North Sea oil peaked in 1999 and is declining at 5 % - 8 % per year .
The table on the following page shows , for oil exporting nations , net export declines accelerating from 2006 to 2007 .
Monthly data for 2008 shows that the overall downward trend is continuing .
It is the declining volume of tradeable oil on global markets that is causing steep price rises this year when we are seeing only moderate abatement of growth in global demand .
More buyers are pursuing a tightening supply of exported oil , so small variations in availability are all that is needed to push deal prices upward .
For example , on 28th June Bangladesh , hard - hit by energy shortages , was reported to have struck a deal with Kuwait for supply " at a premium price " .
If declines in the supply of tradeable oil were not enough to create a tight market , buyers are reacting nervously to talk of attacks on Iran by Israel or the USA , and it only takes a rumour to send oil prices on another upward jump .

Critically , Saudi Arabia appears now unable to perform the role of market stabiliser that it played from the 1980's until the 2000's on the basis of its known ability to pump up to 20 % extra volume at short notice .
Depletion of Saudi Arabia 's giant oil fields appears to have taken away its ability to help the world in this way , though the Saudis will not directly admit they no longer have this power .
It seems likely that since 2007 OPEC has lost effective cartel power because few of its members have the ability to pump more oil .
This means the cartel as a whole can do practically nothing to bring down prices even though key members like Saudi Arabia have much of their wealth tied up in Western economies and are clearly concerned about damage to their own interests if oil prices go any higher – thus the Saudi conference held on the 22nd of June 2008 .
So what happens next ?
Questions 6 and 7 – Has the price stopped rising and what prices might we expect over short - term and medium - term planning horizons ?
Price rises did indeed pause in mid-June after an astonishing $ 11 run-up on Friday 6th June .
Traders may have been waiting for an outcome from the Saudi conference on 22nd June , which was soon seen to have provided little new knowledge or cause for optimism .
Game on .
Futures topped $ 140 for the first time on 26th June .
So what will next week , next month and next year bring ?
" Predictions are always difficult , especially about the future . "
Niels Bohr
There are essentially two patterns of oil price prediction being made by informed pundits :
Ongoing steady price rises driven by the continuing supply - demand squeeze A big discontinuity caused by demand destruction of a major sort , followed by a short period of lower prices then a resumption of ongoing steady price rises driven by the continuing supply - demand squeeze .
Pattern A – Ongoing steady price rises
Proponents of ongoing price rises are betting on geopolitical and economic stability and the ability of a resilient world to keep steadily adjusting to rising oil prices , as we have done for the past six years .
Typical projections of this type are from Jeff Rubin , Chief Economist at Canada 's CIBC World Markets .
The following table is from Jeff Rubin's April 2008 report http://research.cibcwm.com
/economic_public/download /sapr08.pdf
Two months later Rubin has revised his April price projections drastically upwards in CIBC WM's June 2008 report http://research.cibcwm.com
/economic_public/download /sjun08.pdf .
He explains " We are compelled to once again raise our target prices for oil .
We are lifting our target for West Texas Intermediate by $ 20 per barrel to an average price of $ 150 next year and by $ 50 per barrel to an average price of $ 200 per barrel by 2010 . "
Pattern B – Price moves down then up on a rising trend
The other school of oil price projections makes the common - sense point that serious demand reduction and perhaps economic recession in some countries will be triggered when oil prices reach a critical level – when " demand destruction " becomes really destructive .
Proponents suggest that such a free - fall in demand from one or more larger consuming countries such as the USA will be dramatic enough to drop price back to , say , US $ 100 / barrel for a period of time .
Some writers guess that the critical price point to cause such sudden and significant demand destruction may be US $ 200 - 300 / barrel , based on percentages of world GDP , but the accompanying analysis is weak and the arguments published to date do not convincingly pinpoint a critical price for oil above which it cannot go .
A graphic example of the " dramatic recession " school of price projections is shown below .
Given the great variety of geopolitical events and economic factors that could influence actual supply , demand and price there is little hope for more precise forecasting of price and timing than the indicative story set out below .
Conclusion :
Stay awake , expect oil prices to be in dynamic movement .
Conservatively , plan for US $ 200 / barrel by 2010 , but do n't be surprised if a recession somewhere drops price back to US $ 100 , for a short while , or sudden war in the Middle East sends prices skyrocketing .
Expect the fundamentals of fading supply growth and growing demand to push prices ever higher in the 5 year horizon , perhaps well beyond US $ 300 / barrel .
The implications in terms of Australian pump prices in A$ / litre are shown in the table below .
These pump price estimates are made on the basis of some reasonable assumptions :
Current excise and GST rules stay the same , keeping Australia 's fuel taxes significantly lower than any other OECD country except the USA , Canada and Mexico
Australia 's prices continue to be driven by average Singapore refined product prices .
Singapore product prices are most influenced by the price of Malaysian Tapis crude which normally sells for a few dollars more than US West Texas Intermediate
Freight , insurance , wharfage and wholesale and retail margins rise only moderately with world oil price
A$ / US $ exchange rate moves up from the current 95 cents to parity due to continued weakness in the US $ compared with commodity - driven support for the A $
No net impacts from the Emissions Trading Scheme which starts in 2010 and might add another 10 cents / litre .
Indicative Estimates of Pump Price
Tapis price US $ / barrel Australian capital city pump price A$ / litre $ 140 ( today ) $ 1.68 $ 200 $ 2.07 $ 250 $ 2.45 $ 300 $ 2.80 $ 500 $ 4.30
" When you think a litre of petrol costs too much , ask yourself how much you would have to pay someone to push your car 10 kilometres . "
Finally , let 's look on the bright side .
There is plenty to like about moderately higher oil prices , if communities , businesses and economies take heed and get time and help to adjust .
Less traffic , less congestion and less pollution would be a big plus for most of us .
New business opportunities should spring up in areas such as energy conservation , Natural Gas conversions , cleantech industries , electric vehicles and freight optimisation .
Having the world place a higher value on energy from oil will change a lot of business decisions , improving our resource efficiency and enhancing sustainability .
Anawhata comments :
The above is my effort to explain the recent history and possible outlook for oil prices to non-TOD audiences who lack awareness or understanding of peak oil .
I think all of us know how tricky it is to explain these big issues to intelligent people who simply lack the basic knowledge we take for granted about peak oil .
I have chosen to focus this piece specifically on prices , with the minimum possible mention of related causes like oil field reserves , depletion rates , the export land model and so on .
Most of these topics underlie my argument , but are not highlighted because I will lose the audience if I stray too far away from the central topic of prices .
I have anchored the whole argument around the undeniable facts of recent oil price history .
You will see TOD contributors ' fingerprints and exact words throughout , and I hope I have credited key people correctly and sufficiently .
In any case , TOD thought leaders , you know who you are .
Thank you for educating and informing me and so many others .
I welcome suggestions to clarify and improve the story , remembering that I have to keep it as simple as possible for a lay audience .
In particular please help me correct any errors of fact or understanding on my part .

Here ’s another reason to enjoy your coffee .
A recent study in the July edition of the Journal Hepatology found a significant inverse association ( meaning opposingly related ; an increase in one variable results in a decrease in another ) between coffee drinking and the risk of primary liver cancer [ 1 ] .
The study also found that serum levels of an antioxidant enzyme , elevated in people with low coffee consumption , were associated with an increased risk of developing the disease .
Primary liver and bile duct cancers are the sixth most common cause of cancer death in men and the tenth most common cause of cancer death in women [ 2 ] .
Hepatitis B and C viral infections have been identified as causative factors in greater than 75 % of liver cancers worldwide [ 3 ] .
Interestingly , incidence rates are low in most developed countries except for Japan , where coffee drinking is relatively uncommon .
Several studies have also identified an inverse association between coffee consumption and serum levels of gamma - glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) , an enzyme involved in glutathione metabolism [ 4 - 5 ] .
Glutathione plays important roles in antioxidant defense , nutrient defense and regulation of a variety of cellular events [ 6 ] .
Residents of Finland consume more coffee per capita than the Japanese , Americans , Italians and other Europeans .
University of Helsinki researchers examined the associations between coffee consumption and serum GGT levels in 60,323 Finnish participants between the ages of 25 and 74 who were cancer - free at the beginning of the study .
Participants were mailed a questionnaire about their medical history , socioeconomic factors , smoking habits and dietary habits .
A subset of participants ( n = 37,842 ) had clinical data available , including alcohol consumption and serum levels of GGT .
Study participants were divided into five categories based on their response to the question “ How many cups of coffee do you drink daily ? ” :
Category 1 : 0 — 1 cup
Category 2 : 2 — 3 cups
Category 3 : 4 — 5 cups
Category 4 : 6 — 7 cups
Category 5 : 8 or more cups per day
During a median follow - up period of 19.3 years , 128 participants were diagnosed with primary liver cancer .
The researchers observed that the cumulative incidence curve of liver cancer decreased with increasing amounts of daily coffee consumption ( graph ) .
When the analysis was restricted to surveys from participants that had clinical data available , a statistically positive association was found between serum GGT level and liver cancer risk .
Joint association of coffee consumption and serum GGT level with liver cancer showed that participants who drank 0 — 1 cups of coffee and were in the top 25 % of subjects sampled with respect to serum GGT had about 9.2 times increased risk for liver cancer compared to participants who drank at least 6 cups of coffee daily and were in the bottom 75 % of subjects sampled with respect to serum GGT .
The study results are consistent with two meta- analyses published last year demonstrating an inverse relation between coffee consumption and liver cancer [ 7 - 8 ] .
While a previous investigation found an inverse association between coffee consumption and serum GGT level , this study is the first large prospective study to suggest that a high level of serum GGT is a risk factor for primary liver cancer .
The authors discuss a mechanism for the association between coffee drinking and serum GGT on liver cancer risk [ 1 ] :
Several other putative mechanisms behind the association of coffee drinking and serum GGT on liver cancer risk have also been proposed .
Coffee contains many compounds , such as chlorogenic acid , which may have the potential to influence glucose metabolism processes to prevent hyperglycemia , and consequently oxidative stress .
Indeed , chlorogenic acid , a chemical largely responsible for coffee ’s bitterness , may also be responsible for coffee ’s effect on serum GGT level and , ultimately , coffee ’s health benefits .
More information and support for patients with “ Liver cancer ” can be found at Organized Wisdom and MDJunction .
Additionally , the American Liver Foundation , the nation ’s leading nonprofit organization promoting liver disease prevention and liver wellness , provides research , education and advocacy for those affected by liver - related diseases .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Ameribank Inc. was shut down on Friday by the Office of the Thrift Supervision , making it the 12th bank this year to go under .
The Northfork , West Virginia bank had total assets of $ 115 million and total deposits of $ 102 million , according to a statement on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Web site .
The FDIC was named receiver and announced that it entered into purchase and assumption agreements with Pioneer Community Bank , Inc. , Iaeger , West Virginia , and the Citizens Savings Bank , Martins Ferry , Ohio , to take over all of Ameribank 's deposits .
Ameribank has five branches located in West Virginia and three branches located in Ohio .
Branches in West Virginia will reopen on Monday and Ohio branches will reopen on Saturday .
All customer accounts were automatically transferred to the two new banks and the full amount of their deposits will automatically be insured , the FDIC said .
Customers of the banks can still access their money over the weekend by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards , according to the statement by the FDIC .
A year of bank failures
This year 12 banks have been forced to close their doors .
In July IndyMac was closed down marking the largest collapse of an FDIC - insured institution since 1984 .
The Pasadena , Calif . - based bank failed because it backed risky home loans .
With the special Alt - A home loan that IndyMac offered , a home buyer had to show little evidence of income and assets .
When IndyMac was shut down , it had assets of $ 32 billion and deposits of $ 19 billion .
While the FDIC protected most of IndyMac customer 's assets , some customers lost some of their deposits .
The FDIC insures the assets held by the 8,451 institutions with a total of $ 13.4 trillion .
Back in December , we covered AMD 's plans to introduce a handful of new 65nm Athlon 64 X2 processors at 45 W and 65W TDPs , including several chips that would push clockspeeds back towards 3GHz .
Those predicted speeds and model numbers were off a bit , but the CPUs themselves have finally materialized .
NewEgg is now offering the Athlon 64 X2 5400 +
Black Edition at 2.8GHz and a 65W TDP for $ 89.99 .
The new 5800 + is also available , although only in an OEM flavor .
The 5800 + is based on the same Brisbane core , but runs at 3GHz and carries an 89W TDP .
Current price on the 5800 + is $ 95.99 .
The new 3GHz chip finally puts AMD 's 65nm technology on a nearly even footing with the company 's older 90nm parts ; the old 6000 + ran at 3GHz , but was rated at 125W TDP .
I 'm not sure if AMD intends to make the 5800 + available in a retail package , but both processors are potentially enticing .
The closest sub -$ 100 Intel processor is an $ 89 Allendale at 2.4GHz and , frankly , I 'd prefer a 3GHz Athlon 64 X2 to a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo — clock efficiency counts for quite a bit , but the Athlon X2 is running a full 25 percent faster .
If you can afford to spend more money , Intel 's E7200 Wolfdale for $ 119.99 is an extremely enticing bit of hardware , but the 5400 + and 5800 + are both significantly less expensive than that chip .
If you 're in a position where even $ 25 makes a difference , these new AMD chips look awfully pretty .
On the platform side of things , there 's really no contest .
AMD 780G boards are available for $ 80 from the likes of Sapphire , MSI , and Biostar , with Gigabyte , Asus , and ASRock flavors all hovering between $ 80 - 90 .
Intel integrated performance , on the other hand , is still considerably more expensive .
The cheapest G33 board — and G33 only compares to the 780G insomuch as they both are capable of displaying a picture — is $ 82.99 , while an Intel boxed OEM G35 board is $ 89.99 .
G35 itself is a pretty miserable competitor to 780G ( to be fair , NVIDIA's GF 8300 is quite capable ) and , although there are new G43 boards available , they are all at $ 100 + .
Given
Intel 's long history of mediocre video , I 'm not personally holding my breath to see G45 break any performance records , much less G43 .
Finally , of course , these chips could provide a much - sought upgrade path for anyone still using an older AM2 - based Athlon 64 X2 .
I 've personally got no such luck , as AMD is n't making any 3GHz +
Socket 940 Opteron processors .
Hopefully a few of you will save some dollars , whereas I 'm stuck staring at needing a new system when I choose to move off this beast .

Most politicians have figured out that it backfires when you say something racist ( the Republican Party has even issued rules to try to avoid future “ Macaca moments ” ) .
The trick , however , is to somehow appeal to racist fears while not appearing to actually be racist .
For example , in 2006 , the Republicans ran a now - infamous negative TV ad against black Senate candidate Harold Ford .
For the most part it was a typical negative political ad , but it accused him of taking porn money and ended with a young white woman winking salaciously and saying “ Harold , call me ” .
The result was devastating .
Ford was ahead before the ad ran , but his campaign plummeted and he lost the election .
The moral ?
Putting black men in the same ad as sexy white woman scares the pants off some voters .
Fast forward to 2008 , and the Republicans are running a new ad containing Obama and young white women like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Note that neither of these women have anything to do with Obama , and both have gotten quite a bit of media attention for their sexual exploits .
The Republicans can claim that they are just trying to compare Obama to other “ top ” celebrities , so they have plausible deniability .
But here ’s the interesting bit .
When Obama complained about this ad , McCain ’s campaign manager snapped back “ Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck . ”
Ignore for a moment that McCain is blaming the target of his own ad for playing the race card .
The more interesting point is that McCain ’s response is almost exactly the same as a famous quote from lawyer Robert Shapiro “ Not only did we play the race card , we dealt it from the bottom of the deck . ”
As you may remember , Shapiro was talking about how they won the O.J. Simpson trial , where a black man was accused of killing a white woman .
Coincidence ?
Or just blatant irony ?
UPDATE : Bob Herbert in the NY Times has the answer .
UPDATE 2 : The Brits have a term for this kind of message — they call it a “ dog whistle ” .
Just like a real dog whistle is a whistle that only dogs can hear , in politics , a “ dog whistle ” sends a message that only a certain constituency will hear or understand .

Documentary film maker Errol Morris has a fascinating piece in the New York Times about " Photography as a Weapon . "
In it , he interviews Hany Farid , a Dartmouth professor and expert on digital photographic fraud .
Errol Morris : [ D] octored photographs are the least of our worries .
If you want to trick someone with a photograph , there are lots of easy ways to do it .
You do n't need Photoshop .
You do n't need sophisticated digital photo - manipulation .
You do n't need a computer .
All you need to do is change the caption .
The photographs presented by Colin Powell at the United Nations in 2003 provide several examples .
Photographs that were used to justify a war .
And yet , the actual photographs are low - res , muddy aerial surveillance photographs of buildings and vehicles on the ground in Iraq .
I 'm not an aerial intelligence expert .
I could be looking at anything .
It is the labels , the captions , and the surrounding text that turn the images from one thing into another .
Photographs presented by Colin Powell at the United Nations in 2003 .
Powell was arguing that the Iraqis were doing something wrong , knew they were doing something wrong , and were trying to cover their tracks .
Later , it was revealed that the captions were wrong .
There was no evidence of chemical weapons and no evidence of concealment .
Morris 's mockery of the sweeping interpretations made in Powell 's photographs .
There is a larger point .
I do n't know what these buildings were really used for .
I do n't know whether they were used for chemical weapons at one time , and then transformed into something relatively innocuous , in order to hide the reality of what was going on from weapons inspectors .
But I do know that the yellow captions influence how we see the pictures .
" Chemical Munitions Bunker " is different from " Empty Warehouse " which is different from " International House of Pancakes . "
The image remains the same but we see it differently .
Change the yellow labels , change the caption and you change the meaning of the photographs .
You do n't need Photoshop .
That 's the disturbing part .
Captions do the heavy lifting as far as deception is concerned .
The pictures merely provide the window - dressing .
The unending series of errors engendered by falsely captioned photographs are rarely remarked on .
Probably because she does n't have any .
At all .
Well , not unless you count the proximity of Alaska to Russia .
Sarah Palin made her first unscripted appearance Wednesday at a town hall meeting with John McCain and proved exactly why the McCain campaign has tried their damnedest to keep her as far away from those things as possible .
In this clip , a questioner throws up a softball about national security cred and Palin can't remember her talking points about being able to see Russia from some remote island or that she 's the " Commander - in - Chief " of the Alaska National Guard .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Governor Palin , there has been quite a bit of discussion about your perceived lack of foreign policy experience .
And I want to give you your chance .
If you could please respond to that criticism and give us specific skills that you think you have to bring to the White House to rebut that or mitigate that concern .
PALIN : Well , I think because I'm a Washington outsider that opponents are going to be looking for a whole lot of things that they can criticize and they can kind of try to beat the candidates here , who chose me as his partner , to kind of tear down the ticket .
But as for foreign policy , you know , I think that I am prepared and I know that on January 20th , if we are so blessed as to be sworn into office as your president and vice president , certainly we 'll be ready .
I 'll be ready .
I have that confidence .
I have that readiness .
And if you want specifics with specific policy or countries , go ahead and you can ask me .
You can even play stump the candidate if you want to .
But we are ready to serve .
Turns out the town hall was pre-ticketed and she still could n't answer the question coherently .
Sheesh .
Police thought Jean Charles was a bomber
Coroner Sir Michael
Wright has decided 49 officers can give evidence from behind a curtain on the grounds that their safety and security would be put at risk if they were identified . [ > [>
Members of the de Menezes family , including Jean Charles ’s mother Maria , will be able to see their faces , but they will be visible to no one else in the coroner ’s court . [>
SAVE MONEY ON YOUR CAR - CHECK OUT EXPRESS MOTORING ... [>
Last night Sir Michael was attacked for giving the dispensation to witnesses who could finally say what really happened when Mr de Menezes , 27 , was killed at Stockwell Tube station , south London , on July 22 , 2005 . [ >
[> Asad Rehman , the spokesman for the de Menezes family , said : “ This was a terrible decision , an absolute disgrace .
Justice has to be seen to be done by everyone who is interested in the death of an innocent man .
Far from a search for the truth and justice , this will be a mechanism to protect the individual officers . ” [ > [>
So far there are no plans for Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair to give evidence at the hearing which starts tomorrow at the Oval cricket ground in Kennington , south London . [>
[> Sir Michael will spend the first day swearing in the 11 - strong jury , but plans are being made for a demonstration outside the building to reflect concerns about how the inquest is being conducted . [> [>
Sir Michael received individual requests from officers seeking anonymity on the grounds that if they became known they would not be able to do their jobs .
Two of those granted anonymity are the officers who shot Mr de Menezes seven times . [ > [>
Cressida Dick , who ran the operations room at Scotland Yard at the time of the shooting and later became deputy assistant commissioner , will not give evidence from behind a screen . [ >
[> Mr Rehman said : “ The most important thing is that for the first time we will hear from the firearms officers . [> [>
“ One of our great concerns is the fact that police officers sat down together and agreed a version of events and that version of events is what they put in their statements .
For the first time we will also hear from the passengers on the Tube carriage .
Jean cannot speak but individuals on the Tube could paint a very different picture of the actions of the officers .
This will be dynamite . ” [ >
[>
He said Scotland Yard ’s controversial shoot - to - kill policy , codenamed Operation Kratos , will come under intense scrutiny . [ > [>
He added : “ We will understand how the policy came about , who was responsible for it and get to the very question of its legality . ” [ > [>
Jean Charles was put under surveillance and then shot because officers believed he might be one of the 21/7 failed Tube bombers . [>
[> Mr Rehman believes that although Sir Ian Blair will not give evidence he will be a central figure in the inquest .
He said : “ As Commissioner he bears responsibility for all the actions on the day and the information that was put into the public domain . [> [>
“ The family hope there will be an unlawful killing verdict .
If that happens the Crown Prosecution Service must consider if criminal charges could be brought against officers . ” [ > [>
Last November the Met was convicted of a “ catastrophic ” series of errors surrounding the shooting in a health and safety case .
It was fined £ 175,000 and ordered to pay £ 385,000 costs . [>

Better Half Podcast host and Isaac Rochell 's fiancée Allie Kucharczyk hangs out with Parker Henry , Hunter Henry 's wife , to go past some of the stereotypes of NFL wives and explore who she is outside of her husband 's job .
On this week 's episode , Allie and Parker talk pursuing their own career goals , self - care during a pandemic and more .
Call me a misty - eyed nostalgic , but for me , the " golden age " of video games is not 2008 .
Was n't 2007 , was n't 2004 , was n't 1978 .
It was the 1990's .
Where , as a predominantly PC gamer , I was treated to not only some of the greatest games of all time from companies like Lucasarts , Origin and Bullfrog , but some of the most entertaining attempts at story - telling and world - building as well .
Forget Half Life 2's train ride .
Forget Halo 3's bombastic aspirations .
I 'm talking about the cinematic introduction sequence , and its little brother , the cinematic cutscene .
Maybe your experience during the time was different .
Maybe it was n't , does n't matter , you 're not writing this , I am .
And when I was a teenager , growing up amongst a friendship group that did little but eat , sleep and swap ( err … ) 3.5 inch floppies on the playground , games were rated according to two things .
One , how good they were .
You know .
As a game .
And two , how good their intros and cutscenes were .
I kid you not .
Games would live , and die , on the strength of their introduction sequences and cutscenes .
Pre -rendered sequences , soundbytes , hand - drawn animation , a rousing musical score , those were the hooks a game needed to grab our attention .
Example : Star Wars ' scrolling text alone – which was a milestone moment in movie history - would have earned little but our scorn if Lucasarts had n't followed it in games like X - Wing and Dark Forces with some of the best animated sequences ( for their time ) this medium has ever seen .
In effect , it was a creative arms race .
One that would , just like a real arms race , mean everyone spent too much time , energy and money on them , and they all but died off .
But boy , before things got that bad , was n't it just great ?
If you 're nodding in agreement , let 's walk down memory lane .
If you do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about , start clicking on these clips .
What was so great about a bunch of animated sequences most gamers these days would happily skip ?
Two things .
And really , you can lump the cutscenes and intros into the same basket for the most part , so I 'll stop differentiating between them .
Firstly , consider this : this was the 90's .
Graphics were improving , yes , but they were still AWFUL .
Your X - Wing did n't look like an X - Wing , it looked like an X - Wing soap box racer .
You could count the pixels making up your X - Com employees on your own appendages .
Basically , we still had this enormous gulf between what they games were MEANT to look like , and what they actually looked like .
Intros and cutscenes bridged that gap .
We could see people 's faces .
We could see the world they lived in .
Secondly : these were the days before quicksaves , before ridiculously easy difficulty settings .
Many games were still brutal .
Additionally , many games were also repetitive .
Taken on their own , these gruelling tests of physical and mental dexterity would , after the 20th re-attempt , stop being fun and start becoming a chore .
Enter the cutscene .
The carrot to gaming 's stick .
As an example , the original Command & Conquer 's missions were limited in scope , and quickly grew repetitive .
Same terrain , same units , mostly the same objectives .
They'd be 30 minutes of mouse - clicking , moving some pixels around , and little more .
It 's not fun .
But when we 're imagining that we 're controlling an army locked in a struggle for the future of the world ?
OK , that 's some context .
Some fantasy .
And that context was propelled by the game 's endless FMV cutscenes .
Yeah , they were full of bad CGI and even worse acting , but as explained above , 10 - 15 years ago , they were also the shit .
You 'd force yourself through the missions to " unlock " your " reward " , a 15 - 45 second piece of eye candy that , moreso than the actual gameplay you 'd just been engaged in , be the most memorable part of the game , the parts I 'd be bleating excitedly about with my buddies the next day .
That " next day " , however , was some time ago .
Some time during the last century .
In 2008 , things have changed .
While for some developers – Square Enix , Relic and Blizzard in particular – the idea of the glorious intro movie lives on , for most , it 's been replaced with either a cheap " movie " consisting of in - game footage or abandoned in favour of an in - game introduction altogether .
It 's a similar story for the in - game cutscene .
While cutscenes themselves live on , they are ( outside again of a few developers , like EA on their C&C games , and platforms like the DS where static cutscenes are common ) , like intros , commonly reduced to in - engine stuff .
Even the Halo series , one of the medium 's biggest and most successful proponents of the cinematic cutscene , uses in - engine assets to drive its cutscenes .
So if these story - driven indulgences were so damn great , how'd we reach a day where they became so damn rare ?
We asked a few developers to find out .
Doug Lombardi , Valve :
For us , stopping the game to show a moving breaks the experience .
To preserve the suspension of disbelief and attempt to keep the player immerse in the game , we 've made it a constraint to keep all story telling in the game engine , and almost always in real time while the player retains control of the camera .
Remember how liberating it was to play HL1 and not have to smack the Space Bar so you could keep shooting headcrabs ?

Lee Musgrave , Head of Art , Rare Software :
Main reason we tend not to infect our games with too much pre-rendered movie nonsense is that it jars the player out of the game world .
Even if you use the same character models , BG geometry and textures in pre-rendered movies as those that exist in a Real - Time engine , things will look different .
There is no doubt that pre-rendered movies have significant ability to look more like real movies , some would say to look better - but this level of fidelity is not always the desired result when you are trying to create an overall universe for the player that is coherent and cohesive throughout their time in your game .

Ru Weerasuriya , Ready At Dawn :
We take so much care in spurring emotions through gameplay that we run the risk of detaching the player from their experience , especially by making them watch events unfold .
Ultimately , interactive gameplay is a form of narration , as are movies .
Although the two are not mutually exclusive , one can often diminish the power of the other .
Our goal is to make the player always be the catalyst in the story , play the action rather than watch it whenever possible , hence the reason behind reducing the amount of cut - scenes and movies in our games .
In addition , by using high resolution cinematics many games tend to switch between two distinct visuals styles and that can be a detriment to retaining that same gameplay experience .
To put it simply , how would you feel if a movie switched constantly between two looks and two different narratives as you were watching it ?
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
So , there 's a common thread throughout all three of those responses .
One of disconnection from a storyline , from a character , from a world .
But …was n't that the point of the cutscene in the first place ?
Sure was .
Then again , while that was the point , the reason they were used was that in - game graphics could n't do a good enough job of depicting characters and worlds .
Modern graphics can .
I mean , when Relic can get away with using in - game character models in a cutscene in a real - time strategy game , you can understand why companies would be reluctant to invest time and money into an animated or pre-rendered sequence .
Case closed .
And as sad as that may be for sad nostalgics like myself , all that 's left to do these days is look back on some classic animated sequences , adjust our rose - tinted glasses and soak up the craftsmanship .
That or go play a Blizzard or Square Enix game .
G8 Action Network statement
July 9 , 2008 --
The G8's communique regarding their action on climate is actually inaction being masked as movement .
It is a great fraud being perpetrated on the global community that would significantly reduce its capacity to contain climate change .
We fully agree with the statement of the Government of South Africa that " [ W ] hile the Statement may appear as a movement forward , we are concerned that it may , in effect , be a regression from what is required to make a meaningful contribution to meeting the challenges of climate change . "
[ Click pic for BBC footage of G8 protests . ]
Retreat from Bali
The announcement of the agreement among the G8 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by 50 per cent by 2050 is actually a step back from the minimum action that was demanded by the global community during the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in Bali last December .
In Bali , opposition from the US , Japan and Canada almost killed a developing consensus that should commit industrialised ( Annex 1 ) countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 - 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
That developing consensus also projected the minimum cut needed by 2050 to be in the range of 80 to 90 per cent if the rise in global temperature was to be kept below 2 degrees centigrade in the 21st century .
The G8's 50 per cent formula is objectionable on several counts :
First , the G8 formula is a global cut , not one undertaken by the industrialised or Annex One countries , so big polluters like the US can actually free - ride on the rest of the world .
Second , the cut has no clear baseline .
It was revealing that in announcing it , Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda initially said it was from 1990 levels , then had to take back that statement and subsequently mentioned a 2000 baseline .
Third , this declaration of intent is not binding and there is no indication that the G8 want to bring their " commitment " fully under the United Nations climate negotiations framework that would bind its signatories .
Indeed , the G8 announcement reinforces the G8 as a site for climate action that rivals the UN process and effectively subverts it .
Not surprisingly , the G8 declaration emerged as part of a parallel process known as the " Major Economies Meeting . "
The Major Economies Meeting is a US initiative to wrest decision - making on climate from the United Nations framework and process .
All in all , the G8 announcement is one giant step away from meaningful mandatory reductions and significantly increases the chances of the planet slipping into uncontrolled climate change .
Supporting the wrong agency
Another setback to the cause of effective climate action was the G8's endorsement of the World Bank 's Climate Investment Funds , to which the communique said certain countries had already pledged $ 6 billion .
Civil society groups monitoring the Bank 's environment program had already warned the G8 that there are very serious concerns that the funds would be heavily oriented toward funding large - scale coal plants .
Without a clear definition of clean technology , the funds may be used to finance projects that do not clearly mitigate climate change or may take up resources that bring only minor or incremental change at a time that fundamental change is needed .
Just as the G8 undermines the UN as the site for climate action , so does the World Bank subvert an already established UN mechanism .
An Adaptation Fund under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) was established in Bali by the Conference of Parties in December 2007 precisely to provide technological assistance to developing countries .
Instead of funding this mechanism , the G8 countries may now divert their contributions to the World Bank Climate Investment Funds to maintain control of the process of technology transfer .
Not surprisingly , the developing countries have criticized the World Bank mechanism as a threat to serious efforts to assist the global South to deal with climate change .
After failing as a development bank , the World Bank is now trying to create the image that it is the " climate bank ' ' .
This is indeed the height of hypocrisy .
With $ 2 billion already spent on coal , oil and gas projects over the last year , the World Bank has broken its own record as the world 's largest multilateral financier of greenhouse - emitting energy initiatives .
Even as it pretends to deal with climate change with its Climate Investment Funds , the Bank is actually exacerbating it with its massive fossil fuel extraction lending .
We must call a spade a spade .
The G8 declaration does not constitute an advance but a step backward in the global community 's ability to deal with climate change .
Saying that it is better than nothing or that it is realistic given the Bush administration 's opposition to significant action is to lend legitimacy to a dangerous charade .
The G8 has once again lived up to its reputation of being an obstacle to the global community 's efforts to come to grips with the challenges of our times .
We repeat our call to disband this unelected body of rich country governments that acts as if it were the government of the world .

BUSH : I'VE ALMOST MISSION ACCOMPLISHED THE ECONOMY
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) - President [ sic ]
Bush told investors today not to worry about the economy , telling them that he had the whole " money thing in the bag and under control . "
Bush gave the short speech at the White House rose garden instead of the speech he had originally planned to make from an air craft carrier while dressed in a fighter pilot uniform .
" It took a while , but we finally convinced the President that the being a ' top gun ' had nothing to do with the current financial crisis , " said a White House spokesman .
The Post Times Sun Dispatch obtained a copy of the original speech .
Here are some of the highlights :
My fellow Americans , I am here to speechicate to you today about the economy and to tell you the money surge is working .
Just like when I bull - horned you all to go shopping after 9 - 11 , I 'm telling you to go shopping for stocks in the market place with all the stocks .
I promise I will hunt down the terrorist killers who have been responsible for attacking Wall Street and smoke them out , dead or alive .
I am pleased that we have made sure that the wealth will stay with the wealthy who can continue their trickling down all over the American people .
" The President has once again displayed his leadership , " said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino , " just like he did with Hurricane Katrina , the Iraq war and catching Osama bin Laden .

Guitar Hero Metallica DLC
Tracks Better Quality Than Universal 's Retail CDs
" The CD version ... has been heavily compressed , limited and / or clipped , and sounds massively distorted as a result , " said recording industry mixing engineer Ian Shepard in a blog post relayed by Wired .
The Guitar Hero version , on the other hand , uses a fuller dynamic range , as illustrated by a soundwave comparison pictured above .
The more dynamic Guitar Hero version is more likely to resemble the songs as recorded by the group .
In this case , " compression " does not refer to data compression like MP3 files , but rather a " part of the ' loudness war , ' " a recording industry technique in which the music 's dynamic range ( the range from soft to loud ) is squished together to make music sound as loud as possible .
The technique , commonly used in TV commercials , means that the retail CD is ten decibels louder than the $ 18 Guitar Hero III DLC , or twice as loud to the human ear .
Meat and milk from the offspring of cloned animals may already be part of the U.S. food supply , the Food and Drug Administration announced this week .
While the cloning process is too expensive ( about $ 20,000 per animal ) to justify creating clones that will be turned into hamburgers , some ranchers have cloned animals with desirable traits , which they then breed the old - fashioned way to create offspring .
Officials said
it is impossible to differentiate between cloned animals , their offspring and conventionally bred animals , making it difficult to know if offspring are in the food supply [ Reuters ] .
The use of cloned livestock -- particularly cows , swine , and sheep - - has been fiercely debated in the United States and Europe .
In January , the FDA declared that cloned animals and their offspring were as safe to eat as conventionally bred animals ; regulators still ask that food companies follow a voluntary moratorium on using cloned animals for food production , but no such moratorium exists for the clones ' natural offspring .
Those offspring may have made it into the food supply , a U.S. Agriculture Department spokesman said , but
" they would be a very limited number because of the very few number of clones that are out there and relatively few of those clones are at an age where they would be parenting " [ Reuters ] .
European regulators have taken a much dimmer view of the cloning industry , and yesterday the European Parliament proposed an official ban on using clones or their offspring for food production .
Several expert groups , including the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) and the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies , outlined problems such as the animals ' well - being and the higher mortality rate of cloned animals .
They also stressed that cloning coould considerably reduce the gene pool diversity and increase the risk of whole herds being hit by an illness they are all particularly susceptible to [ AFP ] .
Here in the United States , 20 food companies responded to the FDA 's latest announcement by promising not to use cloned livestock , citing consumer polls that showed consumers have health , ethical , and environmental concerns regarding cloned meat .
Basil Maglaris , a spokesman for Kraft , the U.S. 's largest food company by revenue and a major cheese producer , said the company has told suppliers it will accept only ingredients from conventional animals .
" The surveys we 've seen indicate that consumers are n't receptive to ingredients from cloned animals , " he said [ The Wall Street Journal ] .
However , Kraft 's current pledge only applies to the clones themselves , not to their offspring .

Customs and Border Patrol agents can grab your laptop , BlackBerry , or external hard drive without needing so much as a reason , but a new bill introduced last week to Congress would at least put some limits on how border searches could be done .
" I was deeply concerned to learn about the lack of protections individuals ' have when their electronic equipment is randomly seized , " said Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D - CA ) , who introduced the bill .
" With the passage of the Border Search Accountability Act of 2008 , Americans will be able to travel with more peace of mind knowing that their data will be further protected and that there are stringent accountability measures in place for safeguarding their personal information . "
Note what her bill will not do — make searches more difficult .
Earlier this year , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that border searches of electronic devices ( even those without any probably cause ) did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment 's unreasonable search and seizure clause .
Judges noted that precedent already allows searches of 1 ) briefcases and luggage , 2 ) a purse , wallet , or pocket , 3 ) papers found in pockets , and 4 ) pictures , films , and other graphic material .
So why not laptops ?
While such searches would not appear to be legal within the country , courts have long recognized the government 's right to " protect its territorial integrity " by controlling the material passing across its borders .
Sanchez 's bill would bring more routine to the search process .
The bill requires the government to draft additional rules regarding information security , the number of days a device can be retained , receipts that must be issued when devices are taken , ways to report abuses , and it requires the completion of both a privacy impact study and a civil liberties impact study .
Travelers would also have the explicit right to watch as the search is conducted .
Sanchez also wants data about the searches , which would have to be turned over to Congress once per quarter .
Specifically , she wants to know how many searches are being done , where they take place , and the race and nationality of those being searched .
The Department of Homeland Security actually issued search rules over the summer ; while they were the first rules made public on the process , which had started to look quite ad - hoc , they still came in for criticism from groups like the Association of Corporate Travel Executives .
ACTE , which does n't like have executive laptops pinched whenever someone travels overseas , complained in early August that devices could basically be kept indefinitely , the data could be shared with foreign governments , and no data destruction procedures were spelled out .
Coming so close to the end of this Congressional session , Sanchez 's bill is unlikely to see action this year .
It currently sits in the House Committee on Homeland Security , where it will likely expire when Congress adjourns .
Given the tremendous uncertainty the electronic search process creates for travelers , 40 civil liberties groups asked Congress back in May to hold hearings on the issue ; so far , that has yet to happen , but Ars has spoken with several frequent travelers who already that precautions with sensitive corporate and personal data before going on international trips .
Perhaps the laptop search program will turn out to be as much of a boon for online data repositories as it will for the federal government .

The essential fact remains that such materials and the so - called intellectual property rights are privately owned , produced and sold with a fundamental “ design flaw ” of easy duplication that easily crosses national borders and is effortlessly duplicated on Main Street USA , in a Bangkok backstreet , or swapped over the Internet with one side being 12 time zones away from the other .
These inventions have superseded the mindset of laws and international conventions enacted a long time ago , before Microsoft , Google and iPods gained currency .
The IT sector has created a modern “ give it away ” business model , unheard of a few decades ago .
These private companies operate on a worldwide basis and they , not their home governments , are best placed to challenge illegal practices in local ( foreign ) courts .
If such jurisdictions are lucrative for their sales and marketing operations , they cannot run back to the U.S. government for cover and enforcement muscle , where those unresponsive “ foreign ” legal systems happen to be the source of other advantages gained by the U.S. economy .
It can all be negotiated into a new legal structure , but chances are that other “ shocking ” findings ( such as cheap or unsafe labor practices ) will come up in any global rounds of fair trade negotiations .
And what will be the impact on the price of goods that eventually end up at Wal - Mart , and the resulting inflation ?
Surely the U.S. Trade Representative knows the answer to that one .
The question skews the interests of ( for- profit ) companies in the private sector .
Alas , their complaint has a whiff of a desire for an easy , free rescue by the U.S. government as the industry hopes to surf the recent tides of “ resource nationalism ” .
Surely the government can rescue Silicon Valley from its follies , since the Fed rescued Wall Street from its foolish deals .
After all , both made fortunes from hype : one from irresponsible lending hype and the other from the Y2 K bug .
Never mind that the market value of Microsoft is now twice the value of Citigroup , the American banking giant !
Secondly , the referenced “ loss ” is an exaggerated misnomer , if not a disingenuous one .
It is not a loss , but a hypothetical foregone opportunity for income that will never be realized at American market equivalents .
More than two - thirds of the world ’s population simply does not have the purchasing power , the promise of economic returns or the market structures to justify the prices set in American or / and Western European markets .
Actual unit sales , at the American definition of “ prices ” , will dwindle exponentially if a $ 200 software package is offered for sale where incomes are about $ 2000 a year .
The street price of “ illegitimate ” copies is a telling story -- copies sell for as little as $ 2 , purely because locals cannot afford a $ 10 copy .
Producers of standardized products ( Coca Cola , McDonalds , cigarette and drug makers ) price and market their products to fit local purchasing power , income profiles and consumer affordability .
A wide price disparity for the same products is most evident in the EU ( where the ratio of per-capita incomes between member states is as high as 20 - to - 1 ) .
And the modern dilemma for software makers is that their product can travel at the speed of an internet connection .
These IT companies will kill their own home markets , and business model , if they sell a “ legitimate ” package in , say , Thailand for a fifth of U.S. prices .
These goods will find their way back to their home markets and unlike cigarettes , consumer goods or medication , there are no visible legal structures ( such as local licensing , excise tax or labelling requirements ) to stand in the way .
Laptops are made to travel .
The competitive market for software measures “ success ” by frequency of use , and not profit .
The producer will go out of business if users in our interconnected world shy away from a product because of price , distribution controls , or other restrictions .
Companies like Google are no longer just “ American ” as more than 51 % of their revenue is generated outside the U.S .
Without wider use of their products , supranational companies could not grow to be giants in less than two decades .
The referenced costs , in terms of loss of opportunity , are merely part of the modern business model that the IT companies have created for themselves .
They called it the “ new economy ” .
This article ( The ' Anti - Java ' Professor and the Jobless Programmers ) has really annoyed me .
Not because of its content , but because the professor being interview is so narrowly focused that he is completely out of it .
Let us take this quote :
“ Furthermore , Java is mainly used in Web applications that are mostly fairly trivial , ” Dewar says , with his characteristic candor .
“ If all we do is train students to be able to do simple Web programming in Java , they wo n't get jobs , since those are the jobs that can be easily outsourced .
What we need are software engineers who understand how to build complex systems . ”
You know what , I might agree with this , trivial web programming is something that does n't require highly skilled worker .
But the context in which he says this makes all the difference in the world .
Here is the next statement :
“ By the way Java has almost no presence in such systems .
At least as of a few months ago , there was not a single line of safety - critical Java flying in commercial or military aircraft .
I recently talked to a customer who had a medium - sized application in Java , which was to be adapted to be part of a safety - critical avionics system .
They immediately decided that this meant it would have to be recoded in a suitable language , probably either C or Ada . ”
So , if it is not aircraft code , it is " simple Web programming " ?
Excuse me ?!
Leaving aside the part about Java 's license not being suitable for life critical systems , it annoys me that this is the only criteria that he think is worth mentioning .
His bank is running Java , as well as the stock exchange , it is likely that the payroll system in his university as well .
Relegating Java to " simple Web programming " is a huge mistake .
Java sweet spot is building complex systems , where a lot of the design decisions that make it hard to do the simple stuff pay off tremendously .
I can think of quite a few mission critical ( people life on the balance ) that are written in C# ( for the purpose of this post , equivalent to Java ) .
That is not to say that aircraft systems should n't be written in Ada or C , I never written one , so I wo n't comment , but to say that this is the only field of any complexity is showing a remarkable amount of ignorance and bigotry .
There was another part that caught my eye , this professor interviewing 's technique :
Dewar says that if he were interviewing applicants for a development job , he would quickly eliminate the under - trained by asking the following questions : 1 . ) You begin to suspect that a problem you are having is due to the compiler generating incorrect code .
How would you track this down ?
How would you prepare a bug report for the compiler vendor ?
How would you work around the problem ?
2 . ) You begin to suspect that a problem you are having is due to a hardware problem , where the processor is not conforming to its specification .
How would you track this down ?
How would you prepare a bug report for the chip manufacturer , and how would you work around the problem ?
“ I am afraid I would be met by blank stares from most recent CS graduates , many of whom have never seen assembly or machine language ! ” he says
I can tell quite a lot about what he is doing , just by the questions he ask , but let me try answering them .
1 ) Well , I would start by creating an isolated test case , seeing if I can still see the odd behavior .
I would remove all code that is even half way smart , trying to reduce the amount of work that the compiler has to do .
I would get the language spec and pore over it , trying to make sure that I am not relying on unspecified behavior or misunderstanding the spec .
Hopefully , I have a decompiler as well , since that would be an independent corroboration that there is or is n't an issue .
Then I would take the output and verify disassemble it , comparing it to what is supposed to happen .
I will take that info and submit to the compiler vendor .
Working around this issue ... by now I have some understanding on what triggers it , so I would change the code accordingly , simplifying it , removing any smart tricks , etc .
I 'll also leave a big comment about why this is done .
2 ) Try it on a different machine with the same processor , try it on another machine with a different processor .
That rules problems with a specific machine and problems with my code , respectively .
Reduce the problem to the smallest thing that can repro it , go over the spec , verify understanding .
Eventually I should have a small program that demonstrate the issue .
This can be incredibly hard to do if you run into something like memory barriers do not work in some scenario on SMP machines , for example .
Work around it ... depending on context ...

Before trying a grand jeté en tournant , there are a couple of things you should know .
First , forget about starting your turn in midair , as some ballet teachers might instruct you .
To turn your body you must apply a torque , or twisting force , to it , and once you are in the air you have nothing to apply a torque with .
If , on the other hand , you begin twisting from the ground up , clasping your legs together at the apex of your leap while raising your arms above your head , you will do a rapid 180 - degree turn , which is the object of the exercise .
“ That ’s physics , ” says Ken Laws .
Laws is a professor emeritus of physics at Dickinson College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania .
He also has a very serious case of balletomania .
Thirty - two years ago , when Laws ’s daughter , Virginia , was 5 - and - a - half , she expressed an interest — not so unusual in a little girl — in learning ballet .
Her 7 - year - old brother , Kevin , announced that he wanted to learn too .
Whereupon Laws , then age 40 and perhaps due for a pirouette , decided not to be left out .
He signed up with his kids for a class at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet .
“ The next - tallest person in the room was as high as my waist , ” he recalls .
Kevin dropped out after a year and a half , and Virginia stuck with it for seven , but Laws was hooked .
“ It turned my life upside down , ” he says .
Laws continued for another three decades , sometimes practicing as many as 15 hours a week , until back problems forced him to stop .
Along the way he took some 5,000 classes and participated in the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet ’s annual performance of The Nutcracker for 26 straight years — for 20 of them gamely playing Mother Ginger .
Early on , frustrated with instructions from his teachers that he considered impressionistic , Laws started applying his knowledge of physics to jetés , fouettés , and other balletic motion .
He wrote three books on the subject , one with an eminent ballerina from the American Ballet Theater ( ABT ) , Cynthia Harvey .
Eventually he became a ballet teacher himself .
On a typical Tuesday evening he would face a crowd of teenagers from the Youth Ballet — the boys all suave in black leotards and white T - shirts ; the girls infectiously pert , their hair in tight chignons ;
Laws in street clothes and ballet slippers .
He taught the kids partnering — the pas de deux — and would try to slip in a little physics in the process .
Physics can help a dancer understand , he would explain , why bringing the legs together will let her complete a grand jeté en tournant .
Or why , when she is standing on tiptoe on one leg in an arabesque — bent at the waist , with her other leg extended horizontally behind her — and her partner gives her a twist , she will do a rapid “ pencil ” turn if she straightens up and pulls her leg in .
“ We ’re using a physical principle there , ” Laws would tell the class .
“ What ’s the principle ? ”
“ Toooohhhrque ! ” one of the students would inevitably shout , sarcasm dripping from the o .
Laws was clearly not among science geeks here .
Torque , Laws would explain good - naturedly , was not the point in this case .
Sure , a boy who twists his partner ’s hips is applying a torque , but after that she ’s on her own , and her angular momentum stays about the same ( although the friction of toe on floor will slowly wind her down ) .
Her angular momentum is her rate of spin multiplied by her moment of inertia , which depends on how her mass is distributed around her spin axis .
If her momentum remains the same but she reduces her inertia by pulling in her leg , she must spin faster .
That ’s physics .
Conservation of angular momentum is perhaps the most important physical principle in ballet , but there ’s more to ballet than rotation .
Another classic move is the grand jeté , a gazellelike leap .
Harvey , who retired from the ABT in 1997 , was known for those jumps ; she had a great “ hang time , ” although neither she nor any other jumper ever really hangs , Laws notes .
Once the dancer leaves the floor , she is like a ballistic missile :
Her center of gravity follows a fixed parabola .
She ca n’t change that , but she can move parts of her body .
By scissoring her legs open as she nears the top of the arc and then closing them again as she descends , she makes them take up most of her center of gravity ’s vertical motion .
For that instant , her head and torso can actually move horizontally .
Spectators focus on those parts and think the whole dancer is floating .
The fouetté turn , a full understanding of which struck Laws like a whip late one night , creates a different illusion : perpetual motion .
It is a seemingly endless series of pirouettes on one pointed foot — 32 in a row , in one passage of Swan Lake — each punctuated by a tiny pause in which the dancer spreads her arms and faces the audience .
All the while , her other leg keeps whipping through the air nonstop .
What that leg is doing , Laws realized , is storing momentum .
During each pause the dancer regains momentum by coming down off point and pushing again with her whole supporting foot .
But by keeping the other leg in rotation , she saves some momentum from one turn to the next .
To store momentum in the leg she kicks it straight out , far from her spin axis , as she faces the audience ; to transfer momentum back to her body she tucks the leg back in as she faces away .
The whole thing is fluid and physically sensible , beautiful and economical .
When Laws understood this , he jumped out of bed and started fouetté-ing around the room .
The Philadelphia Inquirer once ran a story about him under the headline “ He Wants to Reduce Ballet to a Science . ”
Laws wanted to crawl into a hole .
That ’s not it at all , he says .
It was n’t his analytic interest that hooked him on ballet ; it was working as a curtain - puller at the Youth Ballet and watching pas de deux from the wings .
“ It was overwhelming , ” he says .
“ I would stand back there with tears streaming down my face . ”
In another life Laws might have become a professional dancer himself .
“ He ’s quite expert , you know , ” Harvey says .
“ He just started too late . ”
Physics is what Laws brings to the art he loves , and lately ballet dancers are starting to see the value of a scientific perspective .
“ More and more , they ’re recognizing the physical principles that contribute to their ability , and that pleases me , ” he says .
That dialogue between science and ballet can produce concrete results .
A few years back , Law was teaching the grand jeté en tournant when it occurred to him to ask whether any of the students had ever done a full turn in the air instead of the standard half - turn .
None of them had .
But one especially coordinated little powerhouse said she ’d like to try .
Laws discussed the conservation of angular momentum with her , and how in order to execute the full turn she would have to bring her legs together in line with her torso at the top of her leap , just like for the half - turn — but then hold them there .
“ So the first time she tried it , ” he says , “ she went up in the air , brought her legs and arms along the axis of rotation — and did one and a half turns .
I ’ve never seen a more astonished look on a dancer ’s face . ”
It must have felt like magic .
But that ’s physics .
“ It ’s like I can distantly read everyone ’s mind , ” Haley went on to say .
“ I love that .
I feel like I ’m getting to something raw about my friends .
It ’s like I ’ve got this heads - up display for them . ”
It can also lead to more real - life contact , because when one member of Haley ’s group decides to go out to a bar or see a band and Twitters about his plans , the others see it , and some decide to drop by  ad hoc , self - organizing socializing .
And when they do socialize face to face , it feels oddly as if they ’ve never actually been apart .
They do n’t need to ask , “ So , what have you been up to ? ” because they already know .
Instead , they ’ll begin discussing something that one of the friends Twittered that afternoon , as if picking up a conversation in the middle .
Facebook and Twitter may have pushed things into overdrive , but the idea of using communication tools as a form of “ co- presence ” has been around for a while .
The Japanese sociologist Mizuko Ito first noticed it with mobile phones : lovers who were working in different cities would send text messages back and forth all night  tiny updates like “ enjoying a glass of wine now ” or “ watching TV while lying on the couch . ”
They were doing it partly because talking for hours on mobile phones is n’t very comfortable ( or affordable ) .
But they also discovered that the little Ping - Ponging messages felt even more intimate than a phone call .
“ It ’s an aggregate phenomenon , ” Marc Davis , a chief scientist at Yahoo and former professor of information science at the University of California at Berkeley , told me .
“ No message is the single - most - important message .
It ’s sort of like when you ’re sitting with someone and you look over and they smile at you .
You ’re sitting here reading the paper , and you ’re doing your side - by - side thing , and you just sort of let people know you ’re aware of them . ”
Yet it is also why it can be extremely hard to understand the phenomenon until you ’ve experienced it .
Merely looking at a stranger ’s Twitter or Facebook feed is n’t interesting , because it seems like blather .
Follow it for a day , though , and it begins to feel like a short story ; follow it for a month , and it ’s a novel .
You could also regard the growing popularity of online awareness as a reaction to social isolation , the modern American disconnectedness that Robert Putnam explored in his book “ Bowling Alone . ”
The mobile workforce requires people to travel more frequently for work , leaving friends and family behind , and members of the growing army of the self - employed often spend their days in solitude .
Ambient intimacy becomes a way to “ feel less alone , ” as more than one Facebook and Twitter user told me .
When I decided to try out Twitter last year , at first I did n’t have anyone to follow .
None of my friends were yet using the service .
But while doing some Googling one day I stumbled upon the blog of Shannon Seery , a 32 - year - old recruiting consultant in Florida , and I noticed that she Twittered .
Her Twitter updates were pretty charming  she would often post links to camera - phone pictures of her two children or videos of herself cooking Mexican food , or broadcast her agonized cries when a flight was delayed on a business trip .
So on a whim I started “ following ” her  as easy on Twitter as a click of the mouse  and never took her off my account .
( A Twitter account can be “ private , ” so that only invited friends can read one ’s tweets , or it can be public , so anyone can ; Seery ’s was public . )
When I checked in last month , I noticed that she had built up a huge number of online connections :
She was now following 677 people on Twitter and another 442 on Facebook .
How in God ’s name , I wondered , could she follow so many people ?
Who precisely are they ?
I called Seery to find out .
“ I have a rule , ” she told me .
“ I either have to know who you are , or I have to know of you . ”
That means she monitors the lives of friends , family , anyone she works with , and she ’ll also follow interesting people she discovers via her friends ’ online lives .
Like many people who live online , she has wound up following a few strangers  though after a few months they no longer feel like strangers , despite the fact that she has never physically met them .

I asked Seery how she finds the time to follow so many people online .
The math seemed daunting .
After all , if her 1,000 online contacts each post just a couple of notes each a day , that ’s several thousand little social pings to sift through daily .
What would it be like to get thousands of e-mail messages a day ?
But Seery made a point I heard from many others : awareness tools are n’t as cognitively demanding as an e-mail message .
E-mail is something you have to stop to open and assess .
It ’s personal ; someone is asking for 100 percent of your attention .
In contrast , ambient updates are all visible on one single page in a big row , and they ’re not really directed at you .
This makes them skimmable , like newspaper headlines ; maybe you ’ll read them all , maybe you ’ll skip some .
Seery estimated that she needs to spend only a small part of each hour actively reading her Twitter stream .
If you ’d told me a year ago that my PC would have hardware PhysX support today , I ’d have been a little dubious .
Last summer , running hardware game physics simulations involved shelling out $ 150 - 200 for a PhysX card , and all you got for your investment was limited support in a handful of titles .
Not exactly a stocking - stuffer .
That will all change next week .
On August 12 , Nvidia will release new graphics drivers that will allow owners of most GeForce 8 , GeForce 9 , and GeForce GTX 200 - series cards to use PhysX acceleration without spending a dime .
Along with the drivers will come a downloadable PhysX software pack containing free Unreal Tournament 3 maps , the full version of NetDevil ’s Warmonger , a couple of Nvidia demos , and sneak peeks at Object Software ’s Metal Knight Zero and Nurien Software ’s Nurien social - networking service .
Nvidia provided us with early access to the pack , and we ’ve been testing it over the past couple of days .
Physics on the GPU
Before getting into our tests , we should probably talk a little bit about what PhysX is and how Nvidia came to implement it on its graphics processors .
In early 2006 , Ageia Technologies launched the PhysX “ physics processing unit , ” a PCI card with a custom parallel - processing chip tweaked for physics computations .
Game developers could use Ageia ’s matching application programming interface to offload physics simulations to the PPU , enabling not only lower CPU utilization , but also more intensive physics simulations with many more objects .
We reviewed the PhysX PPU in June 2006 , but we came away somewhat unimpressed by the hardware ’s intimidating price tag ( around $ 250-300 ) and the dearth of actual game support .
Ageia displayed some neat effects in its custom tech demos , but actual games like Ubisoft ’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter used the PPU for little more than extra debris in explosions .
As PhysX PPUs seemed to be fading into obscurity , Nvidia announced plans to purchase Ageia in February of this year .
Barely a week after the announcement , Nvidia said it would add PhysX support to GeForce 8 - series graphics cards using its CUDA general - purpose GPU API .
The idea looks great on paper .
Running a physics API on a popular line of GPUs bypasses the need for expensive third - party accelerators , and it should spur the implementation of PhysX effects in games .
Nvidia counts 70 million GeForce 8 and 9 users so far , which is probably quite a bit more than the installed base for PhysX cards .
The PhysX API is quite flexible , as well , since it can scale across different types of hardware and does n’t actually require hardware acceleration to work :
Nvidia ’s PhysX pipeline patches API calls through to different “ solvers ” depending on the host machine ’s hardware and settings .
There are solvers for plain x86 CPUs , Nvidia GPUs , PhysX PPUs , and more exotic chips like the Cell processor in Sony ’s PlayStation 3 .
According to Nvidia , PhysX lets developers run small - scale effects on the CPU and larger - scale effects in hardware .
“ For example , a building that explodes into a hundred pieces on the CPU can explode into thousands of pieces on the GPU , while maintaining the same frame rate . ”
To give you an idea of the performance difference between different solvers , Nvidia claims its GeForce GTX 280 can handle fluid simulations up to 15 times faster than a Core 2 Quad processor from Intel .
Check out page four of our GeForce GTX 280 review for more details .
How does Nvidia ’s PhysX - on - GPU implementation actually affect graphics quality and performance , then ?
I used my GeForce 8800 GT - powered desktop system as a guinea pig to get a feel for PhysX ’s behavior on mainstream graphics hardware .
Our testing methods
As ever , we did our best to deliver clean benchmark numbers .
Tests were run at least three times , and the results were averaged .
Our test system was configured like so :
The test system ’s Windows desktop was set at 1680 ×1050 in 32 - bit color at a 60 Hz screen refresh rate .
Vertical refresh sync ( vsync ) was disabled .
We used the following versions of our test applications :
The tests and methods we employ are usually publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Unreal Tournament 3
Our first stop was Epic Games ’ latest multiplayer shooter , one of the biggest and most recent titles to take advantage of PhysX hardware acceleration .
For our testing , we broke out the Unreal Tournament 3 Extreme PhysX mod pack , which includes three maps chock - full of fancy physics effects : a special version of Heat Ray , which we benchmarked below , as well as capture - the - flag arenas Tornado and Lighthouse .
Let ’s start with Heat Ray .
Epic featured this map in the original UT3 demo , but the PhysX - enhanced version in the mod pack adds plenty of destructible items , plus an ongoing hail - storm that bombards the environment with hundreds of little ice lumps .
Explosions and plasma balls from the shock rifle send hailstones and other debris flying .
Actually , a screenshot does n’t really do the hail effect justice .
We ’ve uploaded part of an Nvidia - recorded demo that showcases it in motion :
Curious to see the impact of those shiny effects on performance , we opted to run some benchmarks .
We tested first with GPU physics enabled , then with software physics only , and finally in the default version of the map without added effects .
Each time , we played through five 60 - second deathmatch sessions against bots and recorded frame rates using FRAPS .
This method likely reflects gameplay performance better than pre-recorded timedemos , although it ’s not precisely repeatable .
Averaging five samples ought to yield sufficiently trustworthy results , though .
These numbers say it all .
Using part of the GPU to compute fancy physics effects induces a performance hit , although in this case , that hit was small enough not to seriously affect playability .
The version of the map without PhysX effects did feel noticeably smoother , though .
As for running the PhysX map in software mode , you can forget itlong stretches of frame rates in the single digits made that config unplayable .
We also had a stroll through the other two maps Tornado and Lighthouse .
The latter is n’t particularly interesting unless you really like destructible walls and floors , but Tornado uses PhysX capabilities in a cooler and more original way .
A tornado slowly crawls through the map and sucks in just about everything in its path : debris , rocks , wall chunks , pipes , shipping crates , and even liquid from a toxic pool .
Roof plates bend like sheets of paper toward the sky , while projectiles from the game ’s flak cannon fly up in circles if you fire into the tornado .
Trying to play a CTF match in this map is an interesting experience , since the tornado creates new obstacles by repositioning large objects , and it can kill players with flying debris or by flinging them against walls .
Personally , I thought seeing my freshly killed corpse swallowed up into the heavens made waiting to respawn more fun .
UT3‘s PhysX implementation is n’t perfect , of course .
We encountered a number of bugs , such as objects vibrating in place and occasionally sliding in strange patterns .
Planks and stone slabs in the Lighthouse map unrealistically exploded into many pieces , kind of like giant graham crackers .
That said , these maps came out before Nvidia ’s acquisition of Ageia , so I ’m not too surprised they were n’t polished to a mirror shine .
Nvidia ’s PhysX Particle Fluid Demo
Many of us love Unreal Tournament 3 , but what kind of physics eye - candy can we expect to see in next - gen games ?
Nvidia has whipped up a couple of demos to showcase just that .
One of those is the PhysX Particle Fluid Demo , which pretty much does what you ’d expect : take a gazillion particles , make them look water -y , set them loose in a sample map , and have the GPU simulate their interactions .
In theory , this technique should let game developers achieve the nirvana of fully interactive volumetric water .
In practice , it looked more like tapioca soup .
Yes , the water flows sort - of - realistically and fills little pools like it ’s supposed to .
But the liquid has a strange , almost jelly - like quality , and you can see circular “ water ” particles fly around every now and then .
Perhaps a greater number of particles would make the effect more believable , or perhaps better - looking shader effects would do the trick .
Either solution probably would n’t improve the demo ’s already - low frame rates , though :
Volumetric , particle - based liquids may work great when everyone has GeForce GTX 200 - class hardware ( or better ) , but I ’d be surprised if many developers were implementing this effect in their games today especially when titles like 2 K Games ’ BioShock manage to fake volumetric liquids quite believably .
As a side note , the software PhysX implementation in this test only seemed to use one processor core .
CPU utilization was paradoxically higher in the hardware physics mode , even though the GPU shouldered the simulation work .
The Great Kulu
In this demo , Nvidia shows off soft - body physics through Kulu , a giant tentacled slug - caterpillar that chases you down corridors by hideously distorting itself like a trash bag full of Jell - O. I ’ve had to sleep with the light on ever since testing this .
Gross .
Nvidia may have written this demo with its GeForce GTX 200 graphics cards in mind , but we had no trouble playing it at 1680 ×1050 on our lowly GeForce 8800 GT .
We did n’t benchmark this particular test , because we somehow could n’t run it with PhysX acceleration disabled .
You probably get the idea by now , though PhysX - heavy games and demos tend to run like slideshows without hardware acceleration .
The Great Kulu gives us an interesting glimpse at how games could feature more “ organic ” objects that bend and squeeze depending on what they collide with .
I ca n’t be the only one tired of seeing rag - doll character corpses that behave like they ’re made of cast titanium .
Nvidia ’s demo goes a little over the top with completely Jell - O - like objects , but the effect remains cool nonetheless .
Update 08/19 : The Great Kulu demo seems to only supports GPU - accelerated PhysX on GeForce GTX 200 - series cards , so physics simulations ran on the CPU in my testing with the GeForce 8800 GT .
Because frame rates felt ( mostly ) playable , I incorrectly assumed physics acceleration was forced on when it was actually forced off .
Nvidia says the following about running the demo with software PhysX :
This demo is available for free and can be installed and played without a PhysX acceleration enabled .
However , the minimum system requirements anticipate PhysX being accelerated and it is likely that non-PhysX accelerated systems will experience severe performance degradation at times of high physics load ( the ending room ) .
This degradation will not be present at all moments , but should be clearly evident during standard play .
This is more or less consistent with my experience , although I attributed the slowdowns to the GPU choking under the load instead of the CPU .
ST .
PAUL , Minn . — Government crackdowns on journalists are a true threat to democracy .
As the Republican National Convention meets in St. Paul , Minn. , this week , police are systematically targeting journalists .
I was arrested with my two colleagues , “ Democracy Now ! ” producers Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar , while reporting on the first day of the RNC .
I have been wrongly charged with a misdemeanor .
My co-workers , who were simply reporting , may be charged with felony riot .
The Democratic and Republican national conventions have become very expensive and protracted acts of political theater , essentially four - day - long advertisements for the major presidential candidates .
Outside the fences , they have become major gatherings for grass - roots movements — for people to come , amidst the banners , bunting , flags and confetti , to express the rights enumerated in the Constitution ’s First Amendment : “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press , or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
Behind all the patriotic hyperbole that accompanies the conventions , and the thousands of journalists and media workers who arrive to cover the staged events , there are serious violations of the basic right of freedom of the press .
Here on the streets of St. Paul , the press is free to report on the official proceedings of the RNC , but not to report on the police violence and mass arrests directed at those who have come to petition their government , to protest .
It was Labor Day , and there was an anti-war march , with a huge turnout , with local families , students , veterans and people from around the country gathered to oppose the war .
The protesters greatly outnumbered the Republican delegates .
There was a positive , festive feeling , coupled with a growing anxiety about the course that Hurricane Gustav was taking , and whether New Orleans would be devastated anew .
Later in the day , there was a splinter march .
The police — clad in full body armor , with helmets , face shields , batons and canisters of pepper spray — charged .
They forced marchers , onlookers and working journalists into a nearby parking lot , then surrounded the people and began handcuffing them .
Nicole was videotaping .
Her tape of her own violent arrest is chilling .
Police in riot gear charged her , yelling , “ Get down on your face . ”
You hear her voice , clearly and repeatedly announcing “ Press !
Press !
Where are we supposed to go ? ”
She was trapped between parked cars .
The camera drops to the pavement amidst Nicole ’s screams of pain .
Her face was smashed into the pavement , and she was bleeding from the nose , with the heavy officer with a boot or knee on her back .
Another officer was pulling on her leg .
Sharif was thrown up against the wall and kicked in the chest , and he was bleeding from his arm .
I was at the Xcel Center on the convention floor , interviewing delegates .
I had just made it to the Minnesota delegation when I got a call on my cell phone with news that Sharif and Nicole were being bloody arrested , in every sense .
Filmmaker Rick Rowley of Big Noise Films and I raced on foot to the scene .
Out of breath , we arrived at the parking lot .
I went up to the line of riot police and asked to speak to a commanding officer , saying that they had arrested accredited journalists .
Within seconds , they grabbed me , pulled me behind the police line and forcibly twisted my arms behind my back and handcuffed me , the rigid plastic cuffs digging into my wrists .
I saw Sharif , his arm bloody , his credentials hanging from his neck .
I repeated we were accredited journalists , whereupon a Secret Service agent came over and ripped my convention credential from my neck .
I was taken to the St. Paul police garage where cages were set up for protesters .
I was charged with obstruction of a peace officer .
Nicole and Sharif were taken to jail , facing riot charges .
The attack on and arrest of me and the “ Democracy Now ! ” producers was not an isolated event .
A video group called I - Witness Video was raided two days earlier .
Another video documentary group , the Glass Bead Collective , was detained , with its computers and video cameras confiscated .
On Wednesday , I - Witness Video was again raided , forced out of its office location .
When I asked St. Paul Police Chief John Harrington how reporters are to operate in this atmosphere , he suggested , “ By embedding reporters in our mobile field force . ”
On Monday night , hours after we were arrested , after much public outcry , Nicole , Sharif and I were released .
That was our Labor Day .
It ’s all in a day ’s work .
Amy Goodman is the host of “ Democracy Now ! , ” a daily international TV / radio news hour airing on more than 700 stations in North America .

You 're worse than The Tick !
WILL SMITH
Dammit , is this movie going to do anything to explain why I keep trying to help the shit - eating dickwads that inhabit this city ?
JASON BATEMAN
I think you could use my help , Will .
Your intentions were to do something good , but instead created a massive trainwreck .
WILL SMITH
Are you talking about the train , or this movie ?
JASON BATEMAN
The train .
I 'm a Public Relations something - or - other .
I can help you with your image .
WILL SMITH
Er , how exactly do you intend to make any money doing that ?
JASON BATEMAN
My plan is just to stay in the movie .

There was all of this confusion with her uncle , who I thought was named " Mr. F , " and ...
CHARLIZE THERON
Will does n't want to hear that story , dear .

Tell us how you found out you had superpowers .
WILL SMITH
Well , I just woke up in the hospital with plot - convenient amnesia about my own origin story .
Like Wolverine , but poorly written .
All I had in my pocket were two tickets to see ' Frankenstein ' and a few dollar bills that were n't in circulation at the time .
I was asked to sign " John Hancock " when I left the hospital , so I thought that was my name because having amnesia turns me into a moron .
When I got out , I whistled for a cab , and when it came near , the license plate said " fresh " and there were dice in the mirror .
If anything I could say that this cab was rare , but I thought " naw forget it , yo home to bel - air ! "

If you do n't get out of my way , I 'm going to turn this movie into a cartoon .
WILL literally shoves his head up SOMEONE'S ASS and the SCREENWRITERS race to remove their names from the CREDITS .

Hey Will .
Looks like my plan to have you stay in jail until the plot progressed itself worked .
There 's a bank robbery in progress .

WILL SMITH
Well that takes care of that .
All in all , a pretty decent climax to a flawed , uneven , but largely tolerable comic book movie .

What the hell , how can we only be 45 minutes into this thing ?
Everything from the trailer was shown and it had 3 distinct acts !
CHARLIZE THERON
I seriously suggest everyone leave the theater right now and pretend the first half was the whole movie .
Things are about to get awful .

This was a relatively fun superhero flick about a sassy but charming loser that must reluctantly learn to become heroic while making sarcastic quips .
How could it possibly go wrong ?
CHARLIZE THERON
I 'm a superhero too .
And I 've been living out a secret identity as a housewife .

And when we 're near each other , we lose our power .
And we 're a thousand years old .
And we used to be married .

EDDIE MARSAN
Yeah well , maybe by now there 's been an extremely awkward and idiotic plot twist that renders him weaker than earlier in the movie .
RANDOM CRIMINAL
I dunno , man .
That would be pretty fucking embarrassingly stupid .
Like , I 'd have to assume everyone involved in making the movie would be unable to show their faces in public again for something that idiotic .
EDDIE escapes and goes after WILL .
WILL gets HURT , which apparently also hurts CHARLIZE THERON .
JASON BATEMAN
Will , do n't forget that this movie was directed by the same guy who made " Very Bad Things . "
What 's the stupidest possible explanation for how you can get your powers back ?
WILL SMITH
Um , walk a few feet away ?

Perfect !
WILL leaps away from CHARLIZE and everyone HEALS .
EDDIE is DEFEATED and WILL carves JASON'S LAME HEART LOGO into the MOON just to be an ASSHOLE .

It 's staggering that a movie that has been in pre-production for a decade could end up feeling so rushed .
Why did this piece of garbage get crammed into the summer so quickly ?

9 Ways to Reduce Business IT Expense
Last month I got a lot of positive feedback about the timeliness of my newsletter topic , “ The Right Span of Control Is n’t a Number , ” so this month I ’ve written another newsletter article dealing with today ’s problems .
In our current economy there is a high likelihood that you ’ve been asked to “ tighten your belt ” and cut back on business IT expenses .
If you follow some of the recommendations in this article , then you ’ll be more successful in that endeavor .
Before we get started , note that the title of this article is “ 9 Ways to Reduce Business IT Expense – not “ 9 Ways to Reduce IT Expense . ”
I want to make that distinction because one easy way to reduce IT expenses is to stop doing things that cost IT money .
You can stop supporting certain products , stop taking certain kinds of Help Desk calls , or stop helping the business with certain kinds of problems , and that will indeed reduce IT expenses .
However , if those things just move the expense from IT to the business then you have n’t done anything good for the business at all .
That ’s why I include the word “ business ” in the title .
The goal is to reduce business IT expenses – that is to say you ’re trying to reduce overall expenses to the business for IT - related services – not just move expense from one cost center to another .
Now I realize that this altruistic view may not be shared by the accountant or manager who ’s bugging you to cut your budget .
But for the good of your company , it ’s important that you focus on reducing expenses for the overall business – not just for your own department .
Make it clear that your focus is bigger than your department , and this attitude will do wonderful things for your career down the road .
TANSTAAFL
OK , now that we ’ve got the article title out of the way , let me talk about one other key to IT expense reduction .
It ’s important for you to get the message across that with each and every IT expense reduction comes a lower level of service .
This is equivalent to saying “ There ’s no such thing as a free lunch , ” and it may seem obvious , but it ’s critical that you actually demonstrate it in your budget reductions .
You ’ve got to say this clearly to whoever is after you to reduce expense , “ Any reduction in IT expense will have an impact on the business .
The impact may be worth the reduction , but that has to be a business decision – not an arbitrary decision by someone in IT .
No IT expense reduction can come without a corresponding business price . ”
Here ’s why you have to make that message clear :
If the business sees a lower level of service as the consequence of IT budget cuts , then they ’ll know exactly what they ’re losing , and they ’ll be on your side when it comes time to eventually increase budgets and restore those lost services or restart those postponed projects .
If you ever – even once – cut your budget without showing a corresponding cut in services to your customer , then you ’ll have set a precedent and an expectation that you ’ll be able to do this again and again .
You ’ll have established the reputation that “ IT budgets loosely , so we can always get them to squeeze money out of their budget without incurring any business penalty , ” and you will have lost the trust of your business customers .
9 Strategies for Expense Reduction
Now it ’s time to reduce expense .
To help make the strategies clear without getting us tied up in IT issues , let me first go through an example of how we would cut expenses for a hypothetical household if our family were forced into a cost - cutting situation .
Then , after you see how these nine strategies work for families , we ’ll go through the same strategies and apply them to IT .
Most families look at nine basic strategies for expense reduction :
Postpone expenses which are n’t required right now .
This is n’t the best time to get a new car , and we can probably avoid buying new clothes for a while .
Postpone all non-essential maintenance .
The house can probably do without painting for another year , and maybe we can get our hair cut every 6 weeks instead of every month .
Substitute less expensive alternatives for those things that have substitutes .
We can buy store - brand groceries , eat more beans instead of meat , and get cheaper shoes for the kids when they outgrow the ones they have .
We ’ll do our own yard work and stop using a lawn service .
Reuse old stuff .
Eight - year - old Sarah can use ten - year - old Sally ’s old coat .
We can make lunches out of leftovers from dinner .
Consolidate needs where possible , and let one thing satisfy multiple needs .
We can reduce gasoline costs if we just shop once a week .
And the new coat for Sally ( she outgrew her old one ) can have a zip - out liner so she wo n’t need two coats .
Go to a lower standard of living .
We can turn down the thermostat in the winter and turn it up in the summer to reduce energy costs .
If necessary , we can move to a smaller , less - expensive apartment .
Stop “ going out . ”
We ’ll cut back on restaurants and vacations for the time being .
Move to less expensive ways to enjoy life .
Instead of a week in Florida at Disney World , we ’ll do some day - trips to local parks .
Look for additional sources of income .
Maybe we can find weekend jobs , or maybe we can take some of those baskets Jean likes to make and sell them at a craft fair .
9 Strategies for Reducing Business Expense in IT
Now let ’s see some examples of applying each of these nine techniques to IT .
Postpone expenses which are n’t required right now .
You had planned to upgrade the server , but the users can live with their current system response time , so that upgrade can be postponed .
And maybe you can do without that new software development tool a little while longer .
Postpone all non-essential maintenance .
You have to keep doing operating system and security patches ( those are essential for company security ) , but some of the other application software maintenance can probably be postponed .
You can also delay some of those minor software enhancements the users have been wanting ; that will let you focus on what ’s really important right now .
Substitute less expensive alternatives for those things that have substitutes .
What first comes to mind is open systems software : both for operating systems as well as applications .
This can definitely be a money - saver , but it ’s usually not a quick decision , you and your users will need training to make it work , and there ’s a migration involved .
Still , it ’s something you ought to consider at some point .
Another possibility is offshoring , but again this requires a great deal of planning and thought – it ’s not a quick budget fix , and you pay the price for offshoring in increased rigidity of your processes .
Surprisingly , you may find that insourcing – moving some of your outsourced work in - house – may help you reduce expenses in some areas where you have people who can do the work .
You ’ll probably get the most bang for your buck in this area by reducing the amount of “ gold plating ” that you ’ve got going on in the requirements for your systems .
Try to convince your business users that they can live with a less - expensive system that does n’t have all of the features they think they need .
Reuse old stuff .
Every IT shop has lots of old equipment lying around .
Try to reuse some of it .
Refurbish old notebook PC ’s and use them for new employees .
Use old desktop PC ’s for kiosks .
And definitely reuse software licenses – it ’s way too easy to just buy a new license for each new employee , but it ’s a waste of money if you have old no - longer - used licenses for the same software .
Stay legal , but there ’s no point in giving unnecessary money to software vendors .
Consolidate needs where possible , and let one thing satisfy multiple needs .
“ Virtualization ” is the IT buzzword in this area .
Use a single server for multiple purposes .
Use blade servers for remote users over the Internet instead of giving each of them their own high - powered individual PC .
Share offices between two people who each work half the time from home .
Go to a lower standard of living .
Re-look at those up - time goals ; maybe you could save money if the business tolerated slightly lower up - time .
You might also be able to reduce expense by delivering a lower level of service on your help desk : maybe a next day response to problems instead of a few minutes or a few hours .
If it makes sense , share offices , consolidate computer centers , and reduce the number of square feet required for your department .
Give the space to someone who really needs it .
Stop “ going out . ”
Postpone unnecessary training .
Try to find local training when you absolutely need it , and avoid conferences for a while to minimize travel costs .
Many of those conferences can be accessed via the Internet now anyway .
And many vendors can give you training over the Internet too .
Move to less expensive ways to enjoy life .
You might have to cut back on bonuses , but maybe you can provide other perqs instead .
If you go to a staggered four - day workweek ( each person works four days , but someone is always in the office ) or let more people work from home , then your employees will save money on gas and waste less time commuting .
That ’s worth a lot these days .
Look for additional sources of income .
Take a hard look at the skills in your department .
Is there any way that those skills could be the basis of a paid service done for your customers ( that ’s the customers of your business – not just the IT customers ) ?
This is probably the least likely of the 9 strategies , but give it at least a little bit of thought .
Conclusion
You can be creative about cutting costs , or you can turn the cost - cutting process into pure drudgery .
It ’s your choice , and your attitude toward the problem will have a big impact on your career .
People get rewarded when they have a good attitude and help the business .
People who complain in this economy often get targeted as lay - off candidates .
Whatever happens , try to be positive about the situation .
Turn the process of cost - cutting – and of then living with the subsequent reduced budget – into a challenge for your employees .
Help them be creative in coming up with ways to do more with less , and in reusing things that already exist .
Cost - cutting is itself a marketable skill , and if you do it right then you and your employees will have fun while you all enhance your careers .
Think about each of the nine cost - cutting strategies , and figure out ways to use them in your own situation .
It ’s much better to be the leader in cost cutting than to fight it and end up being the cost that someone else cuts .

( CNN ) -- Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin wants a quick ruling from the state Personnel Board she has asked to investigate her firing of the state 's public safety commissioner , her lawyer said Wednesday .
Sen . John McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , is accused of pressuring a state official .

Palin , Alaska 's governor , is scheduled to accept the Republican vice presidential nomination Wednesday night at the GOP convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota .
But her nomination has led to heightened scrutiny of her July firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan , who said Palin aides pressured him to fire the governor 's ex-brother - in - law from the state police .
The matter already is under investigation by the state Legislature , which was scheduled to report its findings on October 31 -- days before the November 4 election .
But Palin 's attorney , Thomas Van Flein , said the Personnel Board could resolve the matter faster " if they want to jump on it . "
" I think I 'd rather have them act quickly and get the real facts out there in the open , " he said .
Van Flein filed papers Monday night with the state attorney general 's office to request the investigation be taken out of the hands of the Legislature -- effectively amounting to the governor filing an ethics complaint against herself .
Van Flein said the matter belongs before the Personnel Board , all three members of which were first appointed by Palin 's predecessor .
" We 're not making this up , " he said .
" This is state law that the Legislature enacted that they 're not following . "
In the complaint , he wrote that an " unbiased review " would show Palin did nothing wrong .
In a statement issued along with the complaint , Palin said she requested the new investigation " to put these matters to rest . "
" The people of Alaska -- and of the nation -- deserve to have a decision from the proper tribunal putting their minds at ease that suggestions of misconduct that have circulated on the Internet and in some media outlets are not true , " Palin said in her statement .
There was no immediate response from state Sen.
Hollis French , who is managing the investigation launched in July by the bipartisan Legislative Council .
Monday , he told Van Flein that the Personnel Board would not have jurisdiction over the matter unless a complaint was filed with the attorney general and refused to share copies of witness statements with the governor 's attorney .
" I think you would agree that it would be highly unusual for an investigator to share information with one of the targets of the investigation , " wrote French , a Democrat .
" I am unaware of any precedent for such an arrangement . "
Van Flein said Palin wants the investigation managed " professionally , " and the case belongs with the Personnel Board .
The Personnel Board 's three members were first appointed by Gov. Frank Murkowski , whom Palin unseated in a Republican primary in 2006 .
Palin reappointed one member , Debra English , in 2008 .

Then he stomps a whole in the ground and turns to stone .
When I saw Gendy Tartakovsky ’s animated “ Clone Wars ” on Cartoon Network , I was convinced that it was a positive turning point for Star Wars .
The stylized animation was distinct and likable , the voice acting was , at times , excellent and the stories the series told were compelling .
Mace Windu took out an entire droid army by himself .
It was awesome .
When I found out they were remaking the series as a CGI movie ( with a new tv series to follow ) I groaned that same “ Lucas ca n’t leave well enough alone ” groan I ’ve been groaning for years .
Sure enough , the reviews are confirming my fears .
Many of you will say , “ I do n’t read reviews .
I see the movie and decide for myself . ”

JERRY YANG , the soft - spoken chief executive of Yahoo , rarely becomes animated , at least in public .
But ask him about his company ’s lackluster performance over the past year , and he will begin to pound the table  albeit ever so lightly  punctuating his answer with a dose of impatience .
“ We have a plan , ” Mr. Yang said in an interview last week at Yahoo ’s headquarters here .
“ We want to grow the business over a three - to five - year period .
We are executing against that plan .
And we are still doing that despite all the stuff that ’s happened to us . ”
All the stuff that ’s happened , of course , refers to the turbulence that has engulfed Yahoo since Jan. 31 , when Microsoft made an unsolicited takeover bid .
At the time , conventional wisdom was that Microsoft and its hard - charging C.E.O. , Steven A. Ballmer , would quickly swallow the company .
But Mr. Yang has emerged as an unlikely survivor  at least for now .
He beat back Mr. Ballmer , whose offers to buy all or part of Yahoo were considered inadequate by Mr. Yang and his board .
And he rebuffed Carl C. Icahn , the activist shareholder , who tried to seize control of Yahoo but settled for three seats on an expanded board .
Did you know that there are two basic kinds of USB 2.0 drives ?
I did n’t .
But , now thanks to Robert L. Scheier ’s article , Not all USB drives are created equal , I now know that are significant differences between drives .
And , in particular those differences matter a lot to live USB capable Linux distributions like Fedora 9 .
The differences , in short , is differences in the memory type and their I /O controllers .
The results are anything but trivial .
One type of USB drive will run two to three times faster than their slower brothers and , potentially , last 10 times longer .
As Scheier explains , “ The single biggest factor in USB drive performance is whether it contains one of two types of memory : SLC ( single - level cell ) or MLC ( multilevel cell ) .
SLC stores one bit in each memory cell , and MLC stores two bits in each cell . ”
The more expensive SLC memory runs twice as fast as MLC , “ with maximum read speeds of about 14MB / sec. and write speeds of about 10 - to 12MB / sec . ”
It also lasts much longer .
For most uses , this difference is n’t really noticeable .
But , if you ’re constantly reading and writing small files , the MLC difference quickly becomes apparent .
And , in what situation might you be reading and write small files all the time ?
Why , yes , if you ’re running Linux directly from the USB stick .
So , clearly if you ’re a Linux user who likes the idea of having your very own Linux desktop in your pocket , you ’ll want to get a SLC USB drive , right ?
Well , you can want to do that , but there ’s no way of telling one kind of drive from another short of actually trying it out and testing its I /O performance .
The one ‘ certification ’ that comes on USB drives — a Vista ReadyBoost logo — does n’t actually tell you anything useful .
Any USB 2.0 drive can deliver the performance required for Vista ReadyBoost .
While SLC USB drives tend to be more expensive , you ca n’t rely on that .
One vendor ’s fair - priced SLC drive is another vendor ’s over - priced MLC drive .
So it is that I ’d like to suggest that the USB vendors , like Lexar Media and Stec , start labeling their high - performance USB drives .
I , for one , would be willing to pay for a high - end USB drive if I knew that ’s what I ’d be getting .
Come on guys .
This should be a no - brainer .
Right now I ’m guessing that most of your sales are promotional USB drives .
You know , the ones with the logo of some company or the other on them .
There ca n’t be that much of a margin in that business .
Since you ’re already making SLC drives , why not advertise their speed ?
Even those of us who do n’t plan on using them for portable Linux desktops love speed after all .
Here ’s hoping that someone out there is paying attention and picks up this idea .
I think it would be a good one both for the USB vendors and for Linux users .
A Superpower in Decline America 's Middle Class Has Become Globalization 's Loser
At the beginning of the 21st century , the United States is still a superpower .
But it 's a superpower facing competition from beyond its borders as well as internal difficulties .
Its lower and middle classes are turning out to be the losers of globalization .

On July 29 , the SEC announced that it would extend its original 10 - day restriction on " naked " short sales of 19 major financial companies through August 12 .
Analysts across the board agree that this particular SEC rule , by itself , will have little effect except to raise transaction costs for those wishing to short Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , and other powerhouses .
However , in conjunction with the Fed 's recent lending operations to investment banks and Fannie and Freddie , the restriction on naked short sales makes perfect sense as part of a process of getting the public used to federal / private partnerships that would have been unthinkable before the credit crisis — especially from a " laissez - faire " administration .
In this article , I 'll explain short selling ( and the " naked " variant ) , its benefits to the market economy , and the harm from arbitrary government restrictions on the activity .
I 'll close by speculating on the possible motivation for the government to engage in an apparently pointless gesture .
Short Selling
I explained in a previous article how ( successful ) stock speculators provide a " social " service by steering asset prices to their correct levels .
If investors believe a particular stock is underpriced , they can buy shares of it and then unload them once the stock has met or surpassed what they view as its " proper " level .
In this way , they quickly push up underpriced stocks .
Notice that it does n't matter whether the investors who notice the initial underpricing own any of the stock at the outset .
However , things are different when an investor believes a stock is overpriced .
If the investor happens to own shares of the stock in question , the obvious move is to sell some or all of the position , which both earns a relative gain for the investor and also speeds the downward move in price .
If this were the end of the story , there would be an obvious asymmetry in the market 's ability to rely on the dispersed knowledge of experts in diverse fields .
The only people who could act on their belief that a stock was overpriced would be those who already owned the stock .
Such a restriction would be even worse than a small random sampling of the population , because the people who purchase a stock are more likely than the average person to have overrated it .
Fortunately , the market allows short selling , where someone who has zero shares of a stock can , in effect , sell shares and hold a negative position .
Suppose stock XYZ is trading at $ 50 , but Jim the Speculator believes tomorrow 's news will contain something very unfavorable for the stock — and the rest of the market is n't seeing things the way Jim is .
Jim can borrow , say , 100 shares of XYZ from a stockholder , sell them today for $ 5,000 , and then wait for the news to hit .
When it does , and the stock sinks to $ 40 , Jim buys back the 100 shares for $ 4,000 , and returns them to the stockholder .
The stockholder is no worse off ( he had n't planned on selling the shares ) , and Jim has netted $ 1,000 from his superior foresight .
Things get more complicated when the short seller takes longer to return the shares ; we have to worry about dividend payments , interest , etc .
But the basic principle is simple enough : just as a speculator who wants to go long can borrow money to buy stocks , so too a speculator who wants to go short can borrow stocks to " buy money . "
Short selling is no more mysterious than buying stocks on margin .
Naked Short Selling
Unfortunately , naked short selling is not nearly as exciting as it sounds .
It simply refers to a situation where a trader short sells a quantity of shares before he has actually borrowed them from an owner .
Some of the commentary on naked short selling has become downright silly .
The naked short seller is not violating the laws of logic ; certain bloggers write as if we should fear a rip in the space - time continuum centered on Wall Street .
If a particular stock is illiquid , and a trader wishes to speculate on an anticipated hourly move in the share price , nothing is harmed by allowing him to sell 1,000 shares and then buy them back 45 minutes later ; the broker can simply debit or credit his account accordingly .
Of course , what is really happening here is that the broker is extending a form of credit to the trader , and the buyers of the " naked " shares ( i.e. , the counterparties to the initial short sale ) are in turn trusting the brokerage .
Because those 1,000 shares were n't actually located and borrowed before the short sale , that transaction can't be completed until the trader closes his position and buys back 1,000 shares ( possibly from other individuals ) .
At that point , any of the counterparties to the original short sale who maintained their purchase , can gain title to the shares out of the 1,000 the trader bought back when closing his position .
What if the trader has a heart attack before he closes the position ?
Or what if he made a terribly wrong guess , and the share price triples ten minutes after his initial short sale ?
This danger is why I earlier said that the trader relies on a form of credit from the brokerage ; no matter how much he initially put up as collateral , the share price could rise such that he is on the hook for more money .
Ultimately , the brokerage is responsible for delivering the proper number of shares to those who purchased them in the initial short sale .
Of course , it is possible that if disaster strikes , and a stock experiences a sharp jump while a trader holds a very large naked short position , then the brokerage could be unwilling or even financially incapable of rectifying the accounts of those who were counterparties to the initial short sale .
In other words , they agreed with the trader to buy a certain number of shares at a certain price , they handed over their money , and then find out ( after the shares have risen in price ) that they do n't own these shares , after all .
Depending on the precise contractual understanding , this outcome would be either outright fraud , or at least a very embarrassing sign of incompetence .
Either way , the brokerage would obviously seek to avoid such a predicament , and so ( absent government regulations ) would be very careful in facilitating short sales .
The real controversy over naked short selling , however , concerns price manipulation .
Here the fear is that a maverick trader could spread false rumors about a company while massively shorting its stock .
Such aggressive actions would allegedly push the price down , allowing the trader to reap a guaranteed profit from his self - fulfilling prophecy .
As with most tales of market manipulation , this one is too good to be true .
For one thing , why could n't large stakeholders do the same thing with regular ( not short ) sales ?
Bill Gates could spread rumors about Microsoft and begin unloading his huge position .
After the price fell 50 percent , he could buy back his original position , having netted perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in the process , and owning the same number of shares as before .
Bill Gates 's actions would n't have changed the underlying profitability of Microsoft , and so its artificially depressed share price would presumably recover over time .
No government regulations on short selling could stop this type of maneuver .
Going the other way , why do n't manipulative speculators spread positive rumors about companies , and then massively buy their stock ?
This too ought to yield a sure profit , if manipulation is so easy .
Again , the government would have a difficult time cracking down on this ploy .
What would the SEC do , forbid optimists from buying stocks they expected to rise ?
Traders are n't stupid .
They understand the possibility of manipulative schemes , and can take defensive actions accordingly .
For example , if a trader believes someone else is engaging in a " short and distort " operation , he can buy the stocks on the cheap , preventing them from falling significantly in price .
In the interests of promoting stability , stock exchanges and other clearinghouses enact private " regulations " overseeing their participants .
Even without government regulations , particular practices that were clearly deceptive would be prohibited , in order to ensure that the exchanges ' customers were happy with their experience .
In the grand scheme , grown men and women buy and sell shares of companies .
No one forces them to heed the rumors of a " short and distort " or a " pump and dump " artist .
Government regulations can't protect people from their own gullibility .
In fact , attempts to do so perversely give them a false sense of security .
The Recent Crackdown on Naked Short Selling
What is remarkable about the SEC 's recent announcement is its pointlessness .
All it does is prohibit naked short sales on nineteen " important " financial companies .
In other words , even if a trader intends to short ( say ) Citigroup shares and to buy them back within an hour , the brokerage must first locate and borrow the shares before allowing the sale .
Inasmuch as large brokerages pledge to make whole any customers who are counterparties to a short sale , the restriction apparently does nothing except require more paperwork and reduce the attractiveness of short selling .
( Because of the extra delay , share prices might move before traders can short sell them . )
My observations should n't be taken to suggest that an expanded prohibition by the SEC would be a good thing .
On the contrary , the bigger the restrictions , the worse the interference with the beneficial role of speculation on stock prices .
For example , if the SEC outlawed short selling altogether , this would make market prices more volatile , as experts could no longer anticipate bad news and push stock prices in the proper direction .
But such draconian moves could n't prop up stock prices forever .
Eventually , the actual owners would recognize reality and sell what they knew to be overvalued shares .
This raises an interesting question : if the restrictions on naked short selling wo n't do anything except throw red tape into the works , then why did the SEC do it ?
By itself , the move does n't really benefit the fat cat Wall Street bankers , because ( as we 've argued above ) an insolvent institution wo n't be helped much by bans on short sales , especially if those bans only apply to naked short sales
The answer , it seems , is that the government is gradually eroding the remaining barriers between an explicit federal / corporate partnership with large , politically connected firms .
With the bailout of Bear Stearns , the announcement of possible Fed purchases of Fannie and Freddie equity , and the restrictions on naked shorting of nineteen financial firms , the government is , step by step , desensitizing the public .
In light of what has already happened , a basically irrelevant move to prohibit naked shorting of nineteen firms wo n't lead to riots .
But it is a necessary step along the way to announcements that would have led to massive protests had they occurred at step one .
Conclusion
Short selling is a beneficial process that allows anyone to participate in the market 's evaluation of share prices .
So long as contracts are enforced , even naked short selling can be a beneficial process that allows the quickest possible adjustment in mispriced stocks .
The government 's recent efforts to " protect " nineteen favored firms from naked shorting will do nothing but raise transaction costs .
Beyond that , it provides a sobering hint of future , more significant innovations in federal government support for particular financial giants .
We hear quite a bit about religious extremism in other parts of the world but very little about Christian extremism right here in America .
Do n't get me wrong - Islamic extremism is a real concern and deserves the attention it receives .
However , I think it is a mistake to completely ignore Christian extremism at home .
I suppose it would be accurate to say that one of the main reasons I maintain this blog is to call attention to what I perceive as a neglected issue : Christian extremism in America .
I previously offered a definition of Christian extremism and will not repeat it here .
However , I would remind the reader thatis not synonymous withand that an obvious reason for the media 's neglect of Christian extremism is that it rarely reaches the level of terrorist attacks .
Coverage of the Muslim world often confuses extremism with terrorism and uses the terms interchangeably .
When I say that Christian extremism is neglected by the American media , I am not saying that Christian extremists themselves are neglected ( they are most certainly not ) .
The media loves to feature the Pat Robertsons among us .
What they neglect is covering such figures as the Christian extremists they are .
It is tempting to immediately point to Christian privilege as the main culprit of the media 's neglect of Christian extremism .
After all , the American media ( and its audience ) are so thoroughly saturated with fundamentalist Christianity that it is reasonable to guess that it simply might not occur to them to cover it .
With Christianity as the dominant religion in America , many Americans do not have the perspective to consider alternatives or to ask the difficult questions about the extremists among us .
The Christian progressives and moderates have had relatively little to say on the subject of the vocal extremists who dominate the conversation .
In part , this may be because the media refuses to give them a similar platform .
However , I tend to think that at least some of the blame rests on the shoulders of the progressives and moderates .
It is difficult for them to criticize their extremist colleagues without feeling that their religious beliefs may be weakened in the process .
Before Iraq and before 9/11 , how much did you hear about other forms of religious extremism in the media ?
Not much .
Compared to now , one almost never heard of " Islamic extremists " and the like prior to 9/11 .
9/11 and Bush 's subsequent blunders not only cast a spotlight of national attention on the issue of extremism in the Muslim world but also contributed to its rise .
Could it be that this increased coverage of religious extremism serves political goals and reflects no genuine concern about religious extremism ?
The reason you hear about Christian extremism here on this blog is that I believe in fixing one 's own problems instead of simply pointing out those of others .
I agree that Islamic extremism is an important problem , but I think that religious extremism in general is a problem .
I am not content to ignore what I see going wrong in America to point the finger at other nations .
Pollsters wo n't admit it , but this years presidential election may be unpredictable .
It is not too close to call merely because polls have John McCain and Barack Obama virtually tied in swing states .
New factors rock the reliability of polling :
TURNOUT : Who will actually vote ?
Pollsters interview randomly selected voters , but then weight the results to reflect the expected composition of the electorate in terms of party affiliation , gender , race , age ...
If the model for turnout is wrong , the poll results could go well outside the margin of error .
Will young voters turn out in record numbers , as they did in many Democratic primaries ?
Or will Obama - mania fade as he becomes more of a typical politician , changing his positions to be less liberal , and changing his oratory to be less messianic (   This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet ) ?
Both campaigns are courting evangelicals .
Obama emphasizes that hes a Christian to counter viral e-mails that he is secretly a Muslim .
McCains TV spot spoofing Obama as a Moses wannabe (   The One ) used language that made some Christian fundamentalists think it was suggesting that Obama is the Antichrist .
When issues are so combustible and complicated , can pollsters plumb the depths of voters  souls with simplistic questions ?
RACE : pride , prejudice , and guilt
Political analysts wonder if there is a  Bradley effect in this years polling , referring to former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , a black candidate for governor of California who led in polling but lost the election .
Apparently many white voters didnt want to admit to pollsters that they opposed a black candidate for fear they would seem bigoted .
That could account for Hillary Clinton often outperforming the polls in the primaries against Obama .
Yes , there is white prejudice .
But theres also white guilt about racism , which voters might be reluctant to admit as well .
Does it offset the prejudice ?
There is great pride in , and support for , Obama among African - American voters .
Their turnout might increase dramatically .
Should pollsters increase the percentage of African - Americans in their polling sample ?
Or will there be an overall increase in voter turnout , thus offsetting any increase by a subset of the electorate ?
AGEISM  and appearance
Americas media culture reveres youth , while old age is often mocked .
McCain would be the oldest first - term president in history , and no one says he looks younger than his age .
For voters with high - definition TV , scars and wrinkles are eye - poison .
When McCain and Obama debate , voters will see a greater contrast in appearance than when John Kennedy debated Richard Nixon .
Many voters admit to pollsters that they re troubled by McCains age , but how honest would they be in admitting looks - ism ?
TELE - POLLING : privacy and paranoia
Lots of voters have caller ID .
When they see a research firms number on the display , many assume its a telemarketer and wont answer .
And many voters  not just the young  only use cellphones and dont have a number available to polling firms .
How reliably random is the sample when it consists only of voters who dont mind being asked their opinion by strangers ?
Surely pollsters fail to capture many voters who are paranoid or protective of their privacy .
Some voters resent the influence of polling in politics and give untruthful answers to be mischievous .
( Vegetarian Party Hindu PhD Hispanic
I just dont have an accent .
Are you calling me a liar ?)
UNDECIDEDS : proudly uncommitted
 Undecided voters are often uninformed or wishy - washy , rather than independent - minded .
Even so , they are exalted in televised focus groups and news interviews .
So why wouldnt voters feign indecision ?
Reporter :  In 2000 , you were a soccer mom .
In 2004 , you were a security mom .
Now you are a swing mom .
How can a candidate win your support ?
Voter :  They cant .
Ive decided to remain undecided .
Some voters want to seem not only prejudice - free , but opinion - free .
Apparently they feel that ignorance is bliss , especially when its shared with a pollster .
PREDICTION : continued unpredictability
This campaign has already been the strangest , most unpredictable of any in memory .
That s been true even after Dennis Kucinich , Mike Gravel , Mitt Romney , and Ron Paul stopped campaigning .
A clear front - runner may emerge after the debates , but for now , polls might not even predict the past .

Mozilla took a big step toward Firefox 3.1 yesterday with the release of the first alpha .
It includes important improvements to both the user interface and to Firefox 's underlying Gecko rendering engine .
Much of Firefox 's internal architecture was overhauled during the 3.0 development process .
This means that Mozilla now has a much stronger foundation to build upon .
The features planned for 3.1 will continue pushing the browser forward and will leverage some of the new infrastructure that was put in place for 3.0 .
The new release will also include some features that were deferred during the 3.0 development cycle because of time constraints .
Additionally , some of the experimental features from 3.0 will be refined and improved for 3.1 based on feedback from users .
Tab browsing
The 3.1 alpha , which is codenamed Shiretoko , already includes some of the earliest pieces .
The Firefox developers are attempting to improve on the conventional tabbed browsing model and extend the tab interface so that it provides more visual feedback .
In the alpha release , the ctrl+tab keyboard shortcut now invokes the visual tab switcher , which shows previews of the pages in each tab .
It also changes the order of tab rotation .
Instead of iterating through each tab sequentially , it switches between them based on when they were last used — much like the alt+tab application switcher in Windows or command - tab on the Mac .
The idea of using visual thumbnails makes a lot of sense .
When you use the ctrl+tab shortcut in Firefox 3.0 , each page has to completely redraw while you are rotating through tabs .
When you have a lot of tabs open and are short on system resources , that can get a bit slow .
Showing just the thumbnails and then switching to a page only after the right one has been selected will eliminate some of that overhead .
Additionally , the thumbnail strip in 3.1 lets you see the contents of three tabs at once , which means that you have more visual feedback to work with while you are making your selection .
Although thumbnail previews are an obvious win , the value of altering the tab switching order is debatable .
The " last - used " switching model will make it easier for users to move between related tabs even if those tabs are n't next to each other , but for many power users , that will be a difficult adjustment .
Many of my personal workflow optimizations depend on linear tab iteration .
For instance , I use tab reordering to group related tabs together in a way that makes it easy to navigate to precisely the tab I want by using the conventional iterative alt+tab and ctrl+shift + tab shortcuts along with the alt + number combination .
I have this down to a science and can usually get to anything with a minimal number of key presses .
I personally do n't think that the last - used switcher can really improve on my approach ( for me , at least ) , so I 'm a bit concerned about it taking over those keyboard shortcuts .
Mozilla tries to accommodate those of us who prefer linear iteration by rebinding the old tab switching functionality to ctrl+pageup and ctrl+pagedown .
These are not particularly good keyboard shortcuts to use for much of anything .
In order to hit those on a conventional desktop keyboard , you have to either move your left hand completely across the keyboard or move your right hand off the mouse , both of which are extremely disruptive to browsing workflow .
It 's even worse on laptop keyboards where you sometimes have to hold down a function key for pageup and pagedown .
In the future , the developers plan to add support for displaying the tab previews in a grid view , much like the Mac OS X Expose feature .
Users will also be able to close the tab associated with a thumbnail preview by hitting " w " while using ctrl+tab to rotate through the list .
The rendering of the previews is pretty decent and it has some nice aesthetic flourishes .
For instance , the tab previews have reflections and are displayed on a translucent black frame with rounded corners .
The translucent frame was rendered properly on Windows XP but showed up as an opaque rectangle sheet on Linux .
One minor ( and probably unavoidable ) issue that I noticed with the thumbnails is that they do n't include plug - in content , so you end up with empty holes in the page where Flash media is embedded , for instance .
Awesome Bar
In addition to the changes that have been made to the tab switching interface , the alpha release also adds some smarter filtering mechanisms for the Awesome Bar .
Users can now include sigils in Awesome Bar queries to narrow down the results .
For instance , if you want the bar to only show matches from bookmarks , you type an asterisk .
You can also use a carat to limit the search to bookmarks or a plus sign to match against tagged pages .
You can also search against URLs by using an at sign and match only against titles by using a pound sign .
New configuration options can be used to make any of those filters enabled by default .
These Awesome Bar enhancements offer a lot of useful functionality ( especially the bookmark filter ) and also demonstrate the potential for the Awesome Bar to move beyond simple search operations and into the realm of command behaviors .
For more details , check out this blog entry .
Web developers
Firefox 3.1 alpha 1 also has some great stuff for web developers .
The Gecko rendering engine got some long - awaited CSS3 features like text - shadow , box - shadow , and border images .
The shadow features have been around for a long time in Opera and WebKit and are also part of the Acid3 test .
Another significant addition is the HTML5 Canvas text API .
This is an area where Firefox seems to be a bit ahead of the curve — the Canvas text functions are still in the draft stage and are n't implemented by other browsers yet .
CSS text shadow demo from CSS3.info
Firefox 3.1 alpha 1 is available for download from the Mozilla web site .
Binaries and installation instructions are available for all three major platforms .
Since this is an early alpha release and is intended primarily for developers , we recommend that users create a separate profile for testing it .

The Wall Street Journal :
Last week , Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , had n't sought earmarks or special - interest spending from Congress , presenting her as a fiscal conservative .
But state records show Gov. Palin has asked U.S. taxpayers to fund $ 453 million in specific Alaska projects over the past two years .
It 's been 652 days since Earmark Queen Sarah Palin took office as Governor of Alaska .
In that time , she 's hustled for $ 453,000,000 in federal lipstick pork .
That 's $ 694,785.28 a day .
Six hundred ninetey - four thousand , seven hundred and eight five dollars and twenty - eight cents .
Every day .
Even Sundays !
Palin was grubbing six hundred ninety - four thousand , seven hundred and eighty - five dollars and twenty - eight cents out of the federal trough on the very day when John McCain looked America in the eye and said she was taking zero .
And she took it again today , too .
And she took it on every one of the 312 nights she spent at home and billed the Alaskan taxpayers for it .
So why say it 's a million dollars a day ?
Well , first , let me show you what Slick Sarah Palin is telling people :
On the campaign trail , Gov. Palin has repeatedly attacked Sen. Obama on earmarks .
" Our opponent has requested nearly one billion dollars in earmarks in three years .
That 's about a million for every working day , " she said at a rally in Albuquerque , N.M .
Ohhhh , this feels like it 's going to get embarrassing in a second ....
And , behold !
Look what " The Math " says !
It is difficult to compare Sen . Obama 's earmark record with Gov. Palin's -- their states differ in size , for instance , and the two candidates play different roles in the process .
But using the same calculation that the McCain campaign uses , the total amount of earmarked dollars divided by the number of working days while each held office ( assuming a five - day workweek , every week , for both ) , Gov. Palin sought $ 980,000 per workday , compared with roughly $ 893,000 for Sen.
Obama .
Not only is Palin taking much more , but oh my word if the million dollar figure does n't actually fit her sooooo much better than the person she 's trying to use it against !
What a surprise !
So that 's almost a million dollars a day , whether she showed up at the office or not .
A million bucks , plus $ 60 in her pocket for defrosting one of her own mooseburgers for lunch .
And really , Palin must be asking herself , why not chisel the Alaska state government a little bit ?
After all :
The state 's earmark requests stand out in part because its state government is among the wealthiest in the U.S.
Flush with oil and gas royalties , it does n't impose income or sales taxes .
In fact , money flows the other way : Every man , woman and child this year got a check for $ 3,200 .
Gosh , but they 're such rugged individualists up there !
They 're gonna launch themselves into orbit with those bootstraps , don'tcha know ?
A million dollars a day .
From you and me .
Plus $ 3,200 in the bank for each one of 'em .
And $ 60 in Sarah 's pocket for every lunch at home .
( Like every working mom , of course ! )
It 's the new fiscal responsibility , in John McCain 's seven house - owning , $ 5 million middle class living world !
Somehow , YouTube already has a copy of David Letterman tonight lacerating John McCain for skipping the Late Show and suspending his campaign in the midst of the Wall Street meltdown .
As reported earlier by Drudge , Letterman became especially upset when he caught the Republican presidential nominee in a live feed from New York being interviewed by his own network 's Katie Couric .
McCain had personally told Letterman he was canceling because he was headed back to the capital to handle the financial crisis .
Whoops .
Letterman invited lefty MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann to fill for McCain and spent huge stretches of his broadcast laying into the candidate , saying he was acting " fishy " by not letting his running mate Sarah Palin take over the campaign .
It remains a mystery how this ended up on YouTube .
Did someone at Letterman leak it ?
Why , and why not wait until after the broadcast airs ?
Do show producers fear CBS suits will quash the broadcast for its heavy political overtones ?
Or did they think they risked a ratings disaster without their A - list guest and were hoping to either effectively tease the McCain - less show or maximize revenge against the McCain camp ?
Whether they capitalize on it financially or otherwise , Late Show producers have created some fascinating television .

Il has been suffering from serious health problems , and may have had a stroke , a U.S. intelligence official told CNN Tuesday -- the same day Kim missed a parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Communist nation .
National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the White House is aware of the reports , but has no additional information .
Kim 's absence from the parade and events the night before revived questions about the president 's health .
The leader has denied reports that he suffers from heart disease and diabetes .
The second - in - command in North Korea , Kim Yong Nam , said there is no problem with Kim , the Kyodo News agency of Japan reported Wednesday .
Naoko Aoki of the news agency said the second - in - command filled in for Kim at the parade .
A senior North Korean diplomat dismissed reports that Kim was ill as " a conspiracy plot , " Kyodo reported .
" We see such reports as not only worthless , but rather as a conspiracy plot , " Song Il Ho , North Korea 's ambassador for normalization talks with Japan , was quoted as saying .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak held a meeting Wednesday with his senior secretaries on the matter , a source at his office told the nation 's Yonhap news agency .
" Lee discussed countermeasures to a possible serious illness of the North Korean leader during his unscheduled meeting with senior presidential secretaries , " Yonhap quoted Cheong Wa Dae , a source at the presidential office , as saying .
Watch the massive military parade in Pyongyang »
North Koreans filled Pyongyang 's main square , which can hold about 100,000 people , she said .
Participating in the parade were paramilitary troops , which are not part of North Korea 's regular army -- there were no members of the regular army , navy or air force , Aoki said .
There were anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery on display , but no tanks or missiles , she added .
Kim also holds the post of supreme commander of the Korean People 's Army .

Today in response to a question about what McCain ’s work on the Senate Commerce Committee did to help him understand the financial markets economic advisor Douglas Holtz - Eakin claimed that John McCain helped create the Blackberry , which seems to be quite an accomplishment for a man who ca n’t use the Internet .
In response to a question about the financial markets , Holtz - Eakin held up his Blackberry and answered , “ He did this .
Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years , comes right through the Commerce committee so you ’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that ’s what he did . ”
Bill Burton of the Obama campaign pointed out that this is n’t even the worst thing that McCain has said all week , “ If John McCain had n’t said that ‘ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ’ on the day of one of our nation ’s worst financial crises , the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week . ”

This is hysterical .
Al Gore was abused and distorted by the right wing in 2000 , for his comments about the Internet , but Gore understands and uses the technology .
The basis for Holtz - Eakin ’s answer seems to be that since the Blackberry is a tool used in commerce , and the selling of it is a form of commerce , then McCain helped create it .
Wow , this makes no sense .
On the scale of McCain lies and distortions , this one flies straight to the top .
John McCain is apparently some sort of technology idiot savant .
He creates devices that he has no idea how to use .
I would just like to remind everybody one more time that the question was about McCain ’s knowledge of financial markets .
Holtz - Eakin never answered the question , so we can assume that McCain does n’t know anything about the financial markets either .
The only question I can see between Blackberries and the financial markets is that there were thousands of people who discovered that they were wiped out yesterday on their Blackberries .
The McCain campaign has taken their lying to a whole new level .
They have gone from lying about the issues to lying about McCain ’s accomplishments .
I do n’t know about you , but I ca n’t wait to see what other technologies that John McCain has created .
My guess is that by Friday the campaign will say that he created the iPod .
Someone dropped in unexpectedly at the Duke game on Saturday .
About an hour before kickoff against James Madison , two parachutists landed at the 35 - yard line at Wallace Wade Stadium with a game ball , according to a story in the Raleigh News & Observer .
The Blue Devils had n't scheduled the event , however .
The jumpers were supposed to land eight miles down the road in Chapel Hill , N.C. , before the North Carolina game .
" All we know is , they must have missed their jump site , '' a Duke team official said , according to the newspaper .
UNC assistant athletics director for promotions Michael Beale told the Observer that the plane had decided to cancel the jump into Kenan Stadium due to bad weather .
A break in the clouds , however , revealed a stadium and the jumpers made their leap after all .
They did n't realize that they were over the wrong stadium until it was too late .
When informed of the gaffe , UNC associate athletics director Rick Steinbacher called Duke to apologize .
" In about five years , maybe this will be funny , '' Steinbacher said , according to the newspaper .
" Right now , I 'm just glad no one was hurt . "

Answer : 576 megapixels .
That would be a VERY nice camera — but think about the filesize .
How in the world do people who have eidetic memory store all the information ?
If the human eye was a digital camera , how many megapixels would it have ?
Clarkvision does the calculations .
The answer : 576 megapixels .
Impressive job — I wish I had thought to do that .
Note that their calculations require a bit of fudging : the fovea actually covers just a tiny bit of the visual field ; the eye must move from point to point in order to assemble an image this detailed .
A digital camera records all the pixels at the same time .
For the photographically inclined , the article also goes on to make several other camera / eye calculations .
A separate question : could a 576 megapixel image “ fool ” your visual system into believing it was seeing the real thing ?
Assuming one eye was covered and you were not allowed to move , I think it could .
But as soon as you viewed the image with both eyes or were allowed to move , then you would be able to detect the fact that the image was flat .
Three - dimensional images look different when viewed from different perspectives , but flat images do n’t .
The delusions are fueling a chicken - and - egg debate in psychiatry :
Are these merely modern examples of classic paranoia fed by the current cultural landscape , or is there something about media like reality television and the Internet that can push people over the sanity line ?

“ Most likely these people would be delusional anyway , ” said Dr. Joel Gold , a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York , who said he saw five patients at the hospital from 2002 to 2004 with Truman Show delusion .
Dr. Gold and his brother , Dr. Ian Gold , the Canada research chair in philosophy and psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal , came up with the term “ Truman Show delusion . ”
“ But the more radical view is that this pushes some people over the threshold ; the environment tips them over the edge , ” said Dr. Joel Gold , who is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at New York University .
“ And if culture can make people crazy , then we need to look at it . ”
One way of looking at the delusions and hallucinations of the mentally ill is that they represent extreme cases of what the general population , or the merely neurotic , are worried about .
Schizophrenics and other paranoid patients can take common fears — like identity theft because of information transmitted on the Internet , or the loss of privacy because of the prevalence of security cameras to fight crime — and magnify them , psychiatrists say .
“ There is the old saying that just because you ’re paranoid does n’t mean there ’s not somebody after you , ” said Dr. Jeffrey A. Lieberman , chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University .
The prevailing view in psychiatry is that a delusion is just a delusion , psychosis is psychosis , and the scenery is incidental .
Fear , a sense of persecution and grandiosity are static features of delusional thinking , many psychiatrists say .
MIT researchers have shown that cells from different people do n't all react the same way when exposed to the same DNA - damaging agent -- a finding that could help clinicians predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy .
The research team from MIT 's Center for Environmental Health Sciences ( CEHS ) and the Departments of Biological Engineering and Biology , identified a group of 48 genes that can predict how susceptible an individual is to the toxic compound known as MNNG .
The work appears in the Sept. 18 online edition of Genes and Development .
MNNG , a DNA - damaging compound similar to toxic chemicals found in tobacco smoke and in common chemotherapy agents , usually kills cells by inducing irreparable DNA damage .
However , the researchers found a wide range of susceptibility among cells taken from healthy people .
" A cell line from one person would be killed dramatically , while that from another person was resistant to exposure , " said Rebecca Fry , former MIT research scientist and lead author of the paper .
" It was n't known that cell lines from different people could have such dramatic differences in responses . "
Toxic agents such as MNNG create lesions in DNA , provoking the cell to defend itself with a variety of DNA - repair and other pathways .
However , every individual expresses slight differences in the genes involved in those pathways .
" Even if everyone is exposed to exactly the same things , they would respond differently , because we 're all genetically different , " said Leona Samson , senior author of the paper , director of CEHS , and an American Cancer Society Research Professor .
The team members found that after measuring the expression of every gene in each cell line , they could predict cell sensitivity to MNNG from the expression of just 48 specific genes , with 94 percent accuracy .
Several of those 48 genes have already been linked to cancer , said Samson , but it was not known that their expression is already altered before exposure to the DNA damaging agent .
This study is specific to MNNG , but similar efforts are now underway in Samson 's lab to predict individuals ' responses to other toxic agents , including cisplatin , a common chemotherapy agent , and temozolomide , used to treat brain cancer .
Fry , the lead author of the paper , is now an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health .
Other authors are Peter Svensson , a postdoctoral fellow in CEHS ; Chandni Valiathan , a graduate student in computational and systems biology ; Emma Wang and Brad Hogan , technical assistants in CEHS ; Sanchita Bhattacharya , former CEHS research scientist ; James Bugni , former CEHS postdoctoral fellow ; and Charles Whittaker , a research scientist in the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research .

Anyone who has seen an optical illusion can recall the quirky moment when you realize that the image being perceived is different from objective reality .
Now , a team of scientists from MIT , Harvard and McGill has designed a new illusion involving the sense of touch , which is helping to glean new insights into perception and how different senses -- such as touch and sight -- work together .
Ambiguous visual images are fascinating because it is often difficult to imagine seeing them any other way -- until something flips within the brain and the alternative perception is revealed .
This phenomenon , known as perceptual rivalry , is of great interest to neuroscience .
Because rivalrous illusions produce changes in perception that are independent of changes in the stimulus itself , they may help to understand how the brain gives rise to conscious experience .
" The most familiar illusions involve vision , " explains Christopher Moore , a principal investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT and an assistant professor in MIT 's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences .
" But we 're interested in discovering general principles of perception , and we wanted to see whether similar illusions can occur in the tactile domain . "
Moore is senior author of a paper on the new illusion published on the Current Biology web site on July 17 .
In the visual illusion known as the apparent motion quartet , two dots are presented at diagonally opposite corners of an imaginary square .
When the pattern alternates between the two diagonals - - top left / bottom right followed by top right / bottom left -- people perceive the dots as moving back and forth either horizontally or vertically .
After a period of time , typically a minute or two , most observers report that the axis of motion appears to flip from vertical to horizontal or vice versa .
An example of the illusion can be seen at http://web.mit.edu/~tkonkle/www/AmbiguousQuartet.html.
To create a tactile version of this illusion , Olivia Carter , a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University , and Talia Konkle , a graduate student in Moore 's MIT lab , used a new piezoelectric stimulator device developed by Qi Wang and Vincent Hayward at McGill University .
This device , originally designed as a computer Braille display , uses a centimeter - square array composed of 60 " tactors " to deliver precisely controlled touch stimuli to the finger tips of volunteer subjects .
When volunteer subjects were given the diagonally alternating stimuli , they perceived them as moving smoothly back and forth -- and just as with the visual illusion , the direction of apparent motion flipped back and forth from vertical to horizontal , on average about twice per minute , even though there was no change in the stimulus itself .
The authors went on to show that after a period of adaptation to an unambiguous horizontal or vertical stimulation ( produced by activating a row of tactors in succession ) , subjects were more likely to perceive a subsequent ambiguous stimulus as being in the orthogonal direction .
Similar after - effects are common in vision and were once thought to reflect fatigue in the brain circuits responsible for a particular perceptual interpretation , but are now thought to reflect a continual recalibration of the brain to its sensory environment .
In another experiment , an ambiguous touch stimulus was interrupted by a three - second break , after which subjects tended to experience the same direction as before the break , suggesting that the prior interpretation was somehow retained in memory and used to reinterpret the ambiguous stimulus .
Real - world objects often stimulate multiple senses simultaneously , and our brains must combine these disparate stimuli into a unified interpretation of the world .
The authors used their tactile illusion to explore the interaction between touch and vision .
They instructed their subjects to make vertical or horizontal eye movements during the ambiguous touch stimuli .
Subjects perceived that the direction of tactile motion shifted into alignment with the direction of the eye movements , but only if the head and finger were also aligned .
Tilting the head sideways 90 degrees produced a shift to the other direction -- suggesting that the tactile and visuomotor systems are somehow aligned with respect to the external world .
" We do n't yet understand what 's happening in the brain during these illusions , " says Konkle .
" But we think this illusion will be a useful new tool to understand more about the similarities between different sensory modalities and how they all work together . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush gave an upbeat assessment Thursday of security strides in Iraq as U.S. troop deaths headed for their lowest monthly total since early in the war .
President Bush on Thursday said progress in Iraq will allow shorter tours of duty , starting Friday .
" Violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 , and we 're now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady , " Bush said .
Troop reductions this year could continue if security holds , he said , and he announced that Army troops newly deployed to Iraq would serve 12 months instead of 15 , starting Friday .
The deployment decision , which applies to new soldiers heading to Iraq , was first announced in April .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said separately Thursday that conditions in Iraq have improved " dramatically . "
" There is a real possibility of some additional drawdowns as we look forward , " Gates told reporters .
The new tour policy " relieves the burden on our forces , and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families , " Bush said during brief remarks at the White House .
Watch how Bush assesses situation in Iraq »
Tours will not be reduced for currently deployed troops .
Bush said there 's a " degree of durability " to the gains made in reducing violence in Iraq .
He credited last year 's increase in U.S. troop strength and the rising competency of Iraqi security forces .
A CNN - Opinion Research Corp. poll of 1,041 adults conducted on July 27 - 29 found 62 percent favor a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , while 37 percent oppose setting deadlines .
The results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The same poll found 52 percent consider the troop surge a success and 41 percent consider it a failure .
The error margin on that question was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Overall , 37 percent think the United States is winning the war in Iraq , 6 percent think the insurgents are winning , and a majority , 57 percent , say no one is winning .
That question also had a 4.5 percent error margin .
Sixty - six percent of those polled oppose the war in Iraq , while 33 percent favor it .
The war in Afghanistan is opposed by 52 percent , but 56 percent say troop levels there should be increased as levels in Iraq are reduced .
The margin of error on those questions was 3 percentage points .
The president Thursday praised Iraqi forces for purging Shiite extremists from Basra , Amarra and Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood .
As a result of these successes , U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker was able to walk through Sadr City last week , he said .
" That 's something that would not have been possible just a few months ago , " Bush said .
He also noted political progress in Iraq , as the Parliament has advanced legislation and Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki recently completed a diplomatic trip to Europe .
Ten U.S. troop deaths have been reported this month .
Four were killed in hostilities and six died from nonbattle - related causes , according to the Pentagon .
Two other soldiers who have been missing since May 2007 were found dead this month , but it is not known when they died .
The lowest monthly toll had been in May , when 19 were killed .
U.S. casualties have been lower in 2008 than last year .
There were 40 deaths in January , 29 in February , 38 in March , 52 in April , 19 in May , and 29 in June .
Last year , there were 83 deaths in January , 81 in February , 81 in March , 104 in April , 128 in May , 101 in June , 80 in July , 84 in August , 65 in September , 38 in October , 37 in November , and 23 in December .
" We now have brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three Marine units that were sent to Iraq as part of the surge .
The last of these surge brigades return home this month , " Bush said .
The number of monthly Iraqi civilian deaths in Iraq also is declining , according to the Iraqi government .
In July , 387 Iraqi civilians were killed in conflict - related violence , compared with 448 in June and 504 in May .
However , the number of Iraqi police and soldier casualties in July was higher than June 's figure .
In July , 45 Iraqi police officers were killed and 83 were wounded .
In June , 41 police were killed and 110 were wounded .
Thirty - three Iraqi soldiers were killed and 63 were wounded in July .
In June , 21 soldiers were killed and 47 were wounded .
Bush said later in the year , Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , will provide " recommendations on future troop levels , including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit . "
Still , " we remain a nation at war , " Bush said .
" Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq , but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again . "
Bush said the United States is " making progress " in its discussions with Iraq " on a strategic framework agreement , " which would " serve as the foundation for America 's presence in Iraq " once a U.N. mandate authorizing multinational forces expires at the end of the year .
The administration had hoped to forge an agreement by the end of July but both sides continue to negotiate .

Ice cores indicated that temperatures now are unusually high A new study by climate scientists behind the controversial 1998 " hockey stick " graph suggests their earlier analysis was broadly correct .
Michael Mann 's team analysed data for the last 2,000 years , and concluded that Northern Hemisphere temperatures now are " anomalously warm " .
Different analytical methods give the same result , they report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The 1998 hockey stick was a totem of debates over man-made global warming .
The graph - indicating that Northern Hemisphere temperatures had been roughly constant for 1,000 years ( the " shaft " of the stick ) before turning abruptly upwards in the industrial age - featured prominently in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) 2001 assessment .
The hockey stick is alive and well
Michael Mann
But some academics questioned its methodology and conclusions , and increasingly strident condemnations reverberated around the blogosphere .
One US politician demanded to see financial and research records from the scientists involved .
However , a 2006 report from the National Research Council ( NRC ) , commissioned by the US Congress , broadly endorsed its conclusion that Northern Hemisphere temperatures in the late 20th Century were probably warmer than at any time in the previous 400 years , and perhaps at any time during the previous 1,000 years .
Twin study
Since then , a number of research groups have produced new " proxy records " of temperatures from the centuries before thermometers were widely deployed .
Such proxies include the growth patterns of trees and coral , the contents of ice cores and sediments , and temperature fluctuations in boreholes .
Unravelling ' climate scepticism '
In their latest study , Dr Mann 's group collated more than 1,200 proxy records - the majority from the Northern Hemisphere - and used different statistical methods to analyse their cumulative message .
" We used two different methods that are quite complementary in the assumptions they make about data , so that provides a test of the sensitivity of data to the methods used , " he told BBC News .
" We also made use of a far wider network of proxy data than previously available .
" Ten years ago , the availability of data became quite sparse by the time you got back to 1,000 AD , and what we had then was weighted towards tree - ring data ; but now you can go back 1,300 years without using tree - ring data at all and still get a verifiable conclusion . "
Both analytical methods produced graphs similar to the original hockey stick , though starting further back in time .
The " shaft " now extends back to about 700 AD .
The same basic pattern emerged when tree - ring data - whose reliability has been questioned - was excluded from the analysis .
" I think that having this extra data and using more methods to analyse it makes the conclusions more robust , " commented Gabi Hegerl from the University of Edinburgh , UK , who was not involved in the research .
Past lessons Critics of the idea of man-made climate change argue that conditions 1,000 years ago were as warm as , if not warmer than , they are today .
The new paper adds to the evidence against that notion .
One of the analytical methods used suggests that temperatures in the Mediaeval Warm Period could have been no higher than they were in about 1980 ; the other suggests they were no higher than those seen 100 years ago .
The growth patterns of corals are a valuable proxy record of climate
In any case , said Dr Hegerl : " The whole line of argument [ about whether temperatures have been as high in the past as they are now ] is not very relevant . "
The climate has always responded to factors such as changes in solar activity or volcanic eruptions , and always will , she said ; the issue now is how it is responding to greenhouse gas emissions .
" In any case , the paper still comes to the firm conclusion that the most recent decades are unusual . "
Ten years on from the study that provoked all the ire , Michael Mann 's conclusion is that far from being broken , " the hockey stick is alive and well " .
But , the Penn State University researcher added : " If we want to understand things like El Nino and how it relates to climate change , it 's not enough to know just how anomalously warm the climate is today .
" We need to learn from the palaeoclimatic record .
The science is not all done , there 's still a lot of work to do ; but what we are seeing now is definitely unusual in the context of the past . "
A particular desire of scientists in the field is to increase the amount of data from the Southern Hemisphere .
The majority of proxy records come from land rather than sea , and from land not covered in ice at that , which is in relatively short supply south of the equator .

Nuclear Power as Terrestrial Energy : A Guest Post
William Tucker has written about the environment and energy issues for Harper ’s , The Atlantic Monthly , The Wall Street Journal , and The New York Times , among other publications .
In his forthcoming book Terrestrial Energy , he argues that nuclear power is the only technology that can head off global warming and cut carbon emissions .
This is his first of three guest posts here on the subject .
Energy matters around the world are rapidly coming to a head .
The latest reports from the Arctic are that the North Pole could be ice free this summer for the first time in history .
World oil production seems to have peaked in 2005 , and the recent run-up in price may be permanent .
Natural gas supplies are also bumping up against limits and the world of solar energy seems as far away as ever .
All this has led to talk of reviving nuclear power .
After a national debate from 2000 to 2002 , the Finns decided to construct the first new European reactor in 30 years .
China , India , and Russia are building , and France — which embraced the technology in the 1970 ’s — now gets 78 percent of its electricity from nuclear .
So perhaps it is time for America to reconsider nuclear .
In order to open this national discussion , I would like to suggest that we think of nuclear power as “ terrestrial energy . ”
As we know , nearly all the energy on the earth comes from the sun .
Plants and trees are stored solar energy .
Fossil fuels are organic matter that was buried millions of years ago .
Wind and hydropower are energy flows set in motion by the sun ’s heat .
Converting sunlight on your rooftop into electricity is the most direct way of tapping solar energy .
There is one form of energy , however , that has nothing to do with the sun .
“ Geothermal energy ” involves tapping the earth ’s natural heat .
Steam arises naturally out of the earth at geysers and fumaroles and can be engineered anyplace where hot magma approaches the surface .
Dig deep enough anywhere on earth and you will encounter terrestrial energy .
There is now talk of drilling down 10 miles to tap this heat .
( The deepest oil wells only go five miles down . )
What is the source of this energy ?
Amazingly , 50 to 90 percent of the earth ’s heat ( no one is sure of the exact figure ) comes from the radioactive breakdown of uranium and thorium , which make up 2 percent of the earth ’s crust .
The energy released from these radioactive elements is enough to raise the earth ’s internal temperature to 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit — hotter than the surface of the sun .
So here ’s a suggestion .
Instead of digging down ten miles to access terrestrial energy , why not bring its source to the surface ?
Let ’s mine small amounts of uranium , put them in a controlled environment , accelerate the breakdown a bit by initiating a chain reaction , and use the heat to boil water to produce electricity .
In fact , this is what we do in a nuclear reactor .
A nuclear reactor is not a bomb hot - wired into a power plant .
It is a perfectly natural way of tapping the earth ’s internal energy .
The USDA 's plot to deceive consumers over " raw "
Is the USDA actually trying to destroy consumer health ?
Why the USDA is more dangerous than terrorists
Almond Growers and Handlers File Federal Lawsuit - Seeking to End " Adulteration " of Raw Nuts
( Natural News )
After having their organic almond businesses devastated by the USDA 's bizarre decision requiring mandatory chemical fumigation of almonds , the almond industry is fighting back .
Fifteen American almond growers have filed a lawsuit against the USDA in an attempt to repeal the requirements that all almonds grown in California be fumigated or pasteurized .
( Virtually all almonds sold in the United States are grown in California . )
Since the USDA 's ruling in 2007 , organic almond growers in California have been economically devastated by the mandatory fumigation of almonds .
Because USDA rules do n't apply to almonds being imported from other countries , however , the industry has seen a huge shift away from U.S. growers and towards almond growers in Spain and other countries .
Some American almond farmers have even called the USDA 's decision " a plan to destroy the U.S. almond industry and put small organic farmers out of business .
"
The mandatory almond fumigation requirement is seen by health - conscious consumers as not merely bizarre , but downright fraudulent .
That 's because the USDA 's regulations allow fumigated and pasteurized almonds to be labeled " raw , " thereby intentionally deceiving the consuming public and instantly destroying consumer trust in the labeling of all almonds .
By any honest measure , the people making these decisions at the USDA can only be described as either idiotic or criminal .
To enforce regulations requiring the intentional mislabeling of raw food seems more like the actions of a criminal racket than a government agency .
While online pharmacies selling mislabeled pharmaceuticals are routinely raided and shut down by U.S. authorities , when the government itself engages in similar deceptions , it declares itself above the law and immune to prosecution .
This lawsuit by U.S. almonds growers aims to overturn the USDA 's deception .
These fraudulent actions on the part of the USDA have generated an enormous amount of criticism from the raw food community , whose members depend on almonds to make raw almond milk , raw almond " burgers " and other raw foods preparations .
As leaders of the raw foods movement rightly insist , fumigating or pasteurizing nuts destroys as much as 90 percent of their original nutritional value , altering proteins and destroying disease - fighting phytonutrients .
The USDA , however , remains remarkably illiterate on this topic , have never made a single statement acknowledging any qualitative difference between cooked foods and raw foods .
As the editor of NaturalNews.com , I find the USDA 's ignorance on fundamental matters of nutrition to be nothing short of astonishing .
As it is the U.S. government department responsible for much of the food supply , it should be on the leading edge of nutritional knowledge , not stuck in the 1950's , before scientists knew about plant enzymes and disease - fighting phytochemicals that are easily destroyed by heat or chemicals .
Notably , the USDA has also supported the FDA 's plot to irradiate the U.S. food supply while intentionally misleading consumers over the fact that their foods have been irradiated .
See my article , " FDA Plots to Mislead Consumers Over Irradiated Foods " at https://www.naturalnews.com/023956.html
My only explanation for the USDA 's insistence that the U.S. food supply should be fumigated , irradiated and cooked to the point of nutrient destruction is thatfor the U.S. population .
With Big Pharma now deciding key regulatory decisions of the U.S. government , the USDA 's actions seemed designed to create a nation of health degenerates who will demand unprecedented levels of pharmaceutical " treatments " that enrich the drug companies .
If that sounds a little too conspiratorial , rest assured that U.S. corporations engage in conspiracies all the time : Conspiracies to hide negative drug studies , conspiracies to influence the USDA 's Food Guide Pyramid to avoid saying things like " eat less meat , " and conspiracies to ensnare consumers in an endless cycle of consumption , disease and debt .
In fact , most of what happens between government and private industry today is founded on conspiracy -- which simply means two people sitting in a room , plotting how to bilk consumers for the most profits .
Whether the USDA is openly conspiring to destroy the U.S. food supply -- or is merely run by bumbling idiots who are nutritionally illiterate -- is debatable .
But the results of its actions are not .
By destroying the healing qualities of fresh produce and nuts , the USDA is denying consumers access to the very plant - based nutrients that are just barely keeping people from developing full - blown cancer , diabetes and other serious medical conditions .
As more and more fresh foods are destroyed by USDA regulations , our population will spiral downward into a state of degenerative disease and misery .
In doing so , the USDA will have accomplished what all the terrorists in the world could not do : Destroying the U.S. food supply and leaving its population to rot .
It is unimaginable to think that this could be happening accidentally .
For government agencies like the USDA and FDA to put such policies into place , .
In other words , somebody wants to deny consumers access to raw food .
They want everything to be dead , processed , fumigated , homogenized , pasteurized , irradiated or otherwise destroyed .
This is most likely being pursued solely for corporate profits ( a diseased population is not only easier to control , it also spends a lot more money on pharmaceuticals and medical services ) .
I 've said it before , but it 's worth repeating : .
If such policies are allowed to continue , you can kiss the United States of America goodbye .
It will never survive the disease , death and financial bankruptcy that 's sure to follow such assaults on its food supply .
That 's why this lawsuit by California almond growers is so important :
It may allow us to free almonds from the destructive designs of the USDA , restoring the integrity of this important source of nutrients .
Of course , suing the USDA is hardly the correct response to such terrorism assaults on our national food supply .
If we actually lived in a country that sought to protect its population , the Pentagon would send a team of Navy Seals into the offices of the USDA ( and the Almond Board of California ) with flashbangs and assault rifles , and they 'd arrest these criminals for their attempts to threaten the U.S. food supply .
After sentencing , they could be shackled and lined up in a California park where consumers could throw -- what else ? -- irradiated rotten tomatoes at them .
What follows is yesterday 's press release on this issue from the Cornucopia Institute : WASHINGTON , D.C. 
A group of fifteen American almond growers and wholesale nut handlers filed a lawsuit in the Washington , D.C. federal court on Tuesday , September 9 seeking to repeal a controversial USDA - mandated treatment program for California - grown raw almonds .
The almond farmers and handlers contend that their businesses have been seriously damaged and their futures jeopardized by a requirement that raw almonds be treated with propylene oxide ( a toxic fumigant recognized as a carcinogen by the EPA ) or steam - heated before they can be sold to American consumers .
Foreign - grown almonds are exempt from the treatment scheme and are rapidly displacing raw domestic nuts in the marketplace .
Tens of thousands of angry consumers have contacted the USDA to protest the compulsory almond treatment since the agency 's new regulation went into effect one year ago .
Some have expressed outrage that even though the nuts have been processed with a fumigant , or heat , they will still be labeled as " raw . "
" The USDA 's raw almond treatment mandate has been economically devastating to many family - scale and organic almond farmers in California , " said Will Fantle , the research director for the Wisconsin - based Cornucopia Institute .
Cornucopia has been working with almond farmers and handlers to address the negative impacts of the USDA rule , including the loss of markets to foreign nuts .
The USDA , in consultation with the Almond Board of California , invoked its treatment plan on September 1 , 2007 alleging that it was a necessary food safety requirement .
Salmonella - tainted almonds twice this decade caused outbreaks of food related illnesses .
USDA investigators were never able to determine how salmonella bacteria somehow contaminated the raw almonds that caused the food illnesses but they were able to trace back one of the contaminations , in part , to the country 's largest " factory farm , " growing almonds and pistachios on over 9000 acres .
Instead of insisting that giant growers reduce risky practices , the USDA invoked a rule that requires the gassing or steam - heating of California raw almonds in a way that many consumers have found unacceptable .
" For those of us who are interested in eating fresh and wholesome food the USDA 's plan , to protect the largest corporate agribusinesses against liability , amounts to the adulteration of our food supply , " said Jill Richardson , a consumer activist and blogger at : www.lavidalocavore.org
" This ruling is a financial disaster and has closed a major customer group that we have built up over the years , " said Dan Hyman , an almond grower and owner of D&S Ranches in Selma , CA .
His almond business relies on direct sales to consumers over the internet .
Hyman notes that his customers were never consulted by the USDA or the Almond Board before they were denied " a healthy whole natural raw food that they have eaten with confidence , enjoyment and benefit for decades .
"
The lawsuit contends that the USDA exceeded its authority , which is narrowly limited to regulating quality concerns in almonds such as dirt , appearance and mold .
And even if the USDA sought to regulate bacterial contamination , the questionable expansion of its authority demanded a full evidentiary hearing and a producer referendum , to garner public input  neither of which were undertaken by the USDA .
" The fact that almond growers were not permitted to fully participate in developing and approving this rule undermines its legitimacy , " said Ryan Miltner , the attorney representing the almond growers .
" Rather than raising the level of income for farmers and providing handlers with orderly marketing conditions , " added Miltner , " this particular regulation creates classes of economic winners and losers .
That type of discriminatory economic segregation is anathema to the intended purpose of the federal marketing order system .
" Retailers of raw almonds have also been expressing their unhappiness , based on feedback from their customers , with the raw almond treatment rule .
" We 've been distributing almonds grown by family farmers in California for over 30 years and we regard them as the common heritage of the American people , " said Dr. Jesse Schwartz , President of Living Tree Community Foods in Berkeley , CA .
" We can think of no reply more fitting than to affirm our faith that ultimately the wisdom and good sense of the American people will prevail in this lawsuit .
" Barth Anderson , Research & Development Coordinator for The Wedge , a Minneapolis - based grocery cooperative , noted that their mission has always been to support family farmers .
" We were n't surprised when Wedge shoppers and members wrote nearly 500 individual letters expressing disapproval of the USDA 's mandatory fumigation law for domestic almonds , " Anderson said .
" Our members especially did not like the idea that fumigated almonds could be called 'raw . '" According to the USDA , there is no requirement for retailers to alert consumers to the toxic , propylene oxide fumigation or steam treatment applied to raw almonds from California .
" This rule is killing the California Organic Almond business , " said Steve Koretoff , a plaintiff in the lawsuit and owner of Purity Organics located in Kerman , CA .
" Because foreign almonds do not have to be pasteurized their price is going up while our price is going down because of the rule .
It makes no sense . "
Koretoff added .
Two groups of consumers that have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the almond treatment rule are raw food enthusiasts and vegans .
These consumers may obtain as much as 30 % of their daily protein intake from raw almonds , after grinding them for flour and other uses .
Studies exploring nutritional impacts following fumigant and steam treatment have yet to be publicly released .
A Cornucopia Institute freedom of information request for the documents is awaiting a response from the USDA .
" We raw vegans believe raw foods , from non-animal sources , contains valuable nutrients  some not yet well - understood by scientists , " stated Joan Levin , a retired attorney living in Chicago .
" These nutrients can be destroyed by heat , radiation and toxic chemicals .
We support the continued availability of fresh produce free of industrial age tampering , " explained Levin.
Cornucopia 's Fantle noted that the Washington , D.C. federal district court has already assigned the almond lawsuit a case number , beginning its move through the judicial system .
" We believe this is a strong legal case and hope for a favorable decision in time to protect this year 's almond harvest , " Fantle said .

BBC News Magazine
People in many areas of the country struggle to get a newspaper delivered .
It 's the burning issue in the world of the newsagent - where did all the newspaper boys and girls go ?
Becoming a paper boy or girl is a rite of passage for many children .
Perhaps more than any other part - time job , it educates the young future worker about the importance of getting up in the morning , of punctuality , of steadfastness .
POSSIBLE FACTORS IN DECLINE
Rising pocket money Other job opportunities Concerns over safety Linked to tiredness in school New regulations
While the rest of childkind slumbers , lost in a dreamscape of gaudy electronics and instant gratification , the hardy paperboy ventures out into the gloaming so householders can have their news in time for breakfast .
But all is not well in the world of home news delivery .
The National Federation of Retail Newsagents represents thousands of shops across the country .
At its conference this week , one of the topics of conversation that is preoccupying members is a sad decline .
Newsagents ' pain Stefan Wojciechowski , head of news and magazines at the NFRN , says while no exact figures are available , it is estimated anything up to a third of all independent newsagents have given up home delivery in the past five to seven years .
There 's competition from supermarkets and convenience stores , people are commuting such distances that they leave the house before delivery is possible , and newspaper sales themselves are in long term decline .
It was horrible - the papers were heavy , it rained every day , it was cold and I wanted to sleep but could n't because I had to get up at 6.15
Sarah Pine
Ex-papergirl
But most of all an absence of paperboys is causing newsagents pain .
" Kids do n't want to do paper rounds because of increasing pocket money and other ways of earning money , " Mr Wojciechowski says .
Joe Kelly of Direct News , in Garston , south Liverpool , realised 18 months ago that morning newspaper deliveries would have to stop .
" We just could n't get the paperboys .
We used to have a book full of names .
We used to do 10 paperboys but it was gradually dropping off .
Basically , they seem to have got too much cash .
The majority seem to have unlimited funds from mum and dad . "
Deliverers of news were typically 14 or 15 and could earn £ 10 a week for 20 - 25 minutes work per day .
But no more .
And like the decline of the village post office , there are consequences wider than just people not being able to do the crossword while eating their egg and soldiers .
Young people have been delivering the news since time immemorial Kelly has lost 50 copies a day in sales , but he worries about the loss of community glue that the decline of the paperboy represents .
" Some of the elderly people we deliver to , they form a relationship with the paperboy .
On a couple of occasions the paperboy has come back and said there 's a problem at this house .
It is a lifeline for some . "
Brass in pocket
But is it rising pocket money that is causing the paperboy to stay a - bed ?
The paperboy is an institution in other countries A Halifax survey of pocket money certainly seems to indicate that it has risen much faster than inflation .
Between 1998 and 2004 , pocket money rose more than fourfold , from £ 1.76 to a whopping £ 7.82 a week , although it has now stabilised at about the £ 8 mark .
According to the same survey , in 2007 19 % of working seven- to 16 - year - olds had paper rounds , compared with 35 % in 2004 .
It 's clear that there could be other factors at play - others sources of part - time work and parental concern about early starts and safety .
But those who do get up so early in the morning get to see a unique world .
Their comrades are milkmen - suffering their own decline - early bird shop owners , sundry binmen and recycling crews .
There are downsides .
It can be decidedly chilly at six in the morning even in high summer .
Paperboys learn to hate the one far - flung address on the route , the house with the mad Jack Russell , and the infuriating owners of original Victorian doors with original tiny Victorian letterboxes , through which a meaty Sunday newspaper will not pass .
Bridging gap
And paperboys gain an entry into the world of work .
Walking or cycling provides exercise , but the process of fine - tuning the round is even more valuable .
The paperboy learns to maximise his efficiency and map out the most ergonomic route because the incentive of getting back indoors is so strong .
WORLD'S GREATEST PAPERBOY ?
Warren Buffett had several rounds
By 14 had raised enough to buy farmland in Nebraska Now thought world 's richest man " It is a very good way of bridging the gap between school and work , " says Mr Wojciechowski .
The big newspaper groups have already seen the danger of the decline of the paperboy .
The Times offers to organise delivery for customers , passing their order on to a newsagent .
It 's also experimenting in London - where the ratio of delivering newsagents to people is the lowest in the country - with doing the delivery itself .
" People who get copies home delivered read the paper more and stay with us longer , " says David Walker , head of fulfilment at the Times .
" We realise there is still a massive demand from readers .
It 's up to us to make it as easy as possible . "
Of the 14,000 delivering newsagents in Scotland , England and Wales , only 7,000 are actively seeking new business .
The other 7,000 are contemplating getting out of the home delivery business .
There are already areas of cities where it is a struggle to get a paper delivered and this will worsen .
The future might be " roundsmen " , Mr Wojciechowski says .
" Successful , sustainable home news delivery will probably be using vans and adults covering a much wider area . "
Rain , cold Sarah Pine , 15 , is one of those who has tried paper delivery and decided it 's not the ideal job for her .
At the beginning of last summer she started a round in Orpington on the outskirts of London .
" I was really lucky because I had a short round and because my house was in the middle of the round , " she says .
" My sister had another round .
Her round went very far away . "
But after six months , Sarah realised that the £ 15 a week wages were no compensation for the negative aspect of delivering the news .
" It was horrible .
The papers were heavy , it rained every day , it was cold and I wanted to sleep but could n't because I had to get up at 6.15 .
My hands were really cold .
If it was raining you could n't have an umbrella - you needed your hands to do the papers . "
Now early starts are solely due to GCSE revision and Sarah - who receives £ 17.50 pocket money a week - is no longer tired in school , but the paper round did offer one social advantage .
" I liked the fact I could say I worked for my money rather than being seen as spoilt . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
I used to love my paper round , rain or shine I 'd be out on my BMX delivering .
I remember the sunday loads that were massive compared with the weekly loads .
I remember one morning my wet hair frosted over because of the cold , as well as the spiderwebs that would always get you in the face in the spring time .
I think mostly it taught me that I could earn my own money and gain a small amount of independence at an early age ; that was important to me then .
Peter , Warrington , UK
Why do people seem to think that kids would enjoy a physically demanding , low - paid job any more than an adult would ?
My brother and I used to deliver the local free paper .
Every Thursday we spent about two hours delivering to two streets for a total of £ 6 between the two of us .
It taught me the value of money and the value of hard work - I realised the work I was doing was worth more than they were paying me so I quit .
Steve , Peterborough , UK I worked as a paper delivery girl for three years from 1966 to 1969 , in those days the papers did not have so many supplements .
I sympathise with modern day delivery boys / girls as the newspapers are so heavy and contain so much rubbish .
Sue Beale , Ipswich Between 12 - 16 I delivered early morning papers in my hometown of Southport and relished the responsiblity and independence it bestowed .
My three older brothers had all delivered the same paper round as me as well as afternoon local paper rounds .
All four of us are now hardworking , successful professionals grown from the acorn of the morning deliveries .
What goes a( paper ) round comes around .
Louise Coward , Leeds , UK
In this day and age parents are afraid to allow their children out so early in a morning or in the dark evenings due to the ever increasing violence that we are witnessing , especially in remote areas or streets known to have a history of yob culture .
It is a great pity because it gives children a sense of independence and also exercise which is sadly lacking in our TV .
and computer - besotted era .
E Whitham , UK
For two years , I did two paper - rounds a day , which took upto an hour .
On average , I had to deliver 30 papers which were quite spread out .
Day in day out , I had to deliver , even in torrential conditions .
What I hated most was having to deliver in a rough area , where older boys would kick my bike as I propped it against a wall to deliver papers .
Overall , I earned around £ 60 a month for delivering a grand total of 720 papers .
That works out around 8 pence per paper .
And considering the job must be done in all weather conditions and rough areas , it 's no wonder there 's less papergirls / paperboys .
Nicholas Hatter , Bristol About six years ago , when I was 13 , I worked for a newsagent doing a paper round .
I enjoyed being able to work for my money and it was only at the weekends so I wasnt tired for school .
But a lot of the time I had to do 3 or 4 rounds each morning as other kids stopped turning up .
Then the newsagent decided to stop delivering so I moved to another shop .
They paid OK .
20 p per newspaper delivered which worked out at about £ 20 - £ 30 per week .
But it did include early mornings every morning .
When I was that age , pocket money was minimal and I can see now that kids get a lot more .
I think that parents are giving their kids more money so that they dont have to go out and work as many parents are worried about the safety of their child .
I feel sad that this is the case as doing paper rounds gave me a good start in learning how to earn money and gave me independence .
Claire Haynes , Malvern , Worcestershire I did a paper round and they were scarce .
Getting a round that paid well often spilled over into politics of the playground .
But , it was bloody awful work and I certainly would n't wish it on my kids .
Early mornings , heavy ( and long ) Sundays ( and this was before supplements ) .
The newsagent paid a pittance and would n't think twice about handing the round on if you could n't make it for a few days because of illness .
Less to do with pocket money and more to do with awareness .
Kids now would n't get out of bed for it .
And I for one do n't blame them .
Paul , Windsor
Our paperboy is wonderful , come rain or shine , I always make sure I give a good tip at Christmas , but the way some of my neighbours moan if he is late with the paper , is dreadful .
Also we are lucky we live in a built up area so he is safe , but would worry if he had to go into blocks of flats or dark areas in the winter for his safety .
H , Surrey I used to have a paper round through the local estates , it was afterschool however would take me an hour a day , which when you times that by the 5 day week was only £ 2 an hour .
Even a 15 - year - old can see that it 's not worth the money .
Expecting children to carry that number of newspapers on a daily basis is terrible .
I done it for the summer but stopped as soon as it started raining , just was n't worth it .
Duncan G , Reading
The experience of Sarah Pine sums up why kids would n't do it .
These young workers realise that if they do n't study at school they 'll end up in similar menial jobs for the rest of their lives .
Maybe they should make it compulsory as it may show some more that lessons and homework are n't that bad .
Jack , Surrey I had a paper round which went to the other side of the town I lived in , sure it was n't fun in winter or the rain , but you appreciated your money ( £ 9 / week ) .
To hear that the average wage is only £ 10 / week 16 years later is a bit sad .
Even paperboys and girls need to be compensated for inflation .
David , Letham , Angus , Scotland £ 10 per week ?
That 's more than I earn here in India .
Send me a visa you guys in the UK and I will do the paper delivering for you there .
Ravi , Chennai , India
My son has stuck with his paper round for 3 1 / 2 years now , he delivers evening papers 6 nights a week .
It 's good exercise for him and he likes having the money .
The reason why children taking up the job is in decline is obvious in my mind .
They are simply not paid enough .
He works six nights per week , the round takes an hour and he gets £ 10 per week .
If he misses one day , he doesnt get his full week " bonus " so only collects £ 7.50 .
I 'm surprised he 's stuck it so long and if this is the sort of monies other children are being offered , it 's little wonder the agents are stuggling to find deliverers .
Pay them a decent wage - its hard , back breaking work .

As a first step toward serving as an Internet " launchpad , " AOL now lets users view Yahoo Mail , Gmail , and Hotmail from AOL.com .
Then , over the next two months , the company intends to " open up " to additional third - party content and services .
AOL.com is finally letting down the walls of its proverbial " garden " a bit , moving more in the direction of an Internet portal or starting point -- first by giving access to external e-mail services , and next with links to outside social networks and other non-AOL content .
AOL 's new e-mail " aggregation " service , which is already up , lets subscribers to AOL 's free and paid mail services preview and access mail from Yahoo , Google 's Gmail , and Microsoft 's Hotmail from AOL.com .
Advertisement
" We need to embrace the reality that you visit other sites and become more of a launch pad to your other online experiences , " admitted AOL 's Sanjay Nayar in a blog post yesterday .
" We realize that AOL.com is not the only Web site that you use and that you may , like many of us , have multiple e-mail accounts with different providers .
Why should n't you be able to preview all your e-mail in one place ? "
The links to Yahoo Mail and Gmail are self - evident on the home page .
There is n't a link to Hotmail , although Hotmail can be viewed .
The newly redesigned front page of AOL.com on 9/10/2008 , complete with links to mail other than AOL's
" Microsoft does not provide us the ability for you to access your account via AOL.com , " Nayar said .
" If you want to access the Hotmail preview panel , you 'll have to swap it out with one of the ones already there by clicking on the arrow in the corner .
Keeping that in mind , we 've done what we can for our Hotmail users and provided a link to Hotmail .
Hopefully that will make it a little easier to access your account from AOL.com .
If interested , feel free to send Microsoft some feedback to let them know you 'd like to be able to do this on AOL . "
Users can also replace the e-mail previews with other options such as eBay , TMZ , Music , and Radio , according to Nayar .
Some of those options , though , link to other AOL properties , such as TMZ .
Likewise , a new " extended navigation bar " will also link to other AOL entities -- including TMZ , StyleList , and ParentDish , for example .
But over the next eight weeks , AOL.com will " [ open ] up to third - party content and services for the first time , " according to a statement released by the company this week .
Forthcoming additions will include a " keyhole " view for managing multiple social networking feeds from a single location , a customizable RSS feed reader , and " the ability to link to any Web page . "
Meanwhile , Yahoo -- in second place to Google in the Internet search engine / ad race , but ahead of Microsoft and AOL -- has also been making more of a portal play -- not through its mail service , but through Yahoo - owned " starting points " such as Buzz and Shine .
" Our goal is to grow visits to key Yahoo starting points and properties , where users enter the Internet , by 15 % per year over the next several years , " said Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang , in a letter to shareholders last February .
John McCain said ' Raising taxes in a tough economy is n't patriotic . '
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
When you graduate 894th out of a class of 899 , eventually it will show up .
And John McCain 's mediocre performance at the Naval Academy is showing up big time this week in his total lack of understanding of the nation 's financial crisis .
He told us he did n't know much about the economy … now he 's proving it .
So much so that the Wall Street Journal , perhaps America 's leading financial publication , is blasting McCain over what its editorial board sees as inaccurate and , " unpresidential " comments about the crisis in America 's financial system .
If you 're a Republican running for president of the United States and the Wall Street Journal basically says you 're an incompetent buffoon , you 're in serious trouble .
Specifically the paper pointed to comments McCain made yesterday about SEC Chair Christopher Cox .
McCain pointed the finger at Cox and said if he were president , he 'd fire him for " betraying the public 's trust . "
The Wall Street Journal called that assault " both false and deeply unfair . "
The Journal also said , " In a crisis voters want steady , calm leadership … not easy , misleading answers that will do nothing to help . "
Here ’s my question to you :
What does it mean when the Wall Street Journal slams Mcain on the economy ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Bob writes :
I do n't think so .
I 'm not going to panic .
I think the worst thing a voter can do right now is vote the financial crisis .
Right now I 'm going to vote the future not the present .
I hope that makes sense .
Michael from Bedford , New York writes :
In 2004 , when Bush ran against Kerry , he always made a special point of celebrating new home ownership .
Being a realtor at that time I saw the " NINJA " loans ( no income , no job , no assets ) being given and I wondered how the inevitable failures would be spun .
Yesterday I saw .
McCain who has always been against strong government oversight for the lending business has changed his mind and is railing against the greed .
What a clown !
Alexia from Seattle , Washington writes :
McCain does n't know how many houses he owns .
He would n't know a financial crisis if it hit him in the face .
Trump endorsed him , which makes complete sense because what they have in common is neither knows how many houses they own .
Because of the financial crisis , I could n't buy a house right now if my life depended on it .
Bob writes :
No , it will not change my vote .
I 'm voting " third party . "
Both McCain and Obama are a part of the problem and my vote means too much to me to give to either of them .
Nor do I intend to vote for any incumbents .
At some point we need to clean the rascals out .
Shannon writes :
No , the financial crisis has made me more sure of my vote for Obama .
And just for the record I am a 54 year - old , white female , from south Alabama who has voted Republican since my 18th birthday .
Thank God I have finally seen the light .
Mark from Pennsylvania writes :
Yes , I now want to vote for Obama twice .
Marty writes :
It means that traditional Republican organizations are trying to separate themselves from McCain just as McCain is trying to separate himself from Bush .
The only question that leaves is " why ? "
My guess is because they are smart enough to look down the tracks and see the train wreck coming .
Marjorie from New York writes :
I will get back to you , Jack , after I am done jumping up and down .
The Wall Street Journal , and then Obama looking so presidential today at the presser .
I cannot stop screaming for joy .
McCain ’s goose is so cooked .
Tiffany writes :
It means the Wall Street Journal is sick of McCain 's off - the - cuff , meaningless remarks .
McCain has no ideas of his own .
He hijacked Obama 's change theme , now he 's trying to hijack his economic plan .
His slogan should be " what Obama said " .
Joe from St. Petersburg , Florida writes :
It means someone 's mask is coming off over a month before Halloween , instead of a few hours after Halloween .
Thanks to the Wall Street Journal for ringing some bells which hopefully will wake up many voters before November 4 , 2008 !
John from Fort Collins , Colorado writes :
When the conservative WSJ takes a Republican presidential candidate to the woodshed over his economic comments , he has to be mired pretty deep in the mud .
It is unbelievable that any candidate running for president of the United States could be this ill - informed or this poorly - advised .
Jan writes :
That they are not going to be referred to as " My Friends " anytime soon .
Lucky them .
Comrade Bernanke Does it Again Peter Schiff
Posted Sep 18 , 2008
By nationalizing nearly 80 % of AIG for $ 85 billion , the Fed is doing a lot more than simply flushing taxpayer money down the toilet .
The greater wrong is allowing the agency that has the power to print money to take control of a private enterprise , especially without the approval of the company 's shareholders .
The move represents the largest lurch toward socialism that this country has ever seen , and signals the end of the vibrancy of America 's once vaunted free market economy .
Since there is no limit to the amount of money the Fed can create , there is no limit to the number of assets they can acquire .
The " line in the sand " that the Government seemed to draw by refusing to bail out Lehman Brothers was erased in just two days by the very next wave of financial panic .
While Fannie and Freddie were arguably quasi - government agencies that deserved special protection , no such status exists with AIG .
Where does the Fed get the authority to use the money it prints to take over private companies ?
Congress never gave such authority and , even if it had , it would be unconstitutional , as Congress itself has no such authority to delegate .
What about the shareholders ?
Why did n't they get to vote on this acquisition ?
Whatever happened to private property rights ?
Where does this stop ?
What other troubled companies will the Fed nationalize , and how much will it cost ?
Why stop at troubled companies ?
If the Fed can buy into a sick company , why not a healthy one ?
Now that we have allowed the Fed to take over any asset it wants , private property rights are meaningless .
When oil prices get really high , why bother with a windfall profits tax when the Fed can simply nationalize Exxon - Mobil with a few cranks on its printing press .
Who needs Bolsheviks when you have the Fed ?
AIG is not a bank ; it is not even an investment bank .
The " lender of last resort " power was supposed to apply only to banks , to prevent runs .
It was not meant to apply to any company that had been declared " too big to fail " .
I suppose the Fed is trying to get around some of the more obvious illegalities by having the new AIG shares issued on behalf of the Treasury .
What happened to the concept of an independent Fed ?
Here you have the Fed seizing a private company and ceding control to the U.S. Treasury .
Rather then acting independently , the Fed and the Government are merely partners in crime .
On the economic side , the Fed expects us to believe this is a smart investment .
Does anyone really think that officials at the Fed and Treasury are suddenly private equity experts ?
These are the guys who missed both the tech and housing bubbles , and who assured us that subprime problems were contained .
I would not trust them to run a lemonade stand , let alone one of the largest insurance companies in the world .
The idea that this bailout was necessary given that the alternative would be worse should by now be fully discredited .
All of today 's financial problems are the direct consequence of Fed policy that was designed to weaken the recession that followed the bursting of the tech bubble and the shock of September 11th .
Of course , the tech bubble itself resulted from the Fed 's actions to sooth the pain following the collapse of LTCM , the Russian debt default , the Asian crisis , and Y2K .
I suppose the precedent for all of these actions was established back in 1979 when the government guaranteed Chrysler 's debt .

Comcast has just released a series of documents in response to the Federal Communications Commission detailing how , exactly , the ISP filters your traffic .
Based on their traffic analysis , five protocols ( Ares , BitTorrent , eDonkey , FastTrack and Gnutella ) were especially filtered .
Not anymore .
Now Comcast is going to be throttling ALL traffic you generate , even if it's from their own Fancast streaming video service , if you 're generating abnormally high traffic compared to your peers .
On the bright side , it 's good that your torrents are n't getting slowed down , but on the other hand , " legal " applications like Netflix or Amazon will be affected as well .
This probably wo n't be a big deal to all that many of you , as Comcast says the throttling only occurs during periods of congestion , and in total will only impact 1 % of users .
( It 's likely that many Giz readers are in that 1 % of bandwidth hogs though . )
In any case , you 'll still have to watch out that you do n't run over the 250 GB monthly cap , or else your net will become disconnected entirely .
FAQ below :
Why does Comcast manage its network ?
Comcast manages its network with one goal : to deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers .
High - speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited .
Managing the network is essential to promote the use and enjoyment of the Internet by all of our customers .
We use reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards .
We also try to use tools and technologies that are minimally intrusive .
Just as the Internet continues to change and evolve , so too , will our network management practices to address the challenges and threats on the Internet .
All Internet service providers need to manage their networks and Comcast is no different .
In fact , many of them use the same or similar tools that Comcast does .
If we did n't manage our network , our customers would be subject to the negative effects of spam , viruses , security attacks , network congestion , and other risks and degradations of the service .
By engaging in reasonable and responsible network management , Comcast can deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers .
How does Comcast manage its network ?
Comcast uses various tools and techniques to manage its network , deliver the Service , and ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy and the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services available at http://www.comcast.net/terms/subscriber/.
These tools and techniques are dynamic , like the network and its usage , and can and do change frequently .
For example , these network management activities may include identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer e-mail accounts , detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content and using other tools and techniques that Comcast may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers .
Does network management change over time ?
Yes .
The Internet is highly dynamic .
As the Internet and related technologies continue to evolve and advance , Comcast 's network management tools will evolve and keep pace so that we can deliver an excellent , reliable , and safe online experience to all of our customers .
In March 2008 , Comcast announced that it will migrate to a new network congestion management technique before the end of the year .
( See more FAQs about that in this section . )
How will the new technique work ?
The new network congestion management practice works as follows :
If a certain area of the network nears a state of congestion , the technique will ensure that all customers have a fair share of access to the network .
It will identify which customer accounts are using the greatest amounts of bandwidth and their Internet traffic will be temporarily managed until the period of congestion passes .
Customers will still be able to do anything they want to online , and many activities will be unaffected , but they could experience things like : longer times to download or upload files , surfing the Web may seem somewhat slower , or playing games online may seem somewhat sluggish .
The new technique does not manage congestion based on the online activities , protocols or applications a customer uses , rather it only focuses on the heaviest users in real time , so the periods of congestion could be very fleeting and sporadic .
It is important to note that the effect of this technique is temporary and it has nothing to do with aggregate monthly data usage .
Rather , it is dynamic and based on prevailing network conditions as well as very recent data usage .
Will the technique target P2P or other applications , or make decisions about the content of my traffic ?
No .
The new technique is " protocol - agnostic , " which means that the system does not manage congestion based on the applications being used by customers .
It is content neutral , so it does not depend on the type of content that is generating traffic congestion .
Said another way , customer traffic is congestion - managed not based on their applications , but based on current network conditions and recent bytes transferred by users .
How does the new network management technique impact me and my use of the Comcast High Speed Internet service ?
With this new technique , most customers will notice no change in their Internet experience .
The goal of congestion management is to enable all users to have access to a fair share of the network at peak times , when congestion occasionally occurs .
Congestion management focuses on the consumption activity of individual customer accounts that are using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth .
As a result , and based on our technical trials of this technique , we expect that the large majority of customers will not be affected by it .
In fact , based on consumer data collected from these trials , we found that on average less than 1 % of our high - speed Internet customers are affected by the approach .
How often does Comcast expect to use this technique ?
Based on market trials to date , Comcast expects that select portions of the network will be in a congested state only for relatively small portions of the day , if at all .
During these trials , Comcast did not receive a single customer complaint that could be traced to this new congestion management practice , despite having publicized the trials and notifying customers involved in the trials via e-mail .
Comcast will continue to monitor how user traffic is affected by these new congestion management techniques and will make the adjustments reasonably necessary to ensure that our Comcast High - Speed Internet customers have a high - quality online experience .
Can you give me some " real world " examples of how much bandwidth consumption would be considered too much ?
For example , how many movies would I have to download to be affected by this new technique ?
Since the technique is dynamic and works in real time , the answer really depends on a number of factors including overall usage , time of day and the number of applications a customer might be running at the same time .
First , the local network must be approaching a congested state for our new technique to even look for traffic to manage .
Assuming that is the case , customers ' accounts must exceed a certain percentage of their upstream or downstream ( both currently set at 70 % ) bandwidth for longer than a certain period of time , currently set at fifteen minutes .
A significant amount of normal Internet usage by our customers does not last that long .
For example , most downloads would have completed within that time , and the majority of streaming and downloading will not exceed the threshold to be eligible for congestion management .
And the majority of longer - running applications , such as VoIP , video conferencing , and streaming video content ( including HD streaming on most sites ) will not exceed these thresholds either .
The point of the technique is to deliver the best overall online experience possible .
The technique should help ensure that all customers get their fair share of bandwidth resources to enjoy all that the Internet has to offer and that includes surfing the web , reading emails , downloading movies , watching streaming video , gaming or listening to music .
How will customers know they are being managed ?
We are exploring ways to create new tools that will let customers know when the management is occurring .
In the short term , our efforts are focused on transitioning to the new technique as soon as possible .
We believe this sort of congestion notification should be an Internet standard and have been discussing this issue in technical bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force .
We believe the use of Internet Standards for such a real - time notification is important as applications developers can write for networks beyond the Comcast network .
However we are planning to develop a capability that may enable a customer to see if they were managed in the past , though this is not yet ready for testing .
Does this technique apply to both Commercial and Residential services ?
Yes .
How is this announcement related to the recent 250 GB monthly usage threshold ?
The two are completely separate and distinct .
The new congestion management technique is based on real - time Internet activity .
The goal is to avoid congestion on our network that is being caused by the heaviest users .
The technique is different from the recent announcement that 250 GB / month is the aggregate monthly usage threshold that defines excessive use .
Is Comcast Digital Voice affected by this technique ?
What about other VoIP providers ?
Comcast Digital Voice is a separate facilities - based IP phone service that is not affected by this technique .
Comcast customers who use VoIP providers that rely on delivering calls over the public Internet who are also using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth during a period when this network management technique goes into effect may experience a degradation of their call quality at times of network congestion .
It is important to note , however , that VoIP calling in and of itself does not use a significant amount of bandwidth .
Furthermore , our real - world testing of this technique did not indicate any significant change in the quality of VoIP calls , even for managed customer traffic during periods of congestion .
What about Fancast.com and streaming video or video downloads ?
What will happen to them ?
During periods of congestion , any customers who are using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth – no matter what type or content of the online activity ( for example , it does not matter if the content is coming from a Comcast owned site like Fancast.com or not ) – may be affected by this technique .
Our technique also has no ability to determine the applications or protocols being used or the content , source or destination .
Does Comcast block peer - to - peer ( " P2P " ) traffic or applications like BitTorrent , Gnutella , or others ?
No. Today , Comcast does not block P2P traffic or applications like BitTorrent , Gnutella , or others as part of its current network congestion management technique .
It is important to note , however , that the current network congestion technique , which will be replaced by the end of 2008 , may on a limited basis temporarily delay certain P2P traffic when that traffic has , or is projected to have , an adverse effect on other customers ' use of the service .
We do this because , in certain situations , that type of traffic consumes a disproportionately large amount of network resources .
Does Comcast discriminate against particular types of online content ?
No .
Comcast provides its customers with full access to all the content , services , and applications that the Internet has to offer .
However , we are committed to protecting customers from spam , phishing , and other unwanted or harmful online content and activities .
Comcast uses industry standard tools and generally accepted best practices and policies to help it meet this customer commitment .
In cases where these tools and policies identify certain online content as harmful and unwanted , such as spam or phishing Web sites , this content is usually prevented from reaching customers .
In other cases , these tools and policies may permit customers to identify certain content that is not clearly harmful or unwanted , such as bulk e-mails or Web sites with questionable security ratings , and enable those customers to inspect the content further if they want to do so .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - With a firm rejection of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , the House Republicans have told the financial markets that they 'll have to solve their problems on their own , without $ 700 billion of taxpayer money .
In a stunning vote on Monday , the House rejected the financial rescue package on a vote of 205 to 228 .
Republicans voted against the bill by a two - to - one ratio , and in the process rejected their own leadership , who had worked for nearly a week to craft a bill that could gain a majority .
Nearly 100 Democrats also voted against the bill , spurning their leadership .
Many Republicans in the House were never persuaded that the credit crunch in the financial system is an impending disaster deserving of taxpayer aid .
Politicians who had cut their teeth on free - market principles could n't accept the idea that the federal government should back up the banks who had foolishly bet everything on the housing bubble .
Or they did n't want to face the voters in six weeks and explain why a Republican would vote for the biggest government bailout ever .
Now we shall see if Paulson and Bernanke were right when they said the credit crisis could worsen and inflict dire consequences on the global economy .
Or perhaps the plan 's many critics were right in saying that credit markets and home prices can adjust on their own , once the promise of free money is withdrawn .
The leaders in Congress and in the administration will undoubtedly try again , hoping to write a compromise bill that can attract a majority .
But that wo n't be easy , because the Paulson plan had significant opposition from backbenchers on both the Republican right and the Democratic left .
Rejection of the plan means there 's no political solution to this financial crisis on the horizon .
As it now stands , the markets are on their own .
The next six weeks will tell whether the coup d'etat in the House on Monday has created a political crisis to match the financial one .
-- Rex Nutting , Washington bureau chief
As the global reel under the escalating pressures of the financial market turmoil , the world 's leading central banks launched a joint emergency action to boost dollar liquidity .
Others took individual measures to calm the edgy markets .
Thursday , the US Federal Reserve along with the Bank of Japan , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Bank of Canada , and the Swiss National Bank announced joint efforts to deal with the sustained elevated pressures in U.S. dollar short - term funding markets .
The Fed provided an extra $ 180 billion to the other central banks involved via its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements or swap lines , valid through January 30 , 2009 .
This increased capacity is intended to provide dollar funding for both term and overnight liquidity operations by the other central banks .
The central banks said the latest efforts together with actions taken by individual central banks over the last few days are intended to improve the liquidity conditions in the global financial markets .
They will continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures , the central banks said .
The Fed revealed that it is raising existing provisions in the swap lines with the ECB and the SNB .
The provision of U.S. dollar liquidity for ECB will be increased by $ 55 billion , totaling up to $ 110 billion , while for the SNB , the funds supplied will be up to $ 27 billion , an increase of $ 15 billion .
In reaction to the joint announcement by the world central banks , the cost of borrowing funds dropped to 3.84 % from 5.03 % yesterday , in the interbank lending market .
The actions are in response to the crisis at U.S. financial firms , which took excessive bets on mortgage - backed investments resulting in the write off of billions of dollars of assets .
On Monday , the troubled U. S. investment bank Lehman Brothers revealed that it is filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection .
Also , Bank of America said it agreed to acquire the investment bank Merrill Lynch in a quickly - negotiated $ 50 - billion transaction .
Late Tuesday , the U.S. government stepped in to save insurer AIG from sinking .
The Fed extended an $ 85 billion loan , essentially nationalizing the firm .
The ECB added an overnight maturity to its operations to supply US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties , which will be conducted under a variable rate tender procedure .
Additionally , the central bank also increased the funds offered in the Term Auction Facility operations .
The Fed will provide up to US $ 40 billion under the swap line .
For the Term Auction Facility operations , the ECB increased the amount of US dollar liquidity provided to the counterparties of the Eurosystem to US $ 25 billion for the 28 - days maturity operations , and to US $ 15 billion for the 84 - days maturity operations .
Overall , the dollar funding operations conducted by the Eurosystem could reach an outstanding amount of US $ 110 billion , compared to the current US $ 50 billion , the ECB said .
On Thursday , the ECB allotted $ 40 billion at a marginal rate of 4 % .
The total number of bidders were 61 and the total bid amount was $ 101.675 billion .
Additionally , the central bank alloted EUR25 billion in one - day money at a marginal rate of 4.3 % .
The SNB said it will now hold US dollar repo auctions with a term of 1 day ( overnight ) on a daily basis for an amount of up to US $ 10 billion .
Further , the SNB will also increase the volume of the previous auctions with a term of 28 days to US $ 8 billion and for auctions with a term of 84 days to US$ 9 billion from US $ 6 billion each .
The Swiss central bank said these auctions will be held once every two weeks on an alternating basis as before .
The maximum total amount outstanding for all terms is now stands at US $ 27 billion , as compared to the previous US $ 12 billion .
Taking the market situation into account , the Swiss central bank said it intends to make US dollar liquidity available for as long as it considers this to be necessary .
In Switzerland , the banks bid just $ 10.17 billion for the offered amount of $ 10 billion .
Later in the day , the SNB said it is continuing its generous and flexible provision of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market , while announcing its decision to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 2.75 % .
Further , the Fed announced new swap facilities with the Japanese , British and Canadian central banks .
Accordingly , these facilities will support the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of up to $ 60 billion by the Bank of Japan , $ 40 billion by the Bank of England , and $ 10 billion by the Bank of Canada .
The BoJ announced that it has concluded a US $ 60 billion swap agreement with the U. S. Federal Reserve at an unscheduled monetary policy meeting to ensure smooth functioning of the money market and ensure stability in financial markets .
The Fed will supply funds under the agreement " appropriately in view of the prevailing market conditions " , the Japanese central bank said .
The central bank also said it decided to introduce U.S. dollar funds - supplying operations against pooled collateral to provide U.S. dollar funds to market participants in Japan .
Separately , the BoJ announced that the Policy Board decided to leave the uncollateralized overnight call rate unchanged at 0.5 % .
Policymakers had voted to leave the base rate unchanged at 0.50 % at the conclusion of its regular two - day monetary policy meeting a day earlier .
Earlier in the day , the BoJ had injected 2.5 trillion yen into financial markets .
The central bank has added a total of 8 trillion yen to the system this week to calm markets in the wake of worrying developments on the Wall Street .
The Bank of England decided to lend each day US dollar funds overnight against eligible collateral and offered $ 40 billion in a repo operation today , but the total bid amount came up to just $ 14.05 billion .
In a separate open market operation , the central bank allotted GBP66.21 billion .
Ever since the grim developments on the Wall Street shook the world financial markets at the start of the week , global central banks have stepped in with individual efforts to boost liquidity .
Central banks in Australia , Hong Kong , Norway and India reportedly pumped additional funds to their respective financial markets earlier in the day .
The Reserve Bank of Australia added A$ 3.02 billion to the financial system , after pumping A$ 4.285 billion yesterday .
In Russia , the government pledged a massive 500 billion roubles to ensure stability in financial markets on Thursday .
The Chinese government also announced certain policy moves to support markets .
Further , central banks in Taiwan and Indonesia announced policy rate changes this week amid the crisis in the financial markets .

My wife often rolls her eyes at me , because once I find a new hobby I latch onto it as though life depended on it .
The more arbitrary the nature of the hobby , the less she ’s impressed with it .
So imagine her immense delight when , a year ago , the only thing I would talk about with her was Linux .
From Ignorance to Bliss
Yes , Linux .
When I was in middle school and high school , Linux was a strange , inaccessible beast .
The kind of thing only the most dedicated computer nerds knew anything about .
Although I had seen it in action once , all I gathered from the experience was that Linux amounted to a lot of garbled text manipulated by dry command lines .
Furthermore , it did n’t run any useful programs .
I simply could n’t see the point in using it .
Many years later , I was clicking around Wikipedia one day and stumbled on a treasure - trove of articles on Linux .
To my surprise , I discovered that not only was Linux still around , it was thriving !
Next to the articles were beautiful pictures of clean desktops and full - featured applications .
This discovery left me in disbelief .
Was it true that Linux could be functional , user - friendly , even aesthetically pleasing ?
My gut reaction was that it was n’t possible .
Operating systems are complex animals , and they need constant tinkering and improvement by professionals to function .
They need commercial support and proprietary business models .
Sure , Windows had its issues , but could a bunch of unorganized programmers working in their free time really do better ?
Yet slowly I realized that everything I enjoyed most about my computer experience was now rooted in free and / or open - source software and services .
I was already taking Firefox for granted , using a free media player , constantly looking things up in Wikipedia , and making extensive use of Gmail , Reader , and other Google applications .
In fact , the only Microsoft product I still used with any regularity was the basic Windows XP operating system itself .
It was clear to me that all of these free and / or open - source products were outdoing their corporate , end - user - pays competition .
And if this could be true for web browsers , music and video players , CD / DVD burners , spreadsheets , etc. , then why not also for the operating system ?
The time had come to leave Microsoft behind for good .
How do I describe what it was like to switch to Linux ?
Do you remember those first few months after you switched from Internet Explorer to Firefox ?
It was only a web browser , but suddenly your entire world seemed to change .
Pop-ups , ads , spyware , harmful viruses , security risks of every variety : gone .
The program loaded mere seconds after you clicked on its icon , would perform tasks without delay , and rarely froze or “ encountered a problem and had to quit . ”
And tabbed browsing !
The world of web surfing had truly been revolutionized .
Linux is to Windows what Firefox is to Internet Explorer , and it is so even more intensely — in fact , by orders of magnitude .
Firefox gives Windows users some security for the web , but in Linux there are no known viruses or spyware programs , period .
I found a massive increase in the performance of my older machine after leaving XP ’s bloated frame behind .
My computer feels sleek , responsive , and much more streamlined .
( Start - up comparison times : XP , about three minutes ; Linux , about one minute . )
And then there is the wonderful , liberating feeling of using free , open - source software almost exclusively — including several of the applications that I enjoyed while in Windows .
And I ’m not the only one who feels this way .
The market loves Linux ; that is why it is thriving .
Linux as Example of Market Decentralization
I admit that I am a helpless holistic thinker .
In my twisted view of the world , economics , ethics , theology , aesthetics , political philosophy , relationships , hobbies , etc. all converge in various places and share foundational truths .
The result is that I often cause others to raise an eyebrow as I make comparisons .
Yet I ca n’t help but draw a few libertarian observations from my experience with Linux , including the free and open - source software communities at large .
Linux serves as a marvelous example of market processes in action : human beings with harmonious goals helping each other reach them .
It has been developed through decentralized collaboration by programmers from around the world .
In Leonard Read ’s great essay , I , Pencil , there may not be a single person who knows how to build the pencil , but there can be a single visionary who brings it about .
The entrepreneur coordinates the efforts of his workers , raw material providers , and factory equipment .
Open source software has taken this one step further : who could have guessed that a project with no central planner in any meaningful sense could have had such powerful results ?
Yet here it is , at once the product of thousands of hands , and still unified .
The Linux community embodies a fantastic spirit of voluntary association , which should be cited more often by libertarians as an example of how cooperation benefits everyone .
Anti-capitalist interlocutors often make the assumption that libertarians would actually prefer a world chalk - full of toll booths and pay - as - you - go schemes for things that are currently free !
( This kind of twisted thinking led to one Microsoft official labeling Linux as a kind of “ communism . ”
Fortunately , these remarks have been thoroughly debunked elsewhere — Linux is capitalist ! )
There is no greater betrayal of libertarian values than intruding on voluntary interaction and foisting some other ideal onto innocent victims .
The free software community is constituted by countless developers sacrificing millions of collective hours in service of others .
What could be more libertarian than simply allowing them to continue such noble activity in peace ?
Everyone benefits .
Open Source and the Stateless Society
Linux may even serve as an example of how important projects will function in a post - state society .
All open - source software invariably uses geographically - spread efforts .
Contributors are connected because of common interests and goals , not through mere coincidence of location .
Over time , organizations — and especially those dealing in digital services — are going to become increasingly untethered by geography .
Were the State to dissolve , the importance and benefits of these arrangements would only become more apparent .
Open - source projects are a logical development of the division of labor .
In today ’s market , if I set out to run an efficient software company , I do not need to own suburban office space , an office network , meeting rooms , or even any colleagues living in the same country .
I need not even directly oversee their efforts or control the boundaries of what they may do .
The attempt to centralize these resources into a single geographical location and point of command can , in fact , dramatically limit my potential talent pool .
Recognizing the meaninglessness of political borders to human flourishing is an important step in societal development .
Open source projects unlock this mystery before our eyes and serve as examples of social cooperation that stretches beyond traditional boundaries .
Switching to Linux ( Closing Sentiments )
Linux is not for everyone , to be sure .
( At least , not yet . )
The most commonly asked question by those considering it is “ But will it run program X ? ”
The amount of software available for Linux systems is rather impressive , but not yet comprehensive .
Dedicated gamers and those who are using their computer for specialized professional applications often find that they cannot always do what they need to with Linux alone .
Yet the number of people who use at least one of their computers ( or laptops ) solely for word processing , e-mail , web browsing , and the occasional game grows by the day .
Unfortunately , most of these users have not considered the possibility of breaking away from Windows and the advantages to be had in an alternate operating system .
This is a tragedy , because there has never been a better time to make the switch .
For the vast majority of ordinary users , any one of the most popular distributions ( for example , Ubuntu , openSUSE , or MEPIS ) can change your home computing experience for the better .
For those willing to do just a little bit of research , it is very easy to find a distribution of Linux that suits exactly your needs .
There are distributions of every variety and in every major language in existence .
Several of them are even more user - friendly and easier to install and run than a base Windows package .
There is also , as I hope to have shown , an important ideological advantage in switching to Linux .
The benefits of free and open - source software are ripe for picking and exciting to explore .
Linux fosters an incredible community of helpful enthusiasts dedicated to enriching each other ’s computing experience .
It taps into the great and noble “ art for art ’s sake ” tradition of human endeavor .
Its developers do not profit from ( or justify aggression using ) invalid claims to intellectual property .
They do not use the State as their strong man to muscle out competitors .
They do not suffer from , as Microsoft and even Apple do , the insulation from market feedback that all massive , bureaucratic corporations incur .
It is one of the finest examples of beneficial social cooperation in our society .
My thanks to Robert Wicks and Manuel Lora for helpful feedback and ideas for this article .

The Best of Daniel Coleman
Roy Oswalt threw his second consecutive shutout yesterday .
In his last 32 1/3 innings , he ’s been scoreless .
Since the All - Star break , he has a 1.94 ERA in 10 starts .
He just farted into a bottle and it sold at a Sotheby ’s auction for $ 1.7 million .
The cure for the common cold is in Oswalt ’s passed wind !
Oswalt ’s one of the main reasons the Astros are late season contenders and all of this comes as the Cubs and Astros shutter their windows .
They ’ve been canceled for this Friday and Saturday with a good chance of Sunday being canceled too .
In H2H ( all leagues actually ) , you must fill - in your Cubs and Astros with guys that will be playing .
Also , I hope everyone who lives in the eye of the storm is safe .
Razzball sends a giant umbrella the size of Prince Fielder ’s backside your way .
Anyway , here ’s what else I saw yesterday in fantasy baseball :
Mark Ellis –
Out the rest of the season with a torn labrum .
This gives Eric Patterson a boost in value as he fills in for Ellis .
He has speed and he is a middle infielder , do you need to know more ?
Rhetorical !
Adrian Beltre – Debating whether to shut it down for the season to have surgery on his torn ligament in his thumb .
Guess he does n’t want to miss out on the race to a .400 winning percentage .
Francisco Liriano – Pitched a season - high eight innings at just the right time .
He should be up to speed for spring training next year and ready to put together a solid season .
I ’m sure he ’ll be on everyone ’s winter “ Players to Watch ” list .
He might be on my “ Players That Are On Everyone ’s ‘ Players to Watch ’ List And Have Suddenly Become Overpriced ” list .
B.J. Upton –
Might be used as pinch hitter this weekend , but he ’s not playing on Friday , according to Maddon ’08 .
George Sherrill – Will be back on Friday and thrust right into the closer ’s role .
If he ’s out there and you need saves , there ’s no reason not to grab him .
Brandon Morrow – 5 IP , 2 ER , while walking 4 .
Here was the erratic pitcher from the minors .
This is closer to what I would expect going forward , rather than the number he did on the Yankees last week .
Adrian Gonzalez – 2 HRs .
Wow , did he take two and a half months off or what ?
With these two home runs , he has 10 home runs since July 1st .
He had 10 home runs in May .
As Thigpen would say , “ Bleh ! ”
Josh Hamilton – Day - to - day with a bruised foot .
You really ca n’t complain .
You were getting high on his supply all summer .
Eugenio Velez – Another two hit night .
If you pick him up , it does n’t mean you endorse him .
You ’re just using him for a couple of days .
Maybe a week .
Matt Cain –
He took a dump sometime in August and it ’s been running down his leg ever since .
I would not be counting on him the rest of the way .
Rich Harden –
Got the win in the return as he was limited to 86 pitches .
His velocity was down ; his moxy was up .
If he can get through three more starts , consider yourself lucky .
Jair Jurrjens – 6 IP , 4 ER and 10 Ks .
The Ks are on the high side for him , but 6 IP with 3 to 4 earned runs is about what should be expected .
David Price – The Orioles are hinting he might start the September 23rd game .
Presumably , after doing the weather for The Early Show .
Francisco Rodriguez – Tied Bobby Thigpen ’s Major League record for saves .
Bobby Thigpen watched the record - tying save from his personalized booth at his local Outback Steakhouse .
When asked about what the record has meant to him , he said , “ Bleh ! ” When pressed he said , “ Bleh ! Bleh ! ”
When asked to elaborate , he burped .

Did Tom Clancy ’s “ lucky assertions ” foretell in 2001 the Georgia Conflict of 2008 and foretell in 2004 “ The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) of 2005 ? ”
We will analyze Clancy ’s seemingly “ clairvoyant ” references about the ongoing conflict in Georgia which include the following “ lucky assertions : ”
Civil unrest in Russia in August 2008 - Lucky guess ?
U.S. clandestine support of rebel factions in Georgia - Lucky guess ?
Specifically cites South Ossetia War in 2008 - Lucky guess ?
The U.S. clandestine forces “ Ghosts ” are deployed in Ossetia to silence the rebellion – Lucky guess ?
U.S. Ghosts battle South Ossetian rebel forces from the north of Georgia .
Russian government eventually sends in their army to aid the South Ossetian rebels – Lucky guess ?
The above events have come to fruition with precision as “ fore told ” by Tom Clancy .
Was each of the above just mere coincidences or a compilation of foreknowledge by Tom Clancy ?
You can see the “ The Ghost Recon Intro ” trailer at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtAwn1ATtcU.
There may in fact be more events which have yet to take place as this conflict in Georgia continues to unfold and how it may come to an end before more items of foreknowledge by Tom Clancy may be added to list above .
But there is more ….
In addition to Clancy ’s foreknowledge the conflict between Georgia and Russia as revealed in his 2001 “ Ghost Recon ” video game , Clancy was seemingly “ clairvoyant ” again in a subsequent video game release of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter ( GRAW ) .
This video game , “ GRAW , ” was originally to be released in 2004 , but it was delayed for undisclosed reasons with a new target release in 2005 according to Ubisoft ’s 2005 fiscal year publication listing “ GRAW ” on their release list for Xbox , PS2 , PC , Xbox 360 and scratched entirely for Gamecube http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/615/615158p1.html.
In short , the development of this game took place in 2004 or prior with its release dates delayed two different times once in 2004 and again in 2005 .
Clancy ’s plot in this video game , “ GRAW , ” commences Mexico City in 2014 as a U.S. spy plane carrying a device which disrupts wireless communications called “ Guardrail IX ” is shot down over Nicaragua .
U.S. Intelligence discovers a plot to transfer the device to rebels in Mexico City , and the Ghosts , U.S. clandestine units , are sent in to retrieve it .
However , the mission is aborted when a coup d’état takes place in Mexico City and the Ghosts are ordered to Mexico City immediately , where a summit involving the leaders of the United States : President Ballantine , Canada : Canadian Prime Minister ( unnamed ) , and Mexico : President Ruiz - Peña sign the North American Joint Security Agreement ( NAJSA ) described in the video trailer as a “ historic new policy designed to share the policing responsibilities along the borders of these three countries and hopefully curtail the illegal immigration and movement of drugs weapons and terrorists in the hemisphere as part of this historic agreement . ”
Trailer can be seen at www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrCXY__V0GA&feature=related.
This supposed fictional agreement , North American Joint Security Agreement ( NAJSA ) sounds cynically close to the non-fictional agreement “ The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) . ”
Ironically or not , “ The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) , ” which was predicated upon the writings of CFR members including Robert Pastor entitled “ Creating a North American Community , ” was agreed upon on March 23 , 2005 by the heads of government , Mexico ’s Vincente Fox , U.S. ’s George W. Bush , and Canada ’s Paul Martin launching the North American partnership ( AKA : North American Union ) at a meeting in Waco , Texas .
Presumably , no one other than insiders had knowledge of the this agreement requiring Judicial Watch , a conservative public - interest law firm , to go through the Freedom of Information Act in Sep 26 , 2006 to obtain the SPP documents ( http://www.judicialwatch.org/5979.shtml).
So , once again Tom Clancy got lucky in mirroring “ The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) ” during the developmental stages of this video game , “ GRAW ” in 2004 or earlier and months or may be an year prior to the actual consummation of the SPP agreement on March 23 , 2005 Mexico ’s Vincente Fox , U.S. ’s George W. Bush , and Canada ’s Paul Martin ?
Virtually two years or more before Judicial Watch obtained the documents in Sep 26 , 2006 ?
What odds would actuaries calculate on Tom Clancy “ lucky assertions ” in “ Ghost Recon ” 2001 video game about 1 ) the current conflict in Georgia seven ( 7 ) years prior to the actual event and 2 ) the mirroring of “ The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) ” with his supposed fictional agreement , North American Joint Security Agreement ( NAJSA ) close to one ( 1 ) year before the agreement took place and 3 ) two years or more before Judicial Watch obtained the documents in Sep 26 , 2006 ?
Tom Clancy ’s wife second wife Alexandra Marie Llewellyn ( 26 July 1999 – present ) is the niece of Colin Powell ; as of 2001 , Tom Clancy reportedly worth over USD $ 190 million http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002007/bio .

Whenever there is a systemic banking crisis there is a need to recapitalise the banking / financial system to avoid a destructive credit contraction .
But purchasing toxic / illiquid assets of the financial system is not the most effective and efficient way to do this .
Such government - led recapitalisation – via the use of public resources – can occur in a number of ways : by purchasing bad assets or loans ; an injection of preferred shares ; an injection of common shares ; a purchase of subordinated debt ; an issuance of bonds to be placed on the banks ' balance sheet ; an injection of cash ; credit lines extended to the banks and government assumption of government liabilities .
A recent IMF study ( pdf ) of 42 systemic banking crises across the world shows how different crises were resolved .
In only 32 of the 42 cases was there any government financial intervention of any sort ; in 10 cases systemic banking crises were resolved without any such action .
Of the 32 cases where the government did recapitalise the banking system , only seven included a programme of purchase of bad assets / loans ( like the one proposed by the US Treasury ) .
In 25 other cases there was no state purchase of such toxic assets .
Even in cases where bad assets were purchased – as in Chile – dividends were suspended and all profits and recoveries had to be used to repurchase the bad assets .
Of course , in most cases multiple forms of government recapitalisation of banks were used .
But government purchase of bad assets was the exception rather than the rule .
It was used only in Mexico , Japan , Bolivia , Czech Republic , Jamaica , Malaysia , and Paraguay .
Even in six of these seven cases , purchase of bad assets such recapitalisation was combined with such moves as government purchase of preferred shares or subordinated debt .
In the Scandinavian banking crises ( Sweden , Norway , Finland ) which are a model of how a banking crisis should be resolved , most of the recapitalisation occurred through various injections of public capital rather than a government purchase of bad assets .
Purchase of toxic assets – in most cases in which it was used – made the fiscal cost of the crisis much higher and expensive ( as in Japan and Mexico ) .
Thus the claim by the Fed and Treasury that spending $ 700bn of public money is the best way to recapitalise banks has absolutely no factual basis or justification .
It is a total rip - off that will mostly benefit – at a huge expense for the US taxpayer – the common and preferred shareholders and even the unsecured creditors of the banks .
Even the late addition of some conditions is a fig leaf of dubious value , as they are totally vague and fuzzy .
With $ 700bn of public cash the pockets of reckless bankers and investors have been made fatter under the fake argument that bailing out Wall Street was necessary to rescue Main Street from a severe recession .
The rescue could have been achieved with a cheaper and better use of public money .
Indeed , neither does the plan address the need to recapitalise those financial institutions .
This could have been done via public injections of preferred shares into these firms ; via required matching injections of tier one capital by current shareholders to make sure that such shareholders take first - tier loss ; via suspension of dividends payments or via a an unsecured debt - for - equity swap .
All these actions would have implied much lower fiscal costs , and they would have been cheaper and shared the burden of responsibility more equitably .
For example if the private sector had done its fair share , only $ 350bn of public money would have been required ; and of this $ 350bn , half could have taken the form of purchase of bad assets and the other half should have taken the form of injection of public capital in these financial institutions .
So instead of purchasing ( most likely at an excessive price ) $ 700 bn of toxic assets , the government could have achieved the same result , or better , by spending only $ 175bn in the direct purchase of toxic assets .
And even after the government bail - out , banks that have not yet provisioned for such losses and writedowns will be even more undercapitalised than before .
So this plan does not even achieve its basic objective .
The treasury plan also does not explicitly include an HOLC - style programme to reduce the debt burden of the distressed household sector .
Without such a component , the debt overhang of the household sector will continue to depress consumption spending and will exacerbate the current economic recession .
Thus , the treasury plan is a disgrace : a bail - out of reckless bankers , lenders and investors that provides little direct debt relief to borrowers and financially stressed households and that will come at a very high cost to the US taxpayer .
And the plan does nothing to resolve the severe stress in money markets and interbank markets that are now close to a systemic meltdown .
It is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented – many on the RGE Monitor Finance blog forum – alternative plans that were more fair and efficient .
This is again a case of privatising the gains and socialising the losses ; a bail - out and socialism for the rich , the well - connected and Wall Street .
And it is a scandal that even Congressional Democrats have fallen for this treasury scam that does little to help millions of distressed , debt - saddled home - owners .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Rumor has it that Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld recently wanted to turn off the firm 's signature Jumbotron , the giant panels that flash the Lehman name day and night at its headquarters in New York 's theater district .
Running the lights , the story goes , was costing Lehman ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) $ 500,000 a year .
But New York City rejected Fuld 's plea , since buildings in the Times Square area are required to keep their facades aglow to create the arcade effect that dazzles the tourists .
The lights are still on at Lehman HQ , but they 're going out both for the 158 - year old firm and for the Wall Street business model that it represents .
Now that Lehman has declared bankruptcy , and Bank of America is buying Merrill Lynch for $ 50 billion , the ranks of Wall Street survivors have shrunk in the space of six months from five to two , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
With Merrill , and Bear Stearns before it , being acquired by giant commercial banks , we 're witnessing the triumph of the diversified , universal banking model over the Wall Street one that focused on trading securities and advising corporate clients .
Eventually , the trend will probably capture Morgan Stanley and Goldman as well .
Even if they skirt the fate of their former peers , their time is past .
The demise of old Wall Street is n't just about bad bets on mortgages or the hubris of Dick Fuld .
It 's the failure of an antiquated , risky strategy that depended on macroeconomic luck and that grossly overcompensated employees for being in the right place at the right time .
Debt and more debt
The game Wall Street played relied on leveraging up the cash provided by shareholders to enormous levels and using all the debt to accumulate a giant portfolio of securities .
As long as interest rates trend downward , the value of that portfolio swells , yielding gigantic returns on a slim equity base .
And , with the exception of a few scary blips caused by the Asian currency crisis and the tech meltdown , that 's what happened for most of Lehman 's existence since it was spun off by American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) in 1994 .
Based on a huge surge in profits , the employees arrange to take compensation in amounts unheard of outside of sports and Hollywood .
This model has an obvious , and fatal , flaw .
Earnings on Wall Street no longer come chiefly from recurring businesses but rather from a combination of huge leverage and huge risk .
When good luck turns , as it did in the credit crisis that began just over a year ago , the shareholder wealth supporting all that leverage gets wiped out .
That 's precisely what happened at Lehman .
Its shares are trading today at around 20 cents , meaning that outside of the dividend that the firm slashed last week , Lehman managed to destroy wealth for shareholders .
The employees , though , took out tens of billions in excess pay that 's parked in mansions , yachts and stock portfolios .
How did such a scenario come to pass ?
There are four key reasons :
Too much leverage
Between 2004 and 2007 , Lehman swelled its balance sheet by almost $ 300 billion through the purchase of securities often backed by residential and commercial real estate loans .
But in the same period , the firm added a miniscule $ 6 billion in equity .
As a result , assets jumped from an already high level of 24 times capital , to 31 times .
So if the total value of the portfolio declined by 3 % or so , shareholders ' equity would be erased .
Ever riskier products
Over the years , once - lucrative businesses on Wall Street have become commoditized , including trading and underwriting bonds for clients .
So Lehman , along with Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and other firms , pushed into higher - margin products , notably the packaging and trading of ever more exotic types of mortgage - backed securities .
This allowed Lehman and others to keep profits humming .
But the shift radically changed their businesses .
Wall Street became far more dependent on proprietary trading and far less reliant on clients .
Before the collapse of Bear Stearns , it along with Lehman , Merrill , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) derived over 60 % of revenues from trading , most of it for their own accounts , versus around 40 % in the late 1990s .
Wall Street firms evolved into giant hedge funds .
Now they 're suffering the same fate as a lot of over - leveraged hedgies .
Big bets , short - term debts
Unlike Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) or JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman and the other independent investment banks do n't have a stable base of retail deposits to use for buying securities .
Instead , they rely on short - term debt that needs to be constantly refinanced .
That 's fine as long as the mortgages and other securities they hold are stable or rising in value and thus easy to sell .
But when real estate started to slump , Lehman and its brethren could n't sell securities they owned except at a big loss .
In the case of Bear , creditors got so nervous about lending money for securities that could n't be sold that they refused to roll over Bear 's commercial paper .
Lehman did have access to a newly created Federal Reserve window for short - term financing .
But that could n't save the firm because the basic problem remains :
When markets turn nervous , creditors will stop lending , forcing Wall Street to dump holdings at distressed prices .
Big commercial banks , on the other hand , can hold securities until markets rebound .
That gives them a big edge and explains why their model will prevail .
Exorbitant pay
The Wall Street playbook calls for taking home the highest pay possible when times are good and giving none of it back when times are tough .
Since the securities business is cyclical , it would make sense for firms to bank their bonuses forward so that if profits are plentiful one year but disappear the next , part of the compensation is returned to shareholders .
But that 's not how the Street works .
The pay practices at Lehman are highly instructive .
When it came to granting stock to employees , Lehman was incredibly extravagant .
Before Lehman raised equity capital this year , grants of options and restricted stock left 30 % of shares in employees ' hands .
To be sure , employees have lost billions in recent months .
But they took out plenty over the years .
Fuld , for example , has cashed out almost $ 500 million worth of stock in his 14 years as CEO , according to Fortune 's Allan Sloan ; that 's four times Lehman 's stock market capitalization as of Monday morning .
In fiscal 2006 and 2007 , Fuld earned a total of more than $ 80 million , an astounding sum for a company Lehman 's size .
Lehman 's general counsel Thomas Russo made more than $ 12 million in each of those years .
Top lawyers for much larger U.S. companies make a fraction of that amount .
Given all of this excess , there 's no way this business model can last .
The best bet is that Morgan Stanley will eventually be absorbed by a big bank that will reduce leverage , shrink pay scales , fund assets with deposits and impose strict risk controls .
That 's what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is doing with the old Bear Stearns and what Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis will no doubt do with Merrill .
Goldman , on the other hand , has the financial strength to move in the other direction and buy a bank .
Even so , the Wall Street follies will soon end .
They were great while they lasted - though mainly for the hired hands .
Cosmic rays throughout the universe produce similar collisions of higher energy than will be possible with the LHC on a regular basis .
Even if a micro black hole is created AND it does not instantly evaporate AND it becomes trapped by the earth 's gravity , it is likely that it will aggregate mass so slowly that something else out there will destroy the earth before the black hole is able to do so .
A strangelet disaster is similarly unlikely .
The mere fact that Earth ( in addition to countless other stars and planets ) has not yet been converted to strange matter is a testament in itself to the rarity of such an event in the universe .
As for a vacuum metastability event , well , we probably would have been killed by such an event resulting from either natural sources or an extraterrestrial civilization 's particle collider long ago if it were that easy to initiate .
However , in the unlikely event that :
a) The LHC does in fact destroy the earth ,
b ) Humanity somehow survives this event and relocates to somewhere else in the universe ,
c ) I am still alive ,
d ) Your beneficiary still exists , and
e ) Money as we know it still has value ,
then I will gladly pay up .
I would be interested to know which of the scenarios I have mentioned ( or have not mentioned ) Mr. Keane thinks is likely to destroy the planet .
A chain of elephants , trunks and tails linked , wanders , with a mixture of upbeat energy and complacent pride , along the endpapers of a children ’s book .
So begins one of the stories that most please the imagination of the modern child and his distant relation the modern adult — Jean de Brunhoff ’s “ The Story of Babar , ” published in 1931 .
The Babar books are among those half - dozen picture books that seem to fix not just a character but a whole way of being , even a civilization .
An elephant , lost in the city , does not trumpet with rage but rides a department - store elevator up and down , until gently discouraged by the elevator boy .
A Haussmann - style city rises in the middle of the barbarian jungle .
Once seen , Babar the Frenchified elephant is not forgotten .
With Bemelmans ’s “ Madeline ” and Sendak ’s “ Where the Wild Things Are , ” the Babar books have become part of the common language of childhood , the library of the early mind .
There are few parents who have n’t tried them and few small children who do n’t like them .
They also remain one of the few enterprises begun by a father and continued by his son in more or less the same style .
Laurent de Brunhoff , who was twelve when his father died , at the age of just thirty - seven , picked up the elephant brush after the Second World War and has gone on producing Babar books , with the same panache , almost to this day .
( Audubon ’s sons ’ continuation of their father ’s “ Quadrupeds ” is another instance , but in that case the father was alive when the sons began to carry on the work . )
Babar comes to us now in a show , at the Morgan Library & Museum , of the early drafts and watercolor drawings for the first books by both de Brunhoff père and de Brunhoff fils .
Jean had produced the very first Babar book at the demand of his wife and two children , who had fallen in love with an elephant - centered bedtime story that she had been telling the children in the summer of 1930 .
He came from a family of artists perched on the ledge — a broad one in the France of his time — between fine - arts painting and book and fashion illustration .
( De Brunhoff ’s father had worked with the academic Impressionist James Tissot , and his brother was the editor of French Vogue . )
Jean de Brunhoff was trained as a painter , and what strikes one first about his preliminary drawings for “ Babar ” is how much more conventionally masterly — the work of an obviously accomplished draftsman — they look than the final drawings do .
The sketches are sinuous and authoritative as de Brunhoff searches out form and dramatic manner .
( He made oil paintings for adult collectors , and those which survive are likewise quite conservative and finished . )
The completed Babar drawings , by contrast , are beautiful small masterpieces of the faux - naïf : the elephant faces reduced to a language of points and angles , each figure cozily encased in its black - ink outline , a friezelike arrangement of figures against a background of pure color .
De Brunhoff ’s style is an illustrator ’s version of Matisse , Dufy , and Derain , which by the nineteen - thirties had already been filtered and defanged and made part of the system of French design .
Jean de Brunhoff , a trained painter , worked hard to make his Babar illustrations as simple as possible .
He ended up creating a kind of domestic primitivism , a faux - naïf style that affectionately parodied the ordered rhythms of French bourgeois existence .

But the Babar books are more than the sum of their lines .
By now , of course , a controversial literature is possible about anything , and yet to discover that there is a controversial literature about Babar is a little shocking — faut - il brûler Babar ?
( “ Must we burn Babar ? ” ) , as one inquisitor puts it , in a famous French locution .
And the controversial literature is n’t trivial : it touches on questions that are real and enduring .
In the past few decades , a series of critics on the left , most notably the Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman , have indicted Babar in the course of a surprisingly resilient and hydra - headed argument about the uses of imagery and the subtleties of imperialist propaganda .
Babar , such interpreters have insisted , is an allegory of French colonization , as seen by the complacent colonizers : the naked African natives , represented by the “ good ” elephants , are brought to the imperial capital , acculturated , and then sent back to their homeland on a civilizing mission .
The elephants that have assimilated to the ways of the metropolis dominate those which have not .
The true condition of the animals — to be naked , on all fours , in the jungle — is made shameful to them , while to become an imitation human , dressed and upright , is to be given the right to rule .
The animals that resist — the rhinoceroses — are defeated .
The Europeanized elephants are , as in the colonial mechanism of indirect rule , then made trustees of the system , consuls for the colonial power .
To be made French is to be made human and to be made superior .
The straight lines and boulevards of Celesteville , the argument goes , are the sign of enslavement .
Through such subtle imprinting , the premises of imperialism come to be treated as natural .
The case cannot be dismissed out of hand : it ’s easy to see that , say , “ Little Black Sambo , ” for all his pancake - eating charms , needs to be thought through before being introduced to young readers , while , to take an extreme example , a book from nineteen - thirties Germany about the extermination of long - nosed rats by obviously Aryan cats would go on anyone ’s excluded list , however beautifully drawn .
Yet those who would burn “ Babar ” miss the true subject of the books .
The de Brunhoffs ’ saga is not an unconscious expression of the French colonial imagination ; it is a self - conscious comedy about the French colonial imagination and its close relation to the French domestic imagination .
The gist of the classic early books of the nineteen - thirties —
“ The Story of Babar ” and “ Babar the King , ” particularly — is explicit and intelligent : the lure of the city , of civilization , of style and order and bourgeois living is real , for elephants as for humans .
The costs of those things are real , too , in the perpetual care , the sobriety of effort , they demand .
The happy effect that Babar has on us , and our imaginations , comes from this knowledge — from the child ’s strong sense that , while it is a very good thing to be an elephant , still , the life of an elephant is dangerous , wild , and painful .
It is therefore a safer thing to be an elephant in a house near a park .
Every children ’s story that works at all begins with a simple opposition of good and evil , of straightforward innocence and envious corruption .
While the good hero or heroine has to be particularized , with flaws and idiosyncrasies , the evil force is , oddly , the more powerful the less distinct it is ; because villainy is itself so interesting , there ’s no great need to particularize the villain .
In few works of children ’s literature is the creation of dull and faceless evil as effective as it is in the Babar saga .
“ Page 2 of ‘ Babar ’ ” is a code word among certain parents for the entire issue of what it is right to expose our children to .
( It ’s actually the sixth numbered page in the book , and the fourth page in the story , but it seems to register as page 2 , being the second element after the introduction of the elephant nursery idyll . )
It is there that Babar ’s mother , with her little elephant on her back , is murdered , with casual brutality , by a squat white hunter .
The pro-page - twoers think that without the incident the story is robbed of motive and pathos ; the anti-page - twoers think that it ’s just too hard , too early , and too brutal , so they turn the story into one of a little elephant who merely wanders into Paris — not such a bad premise .
( Maurice Sendak , in a lovely appraisal of Babar , recalls thinking that the act of violence that sets Babar off is not sufficiently analyzed — that the trauma is left unhealed and even untreated — while Nicholas Fox Weber , in his good book about the art of the elephant saga , suggests that Babar ’s “ apparent indifference to his mother ’s shooting is a by - product of the essential drive to see beauty and continue living no matter how tragic the past . ” )
Whether the motive is amnesiac or therapeutic , the moment when the lost and motherless elephant enters the French city — Paris , surely , though also standing in for French colonial capitals from Saigon to Casablanca — is a magical moment .
The arrival is subdued and simple , creating a tension between the savanna and the city that is continually renewed , and around which the whole series will be structured .
The exoticism of the Babar story is obviously a Fifth Arrondissement exoticism , like that of the turn - of - the - century Douanier Henri Rousseau , whose harmless but rapacious paintings of wild animals , inspired by visits to the zoo , have much of the same sober charm as Jean de Brunhoff’s .
And the dream of the desert as an enchanted place , which takes such powerful form in Rousseau ’s matchless “ Sleeping Gypsy , ” as in de Brunhoff ’s unforgettable nocturne of Babar and his bride , connects the two .
But there is a deeper connection between this kind of French made - at - home exoticism and the domestic charm of Babar — between , if you like , Jean - Jacques Rousseau and Henri Rousseau , between the idea of the native genius of children and a romantic vision of Africa .
France during the nineteen - thirties was in transition from an old , unashamedly predatory model of imperialism to one that insisted on the mission civilisatrice — the vauntedly benevolent gathering of different races into one French commonwealth — and , simultaneously , from a model of work and labor as their own reward to one in which the reward of irksome labor was French family leisure .

This double “ primitivism ” of the hearth and the heathen , the foyer and the faraway , is apparent in the books ’ visual style , even more than in the obvious and much argued - over story line .
High Fauve style , from the beginning , and in the hands of Matisse in particular , was connected to children ’s art and the idea of childhood .
Picasso saw this keenly , speaking often ( if with a hint of condescension ) of how crucially the drawings of Matisse ’s children had affected their father ’s art , and for the better , supplying a kind of domestic primitivism , an African art of the nursery .
That is visible even in a masterpiece as sophisticated as Matisse ’s “ Piano Lesson , ” of 1916 , where the play between the oppressive weight of French teaching and the gasping attempt at pleasure weighs on the boy .
And the traffic between the exotic elephant and the French nursery is already implied , in a more complex form , in Matisse ’s “ The Moroccans , ” of the same year , in which the remote decorative style of French - colonized Africa is rephrased in terms of the metropolitan faux - naïf .
( Although “ tribal ” art is in no way childlike , French artists , wrongly but fruitfully , saw it that way . )
The tightrope between the exotic and the domestic that the Babar books walk is central to the French imagination of the first half of the twentieth century : the great desert opens onto the great city ; the beautiful patterning of the carpet gives life to the gray light of the Île de France ; we dream of the elephants , and the elephant dreams of a green suit and a motorcar .
( The children ’s dining room of the French ocean liner Normandie was , tellingly , decorated with de Brunhoff ’s elephants , animal totems of French voyaging . )
All of which complicates one ’s sense of the politics of “ Babar , ” too .
One can forget , reading the critics , that the books are , first and last , meant to be funny , and that Babar is an elephant who talks and walks : the story is happening to creatures that children know do not ride elevators , wear suits , or build buildings .
Part of the joke is in the way the obvious animalness of the protagonist makes evident the absurdity of the human behavior depicted .
An animal that attempts to become an astronaut or conduct an orchestra is inherently ridiculous and makes the ambition ridiculous as he pursues it .
That ’s why Daffy Duck in “ Duck Dodgers ” is daffy .
As an elephant who takes on the role of the bourgeois patriarch ( and monarch ) , Babar reveals that role ’s touching absurdity .
In “ Babar the King ” ( 1933 ) — the central book in the Babar saga — the rhinos and the elephants have been at war , but the point is n’t that the rhinos are evil .
It is that war between nations is as absurd in reality as war between animals looks on the page .
Becoming French , the elephants reveal the absurd and contrived elements of the French national character .
Celesteville is a parody of the French corporatist dream , beautifully expressed , in “ Babar the King , ” in the drawing of the elephants at their various occupations , as Cartesian and logical as a poster from the pedagogical - instruments house Deyrolle :
If Barbacol wants a statue for his mantelpiece , he asks Podular to carve one for him , and when Podular ’s coat is worn out Barbacol makes a new one to order for him .
. . .
Hatchibombotar cleans the streets ,
Olur repairs the automobiles , and , when they are all tired , Doulamor plays his cello to entertain them .
. . .
As for Coco , he keeps them all laughing and gay .
There are no bankers or stockbrokers in Celesteville .
Capitalism is elided , as are unnecessary “ middlemen , ” in this perfect Comtian economy , in which each does his job and receives his goods .
There is to be no ambition , either , no upwardly mobile individual elephant .
( That is an American elephant ’s notion . )
The reward for this serene corporatism is apparent on the next page : after working in the morning , the elephants take the afternoon off .
And this society provides continuity with the classical traditions — the elephants , bewigged and formal , attend a production of the Comédie - Française .
Surely the happy effect this has on the reader , and the elephants , is not the result of our ( or their ) having been propagandized to accept colonial hegemony .
This is n’t a portrait at a distance of an imaginary colonial city .
It is , instead , an affectionate , closeup caricature of an idealized French society .
The fragility of this society — and its inability to resist the rhinoceroses — only intensifies the pathos and affection it inspires .
So “ a certain idea of France , ” in de Gaulle ’s phrase , is at the heart of the appeal of the Babar books .
What is that idea , and how does it differ from our idea of England or America ?
All children ’s books take as their subject disorder and order and their proper relation , beginning in order and ending there , but with disorder given its due .
In our century , different ideas of order have been represented in children ’s literature by a city or a country .
The Mary Poppins stories , “ Peter Pan , ” “ The Wind in the Willows , ” and , in a slightly different way , “ The Hobbit ” all use an idea of England and , often , of London .
Here order is internal , found at home , part of the natural world of the nursery and the riverbank ; disorder lies beyond , at times threatening but more often beckoning as a source of joy and Dionysian possibility — as in the beautiful chapter entitled “ The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , ” in “ The Wind in the Willows , ” or the celestial circus in “ Mary Poppins . ”
Order , in the English vision , is comforting but plain ; disorder is perilous but romantically alluring .
We escape the nursery for the disorder of the park .
The idea of Paris that one finds in the Babar books — or in the Madeline books — has another shape .
Disorder is imagined as internal , psychological ; the natural world is accepted as inherently coquin , “ mean , ” or potentially violent .
Order needs to be created by constant infusions of education and city planning ; it is a source of Apollonian pleasure .
Paris is the place where you go up and down in the elevator .
Madeline ’s wish is to walk along the parapet , while Miss Clavell wakes every night to sense that something is not right , and the girls walk in two straight lines to hold disorder at bay .
When disorder arrives — Madeline and Pepito ’s time with the Gypsies , Babar and Celeste ’s imprisonment in the circus — it takes the form of a new routine .
Disorder is the normal mess of life , what rhinos like .
Order is what elephants ( that is , Frenchmen ) achieve at a cost and with effort .
To stray from built order is to confront the man with a gun .

Things are sorted differently in the children ’s classics of New York .
In “ From the Mixed - Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler , ” “ The House on East 88th Street , ” “ Stuart Little , ” “ The Pushcart War , ” and “ Harriet the Spy , ” neither order nor disorder is taken to be natural .
The world of the books oscillates unpredictably between them , producing battles and freaks .
The best we can find are small secret islands of order .
Everything turns on the individual child and her ability to create a safe miniworld of her own within the big chaotic city .
In London , in children ’s books , life is too orderly and one longs for the vitality of the wild ; in Paris , order is an achievement , hard won against the natural chaos and cruelty of adult life ; in New York , we begin most stories in an indifferent city and the child has to create a kind of order within it .
Each of these schemes reflects a history : the English vision being a natural consequence of a peaceful nation with a reformist history and in search of adventure ; the French of a troubled nation with a violent history in search of peace ; and the American of an individualistic and sporadically violent country with a strong ethos of family isolation and improvised rules .
We go to the imaginary Paris for sudden glimpses of evil ( the death of Babar ’s mother ) set off by satisfying visions of aesthetic bliss ( the Celesteville Bureau of Industry , situated near the Amusement Hall ) , just as we go to the imaginary London to satisfy our longing for adventure and the undefined elsewhere , which returns us safely in the end to Cherry Tree Lane .
And we go to the imaginary New York for the pleasure of the self - made : to see two children actually hide and live in a museum ; to see an alligator , or a mouse , absorbed uncontroversially into a normal life .
Fables for children work not by pointing to a moral but by complicating the moral of a point .
The child does not dutifully take in the lesson that salvation lies in civilization , but , in good Freudian fashion , takes in the lesson that the pleasures of civilization come with discontent at its constraints : you ride the elevator , dress up in the green suit , and go to live in Celesteville , but an animal you remain — the dangerous humans and rhinoceroses are there to remind you of that — and you delight in being so .
There is allure in escaping from the constraints that button you up and hold you ; there is also allure in the constraints and the buttons .
We would all love to be free , untrammelled elephants , but we long , too , for a green suit .
Far more than an allegory of colonialism , the “ Babar ” books are a fable of the difficulties of a bourgeois life .
“ Truly it is not easy to bring up a family , ” Babar sighs at one point , and it is true .
The city lives on the edge of a desert , and animals wander in and out at will , and then wander out again to make cities of their own .
The civilizing principle is energetic but essentially comical , solid - looking on the outside but fragile in its foundations , reducible to rubble by rhinoceroses .
Even the elephants , for all their learning and sailor suits , can be turned into slaves through a bad twist of fate .
The unruliness of natural life is countered by the beautiful symmetries of classical style and the absurd orderliness of domestic life — but we are kidding ourselves if we imagine that we are ever really safe .
Death is a rifle shot and a poisoned mushroom away .
The only security , the de Brunhoff books propose , lies in our commitment to those graceful winged elephants that , in Babar ’s dream , at the end of “ Babar the King , ” chase away misfortune .
Love and Happiness , who are at the heart of the American vision , are , in Babar ’s dream , mere tiny camp followers .
The larger winged elephants , which are at the forefront of this French vision of civilized life , are instead Intelligence , Patience , Learning , and Courage .
“ Let ’s work hard and cheerfully and we ’ll continue to be happy , ” the Old Lady tells the elephants , and , though we know that the hunter is still in the woods , it is hard to know what more to add . ♦

FIDEL Castro makes Wilt Chamberlain seem lame .
While the NBA legend bragged he ’d bedded 20,000 women , the Cuban dictator slept with 35,000 , according to an upcoming documentary .
“ He slept with at least two women a day for more than four decades – one for lunch and one for supper .
Sometimes he even ordered one for breakfast , ” an ex-Castro official named “ Ramon ” tells filmmaker Ian Halperin .
“ I do n’t think he would have stayed on as long as he did if not for all the incredible women he had access to as president . ”
Castro ’s security would comb Havana beaches each day recruiting the hottest babes .
Remaining Mute , Cell Phone Execs Refuse to Appear Before Congress
Industry group a no - show at hearing on whether a link between phones and cancer .
September 25 , 2008  --
The wireless industry association refused to appear before Congress today on a hearing about whether there is a link between cell phones and cancer .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of ( D - Ohio ) , chair of the subcommittee of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which held a hearing Thursday , said that CTIA ( The Wireless Association ) , the industry major trade association in Washington DC , declined his request to testify with scientists and government officials about the status of the scientific research on the topic .
" By their refusal they deny this Congress the benefit of their testimony and the opportunity to pose questions , " Kucinich said at the hearing .
But a CTIA spokesperson said the organization 's lack of testimony should n't be seen as a dodge .
" We 've always maintained that this debate must be guided by science , " said Joseph Farren , a spokesperson for CTIA .
" We are not scientists and we just think it 's best left to the scientists . "
Most studies have found no connection between cancer and cell phone use .
The scientific studies pointing to an association between cell phones and brain cancer is controversial and limited .
None of the major health organizations -- including the National Cancer Institute nor the American Cancer Society -- think that there is a link .
In fact the chief medical director at the American Cancer Society , Otis Brawley , said as recently as this summer that some of the warnings about a link are " scaring people unnecessarily . "
But during a hearing Thursday members of Congress wanted to know if they should n't push more people to take measures to prevent exposure .
Robert Hoover , director of epidemiology at the National Cancer Institute , did not think there was solid science .
" There are some isolated findings but larger studies are needed to sort out the role of chance and bias , " he said .
And , he noted , studies show there has been no increase in the instances of brain cancer between 1987 and 2005 .
But some scientists believe there 's enough of an association to be concerned , enough , at least , to take precautions in using cell phones , such as using an ear piece or limiting use .
That is what Ronald Herberman , director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute , did this summer , issuing a precautionary memo on cell phone use to his colleagues .
During testimony he explained his reasoning .
" I cannot tell this committee that cell phones are definitely dangerous but I certainly cannot tell you that they are safe , " Herberman said .
Part of the problem , he said , is that many of the studies have a key limitation : that they only measure short term influence instead of looking at whether the radiation has an impact over the long haul .
He and another scientist , David Carpenter , an epidemiologist at the University of Albany , pointed to a recent study that found an association between prolonged cell phone use and two brain cancers -- one that was five time greater among those who used cell phones before the age of 20 .
" I certainly find the evidence at present to be less than 100 percent , " Carpenter said .
But , he added " the implications are enormous . "
Enormous enough that " there should be national standards of warning or precaution relating ot the use of cell phones for children ? "
Kucinich wanted to know .
Carpenter 's response : " I think evidence is certainly strong enough for warnings that children should not use cell phones .
I think failure to do that is going to lead us to an epidemic of brain cancer in the future . "
Hoover 's response was less sanguine .
" I think it does depend on whether there is a risk or not . "
And that , he said , would have to wait for a major study schedule to come out sometime next year .

Obama stays cool during O'Reilly inquisition Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008

In first segment aired , Obama says surge succeeded It 's been almost nine months to the day since Fox News 's Bill O'Reilly tried to shove his way to an interview with Barack Obama during a New Hampshire campaign stop .
The setting was a little more peaceful when the two finally sat down together Thursday , but O'Reilly was his good old fashioned bullying self .
In an interview in which the O'Reilly Factor host seemed as interested in hearing his own exhortations as Obama 's answers , the Fox talker harangued Obama over an array of foreign policy issues .
O'Reilly kicked off the interview with a question no one could imagine anyone on the Fox News network posing to Republican candidate John McCain : " Do you believe we 're in the middle of a war on terror ? "
( That O'Reilly apparently believed -- or wanted his viewers to believe -- there was a possibility that Obama would say no perhaps says as much about the brush with which Fox has tried to paint the Democratic candidate as anything else on the network . )
A day after Rudy Giuliani viciously -- and inaccurately -- mocked Democrats for failing to fetishize " Islamic terrorism , " as the former New York Mayor himself is so fond of doing , Obama delivered a reasoned , concise answer about the need to " go after " terrorists while warning against the danger of lumping everyone together , as the Republicans are so fond of doing .
" Iran is a major threat , now ... they are not part of the same network [ as al Qaeda ] .
You 've got Shia and you 've got Sunni , " Obama said .
" We 've got to have the ability to distinguish between these groups .
" The war in Iraq is a good example , where I believe the administration lumped together , Saddam Hussein -- a terrible guy -- with al Qaeda , which had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein , " Obama continued .
" And as a consequence , we ended up , I think , misdirecting our resources . "
O'Reilly continued to harp on Iran and its quest for a nuclear weapon .
Obama said it would be " unacceptable " for Iran to get a nuclear weapon and he repeated his vow that military action would always remain an option at his disposal .
No answer he could give on the issue though -- aside , perhaps , from " the bombs start falling on Inauguration Day " -- seemed like it would have satisfied O'Reilly , who continued to press Obama on precisely what military action the candidate was planning for .
" Answer the question , senator , " O'Reilly demanded , despite Obama 's assurances that it would be irresponsible to tip his hand on military planning .
Exasperated , O'Reilly moved on to the war in Iraq , praising the Illinois senator 's foresight in opposing the war but taking a particularly tough line towards his vote against the " troop surge " that began last Spring .
" I think you were desperately wrong on the surge , and I think you should admit it to the nation , " O'Reilly scolded .
Obama acknowledged that the surge " succeeded in ways that nobody anticipated -- including President Bush , " but he maintained that the political progress the surge was meant to foster has still failed to materialize .
Furthermore , he said , a part of the reduction in violence needs to be credited to the Anbar Awakening , where Sunni tribal leaders in the province turned against the insurgency and began cooperating with Americans .
" We have reduced the violence , but the Iraqis still have n't taken responsibility , " Obama said , accusing Iraq 's government of failing to invest the country 's massive oil wealth in its rebuilding .
The statements echoed views Obama expressed in a July New York Times column on his Iraq plans .
Again , O'Reilly hectored .
The surge worked , he said simply , and in a heated back and forth , Obama let slip his most frank agreement with that assessment .
" I 've already said , the surge succeeded beyond our wildest dreams , " Obama said during the exchange , almost as an aside .
It was that line that led Fox 's release of excerpts from the interview earlier Thursday .
Not 20 minutes after the interviewed aired -- and at least an hour after the excerpts were released -- Sen. Lindsey Graham took to the Republican National Convention stage in St. Paul , Minn. , to inaccurately accuse Obama of not believing the surge had been a success .
One assumes they had Fox News on in all the RNC green rooms .
Maybe Graham just was n't paying attention .
New segments of the interview , conducted Thursday in York , Pa. , will air Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday on The O'Reilly Factor .

Choosing an XMPP server is a big decision .
Should you go with the popular one or the one written in the most popular language ?
Perhaps you do n’t plan to become a systems administrator and you need one which is easy to set up and maintain .
Unfortunately for people making this important choice , there is not much guidance published beyond features comparisons .
What follows is an account of our decision making process on XMPP servers – how we came to pick jabberd2 originally , and how we switched to ejabberd .
A Brief History Of XMPP Servers
XMPP began as Jabber and had only one server , jabberd .
As popularity of the protocol grew , more servers appeared , and now there are half a dozen major contenders , both commercial and open source .
The main players these days seem to be :
jabberd – The original server .
It started in C , but now appears to be a mix of C and C++ code .
The main users for years was jabber.org itself .
The code may have changed substantially in the last couple of years , but I remember it being rather crufty .
Matthias Wimmer has been maintainer at least since 2004 , and he continues to maintain it today , although it does go through some long periods of inactivity .

jabberd 2.x – A rewrite of jabberd , originally by Rob Norris .
The code is pure C , modular , and fairly easy to understand .
Chesspark picked this to start with in 2006 .
Another notable user of jabberd 2.x is Meebo .
Unfortunately it was abandoned by its original maintainers some time ago .
Tomas Sterna stepped up to the plate and took over the project , and it is now actively maintained again .

ejabberd – An XMPP server written in Erlang which claims to be quite scalable .
Erlang is the language created decades ago by Ericcson to power their telephone switches .
It has many features that make it well suited for XMPP servers .
ejabberd has been around and active since early 2005 , and is supported officially by Process One .
It also has a growing developer community .
Jabber.org switched from jabberd to ejabberd some time ago , and continues to run ejabberd today .

Openfire – A Java server written by JIVE Software .
This was formerly a commercial product called Wildfire .
I have no personal experience with it , but it appears to have an active community .

Tigase - Another Java server that started in late 2004 .
It is actively maintained .
I have no personal experience with Tigase other than meeting Artur at the recent XMPP Summit , but the Seesmic folks speak very highly of the project .
This list is incomplete .
Notable omissions include Google Talk ( not publically available ) , Jabber XCP ( the commercial offering from Jabber.com ) , and djabberd ( Danga ’s jabber server written in Perl ) .
Chesspark ’s Initial Decision
Chesspark chose jabberd2 as its XMPP server about 3 years ago .
I recall being impressed with the clean and modular code base as well as its ability to change the SQL queries right in the configuration file .
It also supported PostgreSQL which was the RDBMS we preferred .
I do n’t think that Tigase or ejabberd were considered ; they were likely too young at the time .
Jabberd was the only other real choice , but we were not impressed with the code .
One major factor which influenced our decision was code readability and maintainability .
We wanted an XMPP server that we could patch ourselves if needed , and we did n’t want to be stuck in case the project was abandoned down the road .
This turned out to be a wise decision – the jabberd 2.x project was unmaintained for a long period while we used it .
Over the last few years we ’ve made patches and assisted others with patches as best we can .
Jabberd 2.x Disappointment
Over time , Chesspark ’s user base got larger as the site became more popular , and jabberd 2.x ’s warts began to show .
Here are the main ones in the approximate order we discovered them .
Database transactions abused .
Jabberd 2.x does no queries out of the box that require the use of database transactions .
By default it is configured to do every query in a transaction , even if it is a simple SELECT .
This is a common problem with many libraries we ’ve used at Chesspark .
Thankfully , jabberd 2.x can be configured to turn this off .
Normally this would not affect anything , but the small amount of overhead caused can add up fast when jabberd 2.x does lots of queries , which it certainly does .

Normally this would not affect anything , but the small amount of overhead caused can add up fast when jabberd 2.x does lots of queries , which it certainly does .
Memory leaks .
There are several memory leaks that persist to this day .
Even with a small userbase like Chesspark has , this forces us to restart the server about once a week .
As memory usage climbs , the server latency gets higher .
Our attempts to find this leak have been unsuccessful to date .

Our attempts to find this leak have been unsuccessful to date .
Non-blocking design inconsistent .
The server uses a non-blocking design common to scalable daemons ; this is great .
Unfortunately , all database calls use the blocking database API and a single database connection .
This means that even with light load , packet latencies can be quite high if the database is n’t ridiculously fast .
For us , the show stopper was latency .
Games depend on near real - time performance , and latency destroys the user experience .
We generated test load which logged in a few hundred users , did roster operations , logged out , and repeated .
We then measured latency of chess moves on the same server .
We were shocked when we saw the numbers – over 3 seconds of lag between an IQ query and its response .
All of these things could theoretically be fixed , and I hope that they are fixed eventually .
Diversity in server choices is a feature of XMPP – the more the merrier .
Finding A New Server
Once we decided to abandon jabberd2 , we needed to find a new server .
Feature wise , all the current servers support the stack we need – authentication with TLS and SASL , ability to use PostgreSQL as a backend , private XML storage , external components , and privacy lists .
Years ago , some of these features were hard to come by , but today they are common .
ejabberd , Openfire , and Tigase have pubsub and BOSH support as well , neither of which was available in any open source server when we started .
We knew right off the bat that we did n’t want to be writing C .
While we have a lot of C experience , we like to reserve C for the few times it is actually needed and spend the rest of our time in more productive and higher level languages .
This removed jabberd from the list .
From here the language choice is Erlang or Java .
Erlang is a dynamically typed , functional language – quite a radical departure from the norm for people most C and Java hackers .
We work a lot in Python , so Erlang was the closer fit .
Many people make the decision to work in Java , and from there they will need to pick between Tigase and Openfire .
One thing to note is that some people seem scared away by the Erlang language .
Do n’t be one of these people .
Erlang is well documented and pretty easy to learn .
We knew nothing about Erlang a few months ago .
That did not slow us down too much when we needed to write ejabberd modules or make changes in ejabberd internals .
Even without knowing Erlang , we were able to write extensions to ejabberd much faster than for jabberd2 .
The last part of our decision was to test server latency with ejabberd .
We ran the same test that we ran on jabberd2 , and ejabberd did n’t flinch .
The measured latency at idle was twice as fast in some cases with ejabberd , and there was very little change even as we pounded the database to levels that would have made jabberd2 cry .
Life With Ejabberd
ejabberd is not perfect ; no server is .
Here ’s a list of our current gripes :
Memory hog – Erlang uses a lot of memory for basic string handling since a string is represented as a list of integers .
There also seems to be a bug in TLS that causes it to use quite a bit more memory than non-TLS connections .
These add up to quite a bit of memory usage .
For Chesspark , we use over a gig of RAM for a few hundred connections .
Jabber.org uses about 2.7GB of RAM for its 10 k+ connections .
I ’m not sure what the discrepancy is between these numbers ; we are still looking .
I expect the TLS memory issue to be solved soon , and the Process One folks told me that they were going to switch the string handling to use Erlang binaries which are more memory efficient .

Lots of database queries – As with jabberd2 , ejabberd does an enormous amount of database queries .
With mod_privacy enabled , two roster related queries are done for every packet sent .
ejabberd also uses the database inappropriately , with idioms like SELECT , DELETE , INSERT which can lead to race conditions .
Thankfully , this does not seem to be a big problem with a correctly tuned database , as ejabberd does n’t block on the queries .

Lack of comments in the code –
The code is often quite clear , but comments would be helpful .
There is some basic , but very helpful , developer documentation , but the code contains virtually no comments .
Luckily , this is not as bad as it seems , because many of the idioms in the server are really Erlang and OTP idioms , so reading up a bit on Erlang and OTP answers a lot of questions .
I ’m also not sure other servers are better .
Jabberd2 probably had more comments , but it also had less documentation in general ; I ’ve found working with ejabberd to be easier .
There are many excellent things about ejabberd that make up for these and other shortcomings , and have made us very happy we made the switch .
Hot code loading – After we write a new ejabberd module , we can deploy it in production without pausing or restarting the server .
We can also redeploy it later if we find a bug .
We have even redeployed core server pieces this way with success .
This can even be done to some degree right in the Web interface .

Live console –
It is possible to open an Erlang shell inside the running ejabberd node .
This makes it really easy to poke around to see which processes are running , how much memory they are using , and which internal database tables are getting full .
Java , C , Python , and Ruby have nothing quite like this , although Twisted Python ’s manhole is similar .

You ’d think a C based XMPP server would be a winner in this area , but that is not always true .
ejabberd uses very little CPU usage , except when things go wrong .
Chesspark ’s XMPP server is sitting around a load of 0.1 to 0.2 ; Jabber.org sits at 0.1 .
This is exactly what you want .
An XMPP server should be I/O bound , not CPU bound .
So far we ’re pretty happy .
How did you pick your XMPP server ?
Introduction
How to write code to detect when any software application on the machine accesses any file on the machine , and how to extract and view any data read from or written to that file in your own application , in real time , using C# and a little bit of C ++?
That 's the subject of today 's article : how to build a file monitor on steroids ( or a rough draft of one ) .
In the above screen shot , we 're monitoring the Yahoo Messenger application .
And as you can see , it reads and writes quite a bit of data .
Public keys , log file snippets , some XML filtering stuff , and so forth .
We could have as well chosen to point the tool at Microsoft Word , Grand Theft Auto , or the humble Notepad.exe .
But the real power of these techniques is incorporating them into your own applications .
For example , those of you who 've been following the online poker botting series can use these exact methods to detect and respond to log file and poker hand history text in real time , as its generated by the poker client .
Let 's take our tool and point it at the Poker Stars client , POKERSTARS.EXE , by way of example :
Sure enough , we 've detected that Poker Stars has opened the log file , and sure enough , we 're reading and displaying the log file data as it appears .
Which is almost exactly what we'd like our poker bot to do .
But maybe poker 's not you 're thing .
Maybe you 're just tired , as I am , of third - rate software treating your hard drive like one of these :
Modern software apps are footloose and fancy - free when it comes to depositing cruft on your machine .
I mean the temporary files that never get deleted .
The hidden cookies that persist until you reinstall the operating system .
And the registry entries which do n't get culled when the application that owns them is uninstalled .
Fighting Back
It 's a widely - known fact that file I/O on Windows systems is a matter of public record .
It 's public because , with admin - level access , you yourself can browse to any file on the machine , open the file , edit it , and save it .
It 's public because you have access to the process address space of every application on the machine ( with few exceptions ) .
It 's public because applications that read from or write to files do so using a small set of publically available and thoroughly documented functions :
CreateFile
WriteFile
ReadFile
CloseHandle
And a few others
The above functions are formal members of the exclusive country club known as the Windows API .
They 're called by millions of applications around the world every day .
As you 're reading this , various applications on your machine are calling these functions , whether they know it or not and whether you know it or not .
In fact , it 's hard to do much of anything on a Windows box without calling one of the above functions , either directly or indirectly .
But I 'm a .NET programmer !
you say .
I 'm a Java programmer !
I do n't talk to low - level Windows APIs !
Ah , but you do .
You wo n't call these functions directly , but the .NET framework , the JVM implementation , or whatever library or framework you 're using will .
So the above set of file - manipulation APIs constitute a sort of bottleneck through which a majority of system file I /O must pass .
Now : what if we could somehow get Windows to call one of our functions every time a particular application ( any application ) calls or causes to be called one of the above APIs ?
File monitoring would be a cinch in that case .
And that 's essentially what we 're going to do .
Creating the Injection DLL
The above application was written in C# , but it works in conjunction with a small C++ " workhorse " DLL .
Inside this DLL , we 'll code custom but equivalent versions of whatever Windows APIs we 're interested in redirecting .
Here 's an example showing our custom version of CreateFile , dubbed " Mine_Create File " but you can call it whatever you want :
// Our custom version of the CreateFile Windows API , having the same parameters ,
// return type , and calling convention as the version of CreateFile provided by the OS .
HANDLE WINAPI Mine_CreateFile ( LPCWSTR lpFileName , DWORD dwDesiredAccess ,
DWORD dwShareMode , LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES
lpSecAttr ,
DWORD dwCreateDisp , DWORD dwFlagsAttr, HANDLE
hTemplate )
{
// First , call the original CreateFile provided by the operating system .
HANDLE hFile = Real_CreateFile ( lpFileName , dwDesiredAccess , dwShareMode , lpSecAttr ,
dwCreateDisp , dwFlagsAttr, hTemplate ) ;
// Now , do whatever we want with the filename ( lpFileName )
// Now , do whatever we want with the file handle ( hFile )
// Return the same value returned to us by the original API
return hFile ;
}
Pretty straightforward .
Whenever this function is called , we call the original CreateFile API through the Real_CreateFile function pointer .
Once that 's done , we can snoop on the parameters ( such as the filename ) passed to this function by the target application , report them , etc .
Now , in order for this code to work , we have to ensure one thing : our code must be running inside the target application 's process .
A New Flavor of DLL Injection
I 've written about DLL injection before , and there 's a lot of information on this topic scattered around the net and in books .
So I 'll assume you know that DLL Injection is robust and reliable .
I 'll assume you know it 's a carefully - designed operating system facility , not some backdoor hack .
And I 'll assume you know ( or can figure out ) how to inject a DLL .
After all , it 's a one - liner :
HHOOK myHook = SetWindowsHookEx ( WH_CBT , ( HOOKPROC ) MyHookProcedure , hInstance , 0 ) ;
For the purpose of monitoring file I/ O in real time , any DLL injection technique will work .
But there 's one which is particularly well - suited for this kind of thing .
I mean the DetourCreateProcessWithDLL function , provided by the Microsoft Detours library :
// Initialize some data structures ...
STARTUPINFO si ;
PROCESS_INFORMATION
pi ;
ZeroMemory ( & si , sizeof ( si ) ) ;
ZeroMemory ( & pi , sizeof ( pi ) ) ;
si. cb = sizeof ( si ) ;
//
The following call loads the target executable with our DLL attached
BOOL bSuccess = DetourCreateProcessWithDll ( targetExePath , NULL , NULL , NULL , TRUE ,
CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE
| CREATE_SUSPENDED , NULL , NULL ,
& si , & pi , " detoured.dll " , " XFileMonitor.Hook.dll " , NULL ) ;
// DetourCreateProcessWithDll runs the process in a suspended state .
Wake it up .
if ( bSuccess )
ResumeThread ( pi. hThread ) ;
The benefit of doing it this way , as opposed to Windows Hooks or other methods of DLL injection ?
It ensures that our DLL will be present during the target application 's startup routine , which is traditionally when programmers open a lot of files .
Were we to inject using a Windows Hook , we 'd miss application startup every time , because it takes several seconds for a Windows Hook DLL to be propagated across the system .
Detouring the System File APIs
It 's not enough to simply create a DLL and inject it into the target application .
We have to somehow redirect calls to the system - provided file APIs to the equivalent versions we 've created .
That 's easily accomplished , using Microsoft Detours and a few lines of code .
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain ( HANDLE hModule , DWORD ul_reason_for_call , LPVOID lpReserved )
{
switch ( ul_reason_for_call )
{
case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH
:
if ( :: GetModuleHandle ( L " XFILEMONITOR.GUI.EXE " ) == NULL )
{
DetourTransactionBegin ( ) ;
DetourUpdateThread ( GetCurrentThread ( ) ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CreateFile , Mine_CreateFile ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CloseHandle , Mine_CloseHandle ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_WriteFile , Mine_WriteFile ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_ReadFile , Mine_ReadFile ) ;
DetourTransactionCommit ( ) ;
}
break ;
case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH
: break ;
case DLL_THREAD_DETACH
: break ;
case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH
:
if ( :: GetModuleHandle ( L " XFILEMONITOR.GUI.EXE " ) == NULL )
{
DetourTransactionBegin ( ) ;
DetourUpdateThread ( GetCurrentThread ( ) ) ;
DetourDetach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CreateFile , Mine_CreateFile ) ;
DetourDetach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CloseHandle , Mine_CloseHandle ) ;
DetourDetach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_WriteFile , Mine_WriteFile ) ;
DetourDetach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_ReadFile , Mine_ReadFile ) ;
DetourTransactionCommit ( ) ;
}
break ;
}
return TRUE ;
}
C and C++ programmers will recognize this is as a standard DllMain function .
The DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH notification tells us that this DLL is being mapped into a new process - in this case , the process of the target application we 'd like to spy on .
That 's as good a place as any to perform the redirection .
The following lines of code ...
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CreateFile , Mine_CreateFile ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_CloseHandle , Mine_CloseHandle ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_WriteFile , Mine_WriteFile ) ;
DetourAttach ( & ( PVOID & ) Real_ReadFile , Mine_ReadFile ) ;
... cause all calls to the original versions of the function ( the ones provided by the operating system ) to be redirected to our custom versions of those functions .
It happens transparently , behind the scenes , and in memory - you 're not actually changing the system DLLs as they exist on disk , so you do n't have to worry about corruption .
And of course , when the DLL is unloaded from the process ( DLL_PROCESS_DETACH ) we remove the detours .
Simple .
Spying on the Birth and Death of Files
So you 've got your DLL containing custom versions of various Windows APIs .
You 've injected your DLL into the target process using DetourCreateProcessWithDLL or your injection method of choice .
And you 've redirected all calls to various system APIs such that your code gets called instead .
Now it 's time to start tracking files as they 're opened and closed by the target application .
Let 's revisit our CreateFile override , and add a little bit of code to do this :
//
This data structure stores the files currently opened by the target app .
map < HANDLE , CString > g_openFiles ;
// Critical section guards access to the above collection across threads .
// Elsewhere in code we 've called InitializeCriticalSection
CRITICAL_SECTION g_CritSec ;
// Our custom version of the CreateFile API .
HANDLE WINAPI Mine_CreateFile ( LPCWSTR lpFileName , DWORD dwDesiredAccess ,
DWORD dwShareMode , LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES
lpSecAttr ,
DWORD dwCreateDisp , DWORD dwFlagsAttr, HANDLE
hTemplate )
{
// First , all the original CreateFile provided by the operating system .
HANDLE hFile = Real_CreateFile ( lpFileName , dwDesiredAccess , dwShareMode , lpSecAttr ,
dwCreateDisp , dwFlagsAttr, hTemplate ) ;
// If that was successful ... a new file handle has been born
if ( lpFileName && hFile )
{
CString sFileName = lpFileName ;
if ( ! sFileName . IsEmpty ( ) )
{
// Store it !
Multiple threads may call this function at the
// same time , we we 'll use a critical section to ensure that
// only one of them manipulates g_openFiles at a given time .
:: EnterCriticalSection ( & g_CritSec ) ;
g_openFiles .
insert ( pair < HANDLE , CString > ( h File , sFileName ) ) ;
:: LeaveCriticalSection ( & g_CritSec ) ;
}
}
return hFile ;
}
Every time the target application calls ( or indirectly causes to be called ) CreateFile , we 're storing the filename and the HANDLE associated with it .
You could also take this opportunity to dump some information in a log file or ( in the case of the XFileMonitor ) display a notification in your GUI ( which is running in a different process ) that a particular file has been opened .
Snooping on File Reads and Writes
Similar to the custom version of CreateFile above , we 'll create custom versions of the WriteFile and ReadFile APIs .
The target application will call our versions of these APIs whenever it tries to read data from or write data to the disk .
Let 's take a look at our version of Read File .
BOOL WINAPI Mine_ReadFile ( HANDLE hFile , LPVOID lpBuffer , DWORD nNumberOfBytesToRead ,
LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesRead , LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped )
{
// Call the original version of ReadFile provided by the OS
BOOL bSuccess = Real_ReadFile ( hFile , lpBuffer , nNumberOfBytesToRead ,
lpNumberOfBytesRead , lpOverlapped ) ;
//
See if the handle being written to is one we know about
map <HANDLE , CString>::const_iterator iter = g_openFiles.find ( hFile ) ;
if ( iter != g_openFiles.end ( ) )
{
// Yes , we collected this handle in an earlier call to Create File .
// Retrieve the file name and do something with it .
CString fileName = ( * iter ) . second ;
// TODO : lpBuffer now contains whatever data the application read .
This
// might be text data ( either single - byte or Unicode ) or it might be
// binary .. we 're free to examine and / or transmit it as we see fit
}
return bSuccess ;
}
First we pass the call along to the original API .
Then we take the supplied HANDLE and see if it's in the list of handles we created by monitoring calls to Create File .
If it is , we can easily get the associated filename .
If it 's not , we can still get the filename , but it 's a bit more work , and left as a reader exercise .
Identifying Binary vs. Text Data the Quick and Dirty Way
If you 're targeting or trying to monitor a particular file or application , such as monitoring the log file created by the Poker Stars gaming client , you already presumably know about the files you want to snoop on .
You know for example , that hand history files are text files .
So when you detect a write to a hand history file , you can be sure it 's text data that 's being written .
But what about when you do n't know anything about the files ?
What if you 're trying to write a generic file monitor , such as the one shown above ?
The problem is that ReadFile and WriteFile treat everything as a buffer of bytes .
It might be text data , that 's being written .
Then again , it might be binary data .
You do n't really know , and there 's no quick and easy way to tell the difference , because binary data and text data will frequently use some of the same underlying values .
For example , if the first byte of data in the buffer has the value 65 , it might be the letter " A " ( which , in its single - byte form , has the value 65 ) or it might be that you 're reading a binary file , and the 65 indicates something ( anything ) else entirely .
Maybe it means there are 65 records in this particular file , or maybe it means that the average price of a pound of bok choi in Moscow is 65 pennies .
You do n't know , I do n't know .
Only the person who wrote the code knows .
So what to do in that case ?
Well , we can get a quick - and - dirty approximation of whether a given buffer of data is text or binary by :
Checking the file extension .
This is n't always reliable , since you can give any file , whether text or binary , any extension .
But it 's usually reliable .
Checking the data being written to see if it falls within normal ranges for text character data .
Again , not always reliable , but often reliable .
You already know how to get the file name ( by detouring Create File ) .
So let 's look at some quick - and - dirty code to scan a particular buffer and see if the data in that buffer can successfully be interpreted as ASCII text .
Specifically , let 's check each byte in the buffer to see if it falls within normal ranges for ASCII ( single - byte ) character data .
Here 's a sample function which does that :
// Check the first N bytes of any arbitrary data stream to see
// if they fall within normal printable ranges for ASCII / MBCS
// character data .
bool IsAsciiText ( LPCSTR buffer , int testLength )
{
int validChars = 0 ;
for ( int index = 0 ; index < testLength ; index ++ )
{
char c = buffer [ index ] ;
// if the value of C is negative , or if it
// identifies a non-printable ASCII character ,
// then this is probably binary data .
if ( char < 0 || ! ( isprint ( c ) || isspace ( c ) ) )
return false ;
}
// Every character we tested was within the range
// for printable ASCII characters .
This is probably
// text data .
return true ;
}
Now , this little function is far from complete .
It only handles ASCII ( single - byte ) character text .
It does n't correctly handle embedded NULLs and so forth .
But it 's good enough for demonstration purposes and pretty easy to enhance with additional , smarter checks .
Transmitting File Read and Write Data to Managed Applications
So you 've got your ReadFile and Write File detours in place and working .
You 're able to roughly detect when particular data is text or binary , by examining the file name as well as the data stream itself .
Now how do you go about transmitting all this data back to your application , running in a separate process ?
Obviously we 'll have to use some sort of inter-process communication .
The exact flavor is up to you , but the above XFileMonitor tool uses WM_COPYDATA because it 's simple and straightforward .
// A little structure to communicate relevant file read / write contextual info
struct FILECONTEXT
{
HANDLE File ; // the handle of the file read / written
int OriginalAPI ; // a number uniquely identifying the specific API
// ( such as Read File , etc ) that was called .
} ;
// Transmit file read / write data back to the XFileMonitor ( or any ) application ..
void Transmit ( Win32API sourceAPI , HANDLE hFile , LPCWSTR text )
{
//
We 're using WM_COPYDATA , which is a window message , so we need a target window .
HWND hWnd = :: FindWindow ( NULL , L " Coding the Wheel - XFileMonitor v1.0 " ) ;
if ( !
hWnd )
return ;
// Set up the COPYDATASTRUCT expected by Windows .. the length should be the
// size of our ( custom ) FILECONTEXTstructure , plus the length of the file
// data we 're sending , expressed in bytes , with enough room for a terminating
// NULL .
COPYDATASTRUCT cds ;
:: ZeroMemory ( & cds , sizeof ( COPYDATASTRUCT ) ) ;
cds. dwData = action ;
cds . cbData = sizeof ( FILECONTEXT ) + ( ( wcslen ( text ) +1 ) * 2 ) ;
// Allocate the outgoing array
LPBYTE pOutData = new BYTE [ cds. cbData ] ;
// Place a FILECONTEXT structure at the front of this array
FILECONTEXT ht ;
ht .
File = hFile ;
ht. OriginalAPI = sourceAPI ;
memcpy ( pOutData , & ht , sizeof ( FILECONTEXT ) ) ;
// Place the text immediately following the structure .. assumes any
// single - byte text has already been converted to Unicode
wcscpy ( ( LPWSTR ) ( pOutData + sizeof ( FILECONTEXT ) ) , text ) ;
// Send it off
cds . lpData = pOutData ;
:: SendMessage ( hWnd , WM_COPYDATA , ( WPARAM ) :: GetDesktopWindow ( ) , ( LPARAM ) & cds ) ;
delete [ ] pOutData ;
}
Then in our managed code application .
EXE , we can use some simple P / Invoke to access the data .
First , let 's override OnWndMessage :
// WM_COPYDATA message ID
const int WM_COPYDATA = 0x4A ;
// Get access to the WM_COPYDATA message
protected override void WndProc ( ref Message m )
{
if ( m. Msg == WM_COPYDATA )
OnCopyData ( ref m ) ;
base .
Wnd Proc ( ref m ) ;
}
Now let 's define the OnCopyData function .
In order to do that , we 'll need to create P / Invoke compatible versions of the COPYDATASTRUCT ( defined by windows ) and FILECONTEXT ( defined by us ) structures .
// Managed version of Win32 COPYDATASTRUCT
( defined by OS )
private struct COPYDATASTRUCT
{
public int dwData ;
public int cbData ;
public IntPtr lpData ;
} ;
// Managed version of FILECONTEXT struct ( defined by us )
private struct FILECONTEXT
{
public IntPtr Handle ;
public System .
Int32 OriginalAPI ;
}
// Decode WM_COPYDATA sent from the unmanaged C++ file monitoring DLL
private void OnCopyData ( ref Message m )
{
COPYDATASTRUCT cds = new COPYDATASTRUCT ( ) ;
cds = ( COPYDATASTRUCT ) Marshal .
PtrToStructure ( m. LParam , typeof ( COPYDATASTRUCT ) ) ;
FILECONTEXTht = ( FILECONTEXT ) Marshal .
PtrToStructure ( cds. lpData , typeof ( FILECONTEXT ) ) ;
string strBufferData ;
int unManagedSize = Marshal .
SizeOf ( typeof ( FILECONTEXT ) ) ;
unsafe
{
byte * pString = ( byte * ) cds. lpData .
ToPointer ( ) ;
pString += unManagedSize ;
IntPtr pManString = new IntPtr ( ( void * ) pString ) ;
strBufferData = Marshal .
PtrToStringUni ( pManString ) ;
// TODO : strBufferData contains the text sent over by the
// file monitor .
Display it , analyze it , whatever .
}
}
And that 's all there is to it .
I had very little time to throw this code together so I hope you 'll excuse some of its obvious warts such as the use of unsafe C# code .
Think of it as a quick and dirty example of techniques rather than production botting code .
This code will be extended in Part 8 of this series ( already written , and due shortly ) in a direction you might not have guessed ...
Putting It All Together : the XFileMonitor Application
You 've seen what it looks like .
You 've read about the techniques behind it .
Time to download the thing and test it out .
The source code contains four projects :
An EXE project , implemented in C #
A DLL project , implemented in C ++
2 Detours projects : detours.dll and detoured.dll .
These projects boil down to essentially two files , which contain all the source code demonstrated above .
In addition , there are two projects needed by the Detours Library which you can mostly ignore .
Boost is not required for this project , and neither is NMAKE .
So those of you that had trouble building the FoldBot will hopefully find this project is a cleaner build .
And as usual , my standard source - code disclaimer applies !
Good luck , and enjoy .

It looks like a US Air Force robotic orbiter will push back the planned launch date of NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) .
The double satellite launch , originally set for November this year , will now take place sometime early 2009 .
They will make way for the test flight of the orbital Boeing X - 37B spaceplane , commandeering the Atlas V rocket flight originally intended for NASA .
According to the Air Force , the November X - 37B test flight will be a study into “ risk reduction , experimentation , and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies . ”
( There might also be some urgency due to the Shuttle decommissioning in 2010 … )
The X - 37B ’s predecessors have undergone exhaustive testing .
Based at Edwards Air Force Base , California , the US military has been testing automated spaceplanes for many years .
NASA has also been heavily involved in the program .
Originally tasked with developing a Space Manoeuvre Vehicle ( SMV ) that could either be launched by the Shuttle or by rocket , the US Air Force wanted an automated orbital vehicle that could carry out a multitude of tasks in space for up to a year .
The X - 40 design evolved and by 1998 , the vehicle was being dropped from helicopters and allowed to land like a conventional aircraft ( automatically ) .
The X - 40 military program was then passed to NASA to use as the basis of the X - 37 program .
After a long period of development , the X - 37A was used in conjunction with Scaled Composites WhiteKnightOne ( pictured below ) .
Now the brand new Boeing X - 37B is ready to be launched to begin its first automated orbital operations , re-enter and land conventionally .
The Atlas V rocket will blast off from Cape Canaveral and the X - 37B will hopefully land on schedule at Edwards Air Force Base .
The X - 37B is 27 ft ( 8 m ) long with a 15 ft ( 4.5 m ) wingspan and resembles a blindfolded mini-Shuttle ( it really does !
See the picture at the top of the article ) .
Although there will be a lot of anticipation for the X - 37B test flight , it is a shame for the lunar mission scientists who are currently preparing the LRO and LCROSS for their trip to the Moon .
The LRO ’s objective is to orbit the Moon , analysing the surface to aid future manned missions .
LCROSS has something a little more spectacular planned ; it will create two impact plumes during it ’s kamikaze mission in aid of detecting present water in the lunar rock .

We 've recommended a number of movies to the GeekDad readership , and we 've cautioned you against a few .
This time around , we 're giving you a list of geeky films that should have appealed to us , should have made us drool with geeky joy , but turned out to be duds .
These are movies that , if you missed them , then lucky you !
And make sure not to show them to your kids - they 'll thank you when they 're older .
( Ed. Note : Welcome Yahoo readers !
If this post gave you food for thought - or debate - consider checking out the poll we 're running today where you can pick your own most disappointing geeky movie from an expanded list based on the comments we 've received .
And enjoy GeekDad ! )
1. Mummy 3 : as mentioned not too long ago on this blog , M3 was potential wasted .
We all love Brendan when he's got a script and sharp co-starts to work with , but this one seemed as if he was denied both on purpose .
Add to that the actor playing his son was only 13 years his younger , while Brendan hardly looks a year older than he did back in the first film ( which was set nearly 20 years earlier ) and you 'll see why any geek worth their salt would snort derisively .
2. A.I. : The viral marketing for this movie on the internet set the tone for what Lost would do years later .
I 'll admit it , I was hooked - and eventually got the special movie poster that had my email handle printed on it as the special gift for everyone who had participated in the online mystery .
But while it was a pretty looking Spielberg pic , and gave us Jude Law in a career - making performance , ultimately it all felt flat , neither a compelling drama nor an overly impressive bit of science fiction .
3. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow : Again with the Jude Law .
This one had so much buzz - all green screen with amazing effects , and a grand retro-pulp adventure feel , we all hoped it would usher in an era of Doc Savage and Flash Gordon revivals .
But if you can't deliver a decent plot , and the actors get lost amidst the effect , people will simply shrug and walk away .
4 . The Time Machine : sometimes you 've got to wonder why remake a movie that was done really , really well in the past , if you can't deliver the same quality ?
Rod Taylor was full of geeky adventure in the 1960 version , and the decision to make the lead character American ?
Why ?
It 's an H.G. Wells story , for cripes sake !
And Guy Pierce is English ( ed. note : born English , grew up in Australia ) !
He could do the accent !
Saddest part ?
It was directed by the great grandson of the author , and it was still bad .
5. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory : speaking of why do a remake ...
When we heard Tim Burton was doing a new version of the Roald Dahl story , there was a lot of interest - knowing Burton 's distinct visual stylings , how would he interpret the classic tale ?
And with Johnny Depp on board as the enigmatic candy maker , this one seemed like a ready - made hit .
Alas , it was a pale reflection of the 1971 version , containing all the snark and none of the heart .
And while Depp 's performance was an interesting variation , no one could ever match Gene Wilder in the role .
Utterly pointless .
6. Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy : I may take some flack on this one , but I 'll stand by my sadness that this film was n't better .
It was enjoyable , for fans of the books , but did n't we all want it to wash over the planet with a life - changing wave of laughter ?
It had a good cast .
It had good special effects .
It had a reasonably - adapted screenplay ( though some of the adds were a bit odd ) .
But in the end , it was ... mostly harmless .
7. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen :
This one was really unforgivable .
The source material , a couple of graphic novels by Alan Moore , were some of the most literate pulp adventure ever devised .
Instead of working with that to craft a film of high adventure , they tore the concept apart , added a couple Americans to appeal to the movie - going audience , and changed a recovering opium addict into Sean Connery .
This movie gave steampunk a bad name .
8. Erik the Viking : This should have been Monty Python funny , but instead it was only Monty Hall funny .
I know , the joke does n't quite make sense , and neither did much of this movie .
In a way , Baron von Münchhausen was the smart film alternative to this , but neither one set the world on fire , much to our chagrin .
9. Matrix 2/3 : Sometimes , when a good movie is made , recognized as being good , and the filmmakers are given the money and creative freedom to expand their vision , you get greatness .
Not this time .
Where the first Matrix movie had been a lean , mind - twisting tale with groundbreaking special effects , the second and third were muddled , self - indulgent philosophical drivel with gaping plot holes .
Alas for what could have been .
10 . Waterworld :
At the time , it was the most expensive movie ever made .
A still - big Kevin Costner in a post - apocalyptic aquatic world should have been really really cool .
In the end , the best thing that ever came of it was the stunt show at Universal Studios Theme Park .
Ipod Video – A Green Product ?
After using a CD player and a bunch of cheap MP3 players which could hardly store a hundred songs I decided to get an iPod Video .
I was highly satisfied once I got it .
And instead of worrying about what songs to keep , I was worried about running out of songs to put inside !
At the time the 30GB was the latest model but nowadays you can get more storage .
But believe me unless you have thousands of CDs you ’ll probably be able to fit your whole music collection into the iPod .
As for the sound quality , it ’s great and you can do more than just play music .
You can also play games on your iPod , store pictures , and watch videos .
The games that it comes with get kind of boring after a while though .
I recommend getting Pacman or Tetris which can be obtained via iTunes .
In case you do n’t know what that is , it ’s the software that comes with your iPod and if you happen to lose the CD you can just download the latest version online .
That software will sync your music along with anything else you can store on your iPod .
But Is It Green ?
Anyway , now for the green stuff .
Being an eco-friendly dude I was n’t going to purchase just anything .
I did some research on it before pulling my wallet out to pay for it at the counter .
To be honest I was expecting it not to be eco-friendly .
Luckily , my expectations were wrong .
While it might not seem that buying this little device contributes to well being of the environment it actually does .
Why ?
Well for one it cuts down on the manufacturing of CDs / DVDs as they can easily be bought in digital format via iTunes .
Another thing is the life span – iPods generally last longer than a conventional CD player .
Since it has a built - in rechargeable battery you do n’t have to keep buying new batteries that you ’ll later have to throw away and will eventually rack up at the local landfill .
Last but not least , iPods are RoHS compliant which means they have reduced or eliminated hazardous materials such as lead , arsenic , etc .
Not to mention that Apple has recently cut down on packaging material , which saves millions of pounds of cardboard ( trees ) and plastic .
It ’s good that Apple has made sure their name is well as I would have been really disappointed in them to have such a name and be a threat to the environment .
Overall the iPod Video is not only helping you enjoy your music but the environment as well .
Once upon a time there was a graphical programming princess named Processing .
She conjured the most beautiful animations and interactive art in all the world !
Every artist wanted to work with her .
But the princess ’s castle lay within a vast colony of millworkers that , excepting her own court , had little appreciation for her talents .
Indeed , she was better known outside the colony than inside .
The few millworkers that did request an audience with the princess required her to wear their tool - laden overalls instead of her own elegant and simple gown .
As time passed , the exotic artists and artisans grew weary the journey to the mill , and to avoid this displeasure they they contrived a replica of the princess in papier - mâché .
Meanwhile , a promising new land was being cultivated …
Retrofitting the Processing Development Environment for Scala
Processing is both a language and environment .
While in this case language refers also to the API , Processing has a distinct syntax known internally as p5 that is converted into Java by a preprocessor .
This syntax dispenses with some qualities of Java that may be irksome to new programmers ( or old programmers ) with the help of an ANTLR generated parser .
Where the specialized syntax has benefits , it also has costs .
The build is more complicated , as ANTLR must first run against the grammar to generate Java sources to parse p5 .
This process is automated by shell scripts .
Additionally , the number of people that are comfortable working on language grammars is small ; the p5 grammar has yet to be updated to Java 1.5 generics and loops .
The Processing language and environment are being held back , presently , by the depth of their original ambition .
Writing a customized Java grammar was the right thing to do at the time of Processing ’s conception , with the JVM as the best cross- platform virtual machine and Java as its only fully realized language .
But now only the first of those things is true .
Basing Processing on the standard version of a more modern language would free it from a complicated build process and the need for regular attention from language wizards .
The language proposed here for that job is Scala , which ships off boatloads of Java cruft on sails of type inference .
Beyond that it allows API designers to vacuum remaining code hairballs with implicit conversions , first - class functions , and object mix-ins .
All of the syntax substitutions made by p5 ’s preprocessor are either unnecessary in Scala or can be equivalently performed by an underlying interface and implicit conversions .
One pioneer has blazed this trail to the point of calling the core library from Scala , but bringing the language into the environment is the key to preserving — and even improving — the remarkable student - friendliness of Processing .
Showing , not telling
Once you get into Git , you become a fork terrorist .
Ohh ho ho… what will we fork next ?
Web frameworks with inadequate support for RFC 2616 section 13 ?
Probably !
But this week it was the Processing Development Environment .
The fork started off as an attempt to replace the Eclipse Compiler for Java , used by the PDE , with Scala’s .
But then one thing lead to another and both the ECJ and ANTLR dependencies were on the cutting room floor .
The result :
That ’s a translation of a basic Processing example .
The only structural change is the dispersal of setup code .
In p5 ’s active mode , operations like size must be performed inside a method like setup .
But in Scala the wrapped top - level code becomes the base constructor , which is nested here in a draw proxy that is constructed in SApplet ’s setup method .
This conceit frees the user from needing to know the difference between construction and setting up , and allows global values to be initialized using methods that are not otherwise available until after construction ( eliminating a few lines of code in this case ) .
It ’s half - way to the simplicity of Processing ’s static mode and could eliminate the need for it , particularly since you can replace the blank template for new files with one that defines a blank draw method .
After the fork
For the moment the base SApplet class is still in Java , and lives in a forked core module .
If this experiment becomes anything serious it would be smarter to work with a completely stock core and build a separate module for Scala extensions , written in Scala .
The forked development environment will need a distinct name ( Spde ? ) and branding graphics (??? ) .
That all sounds really time consuming , but also fun , and not that difficult since a lot of old stuff can be discarded .
Instead of running sketches in a separate process it might be faster to do it directly and with some live reloading potential thanks to Scala ’s interpreter - concious compiler and / or JavaRebel ’s free Scala license .
Hello !
Now the fork has been converted to Buildr and is in a fresh , tiny repository .
The original clone will be used to merge upstream changes but wo n’t be published .
Hello again !
Now Spde has a site with downloads so you can skip all this building business .
Does anyone want to help with this ?
Is processing .org itself interested in moving to Scala ?
Whatever works !
Probably what would n’t work so well is for a lot of people to try to clone this branch from technically .us , which is technically on a DSL connection .
Many jars , and old versions of jars , are embedded therein .
Once the fork is converted to Buildr ( oh , yes ) those can be burned from the history ( or maybe it is easier to just have github serve the ancient jars and everything else ) .
But if you really want to play with it now and make improvements then you can try a shallow clone ( see note ) :
git clone git://technically.us/git/spde
And as for JavaScript : this ain’t over yet .
The title of this post was originally going to be “ Delicious : A Review from a Late Adopter . ”
But that was four months ago and only a few days after I started using social bookmarking site Delicious .
At the time , I found it useful even if lacking in a few areas .
But it only took a week before I went back to my old bookmarking habits with Firefox .
And now I ’m more excited about the latest bookmarking features in Firefox 3 ( due out later this month ) than the next version of Delicious , which is taking its sweet time .
The problem with Delicious ( for me , at least ) is that it required too much of me as a bookmarking service and did n’t provide me much as a place to find new content .
The first problem could be with how I browse the web .
I often find myself reading / browsing a dozen or so stories / websites at the same time .
For the most part , it ’s not a problem to have tons of tabs open in Firefox .
But I often get interrupted in my daily perusing and need to bookmark all the stories I ’m half way through or have n’t started reading ( the “ Bookmark All Tabs ” feature in Firefox ) .
Although I ’ve found a Firefox plugin that expedites the process of saving sites to Delicious , it ’s still one site / story at a time .
If I want to save a dozen at a time , I ’m obviously going to revert back to Firefox rather than complete twelve separate tasks .
As for using Delicious as a way to discover new content , well , I ’ve found it hard to filter out the noise and am generally uninterested in the majority of what the world is bookmarking ( apparently ) .
What about Digg ?
Even if Delicious came before Digg and is popular in its own right , Digg took the Delicious concept and made it really work as a more social way to find and share new content online .
But that was the Digg of what feels like a long time ago ( Digg is running on its third major revision while the second version of Digg was arguably the best ) .
We have covered Digg issues plenty before .
The site ’s problems are easy to sum up in one sentence :
It ’s slow , bloated , outdated , gamed , policed , etc .
As a result , the front page content is pretty lacking to say the least .
Now on to Reddit .
While Reddit has been around for a while , I never took it seriously , always thinking of it as “ Digg Light . ”
But it turns out that it does what Digg does but better and faster .
The latest version was released recently and makes it even more accessible to the masses .
I could go through all the reasons individually in detail , but I ’ll just summarize : fairly interesting content , intuitive interface , and very fast response .

WASHINGTON --
Two studies based on data from NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed that the Red Planet once hosted vast lakes , flowing rivers and a variety of other wet environments that had the potential to support life .
One study , published in the July 17 issue of Nature , shows that vast regions of the ancient highlands of Mars , which cover about half the planet , contain clay minerals , which can form only in the presence of water .
Volcanic lavas buried the clay - rich regions during subsequent , drier periods of the planet 's history , but impact craters later exposed them at thousands of locations across Mars .
The data for the study derives from images taken by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars , or CRISM , and other instruments on the orbiter .
"
The big surprise from these new results is how pervasive and long - lasting Mars ' water was , and how diverse the wet environments were , " said Scott Murchie , CRISM principal investigator at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Md . The clay - like minerals , called phyllosilicates , preserve a record of the interaction of water with rocks dating back to what is called the Noachian period of Mars ' history , approximately 4.6 billion to 3.8 billion years ago .
This period corresponds to the earliest years of the solar system , when Earth , the moon and Mars sustained a cosmic bombardment by comets and asteroids .
Rocks of this age have largely been destroyed on Earth by plate tectonics .
They are preserved on the moon , but were never exposed to liquid water .
The phyllosilicate - containing rocks on Mars preserve a unique record of liquid water environments possibly suitable for life in the early solar system .
"
The minerals present in Mars ' ancient crust show a variety of wet environments , " said John Mustard , a member of the CRISM team from Brown University , and lead author of the Nature study .
" In most locations the rocks are lightly altered by liquid water , but in a few locations they have been so altered that a great deal of water must have flushed though the rocks and soil .
This is really exciting because we 're finding dozens of sites where future missions can land to understand if Mars was ever habitable and if so , to look for signs of past life .
" Another study , published in the June 2 issue of Nature Geosciences , finds that the wet conditions on Mars persisted for a long time .
Thousands to millions of years after the clays formed , a system of river channels eroded them out of the highlands and concentrated them in a delta where the river emptied into a crater lake slightly larger than California 's Lake Tahoe , approximately 25 miles in diameter .
"
The distribution of clays inside the ancient lakebed shows that standing water must have persisted for thousands of years , " says Bethany Ehlmann , another member of the CRISM team from Brown .
Ehlmann is lead author of the study of an ancient lake within a northern - Mars impact basin called Jezero Crater .
" Clays are wonderful at trapping and preserving organic matter , so if life ever existed in this region , there 's a chance of its chemistry being preserved in the delta .
" CRISM 's high spatial and spectral resolutions are better than any previous spectrometer sent to Mars and reveal variations in the types and composition of the phyllosilicate minerals .
By combining data from CRISM and the orbiter 's Context Imager and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , the team identified three principal classes of water - related minerals dating to the early Noachian period .
The classes are aluminum - phyllosilicates , hydrated silica or opal , and the more common and widespread iron / magnesium - phyllosilicates .
The variations in the minerals suggest that different processes , or different types of watery environments , created them .
" Our whole team is turning our findings into a list of sites where future missions could land to look for organic chemistry and perhaps determine whether life ever existed on Mars , " said Murchie .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
The Applied Physics Laboratory operates the CRISM instrument in coordination with an international team of researchers from universities , government and the private sector .

XScreenSaver :
On Toolkit Dialogs
by Jamie Zawinski
19 - Oct-2004
Periodically , I get asked about converting the xscreensaver " unlock " dialog to use a toolkit such as GTK .
There are typically only two reasons that people give for wanting this :
It would be " prettier " if it used a toolkit .
The current dialog does not take advantage of toolkit - provided " accessibility " features , such as screen readers , magnifiers , and exotic input methods .
I think that # 1 can be solved without using a toolkit .
For a dialog as simple as the password entry box , the " look " of the toolkit really just comes down to colors , fonts , and border widths .
Personally , I think the current unlock dialog looks very much like the default GTK theme , but if you disagree , it 's easy to tweak it by simply editing the colors and border sizes in the app - defaults file .
( If you think you have changes that make it look more " conventional " , please send them to me .
There are a few examples of other looks in XScreenSaver.ad. )
Note :
It is now 2019 , and in the 15 years since I wrote those words , literally no one has ever done this .
So maybe people do n't care about the look of the dialog as much as they claim .
Reason # 2 is much more valid ; it 's true that it is very hard to make accessibility tools work without using a toolkit .
However , converting that dialog to use a toolkit turns out to be a very difficult thing to do securely .
And if the screen locker is not secure , then it 's better to not lock the screen at all : giving the impression of security when there is no actual security is far worse than having no security at all .
It 's a matter of expectations : if people do n't expect to be able to lock their screens , they 'll log out .
But if they expect to be able to lock their screens and it does n't actually work , then they 're screwed .
Minimal library usage by the xscreensaver daemon .
The xscreensaver daemon is a critical piece of security software .
The reason for this is that , as a screen locker , any bug in the program that causes it to crash will cause the screen to unlock .
As soon as xscreensaver is no longer running , the screen is no longer locked .
Therefore , great care must be taken to ensure that the daemon never crash .
And that it especially never crash as a result of ( hostile ) input from the keyboard or mouse .
Let 's suppose that down in the bowels of some particular version of some particular toolkit library , there lurks a bug .
Let 's suppose that the nature of this bug is something relatively obscure : say that it 's something like , if you hold down 5 keys on the keyboard for 10 seconds then drag the middle mouse button , the text entry widget gets a SEGV .
( In fact , I 'm not making this up : I saw this very bug once , years ago . )
Now , that 's the sort of bug that is not likely to be noticed or fixed , because it 's the sort of thing that people " never " do .
If that bug was reported against , say , a web browser , nobody would much care : User : " I can crash my web browser by doing this crazy thing ! "
Developer : " Uh , do n't do that then . "
And that 's not a totally unreasonable response .
However , in the context of security software , it matters , because then it's not merely a cute trick that crashes the program : now it 's a backdoor password that unlocks the screen .
Bugs like that will exist in GUI libraries ; it 's inevitable .
The libraries are big , and do many different things .
So one way to protect against that problem is to keep the number of libraries used by the xscreensaver daemon to an absolute minimum .
Today , the only libraries that are actually linked into the xscreensaver daemon are Xlib and dependent libraries ; and the few crypto-related libraries needed to determine whether a typed password is , in fact , the right one .
That 's why I implemented the unlock dialog using only Xlib : not because I think Xlib is a good way to write user interfaces , but because I think this was the safest way .
The amount of code in Xlib is very small , and has been extensively security audited .
It is very unlikely that there are crashing bugs lurking in Xlib itself .
The same cannot be said for larger , more featureful libraries .
So , by making minimal use of Xlib ( the dialog box is drawn using only the lowest level text - printing and rectangle - drawing routines ) we can keep the code path short and auditable .
I am as close to certain as I can be that there is no action a user can take on their input devices that will cause the current Xlib - based lock dialog in xscreensaver to unlock .
That 's because it's a small amount of code that I have stared at and tested for a very long time .
It is a small enough piece of code that I ( believe I ) know every possible path through it .
Introduce N layers of widget library , general text field handling , compose processing , input methods , I18N ... and all bets are off .
Who knows what bugs wait lurking in there ; who knows which particular combinations of which libraries are a security - bug timebomb .
Let me put that another way :
The GTK and GNOME libraries have never been security - audited to the extent that their maintainers would be willing to make the claim , " under no circumstances will this library ever crash . "
One can , within a reasonable doubt , make that claim about libc , or even about Xlib , but not about anything the size of GTK .
It 's just too big to be sure .
This is not a criticism of GTK or GNOME or their authors : it 's simply a truth about any piece of software of that size .
All password boxes are not alike .
It 's worth noting an important difference between a screen locker and a login manager ( that is , between xscreensaver and gdm . )
The login box on something like gdm can safely use a toolkit in a way that xscreensaver cannot , because of the simple fact that while gdm is running , nobody is yet logged in .
What happens if a user finds a way to crash gdm by typing noise at the login box ?
Nothing much : if gdm crashes , there 's still nobody logged in ( and gdm is probably just automatically restarted . )
But if xscreensaver crashes , the screen is unlocked , and our attacker is now logged in as the person who locked their screen .
Segregation of library usage .
There is one obvious part of xscreensaver that uses toolkits : the " xscreensaver - demo " program uses GTK ( and there have in the past been versions that used the Motif and Athena toolkits too . )
This is perfectly safe , because that program is not a part of the xscreensaver daemon itself : it 's a separate program that lets you send messages to the running xscreensaver daemon .
If there were a crashing bug in xscreensaver - demo , it could not result in the screen unlocking .
So that suggests one way of making the lock dialog use a toolkit : move the lock dialog out of the xscreensaver daemon process altogether .
Make it be a separate program that the daemon invokes in such a way that , if the lock dialog crashes , the daemon neither crashes nor unlocks the screen .
If that can be accomplished , then the presence of a crashing bug in the toolkit is no longer a critical security problem .
Splitting out the lock dialog .
So , you want xscreensaver to invoke the " unlock dialog " program and wait for a response .
The unlocker would use a GUI toolkit , and would be linked against the various security libraries .
Perhaps the way it would work is that it would print either " yes " or " no " on stdout , depending on whether a password was correctly entered .
Were it to crash , the daemon would take that that to mean " no " ...
In fact , this approach would actually reduce the number of libraries ( and thus , lines of code ) in the daemon itself , since the daemon would not need to link against things like PAM and crypto .
That 's a good thing .
So that does n't sound hard so far , except that the xscreensaver daemon has the keyboard grabbed .
It 's pretty important that it hold that grab , because otherwise keystrokes tend to go " through " the xscreensaver window and reach random desktop windows underneath .
This begs the question of , how do the keystrokes get to the unlock dialog at all ?
That 's a difficult question .
Understanding how to do that right requires a lot of knowledge about X ( which I have ) but also probably a lot of knowledge about foreign - language input methods and screen readers and other accessibility - ware ( which I do not have . )
Transfer grabs ?
Since xscreensaver blanks the screen using an override - redirect window ( that is , a window that is not under window manager control ) it is necessary for it to grab the keyboard and mouse .
Without that , the window manager would continue to send events to whatever window last had focus .
That 's obviously a bad thing , as it results in people typing their passwords into IRC channels .
In the current system , where the same process is the creator of both the screen - blanking window and the unlock dialog , this is not a problem : that process gets all the events it wants .
But when they are in different processes , we need a way for the keyboard and mouse events to get to the process driving the unlock dialog .
So you 'd like to transfer the grabs from the xscreensaver daemon to the unlock dialog , and then transfer them back afterward .
Unfortunately , there is no way to transfer grabs atomically in X .
The best you could do is this : daemon process : dialog process : 1 : spawns dialog process 2 : loops , repeatedly trying to grab kbd and mouse 3 : releases grabs 4 : grabs succeed 5 : waits for dialog process to exit 6 : exits ( or crashes ) thus ungrabbing 7 : re-grabs kbd and mouse
There are two race conditions here : between steps 3 and 4 , and between steps 6 and 7 .
In those periods the keyboard and mouse are ( briefly ) not grabbed at all .
There are two bad things that could happen there .
First , the keyboard or mouse might become grabbed by some third program ( a popup window from something else on the desktop , for example . )
Or second , the user might type a keystroke at just the wrong time .
That keystroke would then go to neither xscreensaver nor the unlock dialog , but instead to some other window on the desktop .
So , that 'd be bad .
Synthetic events ?
Another possibility is for the xscreensaver daemon to keep its grabs , meaning that all keyboard and mouse events would go to it ; but then for it to use XSendEvent ( ) to generate synthetic events on the lock dialog window .
That is , the xscreensaver daemon would read a KeyPress , and then would simulate an exact duplicate of that KeyPress on the lock dialog window .
There are a few potential problems with this approach :
It 's possible for applications to tell " real " and " synthetic " events apart , and it 's not unusual for toolkits to ignore synthetic events , as a security measure .
I do n't know whether GTK does this or not ( though it 's easy to find out , I guess . )
I do n't know how the currently - popular input methods and accessibility tools work ; if they are embedded in the unlock dialog itself , this wo n't be a problem .
If , however , they work by popping up a second window ( e.g. , another window off to the side that you type in to , or an on - screen keyboard or something ) then we have the problem of figuring out which window to send the events to .
Remember , when the screen is locked , the window manager is not involved at all : it does n't see any of these windows .
The windows do not have title bars .
You can't click and drag them around .
You can't click to change focus .
Your favorite window - management keystrokes do n't work .
If it 's necessary to have full window management of arbitrary windows in order for the accessibility tools to work , well , that 's a big problem ...
In summary :
Making the xscreensaver unlock dialog securely use a toolkit is difficult , but possible , were a knowledgeable person to do the work .
If the work were done well ( by which I mean : clearly commented and documented , and with obvious attention paid to the security implications )
I would be happy to incorporate those changes into the xscreensaver distribution .
Making the unlock dialog also be able to take advantage of accessibility tools is probably a lot harder .
I do n't know how much harder , because I 'm not an accessibility expert .
But anyone intending to implement that had better be both an expert on accessibility , and well versed in secure X11 programming , because the security implications of getting it wrong would be dire indeed .
Epilogue , 2016 : I told you so .
Apple Computer again cracked the top three in U.S. PC sales for the second quarter , according to surveys released Wednesday by both Gartner and IDC .
Apple Computer again cracked the top three in U.S. PC sales for the second quarter , according to surveys released Wednesday by both Gartner and IDC .
Worldwide , Apple did n't make the top five PC vendors , according to both firms .
But within the U.S. , IDC estimated that Apple finished in a virtual dead heat with Acer for third place , just 2,000 units behind the Asian PC maker .
Gartner , meanwhile , said that Apple took the third - place spot outright , topping Acer by 65,000 PCs sold .
Both IDC and Gartner retroactively ranked Apple fourth in sales for the second quarter of 2007 , if measured against a merged Acer - Gateway business .
If treated as separate companies , Apple would have maintained its third - place ranking .
Both sets of data are preliminary , the firms said .
The PC sales estimates include desktops , laptops , and X86 servers , but not handheld PCs .
Ultraportables and so - called mini-notes were also included , although Gartner estimated that they represented just 3 percent of the market .
Domestically , Dell maintained its top spot , capturing 31.9 percent of the market according to Gartner , with 5.25 million PCs sold ; IDC said that Dell 's market share was 32.0 percent , with 5.44 million PCs sold .
Both firms estimated that Dell grew between 11 and 12 percent from the same quarter a year ago .
HP finished second in U.S. sales , with a 25.3 percent share according to Gartner , and a 25.1 percent share according to IDC ; the firm sold 4.17 million and 4.26 million PCs , according to the respective firms .
HP 's year - over - year growth was sluggish , about 5.6 to 5.9 percent .
Treated as a merged company that included Gateway 's results , Acer 's sales slipped about 20.8 percent from year to year , finishing at 1.33 million shipments or about an 8.1 percent market share , according to Gartner .
Apple , however , showed tremendous growth : 38.1 percent year over year , Gartner said , or 31.7 percent by IDC 's estimates .
Apple sold 1.40 million units , according to Gartner , and 1.32 million according to IDC .
In total , that gave Apple an 8.5 percent or a 7.8 percent market share , according to the respective firms .
According to Gartner , total U.S. PC shipments increased 4 percent to 16.4 million units .
But the firm also said that U.S. consumers are increasingly turning to low - end machines as a way to save money .
" Home mobile PCs continue to have momentum in the U.S. market .
However , ASP declines were greater here than in other segments .
The retail space was a harsh pricing environment during the quarter , " according to Mika Kitagawa , the Gartner analyst in charge of the report .
Worldwide , PC shipments rose 15.3 percent according to IDC , to 70.6 million units .
On a global scale , the top five vendors showed excellent growth ; fourth - ranked Lenovo grew the least of the group , at 14.6 percent .
HP grew 16.8 percent to lead the market with 13.3 million units shipped , and a 18.9 percent market share .
Dell was second , growing 21.4 percent to 11.6 million units and a 16.4 percent share .
Third - ranked Acer grew 63.5 percent when Gateway 's numbers were factored in , finishing with 6.97 million units and a 9.9 percent share .
Lenovo sold 5.6 million units and finished with a 7.9 percent market share , while Toshiba grew 28.5 percent to 3.1 million units and a 4.4 percent share .
Editor 's Note : The IDC and Gartner results were for the second quarter , not the third , as the story originally stated .
A new grenadelike gadget — designed to quickly extinguish flames in small quarters , thereby limiting injury to victims as well as firefighters — is becoming an important part of firemen 's arsenals .
More than 37 fire departments along the U.S. east coast now carry Vancouver - based ARA Safety 's FIT - 5 ( for fire interruption technology ) .
The device , available to firefighters since December , is a means of knocking down or even extinguishing fires in rooms , basements and attics .
The FIT - 5 ( price tag : around $ 1,300 ) is a nine - pound ( four - kilogram ) red disk that resembles a land mine and is deployed like a grenade :
A firefighter pulls its cord and tosses the disk into the area engulfed in flames ; within seconds the FIT - 5 releases a wispy cloud of potassium carbonate , a flame retardant that suppresses combustion and disrupts fire at the molecular level .
The company says the device can fully extinguish a class B ( fuel - based ) fire in a room 2,100 cubic feet ( 60 cubic meters ) or less and reduce fire temperatures from 1,000 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit ( 540 to 150 degrees Celsius ) in less than 10 seconds .
The FIT - 5 is also designed to control class A ( wood - based ) fires enough so that firefighters can douse them with water .
Firefighters in New York State and New Jersey have successfully contained three fires ( in a room on the third floor of a house and two in basements ) with the FIT - 5 since it hit the market .
The FIT - 5 is designed to be most effective in a contained space — the larger the area , the less effective , which is why it is not a good candidate for squelching , say , wildfires .
Most handheld fire extinguishers sold at hardware stores for home use are pressurized with nitrogen or carbon dioxide to propel powdery potassium bicarbonate , liquid water or a fluorocarbon at a fire .
In addition to allowing firefighters to control fires from a safe distance , the FIT - 5 could also replace halon fluorocarbons , an effective fire - fighting tool until they were banned in 1994 after it was discovered that they destroy Earth 's ozone layer .
Because halon displaces oxygen , it extinguished electrical , grease and other fires that water alone could not , says Robert Kaul , ARA Safety 's technical director .
When a firefighter approaches a fire and pulls the rip cord located on the side of the FIT - 5 device , this generates a spark of heat that leads to a thermal reaction within the FIT - 5 .
Within 10 seconds the container releases a white cloud of potassium carbonate aerosol that expands to fill an enclosure ( room , basement , attic ) .
A FIT - 5 grenade is unlikely to leak and works when wet because it is not pressurized and has a sealed outer casing that keeps moisture out .
In addition , even if the rip cord is not pulled , the device will automatically dispense the when placed in temperatures exceeding 500 degrees F ( 260 degrees C ) .
" Once the FIT - 5 is done , you 're left with potassium carbonate powder , which can be vacuumed or swept clean , " says Michael Gardner , ARA Safety 's director of marketing .
Of course , potassium carbonate , used in the production of soap and glass , must be handled carefully ; it can be dangerous if inhaled ( by irritating the respiratory tract and causing coughing and shortness of breath ) or swallowed , potentially damaging the gastrointestinal tract and causing nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
The odorless chemical can also severely irritate the eyes or skin if it comes in contact with either .
Andrew Schmidt , chief of Morris County , N.J. 's Jefferson Township Fire Department ( about 45 miles northwest of New York City ) used a FIT - 5 in April to contain a basement fire in the nearby town of West Milford .
Because most of the fire departments in the area are volunteer , Schmidt was unable to marshal much of a firefighting squad at 3 P.M. , when most of his volunteers were working their day jobs .
On arriving at the burning basement , he broke one of the windows and tossed in an FIT - 5 , which held the flames in check until the fire trucks arrived .
" When you do n't have a truck , and you do n't have water , you 've got to do something , " he says , adding that West Milford ended up using less than 200 gallons ( 750 liters ) of water to extinguish a fire that easily could have required 6,000 gallons ( 22,700 liters ) to put out .
Schmidt was so impressed that he has become trainer and consultant for ARA Safety .
The company is now exploring developing a larger version of the device and hopes to within the next year offer a fixed system for homes and businesses that could be mounted on a wall or ceiling like a smoke detector and switched on when needed .
This would be particularly useful in rooms containing lots of computers or other electronic equipment that would be ruined if water was used to douse the flames .
As nuclear energy attracts increasing attention worldwide , because of its extremely low life - cycle greenhouse - gas emissions profile , three new or improved atomic fission - based tech - nologies are available or under development to meet the planet ’s energy needs .
These are advanced light ( or heavy ) water reactors ( LWRs or HWRs ) , high temperature gas - cooled reactors ( HTGRs ) , and fast breeder reactors ( FBRs ) .
( South Africa ’s pebble - bed modular reactor – PBMR – falls into the category of HTGRs . )

In most parts of the world , the LWR or HWR has been the dominant design for nuclear power reactors for many years now , and the advanced LWRs are the latest generation of this technology .
“ This new generation of LWRs came into being during the 1990s , ” explains Stanford University Centre for International Security and Cooperation consulting professor Dr Chaim Braun .
“ They were developed mostly to retain the best practices of the older generations of LWRs , that had operated up until that time , and improve the performance of the reactor , in terms of its overall safety , ease of operation , and reliability , as well as incorporating the lessons learned in the Three Mile Island accident , in the US , and the Chernobyl accident , in the Ukraine , ensuring that such accidents do not happen again .
“ What went wrong in the past would be corrected by better designed reactors and in part by better training of the plant operators . ”

HTGRs , unlike LWRs , use most of the thermal energy generated in their reactor cores , and this is their great promise .
“ In a LWR , ” elucidates Braun , “ only a third of the thermal energy generated is used effectively , to make electricity .
“ The other two - thirds of the heat generated in the reactor core is essentially released into the atmosphere or into bodies of water . ”
HTGRs are thus much more efficient than LWRs .
This makes them superior in terms of the sustainability of uranium resources .
Also , because HTGRs produce a lot of high - tem - perature heat , they can be used to provide process heat for industrial applications , such as in chemical plants , the extraction of oil from tar sands , the production of hydrogen , and even in steelmaking .
As this process heat cools , it could also be used in applications requiring lower temperatures , such as refining and water desalination .
Thus , HTGRs could form the core of major industrial complexes .
South Africa ’s PBMR – one of several designs of the HTGR – would be especially suitable for process heat applications , owing to its modular nature .
FBRs are remarkable in that they produce – or breed – more fuel than they consume .
Neutrons play a key role in the process of atomic fission in the cores of all reactor designs .
Normally , every reactor contains a moderator – such as water or carbon – to slow down the neutrons , but FBRs do not have moderators , so they employ fast - moving neutrons to bring about fission – hence , the term ‘ fast breeder reactors ’ .
FBRs are cooled by liquid sodium ( LWRs are cooled by water , and HTGRs by helium gas ) and use a mixture of plutonium and uranium oxide as fuel .
The core of an FBR is surrounded by a blanket of uranium oxide and , during operation , some of this is converted into plutonium , which can be extracted and used as fuel .
An FBR produces more plutonium than it consumes .
Futher , an FBR can extract about 60 times the energy from uranium than LWRs can .
“ Eventually , an FBR will produce not just enough fuel to keep its own cycle running and operating for its lifetime , but will produce enough fuel to start another FBR – and so on and so on , ” points out Braun .
However , an FBR is only really practical if the country , or operator , already has operational LWRs , which are needed to produce the plutonium required to fuel the FBR , and if the country of operation has developed commercial technologies for used fuel reprocessing and fresh fuel fabrication .
( Plutonium is a by - product of the nuclear reactions that take place in the core of a LWR ; it is part of the used fuel and is extracted by reprocessing that spent fuel . )
“ But , eventually , FBRs could , if they got enough fuel of their own , keep their own cycle going , ” he says .
“ However , we are talking about tens of years , perhaps , a hundred years , to set up a wholly independent self - sustaining system of FBRs . ”

John McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate literally rocked America .
It caused the nation to scramble for information on her , made her the most famous Alaskan citizen ever and introduced the term " hockey mom " to the American public .
How will her views on health care affect the American public ?
Alaska 's purchase was originally known as Seward 's Folly , the selection of Sarah Palin as VP may very well be McCain 's Folly .
Free Market
Sarah Palin is for free market insurance , basically the same system we currently have right now .
You know , it 's the one that does n't work and denies millions of poor people protection .
She has the benefit of receiving a government funded plan but she is in favor of denying that same type of coverage to 46 million uninsured Americans .
In her ultimate act of free market insurance , she voted against Alaska 's Certificate of Need program .
The program requires hospitals to get government approval to expand or create new property .
The CON plan restrains facility costs and allows for coordinated planning of new construction and services .
By voting against Alaska 's CON program and being in favor of free market care , she is stating that care is an economic product that is subject to market forces .
Basically , she believes care is no different than your local retail outlet .
Ca n't afford it , tough luck !
Maybe there will be a day after Thanksgiving sale .
Gun Control
Do we really need a gun toting woman with a lifetime membership to the NRA having a major hand in our policies ?
Sarah Palin has aligned herself with the Alaskan Independence Party , whose gun control motto is : Gun control is hitting your target .
She is in favor of gun-safety education for children .
She wants to arm our children to teach them gun safety , but if there is an unfortunate accident during one of these sessions the proper insurance is only going to be administered to people that can afford it .
I 'm not really sure what the policy is up in Alaska or what goes on during one of her moose hunting trips , but if we are going to arm everyone in America without restriction , can we at least give everyone in America proper coverage without restriction ?
Her plan truly is a bridge to nowhere .

It ’s nice that a prominent columnist gave Orthodox Jews some positive press after so many scandals .
But his praise is misguided at best and agenda - driven at worst .
Probably no more than the top 10 percent of Brooklyn ’s Orthodox Jews will ever shop at Pomegranate , the luxury kosher supermarket recently featured by The New York Times ’ columnist David Brooks in a column titled “ The Orthodox Surge . ”
Brooks chose the upscale kosher version of Whole Foods as the fulcrum of an admiring piece on Orthodox Jewish life in America , writing of the Orthodox “ sense of collective purpose ” and the “ external moral order ” that governs Orthodox Jewish lives .
It ’s nice of Brooks to give Orthodox Jews some positive press after so many scandals within our community and among other religious denominations .
But his praise is misguided at best and agenda - driven at worst .
Personally , I wish social critics would look elsewhere for their ideological ammunition and leave us alone .
Brooklyn has enough upper - middle - class Orthodox Jews that a gourmet shop like Pomegranate can be an over­night success .
But as in general society , the upper stratum is just cream floating on a sea of the working - class and working - poor struggling to get through each week and blessing the Almighty for each day .
The average Orthodox Jew in Brooklyn cannot afford Pomegranate ; thousands each week rely on food pantries stocked by organizations like the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty and Sephardic Bikur Holim .
Approximately two - thirds of New York ’s needy Jews live in Brooklyn .
The average Orthodox family lives on a tight budget , and that includes many of those 10 - percenters .
They struggle to keep up with household bills , yeshiva tuitions , support for community needs and extravagances like any other American .
By extolling the “ trendy ” minority of Orthodox Jews , Brooks not only misrepresents who most of us are .
He also reinforces the peer pressure so many feel to keep pursuing that brass ring rather than owning our material limitations and imbuing them with sanctity and purpose .
Behind Brooks ’ column is the notion that if people are successful — say , enough to afford fancy meats and artisanal kosher cheeses — then they must be worthy of admiration and emulation .
Had Brooks asked Pomegranate ’s owner , he might have heard about how he provides food to the community ’s free kosher restaurant for those without cash .
The well - heeled Orthodox have every right to spend where they like , and they probably donate more than most of their non-Orthodox and non-Jewish peers .
And most of them are decent and devoted .
But so are most Americans .
Maybe we pray three times a day , put on tefillin ( at least the men ) , and educate our children in the laws of our heritage .
This , however , does not mean that general society is morally bankrupt .
Are secular Americans less worthy or less serious than their religious compatriots ?
Are all Orthodox Jews , or most adherents of any religious doctrine , more moral than others ?
Many of my fellow Orthodox Jews are proud and flattered by Brooks ’ praise , but what is he praising ?
It ’s the equivalent of being interviewed on TV and told your tie looked perfect .
What about the substance beyond a truly magnificent store and the standard - issue minivan ?
By playing the prosperity card to prove our moral superiority , Brooks actually undermines that claim .
The holiest Sabbath cholent stew I ’ve ever tasted , more than 25 years ago , did not contain the requisite red meat but rather chicken parts .
A struggling family that could n’t even afford a couple pounds of flanken was nevertheless hosting college students for a meal .
When shared with guests , these meager fixings express the genuine meaning of Shabbat hospitality and the Divine presence .
And yet , Brooks judges Orthodoxy ’s success by how those with the means choose to spend their disposable income .
The value of the Jewish way of life is in our ethics and not our prices .
This is most readily evident among those with little money or power .
We extol the observance of mitzvahs — religious commandments — with elegance , but not with extravagance .

Men are more likely to be devoted and loyal husbands when they lack a particular variant of a gene that influences brain activity , researchers announced yesterday  the first time that science has shown a direct link between a man 's genes and his aptitude for monogamy .
The finding is striking because it not only links the gene variant  which is present in two of every five men  with the risk of marital discord and divorce , but also appears to predict whether women involved with these men are likely to say their partners are emotionally close and available , or distant and disagreeable .
The presence of the gene variant , or allele , also seems predictive of whether men get married or live with women without getting married .
" Men with two copies of the allele had twice the risk of experiencing marital dysfunction , with a threat of divorce during the last year , compared to men carrying one or no copies , " said Hasse Walum , a behavioral geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm who led the study .
" Women married to men with one or two copies of the allele scored lower on average on how satisfied they were with the relationship compared to women married to men with no copies . "
The scientists studied men because the hormone being examined is known to play a larger role in their brains than in women 's brains ....
Walum said that ... the study is the latest piece of evidence to show that biology  down to the level of individual genes  can play a powerful role in shaping complex human behavior .
The allele ... regulates the activity of a hormone in the brain known as vasopressin .
It dictates how and where vasopressin receptors are situated in the brain .
Effectively , said Larry J. Young , a psychiatrist who studies the genetics of social behavior at Emory University , brain receptors act like locks , and vasopressin acts like a key .
The key works only when there is a lock ; in the absence of a receptor , vasopressin cannot act .
All the scientists emphasized that more work needs to be done to replicate the finding , and to explore possible interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors ....
There has been speculation about the role of the hormone vasopressin in humans ever since we discovered that variations in where receptors for the hormone are expressed makes prairie voles strictly monogamous but meadow voles promiscuous ; vasopressin is related to the " cuddle chemical " oxytocin .
Now it seems variations in a section of the gene coding for a vasopressin receptor in people help to determine whether men are serial commitment - phobes or devoted husbands .
... Given that everyone surveyed had been in their relationship for at least five years , the team suggests that having multiple copies somehow contributes to commitment problems in men .
Because the results were collected for a different study the team could n't quiz the men on whether they were faithful , says Walum .
... Walum 's colleague Paul Lichtenstein says the team 's next task is to test how a nasal vasopressin spray affects altruism and jealousy .
... Journalists rushed headlong into the " divorce gene . "
" Whether a man has one type of gene versus another could help decide whether he 's good ' husband material , ' " announces HealthDay News .
" Marriage problems ?
Husband 's genes may be to blame , " says a Reuters headline writer .
" Marital woes can often be attributed to men's genetic make - up , " declares Agence - France Press ....
Taking the prize for carelessness is the [ London ]
Telegraph , who coined the term " divorce gene " ....
...NPR's All Things Considered also parrots the " new excuse " line , but qualifies it well : bioethicist Erik Parens ... [ notes ] that " it 's possible to have the gene variant but not have the marital difficulties , " and vice versa .
" Human relationships are so complicated , " Parens is paraphrased as saying , " that the effect of any one gene would be very small . "
Furthermore , the study 's fine print notes a previously observed and tentative link between the genetic variation and autism .
Men with " bad " genes  or " bad " neural networks  might not be two - timing gigolos , but people who are bad at communicating and social interaction .
Genetic variation in the vasopressin receptor 1a gene ( AVPR1A ) associates with pair - bonding behavior in humans
Hasse Walum , Lars Westberg , Susanne Henningsson , Jenae M. Neiderhiser , David Reiss , Wilmar Igl , Jody M. Ganiban , Erica L. Spotts , Nancy L. Pedersen , Elias Eriksson , and Paul Lichtenstein .
Pair - bonding has been suggested to be a critical factor in the evolutionary development of the social brain .
The brain neuropeptide arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) exerts an important influence on pair - bonding behavior in voles .
There is a strong association between a polymorphic repeat sequence in the 5 ′ flanking region of the gene ( avpr1a ) encoding one of the AVP receptor subtypes ( V1aR ) , and proneness for monogamous behavior in males of this species .
It is not yet known whether similar mechanisms are important also for human pair - bonding .
Here , we report an association between one of the human AVPR1A repeat polymorphisms ( RS3 ) and traits reflecting pair - bonding behavior in men , including partner bonding , perceived marital problems , and marital status , and show that the RS3 genotype of the males also affects marital quality as perceived by their spouses .
These results suggest an association between a single gene and pair - bonding behavior in humans , and indicate that the well characterized influence of AVP on pair - bonding in voles may be of relevance also for humans .
Maybe you 've seen the breathless news coverage of the " monogamy gene " that researchers in Sweden have supposedly found .
The gene affects receptors of vasopressin in the brain .
Vasopressin is one of the famous hormones ( along with dopamine , oxytocin , and phenylethylamine , PEA ) that are involved in falling in love , limerence , NRE , and bonding behavior in both humans and animals .
In a sample of 552 Swedish couples , men who had the genetic culprit were more likely to have colder , conflict - prone marriages and to show other signs of poor relationship behavior .
What the reseachers actually seem to have found is a gene that affectsnot necessarily a " monogamy gene . "
It 's being called that because monogamy is the only type of intimate , committed sexual bonding that the news media grasp .
Test people living in triads and quads for the gene , and I have a hunch that they 'll score unusually low for the problem genetic trait , rather than unusually high as people might naively expect .
Hey researchers , here 's a project !
Not just because it might tell interesting things about polys , but because it would refine the actual effect of the gene and its vasopressin mechanism .
Does lack of the gene promote successful monogamy directly ?
Or does it merely promote intimate connections generally ?... including the polyamorous generalization of couple - love into something wider .
Polys would be a tool to split that difference in the gene 's effect .

How Trump and Biden are preparing for their first debate
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are taking vastly different approaches in preparing for the first debate of the presidential election .
