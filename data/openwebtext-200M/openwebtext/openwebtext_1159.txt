If someone 3 months ago would have said to me , do you see any reason why you would stop devoting so much time to Flash / Flex in the next year .
I would have said not a chance .
I love interactive content on the web and more specifically interactive 3D within a browser .
I have long history with AS3 and the only other “ competitors ” ( Silverlight and HTML5 ) are n’t capable of what I would need them to do .
My world got turned upside down the day I was shown the Unity Web Player .
I froze , my jaw dropped , this was amazing .
I had seen demos of Unity before in presentations about iPhone development , but this was different , this was in a browser .
Most importantly it meant I could program full 3D in C# for the web .
So I went back to my original list of reasons why I was not interested in Unity the first time I saw it .
Firstly it was really for iPhone and Wii development at the time , but now it ’s also for the web .
The next reason being , I did n’t own a Mac .
After doing some reading I realized that sure enough the Unity guys have dealt with that , the editor was now available for Windows .
My last reason was price , but since this tool is so great I could deal with the price .
In theory I would be in , but there was one other reason that had n’t occurred to me .
What about the thousands of hours I ’ve put into AS3 development .
Separation anxiety , going from a place where I know so much , to a place where I know nothing .
After a week of thought on the topic , I decided that Unity3D development was what I had to do .
This was what I was waiting for , it just did n’t come in the form of a new Flash Player release .
It has been roughly a month since the shift in my spare time over to Unity3D and I could n’t be happier , the power and the opportunities are incredible .
So this is why there has been a little drought in examples on this blog , Unity3D has stolen my free time .
This does not mean nothing new is coming , I ’m actually finishing up some JigLibFlash stuff as I write this ( so clearly Unity3D has n’t stole all my free time ) .
I am also hoping in the coming months that I will have some Unity3D examples to put up on this blog .
If you have n’t already done so please go check out Unity3D now .
I have one final comment and it is for Adobe : I know your plan is to unify the mobile player with the web player .
In doing this you are slowing down the advancement of the web player to a point that by the time you have them ready to unify , there might not be anything left to unify .
Pennsylvania researchers using gene therapy have made significant improvements in vision in 12 patients with a rare inherited visual defect , a finding that suggests it may be possible to produce similar improvements in a much larger number of patients with retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration .
The team last year reported success with three adult patients , an achievement that was hailed as a major accomplishment for gene therapy .
They have now treated an additional nine patients , including five children , and find that the best results are achieved in the youngest patients , whose defective retinal cells have not had time to die off .
The youngest patient , 9 - year - old Corey Haas , was considered legally blind before the treatment began .
He was confined largely to his house and driveway when playing , had immense difficulties in navigating an obstacle course and required special enlarging equipment for books and help in the classroom .
Today , after a single injection of a gene - therapy product in one eye , he rides his bike around the neighborhood , needs no assistance in the classroom , navigates the obstacle course quickly and has even played his first game of softball .
The results are “ astounding , ” said Stephen Rose , chief scientific officer of Foundation Fighting Blindness , which supported the work but was not involved directly .
“ The big take - home message from this is that every individual in the group had improvement . . . and there were no safety issues at all . ”
The study “ holds great promise for the future ” and “ is appealing because of its simplicity , ” wrote researchers from the Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands in an editorial accompanying the report , which was published online Saturday by the journal Lancet .
The 12 patients had Leber ’s congenital amaurosis , which affects about 3,000 people in the United States and perhaps 130,000 worldwide .
Victims are born with severely impaired vision that deteriorates until they are totally blind , usually in childhood or adolescence .
There is no treatment .
Leber ’s is a good candidate for gene therapy because most of the visual apparatus is intact , particularly at birth and in childhood .
Mistakes in 13 different genes are known to cause it , but all 12 of the patients suffered a defect in a gene called RPE65 .
This gene produces a vitamin A derivative that is crucial for detecting light .
About five children are born each year in the United States with that defect , which was chosen because researchers at the Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine had cloned the gene , making copies available for use .
The study , led by Dr. Katherine A. High , Dr. Albert M. Maguire and Dr. Jean Bennett of those two institutions , enrolled five people in the United States , five from Italy and two from Belgium .
Five were children , and the oldest was 44 .
The good copy of the RPE65 gene was inserted into a defanged version of a human adenovirus .
The engineered virus then invaded retinal cells and inserted the gene into the cells ’
DNA .
Maguire used a long , thin needle to insert the preparation into the retina of the worst eye in each of the patients .
Within two weeks , the treated eyes began to become more sensitive to light , and within a few more weeks , vision began to improve .
The younger the patients were , the better they responded .
That was expected , Bennett said , because similar results had been observed in dogs and rodents .
By both objective and subjective measures , vision improved for all the patients .
They were able to navigate obstacle courses , read eye charts and perform most of the tasks of daily living .
The improvement has now persisted for as long as two years .
The children who were treated “ are now able to walk and play just like any normally sighted child , ” Maguire said .
Bennett noted that the oldest patient in the trial , a mother , had not been able to walk down the street to meet her children at school .
“ Now she can .
She also achieved her primary goal , which was to see her daughter hit a home run . ”
There are clear limitations to the study .
The patients ’ vision was not corrected to normal because of the damage that had already been done to the retina , and only one eye was treated .
“ The big elephant in the room is : Can you treat the other eye ? ” Rose said .
The foundation will put more funding into the research “ to make sure that if you go back and treat the other eye , it wo n’t ablate the positive results in the first eye due to an immune reaction or something else . ”
Researchers also have not optimized the dosage of the adenovirus used to carry the gene into the eye .
Those issues will be studied in Phase 2 , a larger clinical trial that they hope to begin soon .
Meanwhile , the team has begun treating some patients at the University of Iowa .
Researchers also hope they will be able to translate the results to other congenital conditions using different genes .
Leber ’s is one form of retinitis pigmentosa , which affects an estimated 100,000 Americans .
The findings might be applicable to macular degeneration , which affects an estimated 1.25 million Americans and is the major cause of visual impairment in the elderly .

Here are some quick numbers to show not enough is being done yet :
2,705,302 homeowners 60 + days late
406,542 were offered a 3 month trial offer ... thats only 15 %
235,247 homeowners started the 3 month trial ..... thats only 9 %
Top US
Banks and the percentage of loan modification trial offers they sent out compared to homeowners that were 60 + days late
1. B of A 13 %
2. Chase 30 %
3. Wells 12 %
4. Citi 21 %
Well in my opinion I think they got an " F " , lets see what next months report card brings .

On August 4th the Treasury Department released a breakdown of who is doing loan modifications thruogh the Making Home Affordable program and well it doesnt look good .
Yes the numbers have gone up a little over the last couple months but it looks as if the Lenders are still lagging in getting these modifications done .
Open the attachment below it is the report card directly from the Treasury Dept. and see the numbers of all the Lenders that are participating .

EVANSTON , Ill . 
For more than a decade , classes of students at Northwestern University ’s journalism school have been scrutinizing the work of prosecutors and the police .
The investigations into old crimes , as part of the Medill Innocence Project , have helped lead to the release of 11 inmates , the project ’s director says , and an Illinois governor once cited those wrongful convictions as he announced he was commuting the sentences of everyone on death row .
But as the Medill Innocence Project is raising concerns about another case , that of a man convicted in a murder 31 years ago , a hearing has been scheduled next month in Cook County Circuit Court on an unusual request : Local prosecutors have subpoenaed the grades , grading criteria , class syllabus , expense reports and e-mail messages of the journalism students themselves .
The prosecutors , it seems , wish to scrutinize the methods of the students this time .
The university is fighting the subpoenas .
Lawyers in the Cook County state ’s attorney ’s office say that in their quest for justice in the old case , they need every pertinent piece of information about the students ’ three - year investigation into Anthony McKinney , who was convicted of fatally shooting a security guard in 1978 .
Mr. McKinney ’s conviction is being reviewed by a judge .
Canadian Police Ask Sea Shepherd Officer if He is Planning â€œa 9/11 or somethingâ€ 
Last year , Canadian police arrested Sea Shepherd ’s First Officer , Peter Hammarstedt , and Captain , Alex Cornelissen .
In Canada , it is illegal to witness or document the slaughter of the seals .
They were charged with approaching , witnessing and documenting the killing .
They were interrogated for 4 1 / 2 hours , during which time they said absolutely nothing , refusing to even acknowledge the police in the room .
They went into the room following the legal advice that “ Nobody talks , everybody walks . ”
In this clip from the interrogation of Peter Hammarstedt , the RCMP compare Sea Shepherd to “ Palestinians ” with bags full of bombs , and at one point the cop says , “ … unless I got ya all wrong and you ’re planning a 9/11 or something here . ”
It ’s not surprising that the Canadian government deported the two for life rather than allow the PR nightmare of them standing trial .
Given the caliber of questions we see in this video , a trial would have been quite entertaining .
Of course , this kind of terrorism rhetoric is n’t an isolated instance , it is government policy .

Arctic sea ice extent for the month of July was thefor that month in the satellite record , after 2007 and 2006 .
The average rate of melt in July 2009 was nearly identical to that of July 2007 .
A strong high - pressure system , similar to the atmospheric pattern that dominated the summer of 2007 , brought warm winds and clear skies to the western Arctic , promoting ice melt .
Figure 1 . Arctic sea ice extent for July 2009 was 8.81 million square kilometers ( 3.40 million square miles ) .

High - resolution image Overview of conditions
Sea ice extent averaged over the month of July 2009 was 8.81 million square kilometers ( 3.40 million square miles ) .
This was 680,000 square kilometers ( 263,000 square miles ) above the record low that occurred in July 2007 , 250,000 square kilometers ( 97,000 square miles ) below July 2008 , and 1.29 million square kilometers ( 498,000 square miles ) below the 1979 to 2000 average .
Sea ice extent is unusually low in the Kara Sea , Baffin Bay , and along the Russian coast .
The only area with significant above - average ice extent is southern Hudson Bay .

High - resolution image Conditions in context
The average pace of ice loss during July 2009 was nearly identical to that of July 2007 .
Ice loss sped up during the third week of July , and slowed again during the last few days of the month .
Averaged for the month , July 2009 saw a decline rate in ice extent of 106,000 square kilometers ( 41,000 square miles ) per day .
For comparison , the rate of decline for July 2007 was 107,000 square kilometers ( 41,000 square miles ) per day and the July 2008 rate of decline was 94,000 square kilometers ( 36,000 square miles ) per day .
The Arctic Ocean lost a total of 3.19 million square kilometers ( 1.23 million square miles ) of ice during July 2009 , and dropped below ice extent at this time in 2008 .

Ice extent averaged for July 2009 was the third lowest in the satellite record for the month of July .
The long - term trend indicates a decline of 6.1 % per decade in July ice extent since 1979 , relative to the 1979 to 2000 average , an average of 62,000 square kilometers ( 24,000 square miles ) of ice per year .

High - resolution image Weather patterns bring clear skies , warmth
The atmospheric circulation pattern for summer 2009 has been similar to the pattern in summer 2007 .
As in 2007 , an unusually strong high - pressure cell ( an anticyclone ) settled over the Beaufort Sea , bringing warm air into the Chukchi Sea .
This year , the Beaufort Sea anticyclone , averaged for June and July 2009 , was even stronger than the anticyclone in 2007 .
However , unlike 2007 , this year the Beaufort Sea high - pressure cell is not paired with unusually low pressure over eastern Siberia , the “ dipole ” pattern that in 2007 promoted strong surface winds and extreme melt .
The strong Beaufort Sea high - pressure cell that occurred both this summer and in 2007 is part of a larger scale atmospheric pattern known as the Pacific North American ( PNA ) “ teleconnection . ”
The airflow in the western hemisphere is usually characterized by a low pressure trough over the North Pacific , a ridge over western North America , and a trough over eastern North America .
The PNA describes the strength of this pattern .
When the PNA is positive , the normal pattern is amplified and the airflow becomes more “ wavy ” than usual .
While the expressions of the PNA vary by season , the strong western North American ridge during the positive PNA favors a strong Beaufort Sea high pressure system .
The stronger than usual trough over eastern North America also helps to explain the cool and rainy weather that has gripped this area much of the summer .

HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER LONDON ( AP ) 
Health officials paused a vaccination program in the English city of Coventry on Tuesday after a 14 - year - old girl died a few hours after being vaccinated against the virus that causes cervical cancer NHS Coventry said it stopped the program for two days to give staff administering the vaccine training in how to answer questions from anyone concerned about its safety .
" We fully expect to resume the program in the coming days , " the health authority said in a statement .
Natalie Morton died in a hospital Monday , a few hours after being the given the Cervarix vaccine , which protects against two strains of the human papilloma virus that causes cervical cancer .
She was vaccinated at her school in Coventry .
Morton appeared to be healthy before being given the jab .
Caron Grainger , director for public health at Coventry City Council , said an autopsy will be carried out to see if there is any link between Morton 's death and the vaccine .
Health officials also said they had quarantined the batch of vaccine given at the school .
The school principal , Julie Roberts , said a few other girls also reported being unwell after receiving the vaccine and some were sent home .
Britain 's publicly owned National Health Service began offering the Cervarix vaccine to teenage girls last year , and over 1.4 million doses of the vaccine have been given out so far under the program .
The virus is often transmitted through sexual intercourse and authorities wanted to give the vaccine to girls as young as 13 so they are protected by the time they become sexually active .
The cervical cancer vaccine is routinely administered to millions of young girls across Europe and North America .
No safety concerns about the vaccines have been raised elsewhere .
" As with any medical intervention ... one can , on rare occasions , see tragic consequences , " said Professor Malcolm McCrae , virologist at the University of Warwick .
" But overall this is an extremely well - tested vaccine which has been produced in response to a critical health issue — cervical cancer — a disease responsible for almost 1,000 deaths annually in the UK . "
Dr Pim Kon , medical director at GlaxoSmithKline UK which manufactures Cervarix , said it was working with the Department of Health and health regulators to investigate the case .
The cervical cancer vaccination program sparked controversy in Britain when it was first introduced .
Some critics argued it would encourage girls to become sexually active at a younger age .
" The vaccination program may give young people a false sense of security and lead them to think that , because they have been vaccinated , they are protected against the worst effects of sexual promiscuity and can , therefore , engage in casual sex without consequence , " said Norman Wells of the Family Education Trust charity .
Morton 's death comes as doctors begin to give children a vaccine against swine flu in a clinical trial .
Doctors across England have begun administering one of two vaccines to 1,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years .
One of the vaccines is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and the other by Baxter .
The trial aims to see which one is most effective on children .

Many others joined Joan in taking their stand today , and rallied at health insurance offices around the country .
The nationwide direct action campaign was led by HCAN , and assisted by other coalition members like US Action .
Five were arrested at the Philadelphia event .
The Philadelphia event was also attended by Stacie Ritter , the mother of twin girls stricken with cancer and denied necessary treatment by Cigna .
The Penn Action press release :
Health care activists protest at CIGNA headquarters in Philadelphia ;
Five people arrested in civil disobedience action protestors October 6 , 2009 ( Philadelphia ) - Health Care for America Now ! in Pennsylvania held a " Crime Scene " action today outside CIGNA headquarters in Philadelphia which drew more than 100 protesters and featured a nonviolent blockade of the insurance giant 's doorways which resulted in five arrests .
There was a significant turn - out from the news media , including the Philadelphia Inquirer , the Metro , KYW 1060 Newsradio , and Fox 29 News .
The action began at 11:30 a.m. at 16th & Chestnut Streets in downtown Philadelphia with enthusiastic chants of " CIGNA , Shame !
Health care NOW ! " and " Healthcare for America NOW ! "
After several minutes , HCAN PA Director Marc Stier introduced the 4 people who were prepared to join him in blocking the doorways to CIGNA 's offices and explained the rationale for escalating the campaign against the insurance industry .
Each of these individuals spoke briefly about why they were taking this step , often sharing very personal stories about how their families have been affected by insurance company greed .
Stacie Ritter , whose twin daughters were denied vital care by CIGNA , also spoke .
Following the speeches , the people participating in the blockade walked over and sat down in front of the 2 revolving doors that lead into CIGNA 's wing of the high - rise office building .
The rest of the crowd cheered them on and continued with the chants as the people risking arrest were given 4 orders to disperse .
Arrests began at 12:15 .
As the last of the protesters were loaded into the police vehicles , the crowd started chanting , " We 'll be back , we 'll be back ! ! "
The people arrested were Marc Stier of HCAN PA , Dennis Short of SEIU , Michael Ladson , Joan Kosloff , and Ray Torres .
They were taken to the 9th District Police Station at 21st St & Pennsylvania
Av where they are being charged with " failure to disperse " and " conspiracy " , both misdemeanors .
It is expected that they will be processed and released some time after 10:00 p.m. tonight .

Six were arrested at another event in Minneapolis .
We 've all been very busy doing what we can to get real health care reform .
We 've heated up the phones making sure our representatives know how we feel .
And we 've put our money where our mouths are by donating to those progressives who 've stood up for a strong public option .
We 've been a part of the biggest push back from the Left in some time .
But there are many of us who 've decided we must do something more :
Even if the best case scenario public option becomes a reality , we will still have a long fight ahead of us before we break the power of the health insurance industry and achieve true universal care .
Will calling , e-mailing and writing letters be enough ?
Health care may be a right , but no one has ever won their rights without demanding them .
If you 'd like to get involved in a direct action campaign or if you 'd simply like to support this important effort , please go to HCAN or US Action and do what you can .
The ' Nonic ' glass could be replaced Plans to replace the traditional pint glass with one made of shatter - proof plastic will not be accepted by drinkers , the pub industry has warned .
The Home Office has commissioned a new design , in an attempt to stop glasses being used as weapons .
Official figures show 5,500 people are attacked with glasses and bottles every year in England and Wales .
The British Beer and Pub Association said it did not want the new plastic glasses to be made compulsory .
Neil Williams from the association said he was concerned that drinkers would notice a drop in quality .
" For the drinker , the pint glass feels better , it has a nice weight and the drink coats the glass nicely .
That 's why people go out for a drink , to have a nice experience . "
He said there was a danger that pubs with no record of trouble would be penalised .
He said : " I would ask , is it necessary to replace the much - loved pint glass for safety reasons in the vast majority of pubs where there is no problem ?
We 've got to make it desirable , acceptable and cool .
Nick Verebelyi , designer of the new pint pot " Pubs should n't be put under pressure to stop using glasses if they are safe places to drink .
Why on earth ask them to do that ?
" They should n't be corralled into using plastic glasses .
Anything that would move us towards a plastic product would not be welcomed . "
Red tape Mr Williams said the industry feared extra costs at a time when many pubs were struggling in the recession : " It would impose another cost on us .
Red tape is already coming from all sides . "
Nick Verebelyi , the designer in charge of delivering the new pint , said they were looking at two approaches .
" One is to coat the glass with a substance that will make sure the glass does n't shatter into pieces when it is broken - that could be a plastic material for example .
THE PINT
The ' Nonic ' ( no nick ) glass , with a strengthened bulge an inch from the rim was invented in 1960
It replaced the dimpled pint glass ( pictured above ) which was too difficult to stack Approximately 126 million pints of beer are served a week in the UK " But it would have to feel like an existing pint glass to the consumer . "
Mr Verebelyi said his company , Design Bridge , was also looking at changing the pint altogether .
" We could do something more radical , by looking at the whole shape and substance of the pint - we could come up with something that is completely different to glass .
" Remember that years ago people used to drink out of pewter tankards .
It could be quite a significant paradigm shift . "
Mr Verebelyi said he accepted that drinkers are attached to the traditional glass pint .
" You make a change and there is often opposition , we 've got to make it appealing to them .
We 've got to make it desirable and acceptable and cool .
" There 's going to be quite a push behind this in terms of the Home Office . "
The Home Office Minister , Alan Campbell , said the redesign could make a significant difference to the number of revellers who are injured .
He said : " Innovative design has played an important role in driving down overall crime , including theft , fraud and burglary .
" This project will see those same skills applied to the dangerous and costly issue of alcohol - related crime and I am confident that it will lead to similar successes . "

The final sexual revolution came with the invention , social acceptance and subsequent widespread use of a system of perfect synthetic surrogates .
Within a decade of the system ’s integration into the everyday life and future of the middle class , a stigma rose within the elite that labeled natural birth as an unclean and backward system used only by those who were too poor to afford in - vitro .
Sterilization parties became a part of popular culture , and as commerce responded in turn , producing “ happy sterilization ” cards and appropriately - themed party favors , the idea entrenched itself within society as a new tradition , a rite of passage that both boys and girls underwent at the onset of puberty .
With reproduction increasingly more and more the business of machines and engineers , new social protest groups emerged , factions within society like the Daughters of Diana , a movement which encouraged complete hysterectomies as part of a means of combating the “ fascist male regime ” by removing the primary organs through which the leaders of the movement felt male dominance behavior was inadvertently encouraged and therefore perpetuated .
Abhorring all surgeries and sterilization procedures that involved modifying the natural state of the human genitalia , the Daughters of Mary stood as both a rallying flag and a stereotypical example of those who stood against and protested ( sometimes violently ) the burgeoning practices of the mainstream sexual infrastructure .
Other groups , such as the Gender Aesthetics , ultimately leaned toward a total erasure of sexual identity , encouraging a sort of asexual androgyny within society that involved a complete mastectomy for women and the surgical realignment inward of external genitalia for men .
As widespread implementation of bacteria - based pharmocological “ Pharms ” allowed for the synthesis of designer hormones to become increasingly more mainstream , advancements within the research cabals for these “ Pharms ” gave the revolution the fuel it needed to carry itself past the tumultuous early stages in which gender conflicts became increasingly more heated in regards to the steady erosion of sexual identity as a constant and defining factor of the individual .
Delivered in capsule - form along with a cocktail of pre-programmed nanites , the designer hormone cultures that ultimately became a mark of haute couture and only later a mainstay of all but the lowest strata of society were keyed to provide gender transformations designed to take place while the consumer slept .
This availability of complete , literally “ overnight ” and easily reversible changes in gender ultimately changed the way in which gender itself was viewed , reassigning it to the state of an impermanent persona , a “ hat ” which could be taken on or off at will .
Further advances in genetic engineering and mandates put forth by the state led to official legislation that required all children to be born gender neutral and insured that only upon reaching adulthood would such children legally be allowed to be gendered as they so pleased .
This of course led to a “ gender black market ” where young , neutrally gendered teens could experiment with street - quality hormone / nanite tandem injections and experience being gendered in a sex - friendly environment .
Campaigns were launched about the unsafe nature of such “ street cocktails ” and “ sex- easies , ” creating iconic figures of those who had died from “ bad mixes ” or superbug STDs and claiming that those who were illegally gendered before legal adulthood produced lower academic scores on average than those who remained gender neutral , regardless of the length of time spent gendered .
Even as time passed and the restraints on minors were relaxed , gender remained primarily the plaything of the adult community , a commodity with all the social joys and stigmas of any legal recreational drug .
Regularly engaging in gendered activities was eventually viewed as a sort of psychological illness or dependence similar to alcoholism , and as support groups for the overly - gendered found their place within society , many gender neutral individuals found less and less appeal in taking on any gender role for any length of time , except in the case of the occasional party or social event .
Those who chose “ living gendered ” over an androgynous lifestyle were seen as traditionalists , backward individuals and “ primitives ” who had lost touch with reality .
Eventually , the old sexual divisions of male and female were forgotten by the mainstream and only appeared in the occasional “ Gender Party , ” in which guests would adopt the physical traits , stereotypical dress and mannerisms of past genders in the spirit of fun , easily glossing over the memories of a past that had long since disappeared beneath a tide of romantic notions and the forgotten books written by historians who had been either unwilling or unable to change their own genders .
Polymer solar cells do n't have the high efficiencies of the silicon kind yet , which is n't saying much , but they can be printed in roll - to - roll processes and at very high speeds so in time the technology could be very cost - effective .
Polymer solar cells are also flexible and lightweight so they could be used on vehicles or clothing or to be incorporated in the design of objects .
Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Ulm have made the first high - resolution 3D images of the inside of a polymer solar cell , giving them new insights in the nanoscale structure of polymer solar cells and its effect on the performance .
In the news hybrid polymer solar cells , a mixture of two different materials , a polymer and a metal oxide are used to create charges at their interface when the mixture is illuminated by the sun .
The degree of mixing of the two materials is essential for its efficiency .
Intimate mixing enhances the area of the interface where charges are formed but at the same time obstructs charge transport because it leads to long and winding roads for the charges to travel .
Larger domains do exactly the opposite .

The vastly different chemical nature of polymers and metal oxides generally makes it very difficult to control the nanoscale structure .
The Eindhoven researchers have been able to largely circumvent this problem by using a precursor compound that mixes with the polymer and is only converted into the metal oxide after it is incorporated in the photoactive layer .
This allows better mixing and enables extracting up to 50 % of the absorbed photons as charges in an external circuit .
The importance of the degree of mixing was clearly demonstrated by visualization of the structure of these blends in three dimensions .
Traditionally such visualization has been extremely challenging , but by using 3D electron tomography , the team has been able to resolve the mixing with unprecedented detail on a nanoscale .
From these images the researchers at the Institute of Stochastics in Ulm have been able to extract typical distances between the two components , relating to the efficiency of charge generation , and analyze the percolation pathways , that is , how much of each component is connected to the electrode .
These quantitative analyses of the structure matched perfectly with the observed performance of the solar cells in sunlight .
Even though these hybrid polymer solar cells are among the most efficient reported to date for this class , their power conversion efficiency of 2 % in sunlight must be enhanced to make them really useful .
This will be realized by improving the control over the morphology of the photoactive blend , for example by creating polymers that can interact with the metal oxide and by developing polymers or molecules that absorb a larger part of the solar spectrum .
At such point , the intrinsic advantages of hybrid polymer solar cells in terms of low cost and thermal stability of the nanoscale structure could be fully exploited .

Latest autism figures should dispel any fears about the MMR jab being linked to the condition , say experts .
The NHS Information Centre found one in every hundred adults living in England has autism , which is identical to the rate in children .
If the vaccine was to blame , autism rates among children should be higher because the MMR has only been available since the early 1990s , the centre says .
This is the first time the rate in adults has been evaluated .
Tim Straughan , chief executive of The NHS Information Centre , said : " This landmark report is the first major study into the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among adults to be carried out anywhere in the world .
The findings do not support suggestions of a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of this condition
Chief executive of The NHS Information Centre Tim Straughan " While the sample size was small and any conclusions need to be tempered with caution , the report suggests that , despite popular perceptions , rates of autism are not increasing , with prevalence among adults in line with that among children .
" It also suggests that , among adults , rates of autism remain broadly constant across age groups .
" The findings do not support suggestions of a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of this condition . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said : " There is no credible evidence to support the link between the MMR vaccine and autism .
" MMR vaccine has been used extensively and safely around the world for over 30 years and is the best way of protecting your child against measles , mumps and rubella . "
Concern over the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine was sparked by a paper published in The Lancet in 1998 by Dr Andrew Wakefield .
' Safe ' vaccine
This research has since been discredited .
But , until now , little was known about how autism affected people over the course of a lifetime .
The latest findings , based on nearly 7,500 adults , suggests that prevalence of autism spectrum disorder remains broadly level across all age bands .
While 1 % of adults had an autism spectrum disorder , which includes autism and Asperger 's syndrome , the rate for men was higher ( 1.8 % ) than for women ( 0.2 % ) .
This was in line with studies among child populations which show higher rates amongst boys .
And in line with recent report from the National Audit Office , the study also found many of these adults are failing to get the diagnosis and specialist help they need .
Mr Straughan said : " This does beg some questions about whether services , as currently configured , are meeting the needs of this group of people . "
Mark Lever , chief executive of the National Autistic Society , said : " The NAS has long campaigned to raise awareness of the fact that services and support for adults with autism are woefully inadequate .
" This study gives us further evidence to demand that more vital support is put in place . "
Care Services Minister Phil Hope said : " This study will feed into the first ever adult autism strategy , which we will publish at the end of this year .
" The strategy should kick - start radical improvements in services for all forms of autism . "
People with autism spectrum disorder may suffer a range of problems , including difficulty interacting with other people and communicating their feelings .

Fictionalized documentary showing the evolution of witchcraft , from its pagan roots to its confusion with hysteria in Eastern Europe .
Matthew Trahan
Part history lesson followed by re-enactments with actors , this film depicts the history of witchcraft from its earliest days through to the present day ( in this case , 1922 or thereabouts ) .
The result is a documentary - like film that must be among the first to use re-enactments as a visual and narrative tool .
From pagan worship to satanic rites to hysteria , the film takes you on a journey through the ages with highly effective visual sequences .
garykmcd
Divided into seven chapters , this part - documentary / part - fiction hybrid attempts to shed light on the numerous superstitions pivoting around the indecipherable mental illnesses that led to the relentless witch purges during the medieval times .
Through a series of graphic vignettes and original gravures , Witchcraft Through the Ages does not shy away from the Inquisition 's revolting inhumanities and its hideous practices of interrogation , as the sadistically ruthless inquisitors shatter human limbs and torture the flesh until the accused hag confesses or implicates another woman in witchery .
From the Dark Ages to the modern 1920s , hysteria is often mistaken for demonolatry ; however , what separates truth from a lie ?

しばしば政策的な意味での 「 技術者育成」が話題となる。
これに対する私の答えは、「別に日本の技術者は貧弱じゃないんだよ。むしろ貧弱なのは経営者の方だろ」であり、これは今のところ変わる様子もない。日本のコの業界の問題点はまさにそこにあるからだ。
ということは、わかっている人はわかっているんじゃないかと思う。でも、なぜ「技術者育成」がしばしば政策になるか。それは単なる「上から目線欲」の満足のためではないか？
若干ひねくれつつよく考えてみれば「育成」なんて語はとても上から目線だ。イメージ的には、
【ニコニコ動画】システムエンジニアになろう～新入社員研修編～
こいつだ。「育成」という目線は、まさしくこれだ。もちろん、もっとマトモな会社もあるのだろうが、結局目線はこれなのだ。上手く育てて食う。ブラック企業はブラックなりに、そうでないとこはそれなりに。「いや、俺は豚じゃねーよ」って声はわかるし、「私は従業員を豚扱いなんてしてません」って声もわかるし、私もそう言いたいところなんだけど、「育成」の視点は結局はこれなのだ。
「 技術者育成」というのは、しばしば「日本のIT業界がマズいので」的な文脈で語られる。「業界がマズい」というのは少なくともある見方としては正しい。それに対する私の答えは、いつだって
マズいのは技術者じゃなくて経営者
ってことになるのだけど、経営者を「育成」という視点で語られることはおよそない。「IT業界重鎮達」は現代の現場で炭鉱労働して再教育でもするべきだと思うんだけど、そんなことは会社に不満を持っている社畜どもでさえも言わない。そもそも、「経営者に問題あり」的な意見を「不満」以外の文脈で語る者さえ少ない。
これは突き詰めれば 、
コの業界がダメなのは技術者のせい
という責任の押しつけでもある。でもさ、技術者で程々に出来る奴は、ちゃんと世界に肩並べてるってば。ところが「世界的IT会社の経営者」なんて日本にはいないぜ。
ということがあってもなお、「技術者育成」が語られるのって、結局それをやっている連中が技術者のことを
養豚所の 豚
と同じような目線で見たいって思ってることじゃないか？
「 育成」なんて視点はそうなんだから。
でも現実には、 「 世界 的 IT技術者」なんて日本にはゴロゴロいる。ところが、「世界的IT会社経営者」なんていないし、「世界的ITジャーナリスト」もいないし、「世界的IT系政治家」も「世界的IT役人」もいない。つまり、
育成が必要なのはテメーらの方
なんだよ 。
お前はどうだって？ 僕育成されたいんで、お金下さいｗｗｗ
PS .
「 育成って必要じゃね？」って話もあるんだけど、こと技術者に関して、特にここで「育成」とか言われている文脈で語られているような技術者には多分いらない。彼等に必要なのは、
能力の発掘と成長の機会
だ。つまり、誰かに育てられるようなものではなくて、もっと主体的なことだ。素質ある者を発掘し、成長の機会を与えることなのだ。間違っても「養豚所の豚」にしてしまうことではない。

More On This Topic Chemistry Blog : Crystals from IR Lasers Topics Covered U of Edinburgh Short pulses from a near - IR laser nucleated the KCl crystals in this agarose gel .
Text Size A A
Short pulses from a low - intensity laser can spark crystallization on demand , allowing researchers to grow single crystals exactly where they want them in minutes rather than days , say the scientists who developed the technique ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja905232 m ) .
It could be used to control the structure of semiconductor materials or make life easier for chemists who want to do diffraction experiments , they add .
" Now we have a real tool to choose when and where nucleation happens , " says Andrew J. Alexander , a chemist at the University of Edinburgh , in Scotland , who led the study .
" It is as if we have opened up a route to flash photography to view the nucleation process on the fly , as it happens . "
The technique is based on an observation by Bruce Garetz , Allan Myerson , and their colleagues at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University .
They noticed that lasers could cause supersaturated urea solutions to crystallize — a technique called nonphotochemical laser - induced nucleation ( NPLIN ) — but they did not attempt to control the timing or location of each nucleation event ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996 , 77 , 3475 ) .
Alexander had taken note of the 1996 study and was waiting for the right moment to build upon it .
" At the time , I was doing a Ph.D. on completely different stuff , so this was filed under curious things that I had to have a go at myself one day , " he says .
In the new study , Alexander 's team prepared an agarose gel with supersaturated potassium chloride , covered it with a mask , and then struck it with 6 - nanosecond polarized pulses from a pair of unfocused YAG lasers .
Within minutes , crystals formed in the exposed areas .
It was the first time that NPLIN had been used to control crystal growth with pinpoint 3 - D accuracy and precise timing .
The British chemists have since managed to crystallize egg - white lysozyme , but they are not yet sure whether the nucleation trick will work consistently to help biochemists crystallize finicky proteins .
" While the reported spatial and temporal control of nucleation is very impressive , there are still several mysteries about NPLIN that need to be resolved , " Garetz says .

Bill Maher is hailed by many as a skeptic , but I disagree with that .
He is an atheist , and he has some salient points to make about religion and beliefs .
However , he is by no means a skeptic when it comes to matters medical .
He rails against " western medicine " ( what I prefer to call , simply , medicine ) , thinks vaccines are dangerous , and buys into a lot of nonsense about vaccinations that is known to be wrong .
Note that a denier is not the same thing as a skeptic ; go read what Orac has to say about Maher to see how the Real Time host misses the mark by miles in his medical beliefs .
You may also guess that I have little love for ex-Senate Majority Leader ( and doctor ) Bill Frist , who claimed he would never diagnose someone without seeing them first , but then proceeded to do just that on the Senate floor about Terry Schiavo ( and get it completely wrong ) .
In my opinion , he let politics trump medicine at that time .
But sometimes medicine wins out : Frist schools
Maher on the swine flu on Real Time , with Frist telling Maher point blank that he 's wrong .
This is worth watching .
Frist is correct , the things Maher says about vaccines are dead wrong .
I wonder if Maher will now do the research instead of just continuing to buy into his flawed belief system ?
Tip o' the syringe to BABloggee Peter Beattie .
The New York Civil Liberties Union today commended Schools Chancellor Joel Klein and the New York City Department of Education for issuing formal rules regulating military recruitment in the city ’s public high schools .
But while the new Chancellor ’s Regulation is a significant step toward preventing military recruitment abuses in the schools , the DOE now must train principals on how to enforce it .
“ We applaud the DOE for both acknowledging that unchecked military recruitment in our schools is a serious problem and for finally taking responsibility for what the recruiters do , ” said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman .
“ If this new regulation is fully enforced , it will be a significant step toward protecting the privacy of our children .
Without proper enforcement , however , it ’s just a piece of paper . ”
For six years the NYCLU , the Ya - Ya Network and other community advocates have been pressuring the DOE to adopt a Chancellor ’s Regulation .
This new regulation requires high school principals to :
Ensure that military recruiters do not get free run of the schools for recruitment purposes .
Ensure that class time is used only for instruction .
Distribute multilingual forms to all students and their parents by early October allowing them to withhold contact information from military recruiters .
New students must receive the opt - out form in their orientation packets .
Opt - out information also will be added to the Bill of Student Rights .
Students will only have to opt - out once during their school careers , as opposed to at the beginning of each new school year .
Designate a staff “ point person ” on issues regarding military recruitment and notify students who it is .
Develop procedures in each school for regulating military recruiter access , ensuring that students understand their opt - out rights and receive opt - out forms .
Require schools that permit students to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Batter ( ASVAB ) to prohibit automatic disclosure of test results and student contact information .
ASVAB is marketed as a career exploration test recruiters use that is funded and graded by the military .
According to the Army ’s School Recruiting Program Handbook , the main function of the test is to “ provide the field recruiter with a source of leads of high school seniors and juniors qualified through the ASVAB for enlistments into the Active Army and Army Reserve … ”
The federal No Child Left Behind
Act of 2001 tied education dollars to military recruitment , granting the military wide access to public high schools and students ’ personal information .
As the United States military intensified its recruitment activities inside public high schools to meet wartime quotas , stories of aggressive recruitment targeting low - income communities of color became common and New York City became a top target .
In 2007 , the NYCLU and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer with the Students or Soldiers ?
Coalition released a report documenting students ’ experiences with recruiters in their schools .
We Want You ( th ) !
Confronting Unregulated Military Recruitment in New York City Public Schools surveyed 1,000 students at select city schools and found that the DOE was failing to protect students ’ rights :
21 percent of students reported the use of class time by military recruiters .
Amongst 12th graders , a full 27 percent reported military recruiter use of class time .
40 percent of students did not receive a military recruitment opt - out forms at the beginning of the academic year .
18 percent of students did not believe anyone in their school could properly advise them of the risks and benefits of military enlistment .
Additionally , 32 percent were unsure if such a person was available in their school .
45 percent of students did not know to whom they should report military recruiter misconduct .
“ Federal education dollars should not be connected to military recruitment , and the NYCLU will keep fighting until that ends .
But after six years of parents , students and advocates sharing their horror stories and lobbying Tweed Hall , we finally have a solid framework for confronting aggressive military recruitment in New York City ’s schools , ” said Udi Ofer , NYCLU advocacy director .
“ What ’s important now is that principals get the guidance and support they need to follow this regulation .
We look forward to working with DOE to flesh out the details and provide principals clear direction about their obligations . ”
The regulation is somewhat vague , Ofer said .
For example , the requirement that principals develop a site plan for regulating recruitment activity on campus is very broad , providing little direction on items all plans should include .
A similar requirement in the Seattle public school system contains specifics , such as requiring schools to outline where military recruiters can set up on campus , where they can leave information when not on campus , and who is responsible for scheduling and approving recruiter visits .
“ While this regulation is a positive step , it ’s not enough , ” said Erica Braudy , NYCLU lead organizer .
“ The DOE must ensure that parents and students know about it and understand their rights .
The department should also step up its efforts prevent aggressive military recruiting in the schools and ensure the military is n’t the only career option promoted for low - income youth . ”
The NYCLU continues to push for additional safeguards missing from the new regulation :
MONEY and compensation experts PayScale.com started with more than 7,000 jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects will grow 10 % or more over the next decade and that require at least a bachelor 's degree .

The recent discovery of water on the Moon by India 's inaugural lunar mission almost never happened because of a twin helping of good old - fashioned red tape and lingering Cold War suspicions , reports science writer Pallava Bagla .
A spanner was thrown in the works by American bureaucracy imposing conditions
India hails Moon mission find India Moon mission ' mixed success '
Hidden behind the euphoria of the find is a less publicised tale of complex back room dealings between Indian and American space science teams .
Back in 2004 , scientists from the two countries were eager to collaborate , but the Bureau of Export Control in the US did not share this enthusiasm .
In fact it was seen by some on the Indian side as being singularly obstinate .
It is accused of not being willing to clear the paperwork that would allow sophisticated American - made instruments to be airlifted to Bangalore for the mission .
It is also accused of using " all the tricks in it is pockets " to scuttle the operation before then US President George W Bush reportedly intervened to make sure this did not happen .
It is important to remember that the Moon mission was planned and executed well before the Indo - US civilian nuclear deal was finalised in 2008 , a historic moment prior to which there was much suspicion between the two countries .
Back in 2005 , in initiating its collaboration with the Americans , the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) decided to forget the two sides ' rocky past .
India had been denied access to technology under US sanctions imposed after nuclear tests in 1974 .
The quantity of water found was small , but could become a useful resource Even today , many Indian space laboratories continue to languish on a dreaded US blacklist .
The $ 100 m Chandrayaan project was an Indian mission with international partners .
On board India used a guest instrument from Nasa , a mineral mapper .
This is a laser printer - sized , 9kg device that beamed images of the wet lunar landscape .
Another Nasa instrument , a small radar called a MiniSAR , was also flown aboard the Indian mission .
Isro decided not to charge its guests for this 400,000 km ( 248,548 - mile ) journey .
The international instruments were all flown free to the Moon .
The only expectation Delhi had in return for this agreement was that the scientific data collected from the guest instruments would be shared with Indian researchers .
It is this visionary arrangement that brought India its water - on - the - Moon moment .
' Not acceptable ' Late in 2005 , just a little before Mr Bush made his historic visit to India , space scientists from the two countries were unquestionably eager to collaborate .
Even today it still seems that the Americans only want to co-operate with India on certain science - based satellite missions
But a spanner was thrown in the works by American conditions in the technology co-operation agreement that were not acceptable to India .
Delhi argued that it seemed as if the US was imposing tough conditions on India while at the same time accepting a free gift from it to fly US payloads to the Moon .
Talking in 2006 , Isro chairman Madhavan Nair argued that the US move could " compromise " India 's interests .
Even as President Bush flew to India , officials from both countries were working hard to hammer out acceptable texts for highly complex bilateral umbrella agreements - called the Technology Safeguards Agreement ( TSA ) and the Technology Assistance Agreement ( TAA ) for space co-operation .
Experts say that the end product of these talks was the " Chandrayaan - 1 " agreement , which is how the Bureau of Export Control finally gave Nasa permission to ship the instruments .
It is not much publicised outside Isro , but the fact is that India had to keep the designs of Chandrayaan open for a long time just to accommodate huge delays by American bureaucracy .
The Moon Mineralogy Mapper , or M3 , one of the devices behind the water on the Moon findings - was literally the last of the 11 instruments to be accommodated on board the Chandrayaan mission .
' Hurdles '
This is not the first time that a high - profile Indo - US space dream has nearly died early because of what some in India see as the unbending attitude of US bureaucracy .
In 2006 , India 's dreams of launching missions in conjunction with America 's Boeing Corporation were shattered soon after the deal was announced .
India wants full access to US lunar technology
It was aborted not because Isro and Boeing were unwilling to become partners , but because of huge delays in getting export clearance from the US state department .
Indian experts argued that the agreement failed to materialise because of " huge delays and immense hurdles " thrown in their way by American bureaucracy in Washington .
The Americans , it was thought , were fearful that the deal could result in a diversion of dual - use technologies for military purposes .
" The [ paperwork ] took so long that the whole project itself was over by the time clearances came through , " Dr Nair said .
Boeing and Isro finally called it quits on their tentative joint venture in late 2006 .
Even today it still seems that the Americans want to co-operate with India only on certain science - based satellite missions .
They seem to be happy that co-operation takes place in not - for - profit science related projects , but profit - making commercial ventures in the lucrative space market are still a no - no .
Indian experts hope that the recent success of the Moon water mission may alter this approach by Washington and lead to a robust Indo - American planetary exploration partnership that is free from the shackles of ever - suspicious civil servants .

AT&T has just announced that MMS -- a much - ballyhooed feature of iPhone OS 3.0 -- will finally be hitting AT&T on September 25 .
There 's still no date for tethering , though the company is holding the line that it 'll be offered " in the future . "
Expanding on the logic behind the tethering delay , they 're saying that " by its nature , this function could exponentially increase traffic on the network , and we need to ensure that some of our current upgrades are in place before we can deliver the expanded functionality with the excellent performance that customers expect . "
We 're no network engineers , but " exponentially increase traffic " and " AT&T " are two things we do n't typically like to hear in the same sentence -- let 's hope the 850MHz , 7.2 Mbps , and backhaul upgrades they 're cranking on right now go a long way toward sorting that out .
As for MMS , they 're acknowledging that the release " does indeed fall a few days past the official end of summer , " arguing that their support of more iPhone customers than any other carrier in the world made a positive launch experience a bit of a challenge .
Of course , virtually every other phone AT&T sells ( and has sold for the past several years ) supports the same tech , so this feels like a pretty active admission that iPhone users blaze through data - rich features at a pace that the carrier has been ill - equipped to handle .
Sept. 21 , 2009  -- For A.J. and Lisa Demaree , the photos they snapped of their young daughters were innocent and sweet .
But after a photo developer at Walmart thought otherwise , the Demarees found themselves in a yearlong battle to prove they were not child pornographers .
" I do n't ' understand it at all , " A.J. Demaree told " Good Morning America " Monday .
" Ninety - nine percent of the families in America have these exact same photos . "
The eight photos in question were among a batch of 144 family photos the Demarees had taken to their local Walmart .
The developer alerted the police and the investigation into child pornography began in earnest , even though the parents maintained they were innocent bath time photos .
The Peoria , Ariz. , couple had their home searched by police and worse , their children -- then ages 18 months , 4 and 5 -- were taken from them for more than month .
Their names were placed on a sex offender registry for a time , and Lisa Demaree was suspended from her school job for a year .
The couple said they have spent $ 75,000 on legal bills .
A report issued by local authorities described the photos as " child erotica " and " sex exploitation , " the couple 's lawyer Dick Treon told " Good Morning America . "
He said the person responsible for the report was unqualified to make such judgments .
The Demarees are now sharing a few of the photos with the public , he said , so the " truth to catch up with the lie . "
" These photos were never intended for anyone to see except for family members , " Treon said .
" Perversion is in the eye of the viewer . "
Eventually , a judge threw out charges against the Demarees , but now they 're going on the legal offensive by suing the state , the city and Walmart for their role in what they call a " nightmare . "
" I think that we need to have an awareness of how our innocent photographs can be misconstrued and misperceived , " Lisa Demaree said .
The Demarees are suing the city of Peoria and the State Attorney General 's office for defamation .
They 're also suing Wal - Mart for failing to tell them that they had an " unsuitable print policy " and could turn over photos to law enforcement without their knowledge .
" At Walmart , we 're committed to providing quality service and convenience to our photo customers , " the company said in a statement .
" These are sensitive allegations and we 're taking them very seriously . "
" It was unbelievable .
I was in so much disbelief .
I started to hyperventilate .
I tried to breathe it out , " Lisa Demaree told " GMA " this weekend , struggling through tears .
" Some of the photos are bath time photos , but there are a few after the bath .
Three of the girls are naked , laying on a towel with their arms around each other , and we thought it was so cute . "
Lisa Demaree told " Good Morning America " today that the girls seem to be doing well , but that her oldest is showing some signs of anxiety when she visits other people 's homes .
She calls her experience in state care as time at the " stranger 's house . "
" They 're doing really well , I think , considering what happened , " she said .
" But sometimes we do n't know the effects that children experience and are undergoing when they go through things like this . "
House Searched , Children Taken
After Walmart alerted them , investigators went to the Demaree home to question them and search their residence where the children live with their parents .
A.J. Demaree said he could understand why the police were there , but he said the pictures were innocuous snapshots of his kids goofing around , and some of them involved the children being naked .
" We have told our girls that they have freedom to be in their home and feel OK about their bodies and their nudity , but that there is a time and a place for it , " Lisa said .
Police seized numerous videotapes and the Demarees ' computers and said they found more photos and videos of the children frolicking without clothes .
Investigators and Child Protective Services saw it very differently and removed the children from the house .
A medical exam of the children revealed no signs of sexual abuse , and a judge ruled that the photos were in fact harmless .
ABC News legal expert Dana Cole said that in cases of child pornography authorities need to prove sexual intent on the part of the parents , and that after the judge reviewed the case and the Demarees underwent psychological evaluation , it was determined that there was no such intent .
From the Demarees perspective , the damage was already done .
Police and prosecutors insist they did what they thought was appropriate .
" It took us a long time to take a picture [ again ] , " Lisa Demaree said .
" I even worry about them in their bathing suits now , if I get a shot of them in their bathing suits and they 're tilting their heads a certain way or their hips are sticking out a little bit , all I think of is ' Does someone think that it was posed ?
Or how is that going to be perceived ? ' "
Steve Meissner , a spokesman for Child Protective Services , released a statement saying , " When a police agency calls us on a matter , we have an obligation to act on that matter .
If we refused , the community would be very unhappy with us . "
The city of Peoria also states that it stands behind the appropriate actions of their officers .
" Honestly we 've missed a year of our children 's lives as far as our memories go , " Lisa Demaree said , " As crazy as it may seem , what you may think are the most beautiful innocent pictures of your children may be seen as something completely different and completely perverted . "
ABC News ' Lee Ferran contributed to this report .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Manhattan federal court sentenced a Lebanese - born Swedish man to life in prison on Tuesday for trying to establish an al Qaeda training camp in the United States and running websites on how to make bombs .
The sentence was handed down four months after Oussama Abdullah Kassir , 43 , was found guilty on 11 counts , including providing material support to al Qaeda and distributing information relating to weapons of mass destruction .
“ The defendant is a clear threat to public safety , ” U.S. District Judge John Keenan said in sentencing Kassir , according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York .
Prosecutors said Kassir was involved in trying to establish a training camp on a property in Bly , Oregon , where Islamist militants could receive military - style training in preparation for combat in Afghanistan .
Kassir also operated at least six websites with instructions on making bombs and poisons and featuring materials such as “ The Mujahideen Explosives Handbook , ” prosecutors said .
They said Kassir conspired with two other suspects who are detained in Britain and awaiting extradition to the United States .
WASHINGTON  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday that it had rejected a design by Westinghouse for a new reactor because a key component might not withstand events like earthquakes and tornadoes .
The rejection raises the possibility of delays in building 14 planned reactors in the United States , including two twin - reactor projects in Georgia and South Carolina that are leading the pack .
Westinghouse , which is owned by Toshiba , promised to conduct tests as quickly as possible to try to satisfy the agency staff that the design was sound .
The new reactor , called the AP1000 , is intended to be faster to build and safer to run than previous models .
The letters stand for “ advanced passive ” and the number is the estimated electrical output in megawatts .
Resolving design issues before construction is viewed as a crucial part of the nuclear industry ’s plan for a revival without the delays and cost overruns that bedeviled the industry in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
Unsolicited advice :
If you insist on robbing people , do so quickly .
Grab everything in sight and sprint to Mexico .
Because when you gradually steal $ 36,471 of Netflix DVDs from your day job , someone will eventually notice .

Myles Weathers , a ( former ) postal sorting facility employee from Springfield , Massachusetts , was busted removing DVDs from Netflix envelopes and placing them in his backpack .
That 's a little dumb .
What 's really dumb is that Weathers was caught on camera following a Netflix investigation as to why all these people in the area were calling in their DVDs as MIA .
Weathers pleaded guilty to the theft of 3012 DVDs ( now recovered ) valued at $ 36,471 , and he may get up to five years in prison when he 's sentenced this December .
Then again , it could be worse .

Peirce , working scientist , pioneer of modern logic , and founder of pragmatism , envisaged a reformed , scientific philosophy which would use “ the most rational methods it can devise , for finding out the little that can as yet be found out about the universe of mind and matter from those observations which every person can make in every hour of his waking life . ”
His philosophy was informed by the pragmatic maxim , identifying the meaning of a concept with ...

Some unprecedented news today , folks .
Never in the history of the United Nations has a U.S. President taken the chairmanship of the powerful UN Security Council .
Perhaps it is because of what could arguably be a Constitutional prohibition against doing so .
To wit : Section 9 of the Constitution says :
No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States : And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them , shall , without the Consent of the Congress , accept of any present , Emolument , Office , or Title , of any kind whatever , from any King , Prince , or foreign State .
Nonetheless , the rotating chairmanship of the council goes to the U.S. this month .
The normal course of business would have U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice take the gavel .
However , this time will be different .
Constitution be damned , Barack Hussein Obama has decided to put HIMSELF in the drivers seat , and will preside over global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament talks slated to begin September 24th .
The Financial Times says :
Barack Obama will cement the new co-operative relationship between the US and the United Nations this month when he becomes the first American president to chair its 15 - member Security Council .
The topic for the summit - level session of the council on September 24 is nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament – one of several global challenges that the US now wants to see addressed at a multinational level .
UN officials also hope a climate change debate on September 22 will give fresh impetus to the search for a global climate deal at Copenhagen in December .
There are also hopes a possible meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu , Israeli prime minister , and Mahmoud Abbas , Palestinian Authority president , that Mr. Obama would host , could lead to a breakthrough about a timetable for Middle East peace .
[ efoods ]
Here is what the UN Security Council does .
Picture Obama as the Chair of this committee with this power .
Under the UN Charter , the functions and powers of the Security Council are :
* to maintain international peace and security in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations ;
* to investigate any dispute or situation which might lead to international friction ;
* to recommend methods of adjusting such disputes or the terms of settlement ;
* to formulate plans for the establishment of a system to regulate armaments ;
* to determine the existence of a threat to the peace or act of aggression and to recommend what action should be taken ;
* to call on Members to apply economic sanctions and other measures not involving the use of force to prevent or stop aggression ;
* to take military action against an aggressor ;
* to recommend the admission of new Members ;
* to exercise the trusteeship functions of the United Nations in “ strategic areas ” ;
* to recommend to the General Assembly the appointment of the Secretary - General and , together with the Assembly , to elect the Judges of the International Court of Justice .
No American president has ever attempted to acquire the image of King of the Universe by officiating at a meeting of the UN ’s highest body .
Obama apparently believes that being flanked by council - member heads of state like Col. Moammar Qaddafi — who is expected to be seated five seats to Obama ’s right — will cast a sufficiently blinding spell on Americans .
He undoubtedly hopes that the horrid state of the nation ’s economy , turmoil over health care , and a summer of racial scapegoating will pale by comparison .
This role as UN
Security Council chair will allow him to make decisions , influence legislation and resolutions , and set the agenda .
Right Soup will be closely following this very unsettling turn of events .
Like I always say , pay attention to what Obama DOES .

There was a leak yesterday to Bloomberg that the Fed is making plans to “ drain ” $ 1 trillion from the US economy .
Because supposedly our economy is overheating with too much money — not that anyone you or I know has seen a penny of it .
It does n’t seem to make any sense to suck money out of a cash - strapped country when the economy ’s in ruins : unemployment is reaching Third World levels , foreclosures are hitting new record highs , and lending is still contracting at an alarming rate not seen since , yep , the Great Depression .
So why would the Fed talk about pulling $ 1 trillion out of the economy , as if that ’s the medicine it needs ?
It is all about taking care the already - mega - rich Wall Street bankers and foreign investors who want to protect the value of all the money they plundered from America .
They want to ensure that the trillions they were handed by Paulson and Bernanke and Summers are still worth the same trillions next year …and to do that , they ’re going to apply a simple law of supply and demand : drain out $ 1 trillion from us , and the value of their trillions holds its value .
What ’s even more strange is that the Fed ’s plan to “ drain ” an incredible $ 1 trillion from our ruined economy comes after the Fed spent two years pumping trillions into the banking system , on the specious theory that the best way to get us regular folks that money is n’t to give it to us directly , but rather , to give it to the bankers first … because they know better than anyone , better than us especially , how to distribute it down to the rest of us ( that ol ’ trickle - down theory that ’s been working magic since Reagan suckered us into believing it ) .
We ’d lose it as soon as we received it — whereas they know how to hide it for safe - keeping .
Then there ’s the question of how : like , how do you actually “ drain ” or “ ” mop up ” $ 1 trillion from our economy–it ’s not like CIA agents running around Central Asia buying back Stingers from the mujahedeen in the 1990s .
( The actual process makes for boring reading , having to do with the Fed and primary dealers and its balance sheet and reverse - repos , bla bla bla . )
What matters is this :
The Fed is going to re-steal $ 1 trillion of the trillions it doled out to everyone who is n’t us , because Wall Street is complaining that if some of those trillions do trickle down to the rest of us , it ’ll cause inflation .
They ’re calling it “ excess ” — the same guys who are making so many billions they do n’t know what to do with it , they ’re the ones who know what ’s excess liquidity or not .
So by taking away $ 1 trillion of money we regular folks might get our hands on and use for our own selfish purposes , Wall Street thinks that it can contain the inflation disease that we carry around .
This is why the Fed and Treasury made sure that all those trillions went to a select few plutocratic institutions first , and not to the rest of us .
See , those dollars only have value to them as long as they ’re the ones in control of the dollars , and the amount of dollars .
If we all have these dollars , then they ’re not much value or use to the billionaires anymore .
The billionaires in Wall Street , Zurich , Abu Dhabi , and Hong Kong had two goals : first , to get ahold of the trillions they ’d lost , even if it meant stealing it all from Americans .
Then , once they got the loot , the next goal was to make sure it did n’t leak out to the rest of us and inflate its value away , otherwise , what was the point of looting all those trillions ?
So that ’s where we are now , in Phase Two : we regular folks must not be allowed to get our hands on any of that dough , or all economic Hell will break loose .
Drain it , mop it , suck it up–get the trillion out of our hands before we do something stupid like buy Jeep Cherokees with it .
Because basically we non-millionaires are slobs , and they ’re not .
They know what to do with money :
In their hands , money does n’t lose value ( it may vanish or turn into negative money due to overleveraging , but it does n’t inflate away , and that ’s what makes them so great ! ) ; in our feckless irresponsible hands , the value of the dollar goes to shit .
So they ’re taking it away from us , $ 1 trillion of it , for our own good .
I saw this same top - down elitist economic strategy in Russia in the 1990s , and all over the developing world : tens and hundreds of billions of dollars in IMF / World Bank loans went to financial institutions and the oligarch class rather than to the people , because that was supposedly the most “ efficient ” way of distributing and employing that money … rather than directly using those loans to pay off the tens of millions of pensions , teachers , state employees , and so on , which was shunned as “ inflationary ” and therefore bad .
“ Bad for whom ? ”
If you asked a question like that , you were a commie who did n’t get it .
See , what economists like Larry Summers figured out is that when the rich get richer , they do n’t spark inflation , which is the Invisible Hand ’s way of saying “ Thumb ’s Up ! ” ; whereas when the middle - class gets too much money , it causes inflation , and when there ’s inflation , it ’s a problem for the rich above all .
That ’s why Bernanke is going to drain that $ 1 trillion from us right when we were about to get a sip of it :
The bankers would rather see us starve to death than risk the possibility that the trillions they stole might lose a bit of their value through inflation .
The Fed says this is all about fighting inflation –which is exactly what Wall Street , the Chinese , Zurich and the rest of the super - wealthy world has been bitching about for the past six months or so–that is , ever since they gorged themselves on the trillions in handouts , and thought , “ Okay , I ’m happy again .
Do n’t need this government money anymore , at least not at this rate .
Hey , wait a doggone minute here–why is the government letting the rest of the schmucks in on the trillions ?
Get it out of their hands now ! ”
Everyone knows what happened to Spain after they plundered all that gold from the New World : too much gold in everyone ’s home led to gold losing its value .
Lesson : make sure only a few people share in the spoils .
So they want a lot of that money drained out of the economy before the rest of us get our hands on it and mess everything up with our highly - communicable inflationary diseases , which we carry around us like head lice .
According to the people who run our economy — Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner — regular taxpayers like you and me carry highly - communicable strains of inflation in our psyches , and so we have to be quarantined from that money to protect the nation , and especially to protect the super - rich , who should n’t have to suffer just because we do n’t bathe properly .
“ Ordinary fucking people –I hate ’em ! ” Bernanke and Summers agree , in their grim , meth - deprived way .
So now we know they want to take $ 1 trillion from us .
The problem is , how do you sell a plan this grotesquely evil to the public you ’re stealing from ?
I mean look at the record of the last two years : first , you loot Americans by destroying the values of their homes and their pensions ; then , you steal another $ 23.7 trillion from America ’s past - present - future and transfer it to the super - rich because they lost all their money gambling ; then , when $ 1 trillion of that $ 23.7 trillion is finally about to drip down to our parched beaks , the Fed runs in screaming “ No !
No !
Do n’t let it drip into their mouths ! ” and takes it away from us … for our own benefit .
How to sell something that violently counter - intuitive ?
First of all , you smother the heist in dull , unreadable business terminology , like “ Reverse Repos ” and the like .
Then , you divert the idiots ’ attention so that we do n’t even notice what hit us until it ’s too late .
To do that , you have to alter the perception of reality–and this is where behavioral economics comes in handy .
Because once the Fed drains all that desperately - needed money out of the economy , even those fairytale “ green shoots ” that Larry Summers ’
PR people tell us are sprouting under our feet , with little green dollar - buds just waiting to bloom so long as we water them with our hope — even those fantasy - green shoots will die if in the reality - world , a trillion real dollars is drained out of our fantasy garden .
In the real feudal reality we inhabit in post - Reagan America , it ’s the .1 % versus the rest of us .
And in between , you have Obama ’s economic team , headed up by Larry Summers , genius extraordinaire .
Let ’s look at the field from his point of view :
On one side , you have 300 million American robbery victims to worry about , because you know , how many times can you keep robbing the same idiots before they start to get it ?
On the other side is a more serious group whom Summers and Bernanke and Geithner REALLY worry about , every waking minute of their lives : Wall Street , and the major foreign money interests — Chinese , German , Arab , Japanese … .
We worry about being homeless and dying horrible health - care - deprived deaths ; they worry about the value of their billions .
And their worries are more important and serious than ours .
Wall Street already gorged on all the federal cash they could cram into their guts ; now they ’re afraid of seeing the value of their stolen cash debased and inflated .
So once again , Wall Street ’s interests , and their foreign finance allies / clients , trump the rest of America’s .
This middle - class woman caught inflation in 2001 .
Can you blame the billionaires for wanting to mop up her excess liquidity ?
So once again , our two interests are facing off in a zero - sum game–and yes , it ’s a zero sum game , no matter what all the shills say .
If I had a Special Drawing Right - denominated asset to bet on who ’s going to win this battle between 300 million Americans on one side , and a few thousand mega - rich financiers on the other , I ’d bet it all against me .
I ’d bet all the IMF bonds I owned on the Blankfeins , the Dimons , the Grosses , along with the Xiaochuans and the Schulte - Noelle ’s — kicking our sorry asses again .
And again .
And again .
They ’re like the Harlem Globetrotters in this rerun , and we ’re the eternal Washington Generals , slapstick punching bags to entertain the billionaires as they shake us down before every vacation they take .
And sometimes just for the fuck of it , they even set us off against each other , like a debased 21st century gladiator tournament for the Roman oligarchs : pit one diabetic group of Red State pensioners armed with crazy signs full of comically idiotic errors and idiocies , against another group of diabetic union organizers who get funnier the poorer and blacker and angrier they appear–send one part of the peasantry , dressed up in jester costumes called “ Tea Party ” outfits , to attack an even feebler part of the peasantry , called “ unions ” or “ ACORN . ”
I hope the Bill Grosses and the Jaime Dimons and our master Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud at least find us funny as we whack each other around for their entertainment , that our sordid , shameless infighting at least is n’t all in vain and it gives our overlords a laugh once in awhile .
Maybe that ’s why Prince Alwaleed bought a big chunk of Fox News ’ parent company , NewsCorp : just for laughs , for entertainment , something to keep him from dying of boredom while flying around the world on his private superjumbo Airbus A380 , to divert his attention as he counts up the hundreds of billions that the government extended to Citigroup , which the Prince also owns a huge chunk of .
Face it , there ’s not a lot of good entertainment for a multibillionaire Saudi prince these days : it ’s either funding Fox News for endless giggles , or funding Islamic hijackers , who are a one - show act .
But I digress … back to the Fed ’s plans to “ drain ” the economy of $ 1 trillion : at least this helps explain why we ’ve been shoveled so much PR bullshit over the past few months about how the “ economy has turned the corner . ”
It ’s a feint .
Last week , once again , Bernanke said “ the worst is over ” ; Geithner yesterday said we are “ moving toward economic recovery ” ; and Larry Summers , the Brain Bug behind it all , has been spewing out this propaganda for months , like when he declared that things were improving because google searches for “ economic depression ” had fallen to “ normal levels . ”
Larry Summers poses for his White House portrait .
The reason the Brain Bug is feeding us all this great news is that it ’ll justify their next brilliant move : taking all this money away from us just when it was our turn to lap up whatever leftover swill remained at the bottom of the Fed ’s trough , whatever the bankers and the sheiks and the CPC heads have n’t hogged for themselves .
It would n’t be responsible , fiscally speaking , to let us get a chance to lap up the scum at the bottom of their feeding trough , given our uncleanliness and the likelihood we ’d cause an outbreak of Inflation Plague — so the money ’s got to be drained , for our own good .
They know what ’s best for us , after all .
And if you ca n’t understand that , that ’s all right , that ’s why there are Brain Bugs like Larry Summers who can think for us .
See , Larry Summers and his ilk are behavioral economists who believe wacky elitist theories like “ the perception of reality is more important than reality ” — it ’s the same crazy elitist theory that Summers peddled back in the 1990s , when he converted Yeltsin ’s corrupt economic team to the “ perception trumps reality ” theory .
Not that it was all that hard–as a lot of Russian liberal critics argued , Yeltsin ’s reformers were essentially updated Bolsheviks in Western outfits , twisting reality and subverting democracy to push through their disastrous “ free - market ” reforms .
The chief Bolshevik of them all , Anatoly Chubais , was once described by Summers as “ my dear friend ” –and Summers even wrote several of the presidential decrees for Chubais , who then handed them to Yeltsin for his signature .
Throughout the 1990s , while reality - Russia ’s economy collapsed 60 % and Russians were dying off like fruit flies , Summers and his minions were running around Davos , Washington , Harvard Square and London saying that Russians were actually doing much better than their massive death - to - birth rate would suggest ; the only problem , according to Summers ’ behavioral economists clique , was that Russians just did n’t know how good they had it .
Once they “ got it , ” they would start behaving according to the model : they ’d spend , consume , invest , and do all the things they promise in those glossy investment brochures , until finally Russians became indistinguishable from mall rats in Salt Lake City .
Then in 1998 Russia ’s entire economy imploded back to pre-Bronze Age times , to a point that would have shocked even the ancient Scythians .
But that did n’t bother Summers none : he came out of that catastrophe more impressed with his genius than ever — and was rewarded with the presidency of America ’s top university , whose finances and reputation he subsequently ruined , before being named Brain Bug Number One to run the American economy from within the White House .
So here we are , at the mercy of the Brain Bug , who sees a problem : the super - rich got their money and now want to preserve it by taking away whatever ’s drifting down to the rest of the country , which is suffering .
And wouldtcha know it , the Brain Bug has the perfect solution to this problem : behavioral economics .
Change our perception of reality right when we need that $ 1 trillion , so that we believe things are getting better as it ’s being “ drained ” away from us ; and by our perception changing , we will change the economic reality , and all behave according to model .
Just like the Russians did .
“ Why not change the perception of the super rich ? ” you might ask .
Here ’s why : they ’re not ignorant fucking idiots the way we are .
You ca n’t fool them .
Behavioral economics is a bit like Newtonian physics in that way : its laws only apply to us idiots , while for the billionaires on Wall Street , a different set of laws , like quantum physics , applies .
Which may explain why they use words like Quants and Quantum Fund and all that –for them , reality is reality .
A dollar is a dollar , unless you print more dollars for the schmucks –then a dollar is 60 cents .
You ca n’t fool them with talk of green shoots and crises and statistics .
Either they get their giant bonuses or they do n’t .
Larry Summers is sure that he can manipulate the regular - citizenry ’s perceptions of our economic reality so much that we ’ll actually believe it and and “ live ” this improved economic reality that we believe : like , we ’ll believe we have jobs and we ’ll believe we ’re paying affordable mortgages on houses that rise in value , even though in the reality - version of our lives , we ’re trying to figure out how to apply for food stamps after losing everything we ’d saved in our IRAs to pay off a mortgage that ’s worth more than the house we no longer own …
That ’s how there are two laws of economics working , depending on the scale and the net worth of the observer : Reality economics for the super - rich ; behavioral economics for the 300 million saps , who can be sold shit on a popsicle stick and told it ’s Italian gelato , and they ’d believe it .
And here ’s the really depressing part : some of us really are buying it : as this recent article shows , folks in Mecklenburg County , North Carolina , are pretty sure that the economy ’s lookin’ up after all , even though they admit in the same article that their own private economic situation is getting more dire by the day .
( Then again , almost half of North Carolinans also think Obama is a foreigner … )
So maybe we deserve it ?
Maybe Summers is right to despise us ?
Maybe behavioral economics works , and you really can fool all the people all the time in this plebian dimension of ours .
Sometimes I wonder if Bill Gross and Larry Fink get together with Paulson and Bernanke and Larry Summers , and they survey all the hundreds of billions they were able to manipulate in the crisis , then say wistfully , like Robert Duvall in that great scene in Apocalypse Now : “ Someday , this war ’s gonna end … ”
Except that they ’re not wistful and tragic like Duvall was , because this war will never end .
In fact , it ’s a turkey shoot , because no matter how many of us they mow down , we keep walking into their line of fire with a big smile on our faces going , “ If I work hard , I can become rich too , just like you ! ” BLAM !!!
Nah , it must be boring for them .
No wonder they ’re all such insane gamblers .
Without resistance or fear of consequences , how much fun can looting Americans be ?

The key take away is precisely this uncertainty : we simply do n’t know if renewables — either current or potential future technology — will be up for the job .
Where does that leave us ?
This discussion — and many others related to Peak Oil — is really a matter of what is known as the “ Precautionary Principle , ” or what degree of consensus is required before we embark on a course of action that may result in irreversible harm .
Because the Precautionary Principle has such broad application in discussions of Peak Oil , I ’ve modeled this post as a discussion of the principle itself , using the issue of renewables transition as but one example of its application .
In the first two posts in this series ( 1 and 2 ) , I discussed the requirements and challenges of transitioning our global economy to renewable sources of energy .
My interim conclusion was that there are serious doubts about our ability to affect any significant transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy .
Much of this uncertainty is the result of uncertain systemic energy return on energy invested .
In other words , when all inputs are taken into account — as must be done where we ’re talking about shifting energy sources on a civilizational level — can a world powered by solar and wind power itself the way it has on oil , gas , and coal ?
What is the Precautionary Principle ?
The simple definition states that if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment , in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue , the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action
While the Precautionary Principle is traditionally framed in terms of proactive but unacceptably risky decisions , it can also be expressed in the converse as a need to avoid inaction .
Principle 15 of the United Nations ’ Rio Declaration states that “ [ i ] n order to protect the environment , the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities .
Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage , lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost - effective measures to prevent environmental degradation . ”
Likewise , the Precautionary Principle has a long history of application in resource management areas such as forestry , endangered species , or global warming .
See , for example , this graph on fisheries management :
However , in these classic resource management examples , there is not a strong underlying trend as we see in fossil fuel depletion and energy descent .
If you do n’t think that fossil fuel sources are finite and will eventually decline , then this article is n’t for you .
However , if you accept that we will see a decline in production in fossil sources of energy , then you recognize that our current situation is not like that of a forest or fishery — while reducing consumption will change the pace of decline , it will not suddenly make the resource self - sustaining .
As a result , we cannot simply proceed with less of business - as - usual .
Instead , it seems axiomatic that our civilization must either 1 ) accept continually declining access to energy , and / or 2 ) develop renewable sources of energy to compensate for the decline in fossil fuel production .
Unfortunately , that choice is n’t especially helpful , as we ’ll likely all agree that we must 1 ) accept some smaller degree of energy AND 2 ) develop renewable sources of energy .
The dilemma facing society , in my opinion ( and as I raised in the first two parts of this series ) is whether it is wise to spend our limited remaining endowment of surplus fossil energy in an effort to jump - start a large enough renewable energy program to essentially maintain business as ususal ( e.g. current economic , political , and social structures ) , or whether that energy would be better spent preparing in mitigation of an accepted and much deeper process of energy descent ?
If we ’re really talking about making societal decisions among various mitigation options — not the simple dichotomy of act with great risk or do n’t act at all and maintain the status quo—then how does the Precautionary Principle apply to deciding between several risky alternatives ?
There seems to be an argument leveraging the Precautionary Principle in both directions : one can argue that if we spend our remaining surplus energy seeking to maintain business as usual through massive investment in wind and solar power , and then those investments do n’t produce enough surplus energy to perpetuate themselves , then we will fall off an energy cliff far worse than if we had consciously powered - down ; conversely , one can argue that there is huge societal risk in not pursuing a solution ( mass renewables investment ) that could stave off disaster , and that “ managed ” energy descent will itself be an unmitigated disaster — it ’s really only akin to asking if you ’d rather kill three or your four children ( managed descent ) , or all four ( unmanaged ) .
Which course of action actually best addresses extreme risk amidst uncertainty — the fundamental purpose of the Precautionary Principle ?
Conclusion : we have a limited remaining endowment of surplus energy , and a limited amount of time , with which to prepare our society for energy descent .
There are many proposed alternative courses ( including staying our current course ) , often infused with selfish interest , and all ( at least if we ’re honest ) including significant degrees of uncertainty .
In the first two posts in this series , I tried to raise substantial uncertainty that a massive investment in wind and solar power will succeed in allowing us to continue with societal business as usual .
You may or may not have been convinced by my critique -- and I want to point out that I do n't claim that I presented a definitive proof .
For the purposes of this post , however , I submit that I have at least raised significant uncertainty about the viability of continuing business as usual through massive investment in renewables .
Without necessarily accepting my arguments writ large , if you accept that there is any uncertainty in this regard , then where to ?
Questions for discussion :
1 . Does the traditional version of the Precautionary Principle provide a guide for our decision - making ?
2 . If not , ** accepting the uncertainty in ALL potential options ** , what framework for decision - making should guide society ?
3 . How does this ( or any ) framework maintain its integrity amidst the self - interested ( and short - sighted ) influences that will continue to skew any such analysis ?
4 . Is there any validity in a solution that may perpetuate business as usual without also addressing the structural growth imperative of our current system ?
5 . How do we ensure that the needs and desires of future generations are adequately represented in this debate ?
To what extent are we morally obligated to do so ?
Do we need to consider only the future generations that will come to exist under a model of declining population , or is there some obligation to consider those future generations that could come to exist under a theorized continuation of business as usual ?

Two of government ’s obligations – enforcing child welfare laws and protecting the constitutional right to freedom of religious expression and practice – can clash when a parent chooses to rely on prayer and other spiritual healing practices instead of standard medical care to treat a child ’s illness .
When such a decision results in harm to the child , courts often are called on to decide the appropriate balance between these two government obligations .
Indeed , courts in Wisconsin and Oregon recently decided two cases involving faith healing that resulted in the death of a child .
In Wisconsin , parents who had relied on spiritual healing to treat their diabetic 11 - year - old daughter were found guilty of second - degree reckless homicide .
In Oregon , parents were acquitted of manslaughter charges in the death of their 15 - month - old daughter , but the girl ’s father ultimately was convicted of a lesser charge of criminal mistreatment .
To explore the legal issues that courts must consider in cases involving parents ’ use of faith healing , the Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life turns to church - state scholar Robert W. Tuttle .

Jesse Merriam , Research Associate , Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life
What laws apply in cases in which a child has been harmed due to a parent ’s decision to rely on faith healing instead of seeking standard medical treatment ?
These cases are generally heard in state courts because most issues involving family law , including obligations to provide medical care , are regulated by the states rather than the federal government .
Indeed , all states have enacted laws to protect children from criminal acts such as abuse and neglect .
But before 1974 , very few states had explicit statutory exemptions from criminal prosecution for parents who relied on faith healing rather than traditional medicine to treat a child ’s illness .
These statutes became very common , however , in 1974 after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services enacted an important regulation on the subject .
This regulation required that states receiving funds for child abuse prevention programs adopt exemptions for parents who practiced faith healing .
Although this federal regulation was rescinded in 1983 , by that time the vast majority of states had enacted some kind of exemption from prosecution for parents who practiced this type of spiritual healing , and most of these states still have such exemptions .
These exemptions differ in breadth .
Today , a few states , including Arkansas and West Virginia , have laws that grant broad immunity for parents who are prosecuted for criminal neglect or manslaughter as a result of engaging in faith healing rather than standard medical care ; in these states , even if a child dies as a result of a parent ’s decision to rely on prayer rather than medicine , parents are generally protected from prosecution .
Most states , however , have much narrower exemptions for faith healing .
These narrower laws provide an exemption only in cases in which the child is not seriously harmed .
Moreover , even when exemptions protect parents from criminal prosecution , they still allow courts to impose other penalties , such as ordering that the child receive medical care or removing the child from the parents ’ custody .
In general , in cases in which parents are prosecuted for failing to provide a child with standard medical care , have parents successfully invoked state faith - healing statutes to avoid criminal penalties ?
When an exemption clearly and specifically protects the practice of faith healing , parents have been successful in using the exemption to defend against criminal charges , even in cases in which the child has died .
But in states that have an unclear exemption that may or may not apply directly to the conduct in question , parents have been less successful in claiming that their belief in faith healing protects them from criminal charges .
Nevertheless , parents still have prevailed in some of these cases because courts generally interpret legal uncertainty in favor of the criminal defendant .
In a 1993 Massachusetts case , for example , the state ’s high court threw out the conviction of parents who were charged with child neglect when their son died after they used prayer to treat his illness .
The court held that even though an exemption for faith healing that was on the books at the time seemed not to apply in the event of a child ’s death , the couple could not be convicted under the state law .
That was the case , the court said , because the exemption was ambiguous enough that it could have led the parents to believe that they were immune from all prosecution for child neglect , even in cases resulting in death .
In response to this decision , the Massachusetts legislature eliminated the exemption for faith healing and enacted a rule requiring all parents to seek appropriate medical care for ill and injured children .
Finally , when an exemption clearly does not apply in a case involving faith healing , parents have rarely been able to defend against criminal charges .
Sometimes they invoke the protection of religious liberty found in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , but this type of argument usually fails because courts have interpreted the Constitution to provide very little protection for parents in this circumstance .
On the other hand , a jury may provide a legal protection of sorts for parents , since jurors have often expressed great sympathy for parents who have lost a child , sometimes regarding the parents ’ predicament as tragic rather than criminally culpable .
In a recent high - profile case in Oregon , parents were charged with manslaughter and criminal mistreatment in the death of their 15 - month - old daughter for refusing to give her necessary medical care .
Did these parents rely on a state faith - healing exemption for their defense ?
The parents in this case did not make a statutory defense because Oregon ’s manslaughter and criminal mistreatment laws no longer contain exemptions from criminal prosecution when a child dies as a result of parents relying on faith healing instead of seeking standard medical care .
Until 1998 , Oregon had one of the nation ’s broadest exemptions for faith healing , protecting parents from being prosecuted for neglect or manslaughter even when recourse to faith healing resulted in the death of a child .
But in 1998 , in response to public criticism of faith healing , the legislature narrowed the statute so that it no longer protects parents when their refusal to seek medical care causes serious harm to the child .
Because , in the recent case , the child died , the Oregon exemption for faith healing did not apply .
Instead , the Oregon parents argued before a trial court judge that the U.S. and Oregon Constitutions protected them from criminal prosecution , but the judge rejected the parents ’ constitutional arguments .
Because no written decision was released , the judge ’s reasons for rejecting those arguments were not made explicit .
But while we do not know the judge ’s precise reasons , his conclusion is one that would be almost universally shared by judges and legal scholars .
As to their federal constitutional argument , the parents asserted that the Free Exercise Clause , the provision in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that prohibits government discrimination based on religion , protected them from prosecution .
Almost all courts would reject this argument because when people violate laws because of their religious beliefs , the Free Exercise Clause , as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court , offers only limited protection .
According to the Supreme Court ’s decision in Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) , the Free Exercise Clause protects religious beliefs , but it does not insulate religiously motivated actions from a law unless that law singles out religion for disfavored treatment .
Therefore , in the Oregon faith - healing case , the Free Exercise Clause did not protect the parents from criminal charges resulting from their failure to seek medical treatment because the state ’s manslaughter and criminal mistreatment laws require all parents , regardless of their religious beliefs or affiliations , to seek medical treatment for their children .
The parents ’ argument under the Oregon Constitution was slightly more complicated .
They argued that the trial court judge should interpret the state constitution to require a stricter standard than the Free Exercise Clause standard applied by the U.S. Supreme Court in its Smith decision .
Under the stricter standard , known as the “ compelling interest standard , ” people would be entitled to exemptions from any law that conflicts with their religious beliefs unless the state could demonstrate the law furthers an important public interest .
As I mentioned earlier , the court did not release an official written decision , but a news report of the judge ’s ruling recounted his declaration that even if the case had been considered under this standard , the parents still would not have been immune from prosecution because the state does have a compelling interest in protecting the health and safety of all children , and this interest trumps even the most sincere religious beliefs of parents .
So while parents might have a right under the Oregon Constitution to refuse standard medical care for their children when that refusal does not seriously harm the child , in this case the parents did not have this right because their refusal to seek medical care resulted in their child ’s death .
After the judge rejected their constitutional arguments , the state ’s case against the parents went to trial , where a jury ultimately acquitted both parents of manslaughter but convicted the father of a lesser charge of criminal mistreatment .
Could a nonreligious parent successfully argue that faith - healing exemptions violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because the exemptions favor religious parents over their secular counterparts ?
I think it is highly unlikely that a court would invalidate a statutory exemption for faith healing on those grounds .
Many federal and state laws exempt people from an obligation to obey certain laws if the conduct in question is based on their religious beliefs .
These exemptions generally are known as religious accommodations .
( See the Pew Forum ’s essay A Fluid Boundary : The Free Exercise Clause and the Legislative and Executive Branches . )
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that religious accommodations do not violate the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause – which prohibits the government from establishing a religion and from favoring one religion over another , or from favoring religion generally over nonreligious beliefs – if the accommodations are designed to relieve burdens that people experience when statutes or regulations specifically conflict with their religious conduct .
Applying that reasoning , a court would likely hold that exemptions for faith healing do not violate the Establishment Clause because these exemptions relieve parents who believe in faith healing of the distinctive burden imposed on them by laws that require them to seek medical treatment for their children .
Is there a constitutional argument that these exemptions violate the Establishment Clause for a different reason : because they favor certain denominations – those that believe in faith healing – over others ?
This question raises much more difficult constitutional issues .
Many state statutes limit exemptions for faith healing to members of “ recognized ” religious traditions .
The exemptions often contain this language because the Church of Christ , Scientist ( commonly known as the Christian Science church ) , one of the major religious groups that believes in faith healing , has pushed for the legislation and has developed its own standards for training and licensing practitioners of its spiritual care .
An argument can be made that by including only “ recognized ” religious traditions such as the Church of Christ , Scientist , these exemptions discriminate against parents who sincerely believe in faith healing but who are not members of traditions that have become sufficiently popular or influential to receive state recognition .
For example , these exemptions would appear not to protect parents who are members of a newly formed religious group , parents who have sincere religious beliefs about faith healing even though they belong to a denomination that does not practice it , or parents who believe in faith healing but do not belong to a religious tradition at all .
A primary purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prohibit the state from favoring some religious groups over others .
So if a court refused to exempt parents on the ground that their faith tradition was not “ recognized , ” it would likely violate the Establishment Clause .
But such a court decision is quite unlikely because even when a statute contains discriminatory language , courts can and typically do avoid constitutional problems by interpreting the statute broadly to include all faiths .

I went through this a few years ago .
I deposited a check right before a holiday weekend at an ATM and they did n't clear the check for ten days - even though my online account already showed it as cleared .
This is what debit cards do now :
They let you take money out that is n't there .
They charged me $ 35 for every single one of my debit card transactions ( it came to more than $ 400 ) .
When I called my bank 's customer service hotline , they told me it was in my service agreement that it could take 10 days to clear something deposited at a " foreign " ATM - even though they all belonged to the same STAR network .
I argued with them , but they would n't budge .
So I called their corporate communications officer , told them I was writing a story about my experience ( noting I 'd found a class - action suit filed against them for this very thing ) and asked for an official statement to include in my piece .
Magically , my charges disappeared and I got an apology .
" You 've been a customer for such a long time , we 'll make an exception this time , " I was told .
Is n't America great ?
BOGOTÁ , Colombia ( Reuters )  President Álvaro Uribe has contracted the H1N1 swine flu virus , and doctors are treating him while he works at home , the government announced Sunday .
The news came two days after Mr. Uribe , an important American ally , attended a summit meeting with other regional leaders in Argentina .
He started getting a fever , headaches and backaches after the meeting , said César Velásquez , a government spokesman .
He said the leaders who met with Mr. Uribe had been told of his infection .
Costa Rica ’s president , Óscar Arias , was the first known head of government to have caught the swine flu .
He recovered this month from a mild case .
In a depressing new report , two Rutgers professors predict that it will take more than seven years to restore the health of the nation ’s labor market to prerecession levels .
The report , released on Wednesday , says that even if the nation adds more than two million jobs annually over the next seven years , that will barely offset what the authors see as a giant employment deficit .
The large employment deficit , the report says , was created by the loss of 7.1 million private - sector jobs since the recession began in December 2007 and by the economy ’s failure to keep up with labor - force growth — that is , the increasing number of people who want jobs — during the recession .
“ America faces a troubling arithmetic of employment recovery because of the extreme depth of the employment deficit it now faces , ” the report says .
“ It may take the nation until the second half of the next decade to return to the prerecession labor market conditions of 2007 .
Such a long road back is likely to be necessary if the nation is able to achieve above - average annual employment growth for a sustained period of time . ”
The report , “ America ’s New Post - Recession Employment Arithmetic , ” was written by James W. Hughes , dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy , and by Joseph J. Seneca , university professor and an economist at the Bloustein School .
The report gives a failing grade to job growth over the last decade , calling it “ The Lost Employment Decade . ”
Noting that there are 1.256 million fewer private - sector jobs than in December 1999 , it said the nation was “ destined to exit the decade with fewer jobs than when it began . ”
Dean Hughes and Professor Seneca contrasted this decade with the 1990s , when the number of private - sector jobs climbed by 19.2 million , and with the 1980s , when the nation added 16.2 million private - sector jobs .
To return to the labor market conditions of 2007 , the report said the nation would not only need to offset the 1.3 million annual increase in the labor force , but would also need to compensate for the job losses suffered during the recession .
Given conservative estimates of further declines in employment , the Rutgers professors see an overall employment deficit of 9.4 million private - sector jobs by December 2009 .
“ Erasing this deficit will require substantial and sustained employment growth , ” the report said .
Even with an optimistic picture for job growth , the report said , it will take years before the nation returns to prerecession labor market conditions .
The report notes that the economic expansion from November 2001 to December 2007 added 6.2 million private - sector jobs , or 1.0 million a year .
It compared that with the creation of 21.5 million private - sector jobs during the expansion from March 1991 to March 2001 , coming to 2.15 million a year , and the addition of 18.4 million private - sector jobs during the economic expansion from November 1982 to July 1990 , amounting to 2.4 million jobs per year .
“ Even if the nation could add 2.15 million private - sector jobs per year starting in January 2010 , ” the report said , “ it would need to maintain this pace for more than 7 straight years ( 7.63 years ) , or until August 2017 , to eliminate the jobs deficit ! ”
This , the authors noted , might be optimistic .
Those hoped - for 7.63 years of consecutive job growth would be about 50 percent longer than the average length — 58 months — of every economic expansion since World War II .

This one has a far more modest purpose :
to save the world from loosers .
What are loosers ?
They 're people who don't
know the difference between " lose " and " loose . "
Here are some clues :
lose rhymes with news , loose rhymes with goose
If someone has referred you to this page , you 've probably
confused those two very similar words .
Do n't be a looser .
Lose , v. t.:
To cease to have , to fail to obtain
Loose , v. n .
To relax ; to make less strict .
Razer has a history of making hardware designed for gamers , but the company 's newest offering does something new ; the product is a mixture of both software and hardware set up to make your raids a little more pleasant .
While the Razer Naga mouse may simply look like a piece of gaming hardware with a number pad fused into it , the truth is actually much more intriguing .
No software is worth it if the hardware is not up to snuff , and luckily the Razer Naga is a sexy mouse .
Yes , it lights up and the blue logo pulses in the dark — very impressive at LAN parties — but more importantly , the mouse features a 5,600 d pi sensor , 1 ms response rate , and a scroll wheel with 24 click positions .
That 's a lot of numbers that all mean that the mouse is ultra-precise and smooth in action .
The mouse itself feels good in your hand , although if you 're a fan of larger , heavier mice you 're out of luck here .
I have moderately sized hands and was able to cup the entirety of the mouse very easily , and the hardware is light and easy to move .
These are preferences more than issues or strengths with the product , but worth pointing out .
The Naga is molded with places for your index , middle , and ring finger , and frankly this mouse is a joy to put your hands on .
Even the cord has n't escaped the notice of the designers ; it 's made from a braided material , not simple plastic .
This would be an impressive mouse on its own merits , but the things that set it apart for MMO fans are noteworthy .
The pad on the side of the mouse features 12 buttons , with a selector switch on the belly of the mouse that maps them to either the top number buttons on the keyboard or the number pad on the side .
It 's interesting to see my laptop recognize the mouse as a keyboard , and then be able to use the number pads instantly .
My wife — who is an accountant — found the idea of actually crunching numbers this way rather ghastly .
The real magic happens when you mix these buttons with Razer 's software , called AddOns , which allows you to map these buttons to different actions inside your MMO game with ease .
You can set up the buttons to operate like a phone keypad , or arrange them horizontally as they would be as the mouse sits on your desk .
You can set it up so that your bindings on the Naga only impact certain characters .
You can map the keys so that hitting them while holding the control button controls your pet .
Here is a video from Razer showing how flexible the software is in World of WarCraft .
If you think twelve buttons is a lot to handle by touch , you 're right .
Luckily , Razer includes a series of plastic nubs , called trainers , that you can stick on any combination of buttons to allow you to navigate the buttons by feel .
It 's a nice touch , and shows the level of care given to the overall package .
Right now the software is only available for World of WarCraft and Warhammer Online , but Razer promises more games are coming .
The downside to all this ?
The Razer Naga is a niche product ; there is no reason to get excited about the extra buttons if you 're not an MMO player , and there is no way to disable them if you do n't want to accidentally hit one during the course of a game .
If you tend to have a tight squeeze when you play shooters or other games , this may not be the mouse for you .
On the other hand , I could see the value in using the buttons to flip through your units in RTS titles by mapping groups to your number keys .
This is a product that is either aimed at you or is n't , but it 's nice to have a company like Razer take something that could have been a gimmick and spend so much time to make the product really work .
All that effort comes at a price , however ; the Razer Naga is available now for $ 79.99 .
Sometimes you get what you pay for .
Verdict : Buy
A hacker has posted code on his Milw0rm website that could be used to attack a system running Microsoft Internet Information Services ( IIS ) server and install unauthorized software on it .
The good news is that the attack appears to work only on older versions of IIS — versions 7.x are not affected .
The flaw resides in the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) software used by IIS to transfer large files , meaning that FTP must be enabled for an attack to be succesful .
The risk posed by this vulnerability is n't completely clear yet , but Microsoft says it is looking into the issue .
" Microsoft is investigating new public claims of a possible vulnerability in IIS 5 and IIS 6 File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) and are currently unaware of any attacks trying to use the claimed vulnerability or of customer impact , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
The software giant will take steps to determine how customers can protect themselves if the vulnerability is confirmed and will take whatever action it determines is appropriate to protect customers once the investigation is complete .
The company might address the vulnerability on this month 's Patch Tuesday , it may be delayed to next month , or it may release an out - of - cycle update .
Given that the issue does n't affect the latest version , it 's unlikely that Microsoft will go with the third option .
The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) also issued a security warning in regards to the flaw : " US - CERT is aware of a public report of a vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Internet Information Services ( IIS ) FTP service , " reads a message on the organization 's website .
" This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code . "
US - CERT recommends that administrators disable anonymous write access to the FTP server to help mitigate the vulnerability , and says it will provide additional information as it becomes available .
Update
Microsoft has now issued Security Advisory 975191 in regards to the issue .
Affected software includes Windows 2000 , Windows XP , and Windows Server 2003 , using IIS 5.0 , IIS 5.1 , and IIS 6.0 .
Microsoft also confirmed that Windows Vista , Windows Server 2008 , Windows 7 , and Windows Server 2008 R2 , in conjunction with IIS 7.0 and IIS 7.5 , are not affected .
Here 's what Microsoft is currently acknowledging :
Mitigating Factors
FTP service is not installed by default on all supported editions of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 .
However , FTP service is installed by default on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 and all supported editions of Windows Small Business Server 2003 .
Affected systems are not vulnerable unless untrusted FTP users are granted write access .
By default , FTP users are not granted write access .
IIS 6.0 is at reduced risk because it was compiled using the / GS compiler option .
This does not remove the vulnerability but does make exploitation of the vulnerability more difficult .
Workarounds
Modify NTFS file system permissions to disallow directory creation by FTP users
Do not allow FTP write access to untrusted anonymous users
Disable the FTP service
Although Microsoft says it is aware of the detailed exploit code that has been published on the Internet , the company says it is not currently aware of active attacks .
We will keep you updated on how Microsoft takes action .
Update 2
The Microsoft Security Response Center has posted an update on the situation :
Today we updated Security Advisory 975191 as we are now seeing limited attacks .
Additionally , a new proof of concept published allowing for Denial of Service ( DoS ) attacks on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 with read access to the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) service .
This does not require Write access .
Also , a new POC allowing DoS was disclosed this afternoon that affects the version of FTP 6 which shipped with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 .
Customers should be aware that the Download Center has FTP 7.5 available for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 .
FTP 7.5 is not vulnerable to any of these exploits .
The initial vulnerability was not responsibly disclosed to Microsoft , which has led to limited , active attacks putting customers at risk .
We continue to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities .
We believe the commonly accepted practice of reporting vulnerabilities directly to a vendor serves everyone 's best interests .
This practice helps to ensure that customers receive comprehensive , high - quality updates for security vulnerabilities without exposure to malicious attackers while the update is being developed .
Microsoft says it is still working on a security patch .
We already know that it wo n't be ready by this month 's Patch Tuesday .
Barack Obama tried to put his presidency back on course last night with a rare fighting speech to Congress rounding on his Republican critics and promising he would not be deflected from his ambitious plan to extend healthcare to all Americans .
With polls showing support for both the president and his healthcare plan slipping , Obama used a rare speech to a joint session of Congress to try to win over not only the public but sceptical members of his Democratic party who could decide the fate of his reform plan .
Apparently giving up on the bipartisanship he hoped for at the start of his presidency in January , he made little attempt to woo Republican members of Congress .
Adopting an unusually aggressive tone for a president usually noted for his moderation , he expressed frustration with the way in which health reform was mauled by Republicans and other conservatives at townhall meetings across America over the summer .
His speech is likely to have alienated Republicans while liberal Democrats will be disappointed by an important passage in the speech in which he showed a willingness to drop the so - called public option , a federal - government insurance scheme .
Addressing Republican critics , he said he would work with those members of Congress prepared to offer alternative solutions .
" But know this : I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it 's better politics to kill this plan than improve it , " he said .
Accusing Republican opponents of " scare tactics " , he said : " I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are .
If you misrepresent what 's in the plan , we will call you out .
And I will not accept the status quo as a solution .
Not this time .
Not now . "
Obama wants to extend health care to 46 million Americans who have no coverage .
On the public option , he said last night that a majority of Americans supported it .
But signalling a willingness to drop it , Obama said : " To my progressive friends , I would remind you that for decades , the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it .
The public option is only a means to that end – and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our goal . "
He expressed a determination to achieve reform , noting that presidents had been trying to achieve health care reform since Theodore Roosevelt a century ago .
" I am not the first president to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last , " he said .
The Senate could vote on a bill before the end of the month and Obama has said he wants the legislation on his desk for signing by early next month .
But that timetable is slipping .
He has much ground to regain after allowing his opponents to dominate the political agenda over the summer .
An Associated Press poll that found that the number of those surveyed who are unhappy with the proposed reform has risen from 43 % to 52 % since July .
Obama , who earlier yesterday admitted he had made a strategic mistake by not setting out months ago what kind of bill he would like , allowing his opponents to exploit the ambiguities , last night began to sketch out the kind of health care bill he wants .
He sought to allay the fears of those who already have health coverage that his reform will negatively affect their existing plans .
" Let me repeat this : nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have , " he said .
What he wanted , he said , was to ensure that the private insurance companies offered a better service , no longer able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , a big issue in the US .
Insurance companies would also be required to cover routine check - ups , which many do not at present .
His plan would offer " security and stability " , the slogan for the night and the coming debate .
The White House invited a group of people from across the country who had been let down by insurance companies when they became ill to watch him deliver the speech .
The main part of his bill would spread insurance coverage to the 46 million Americans who at present have none .
Careful to say whether this would be a private or federal scheme , he said he would create a new insurance exchange that could negotiate decent deals with private insurance companies .
" Well , the time for bickering is over .
The time for games has passed .
Now is the season for action , " he said .

Five - year - old girl battling cancer viciously attacked by yobs who tried to set her on fire
A girl of five who is battling cancer is recovering today after two boys sprayed an aerosol in her face and tried to set her alight .
Scarlett Hellewell had to be rescued by neighbours when the boys pinned her down and sprayed the deodorant in her face in Halifax , West Yorks .
She escaped with just bruises after the deodorant failed to ignite .
Attack : Cancer sufferer Scarlett Hellewell , pictured with her mother Paula , was set upon by thugs who sprayed an aerosol in her face and tried to set her alight
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said : ' It is reported the girl was playing when she was approached by two young boys who kicked and punched her before spraying an aerosol in her face and attempting to set her alight .
The match did not ignite . '
The two young boys , believed to be only 10 and seven , ran off when someone came to Scarlett 's help on Tuesday evening .
Officers are appealing for witnesses .
Victim :
The five - year - old had to be rescued by neighbours
Scarlett 's mother Paula , 38 , a home support worker , said she was hoping to move away from the estate where they live .
She told the Yorkshire Post : ' The sooner we move from here the better .
' I was disgusted when I heard what these boys had done , though this is not the first time they have attacked her .
' Scarlett 's brain tumour is getting bigger and this was the last thing we needed to happen . '
Neighbour Adele Brearley , 30 , told the Yorkshire Post : ' Scarlett was really upset and her eyes were sore where they had sprayed deodorant .
' If they had managed to light the matches it would have been a lot worse . '
Scarlett is suffering from a tumour which has left her blind in one eye and with marginal sight in the other .
Earlier this month the youngster revealed that she and her siblings are selling off their toys to pay for a family holiday before she goes blind .
Scarlett and brother Nathan , 19 , Kai , eight , Finlay , six , and sister Hollie , 16 , have put their favourite teddy bears , bikes , go - karts , rugby balls , even a Ben - 10 pencil case for auction online .
' I want to play on a sunny beach and splash in the sea , ' she told the Metro .
' I am selling my bunny rabbit bag and hope to get a pound for it and my doggie that the teacher gave me .
I want to raise £ 2.60 for him . '
Scarlett was born with neurofibromatosis , which normally lies dormant until adult life , but it has struck early .
It causes numerous tumours to grow and one had formed in her brain , affecting her sight and her growth , so although she is only four , she is the size of an eight - year - old .
The youngster is currently undergoing chemotherapy and her family hope that she will be well enough to travel if they raise enough money .

When western anthropologists first heard reports of witch doctors who could issue deadly curses , they quickly found rational explanations .
The families of the cursed often felt there was no point wasting food on the “ walking dead ” , for example .
That ’s why many of the cursed would die : simple starvation .
However , other case histories have come to light that defy attempts to explain them .
In the 1970s , for example , doctors diagnosed a man with end - stage liver cancer , and told him he had just a few months to live .
Though the patient died in the predicted time , an autopsy showed the doctors had been mistaken .
There was a tiny tumour , but it had not spread .
It seemed the doctors ’ prognosis had been a death curse .
Though the mechanism remains a mystery , but at least now this kind of phenomenon has a name .
The “ nocebo effect ” is the lesser - known opposite number of the placebo effect , and describes any case where putting someone in a negative frame of mind has an adverse effect on their health or well - being .
Tell people a medical procedure will be extremely painful , for example , and they will experience more pain than if you had kept the bad news to yourself .
Similarly , experiences of side effects within the placebo groups of drug trials have shown that a doctor ’s warning about the possible side effects of a medicine makes it much more likely that the patient will report experiencing those effects .

This is not just in the mind : it is also about physical effects .
The stress created by the nocebo effect can have a long - lasting impact on the heart , for example – perhaps serious enough to cause fatal damage .
The race is on to understand the precise mechanisms behind nocebo .
Medical researchers are hoping that such an understanding will help to make the world a less stressful place .
“ It is a good way to understand anxiety , and to find methods to prevent it , ” says Fabrizio Benedetti of the University of Turin , Italy .

It all began in Plaza Hotel , New York City on the 10th of November 1983 .
Two Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates officially announced their corporation ’s first and next - generation graphical user interface operating system – Microsoft Windows .
Despite the criticism on stability and constantly being compared to their rivals Apple Macintosh , Microsoft Windows is still the most widely used operating systems in the world .
In this article , we ’ll bring you back to 1985 where the very first official Microsoft Windows 1.0 was announced , and then we take a trip down memory lane to see all boot screens and desktop interface of all Windows operating system possible .
Here are more related entries we ’ve previously published :
Full content after jump .
Windows 1.01 ( 1985 )
Officially released on November 20 , 1985 , this 16 - bit OS that cost less than 1MB in overall is Microsoft ’s very first operating system that allows multi tasking with graphical user interface on PC platform that runs on MS - DOS 5.0 .
Windows 1.03 ( 1986 )
Introduced in 1986 , Windows 1.03 is an upgrade to its previous predecessor Windows 1.01 .
Entire operating system cost about 2.2 Mb hard disk space .
Windows 2.03 ( 1987 )
Taking advantage of the speed of Intel 286/386 processor at that time , Windows 2.03 is a replacement for Windows 1.x .
It also starts the era where users are able to overlap windows , customize screens , etc .
Still the entire operating system cost no more than 2.5 Mb .
Windows 2.86 ( 1989 )
Windows 3.0 ( 1990 )
This is the third major released of Microsoft Windows with a improved set of Windows icons and applications like File Manager , Program Manager that is still being used in today ’s Windows .
This 22 May 1990 released operating system is then replaced by Windows 3.1 two years later .
Windows 3.1 ( 1992 )
Windows 3.1 is probably the earliest Windows most of us are familiar with .
Windows 3.1 and later Windows 3.1x is an upgrade to Windows 3.0 with bug fixes and multimedia support .
Windows NT 3.1 ( 1993 )
The first Windows New Technology ( NT ) introduced .
It maintains consistency with the Windows 3.1 , a well - established home and business operating system at the time , the new Windows NT operating system began with version 3.1 .
Unlike Windows 3.1 , however , Windows NT 3.1 was a 32 - bit operating system .
Windows 3.11 ( 1993 )
A superset of Windows 3.1 , Windows for Workgroups 3.11 added peer - to - peer workgroup and domain networking support .
For the first time , Windows - based PCs were network - aware and became an integral part of the emerging client / server computing evolution – Microsoft
Windows NT 3.51 Workstation ( 1995 )
The Windows NT Workstation 3.5 release provided the highest degree of protection yet for critical business applications and data .
With support for the OpenGL graphics standard , this operating system helped power high - end applications for software development , engineering , financial analysis , scientific , and business - critical tasks – Microsoft
Windows 95 ( 1995 )
Previously code - named Chicago , Windows 95 is a successor to all the existing Windows operating system so far .
It gives full graphical user interface support , integrated a 32 - bit TCP / IP ( Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol ) stack for built - in Internet support , dial - up networking , and new Plug and Play capabilities that made it easy for users to install hardware and software .
Windows NT 4.0 ( 1996 )
Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 included the popular Windows 95 user interface yet provided improved networking support for easier and more secure access to the Internet and corporate intranets – Microsoft .
Windows NT Server 4.0 ( 1996 )
Windows 98 ( 1998 )
Windows 98 was the upgrade from Windows 95 .
Described as an operating system that " Works Better , Plays Better , " Windows 98 was the first version of Windows designed specifically for consumers – Microsoft .

Former CIA official Paul Pillar says not so much :
Consider :
The preparations most important to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks took place not in training camps in Afghanistan but , rather , in apartments in Germany , hotel rooms in Spain and flight schools in the United States .
In the past couple of decades , international terrorist groups have thrived by exploiting globalization and information technology , which has lessened their dependence on physical havens .
By utilizing networks such as the Internet , terrorists ' organizations have become more network - like , not beholden to any one headquarters .
A significant jihadist terrorist threat to the United States persists , but that does not mean it will consist of attacks instigated and commanded from a South Asian haven , or that it will require a haven at all .
Al - Qaeda 's role in that threat is now less one of commander than of ideological lodestar , and for that role a haven is almost meaningless .
Much of the debate in Afghanistan gets caught up in a false choice : that we either engage in a costly nation building experiment in Afghanistan or surrender to the emergence of al Qaeda " safe havens . "
Everyone agrees that safe havens are bad and that the U.S. should make eliminating them a top priority .
But that does n't lead directly to the conclusion that we should therefore rebuild Afghanistan .
And if we 're truly worried about safe havens , what about this :
Jaish - e- Mohammad ( " army of Mohammad " ) , which is linked to a series of atrocities including an attack on the Indian parliament and the beheading of the American journalist Daniel Pearl , has walled off a 4.5 acre compound just outside the town of Bahawalpur .
Pakistani authorities have turned a blind eye to the new base , in the far south of Punjab province , even though it is believed to have been built to serve as a radical madrassah - Islamic school - or some kind of training camp .
To the extent that Pakistan " turns a blind eye " to massive Islamist compounds being built on their soil , no amount of nation building in Afghanistan is going to protect America .

OSAKA , Japan , Oct 15 ( Reuters ) - Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said on Thursday he had never said a strong yen was good for Japan ’s economy .
He said his political task was to stabilise the value of the yen based on the strength of the economy .
“ My remarks have caused a lot of misunderstanding , ” Fujii told a news conference after meeting with business leaders in Osaka , western Japan .
“ What I said after the G7 and G20 was that competitive devaluations were not good .
I never said the yen should be this or that . ” ( Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto )
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) -
They ’re faithful , friendly and furry -- but under their harmless , fluffy exteriors , dogs and cats , the world ’s most popular house pets , use up more energy resources in a year than driving a car , a new book says .
In their book “ Time to Eat the Dog : The Real Guide to Sustainable Living , ” New Zealand - based architects Robert and Brenda Vale say keeping a medium - sized dog has the same ecological impact as driving 10,000 km ( 6,213 miles ) a year in a 4.6 liter Land Cruiser .
Calculating that the modern Fido chows through about 164 kg of meat and 95 kg of cereals a year , the Vales estimated the ecological footprint of cats and dogs , based on the amount of land needed to grow common brands of pet food .
“ There are no recipes in the book , ” Robert Vale told Reuters , laughingly , in a telephone interview .
“ We ’re not actually saying it is time to eat the dog .
We ’re just saying that we need to think about and know the ( ecological ) impact of some of the things we do and that we take for granted . ”
Constructing and driving the jeep for a year requires 0.41 hectares of land , while growing and manufacturing a dog ’s food takes about 0.84 ha -- or 1.1 ha in the case of a large dog such as a German shepherd .
Meat - eating swells the eco -footprint of canines , and felines are not that much better , the Vales found .
The average cat ’s eco-footprint , 0.15 ha , weighs in at slightly less than a Volkswagen Golf , but still 10 times a hamster ’s 0.014 ha -- which is itself half the eco cost of running a plasma television .
By comparison , the ecological footprint of an average human in the developing world is 1.8 ha , while people in the developed world take 6 ha .
With pets ’ diets under the control of owners , how can their unsustainable appetites be trimmed ?
Convincing carnivorous cats and dogs to go vegetarian for the sake of the planet is a non-starter , the Vales say .
Instead they recommend keeping “ greener , ” smaller , and more sustainable pets , such as goldfish , hamsters , chickens or rabbits .
The book ’s playful title , and serious suggestion that pet animals may be usefully “ recycled , ” by being eaten by their owners or turned into petfood when they die , may not appeal to animal fans .
Offputting as the idea may be , the question is valid given the planet ’s growing population and finite resources , Robert Vale said .
“ Issues about sustainability are increasingly becoming things that are going to require us to make choices which are as difficult as eating your dog .
It ’s not just about changing your lightbulbs or taking a cloth bag to the supermarket , ” he said .
“ It ’s about much more challenging and difficult issues , ” he added .
“ Once you see where ( cats and dogs ) fit in your overall balance of things -- you might decide to have the cat but not also to have the two cars and the three bathrooms and be a meat eater yourself . ”

My name is Andrew Lake ( or Jamboarder if you prefer ) .
I grew up in Jamaica and currently live in Seattle .
I ’ve been a linux user since around the turn of the century but only started dabbling in KDE code about a couple years ago .
Much of my limited contribution has been to the plasma project .
As I learned more about the other Pillars of KDE I became more interested in doing up an app of my own .
I ’m especially excited about the possibilities provided by Nepomuk .
So , over last few months I started work on a media player and , inspired by Aaron ’s recent blog on continuous communication , it seemed appropriate to share my dabblings so far .
Bangarang is a KDE media player .
As much as possible , the pillars of KDE and existing KDE technologies are / will be used , and constructive feedback provided to the respective projects .
Hopefully this might provide additional set of use cases , and a platform to test them on , for some of the still evolving technologies .
The source code and project development page is hosted at http://gitorious.org/bangarang and anyone interested in helping is certainly welcome .
All features on the 1.0 feature target list are not yet implemented so this should be considered alpha quality software .
I ’ve released a source code tarball representing a 1.0 alpha A release on opendesktop.org .
I ’m developing on Kubuntu ( currently 9.04 with KDE 4.3 from backports ) .
I ’m especially looking for help with debugging compiler errors on other platforms ( sigh , I guess I really need to do up a VMWare or VirtualBox install ) .
Feedback , patches and participation are definitely welcome .
I only ask one thing : please be respectful .
I do this in my spare time and , as such , I \ ’d like to keep my motivation up .
Thanks much for any feedback or help !
Oh , and here are some screenshots :

The project , scratches my itch :
To have a media – audio and video – player that gets the basics right with a not - overwhelming interface .
Why do it ?
Simple .
Because I want to .
Nothing more complicated than that .

Let me just say that straight up front .
Yep , I ’ll say it .
I ’ve had a 75 gallon aquarium set up in my small 2 bedroom apartment for about 3 years now and it pretty much is a very crappy experience .
But I still enjoy it !
Why would I say such contradictory things ?
Let me put it this way – I love having my aquarium setup and it ’s a great hobby .
But , I find that having this big aquarium in my little apartment makes a lot of things very tricky .
Mostly in regards to maintenance .
No space
The space restrictions are the worst part of it all .
When I ’m cleaning needing to gain access to the back of the tank , I have a hard time reaching certain parts because of the small room constraints and not being able to put more space around the aquarium itself .
When I ’m needing running water ( as in , a faucet and counter space ) to clean filters and such , I have a small counter top that has pretty much no room for anything else other than what is already on it .
The sink is always full of dish - washing related stuff .
I always have to clear the area and clean up soaps and other stuff to get a clean aquarium maintenance area set up .
Water changes and topping off water also sucks .
I have no place to really store large vats of water , so I basically just fill up 3 buckets of water the day before a water change .
I will let them sit overnight , with salt mixed in , to prep them for water changing the next day .
I have to leave these buckets sitting pretty much right in front of the aquarium , not too much fun .
Then there ’s the storage space for all my supplies .
I have basically had to resort to allotting the closet to aquarium supplies only .
The closet is right next to the left side of the aquarium , and I have installed extra shelving to give me chest - level access to most of my common items .
The buckets are all stacked and stored underneath the low shelf , easy to get at when needed .
As far as aquarium hardware goes , I just have a canister filter , skimmer ( hang - on - tank ) , reactor ( hang - on - tank ) , some power heads and timers and power supplies underneath .
Pretty lightweight , no sump or anything like that .
All in all the aquarium is pretty solid , but if I did n’t dedicate the entire closet to the left for maintenance , maintaining this aquarium would very intimidating .
No construction possibilities
I am renting this place .
I ca n’t install electronics into the wall or tear a wall down .
I ca n’t modify the construction of this place in any way .
If I could , I could install some things that would make maintenance a whole lot easier , but for now I ’ll have to hold off and wait until I secure an owned household as my living quarters .
No basement
I have become convinced that operation of a large aquarium requires a basement or maintenance room of some sort .
I need a place with big counter tops , sinks , drainage , water storage vats , quarantine tanks and all kinds of other good stuff .
I ’m not going to have room for that stuff in my little closet .
I envision a system where my display tank and some controller electronics are the only thing upstairs on the main floor of the house , with all the supporting elements in the basement directly underneath .
I could run water pipes up from the basement to automate water changes and top - offs .
I could automate and control things so much more easily .
Hang tight
For now I need to just sit tight and hold out with this setup .
It ’s efficient for the most part , due to my constant effort to make things as easy to maintain as possible .
It ’s been working so far so I just need to keep it up and persevere until I have more space to work with .
Then I ’ll enjoy the space all that much more !
MOSCOW -- Vladimir Putin , Russia 's current premier and former president , gave the clearest signal to date that he is considering a return to his old job , saying that he and his handpicked successor President Dmitry Medvedev , will decide who runs in 2012 .
In a 2 ½ - hour question - and - answer session with some 45 Russia experts from around the world , Mr. Putin also gave his most detailed assessment of relations with the U.S. since President Barack Obama visited Moscow in July .
Mr. Putin said he was " mildly optimistic " over ...
MI5 men could face ' torture ' perjury charge over Guantanamo prisoner
Piling on the pressure : David Davis says the law must be upheld
Two MI5 agents may be charged with lying to the High Court over British complicity in the torture of a former Guantanamo prisoner .
In an unprecedented move , the court has issued a ‘ revised judgment ’ a year after its original ruling , contradicting the testimony of the agents , who are already the subject of a criminal investigation by the Metropolitan Police .
Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said yesterday : ‘ The Home Secretary has a duty to uphold the law .
‘ The fact the Attorney General referred this matter to the police shows that there is a case to answer . ’
Binyam Mohamed , 30 , an Ethiopian living in London , was captured in Pakistan in 2002 , then ‘ rendered ’ to Morocco by the CIA and tortured for 18 months .
After a further four years in Guantanamo , he was released without charge in February .
The court revealed that MI5 ‘ knew ’ Mr Mohamed had been rendered and that one of the agents had not told it about three trips to Morocco he made while Mr Mohamed was being tortured .
Clive Stafford Smith , one of Mr Mohamed ’s lawyers , said : ‘ The agents committed perjury .
The police will want to take this into account when conducting their investigation . ’
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Users of Microsoft Corp ’s Sidekick mobile phone may have permanently lost data such as contacts , photos and calendar entries due to the failure of a Microsoft server computer .
Models Ashleah O'Shea ( L ) and Arielle Vandenberg take a pictures of themselves at the party for the launch of T - Mobile Sidekick 3 in Los Angeles June 20 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
T- Mobile USA , a unit of Deutsche Telekom , said in a notice available on its website on Monday that its customers who do have such data stored locally on their Sidekick devices will “ almost certainly ” have lost the data .
It also advised customers against resetting a Sidekick by removing the battery or letting the battery drain as this would still result in the loss of any personal content stored on the device made by Danger , a company Microsoft bought in 2008 .
When operating normally , the Sidekick retrieves data from Microsoft servers after an event such as a phone reset .
“ Personal information stored on your device such as contacts , calendar entries , to - do lists or photos that is no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft / Danger , ” a Microsoft unit , the company said .
T- Mobile USA said in the statement dated October 10 that it would update customers again on Monday .
T - Mobile USA spokesperson Cara Walker noted that only a minority of the company ’s Sidekick customers have lost data due to the outage .
But Walker said that T - Mobile USA was still advising customers not to reset their devices on Monday .
Microsoft said in an emailed statement that the recovery process has been “ incredibly complex ” because it suffered a confluence of errors from a server failure that hurt its main and backup databases supporting Sidekick users .
The glitch comes as technology companies are increasingly looking to convince customers to use remote storage services to back up their data and at a time when Microsoft is fighting to regain ground lost in smartphones .
Because Sidekick runs on a proprietary Danger system Microsoft said that its other computing services were totally separate and did not rely on Danger ’s technology .
T- Mobile USA , the No. 4 U.S. mobile service , said that while its workers were seeking a way to recover the information , “ the likelihood of a successful outcome is extremely low . ”
The operator , which has been losing customers to both bigger and smaller rivals , said it is currently focused on looking for a way to restore data and is also considering additional measures for customers who have lost data .
Two Sidekick phones were listed as “ temporarily out of stock ” on T - Mobile USA ’s website on Monday .
Microsoft shares were up 3 cents at $ 25.59 on Nasdaq .
Bernard Madoff was given a 150 - year sentence in June The US financial watchdog mishandled a string of probes into the business of convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff , an investigation has found .
It said the Securities and Exchange Commission bungled five investigations despite many complaints over 16 years about the $ 65 bn ( £ 40 bn ) fraud .
However , the SEC inspector general 's report found no evidence of improper ties between the agency and Madoff .
Madoff , 71 , was jailed for 150 years at the end of June .
He admitted defrauding thousands of investors through a Ponzi scheme which he said had been running since the early 1990s .
' Regret ' SEC enforcement staff had " almost immediately caught [ Madoff ] in lies and misrepresentations , but failed to follow up on inconsistencies " , the report said .
WHAT IS A PONZI SCHEME ?
A fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits Named after Charles Ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the United States in the 1920s Differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person
They had also rejected offers from whistleblowers to provide additional evidence , it added .
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said that the report , by David Kotz , " makes clear that the agency missed numerous opportunities to discover the fraud " .
" It is a failure that we continue to regret , and one that has led us to reform in many ways how we regulate markets and protect investors . "
A congressional hearing in February severely criticised five high - ranking SEC officials for their failure to stop Madoff earlier - three of them have now left the agency .
Madoff 's firm was investigated because it made exceptional returns , but no irregularities were officially reported .
It was the global recession which in effect prompted Madoff 's demise , as investors , hit by the downturn , tried to withdraw about $ 7bn from his funds and he could not find the money to cover it .
The list of Madoff 's victims includes film director Steven Spielberg 's charitable foundation , Wunderkinder - but school teachers , farmers , mechanics and many others have also lost money .

Ludicrous “ agony uncle ” advises that teenagers visiting Alex Jones ’ websites may be psychologically unstable
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , Oct 12 , 2009
An advice columnist for the influential left leaning website Salon.com has launched a scathing attack on Alex Jones in response to a letter from a reader who says his 17 year old nephew has been “ sucked into the Internet conspiracy black hole ” created by Jones .
Salon ’s Cary Tennis refers to Jones as a “ cultish fear - monger ” and advises the reader named “ Buck ” that his nephew ’s visits to Jones ’ websites may be an indication that he is mentally disturbed .
Tennis initially reels off the usual psychobabble about people wanting to find simple explanations for complex things , needing to feel like there is a vast conspiracy to get them , and wanting to feel like they are privy to exclusive information that the masses are not aware of .
YAWN .
Towards the end of his response , however , he makes the following remarks :
I do not want to conclude without making explicit that if he has dyslexia or some kind of attention - deficit disorder , those are things that should be diagnosed and treated on their own .
If his mother ’s coddling has prevented him from facing up to these possible problems , that could be adding to his anxiety .
So I would definitely , in addition to the camping trip , or wilderness expedition , do what you can to bring to light any organic , diagnosable and treatable conditions he may have .
Treating them will not only improve his abilities but give him some confidence that obstacles can be overcome and differences in ability can be compensated for .
Labeling as mentally disturbed anyone who is skeptical or open to the possibility that conspiracies may have a basis in reality is a move we have witnessed before .
Last month Psychology Today published a piece with the exact same implications .
Writer John Gartner made Alex Jones the centerpiece of a story in which he attempted to define distrust of authorities and alternative explanations for the “ official story ” put out by governments and their corporate media arms as mental illness .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In our previous article we pointed out that there is a long history of those very forms of authority designating dissenting explanation as a psychological illness as a means to stamp it out along with all forms of critical thinking .
Salon ’s Cary Tennis got the gig as the website ’s “ agony uncle ” advice columnist , by his own admission , mainly due to a troubled past .
He occasionally makes reference to the fact that he is a recovering alcoholic and that these challenges in his own life have led him to find a connection with others who are in trouble .
I could respond by reeling off a parade of pseudo - psychological clap trap about Tennis wanting to believe other people are troubled because it exorcises his own demons blah blah blah , but instead I will just state that Tennis ’ attempt to play at being Sigmund Freud is tired and weak .
Free thinking people are flocking to Alex Jones ’ websites not because they are “ looking for a system that explains why things are fucked up ” , but because they have been consistently lied to by a cabal calling itself government operating through both political parties .
They are distressed that elites continue to wage wars in their names , continue to hand over the fruits of their labor to offshore banks and corporations , and continue to destroy their freedoms and lower their standard of living .
Hacks like Tennis appear ludicrous when they accuse those free thinkers of being out of touch with their own world when the reality of the situation is the exact opposite .
Pick up a newspaper Mr Tennis , look around you .
Who is engaging in mental gymnastics ?
Is it Alex Jones , who is gravely concerned about an engineered decline of society , or is it you with your accusations that he and his readers may be clinically insane for suggesting such a thing even exists ?
With consideration , however , it is my guess is that Tennis is not engaging in any kind of cognitive dissonance , but that he is just plain lazy .
My guess is that Tennis spent less than five minutes evaluating Alex Jones , his standpoint and the material he has produced over the course of the last fifteen years , before tapping away a standard hack response at his keyboard .
The mentally unstable conspiracy theorist in me has another suggestion , however .
Indulge me if you will .
The reader letter from “ Buck ” stinks to high heaven .
The now standard attempt to link Alex Jones with Fox News provocateur Glenn Beck rears its ugly head again , despite the fact that Alex Jones has clearly outlined his opposition to Beck ’s agenda on several occasions .
The letter also compares the 17 year old nephew to “ young men in 1930s Germany … when told that they were part of a master race being manipulated by the international Jewish conspiracy ” , thus ridiculously and callously implying that Alex Jones is akin to Hitler .
In what seems to be a pre-determined anticipation of our response to the attack piece , the letter also carefully points out that the young impressionable mind of the teenager interprets any any criticism of Jones as “ a product of the nefarious dark forces out to discredit the only man intelligent enough and courageous enough to tell the truth . ”
Call me a paranoid conspiracy theorist , but the letter has all the hallmarks of a carefully concocted smear piece .
Salon Media Group ’s board of Directors reads like a who ’s who of corporate media executives .
The publication also routinely carries columns by globalist philanthropist George Soros , who is always intrinsically linked with routine attacks on Alex Jones directed from the left .
Outlets such as Salon , Media Matters , The Daily Kos and Think Progress have begun attacking Alex Jones precisely because they see his truly individual status , ultimate bipartisanship and real grassroots popularity as a threat to their misconceived “ new media ” empire .
If “ Buck ” is a real person he really has done his homework in following the Soros directed attack program to a tee in his letter .
Of course , all that is in my attention - deficit disorder riddled mind .
Perhaps I need to take Mr Tennis ’ advice and get out into the wilderness some more .
***
Addendum : I can not let slip one more rather cheap shot from the Salon piece which comes in the form of criticizing Alex Jones based on advertisements on his websites .
Tennis derides our acceptance of “ comic book ” style ads for “ Powerful Herbal Medicines ” , while directly opposite his comments , and plastered all over his article for that matter , are a comic book like ads for “ The antioxidant superpower ” of 100 % natural pomegranate juice , instantly rendering his point hypocritical in addition to it ’s permanent irrelevance .

' I was sacked for being too fat , ' says ' stick insect ' model digitally retouched to make her head bigger than her waist
A model who was airbrushed to look super skinny in a Ralph Lauren advert claimed yesterday she was fired by the firm for being too fat .
Filippa Hamilton 's figure was altered so that her hips and waist were unnaturally narrow in the shot .
But yesterday she claimed : ' They fired me because they said I was overweight .
Overweight ?
Filippa Hamilton in the digitally retouched photo , left , and as she normally is at a party in New York in 2007 , right
' They said I could n't fit in their clothes any more , because I was too large . '
The 23 - year - old model , a size 8 , said it was particularly distressing because she had had a long relationship with the company .
' I 've been working with them since I was 15 years old , so I considered them my second family , ' the 5ft 10in beauty said .
' I was very hurt about this . '
Miss Hamilton claims she was fired in April - before the digitally - altered images of her were released .
' I saw my face in this extremely skinny girl - which is not me , ' she recalled .
' It makes me sad .
It makes me think that Ralph Lauren wants to have this kind of image - and it's not healthy , it 's not right .
' And it 's not a good example .
When you see this picture young women will look at this and think it 's normal , and it 's not . '
In a statement last night Polo Ralph Lauren denied her claims , saying their relationship ended 'as a result of her inability to meet the obligations under her contract ' .
' The image in question was mistakenly released and used in a department store in Japan and was not the approved image which ran in the U.S.
We take full responsibility , ' the statement said .
' This error has absolutely no connection to our relationship with Filippa Hamilton . '
Hamilton 's lawyer , Geoffrey Menin , said the image is ' gross distortion of how she really looks and which we fear will be extremely damaging to her . '
Hamilton said she was concerned about its impact on the public .
' I think they owe American women an apology , a big apology , ' she said .
' I'm very proud of what I look like , and I think a role model should look healthy . '
Asked if she planned to sue she said : ' I do n't think so , but I 'm not sure .
I do n't know - we 'll see . '
Here 's Rep. Alan Grayson 's money comment on Hardball last night , where the loudmouthed freshman congressman compares former Vice President Dick Cheney to a vampire :
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : “ By the way , I have trouble listening to what [ Cheney ] says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he ’s talking , but my response is this : he ’s just angry because the president does n’t shoot old men in the face .
But by the way , when he was done speaking , did he just then turn into a bat and fly away ? ”
MATTHEWS : Oh , God , we got to keep a level here .
Matthews also dubbed Grayson “ Captain Cajones ” at the end of the congressman ’s MSNBC appearance .

Filippa Hamilton , the 23 - year - old model who was Photoshopped into a stick insect by Ralph Lauren , has revealed that the brand — which later apologised for the image — quietly fired her for being overweight .

Hamilton had counted Ralph Lauren among her clients since she started modeling at the age of 15 and she says that she considered the people who worked there her second family — at least until April of this year , when Ralph Lauren summarily fired her .
The stated reason was that the label dumped Hamilton " as a result of her inability to meet the obligations under her contract with us . "
What Ralph Lauren allegedly told Hamilton 's agency , Next , is that the 5 ' 10 " 5 ' 8 " , 120 lb model had become too fat to fit into its clothing .

Ralph Lauren 's behavior since these images came to light , on the blog Photoshop Disasters , has single - handedly turned a small PR crisis into a full - fledged disaster .
First , the company had its lawyers try to sue Photoshop Disasters and BoingBoing , the second blog to pick up the story , for copyright infringement for reporting on the ad .
The threats — and the fact that Ralph Lauren managed to get Photoshop Disasters ' ISP , Google - owned Blogspot , to remove the image — not only came across as ridiculous and bullying , but only served to draw hundreds of thousands of eyes to the story .
( The Daily Mail , Huffington Post , Telegraph , Current TV , and Mother Jones , among other outlets , jumped on the story with more or less alacrity . )
The company 's apology , when it came , seemed sincere — but today , Ralph Lauren sought to distance itself from its decision to create and run the ad : " The image in question was mistakenly released and used in a department store in Japan and was not the approved image which ran in the U.S. "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
And for it to emerge that the model in question is a justifiably pissed - off employee that the brand threw under the bus six months ago for being " fat " — that 's just the cherry on the Ralph Lauren public relations shit pie .
The company 's admission of " responsibility " for the ad , coming after its attempt to minimize the ad's significance , rings as hollow as its protestation that Hamilton is a " beautiful and healthy " woman , and that the Photoshop incident had " absolutely no connection " to the company 's decision to fire her .
Which is it ?
Is the ad a one - time " error " that was " unapproved , " or is it something Ralph Lauren is prepared to take true responsibility for ?
Is Hamilton " beautiful and healthy , " or is she unable to meet the obligations of her contract because of her weight ?
Models get fired , or simply passed over for work , all the time for being overweight , but it 's a practice that rarely gets addressed publicly .
( Not least because anyone outside the industry might struggle to grasp by what measure a size 4 twenty - something who 's represented a brand for nearly a decade could be considered " overweight . " )
There have even been cases where models who have had eating disorders , having entered treatment , have lost work or agency contracts because of their choice to try and get better .
As much as it sucks that Hamilton was fired so coldly , it 's kind of thrilling that she 's willing to talk about it .
Advertisement
Did it never occur to Ralph Lauren to fire the photographer ?
Or the retoucher who created the image of the near - death Bratz doll Hamilton ?
Why did n't it consider firing the person who was responsible for releasing the image , if indeed that was a " mistake " ?
Why did Ralph Lauren 's sights immediately fall to rest on the person involved who bore the least responsibility for the drastically altered image in question : the model ?

What else is n't so great ?
Hearing some of Cosmopolitan editor Kate White 's statements in the full segment .
It seems to be the rule that any model , when doing television appearances , needs to be chaperoned by a fashion magazine editor , à la Ali Michael and Teen Vogue 's Amy Astley .
At least , that 's the only explanation I could come up with for White 's presence .
After grabbing Hamilton 's spotlight and hitching her wagon to the attendant publicity by offering her an 8 - page spread in her magazine — a favor that Hamilton , having graced the covers of numerous international editions of Elle , Harper 's Bazaar , and Vogue , including one of my all - time favorite issues of Vogue Paris , hardly need lower herself to accept —
White , much like Ralph Lauren , set about walking the delicate line of admitting that there might be a " problem " in fashion without doing anything so creative as taking responsibility for it .

" It really starts with the sample clothes , because they 've down - sized , they 're now like a size 2 or 4 , " says White .
" To some degree , it relates to the Kate Moss era .
Before then , supermodels like Cindy Crawford and Christy Brinkley , they were really curvy .
But they got skinnier and skinnier , and the clothes got smaller , and so it creates this cycle where you have to fit in the clothes to get the job , and then the models get smaller and that 's who we have to use in fashion stories . "
Notice the absence of subjects in that sentence : " it " creates a cycle .
( A cycle !
Those can be really hard to stop . )
" It " relates to Kate Moss , or at least her " era . "
" The clothes " got smaller .
( All by themselves ? )
The underweight ideal body that the fashion industry promulgates to women all around the world — and the underweight bodies that real fashion models are required to maintain , and which some cannot but maintain through unhealthy means — are problems that everyone is prepared to " acknowledge " in the fashion industry .
People write letters about it .
They institute meaningless , unenforced laws .
What nobody has yet done is actually make a serious , thoughtful attempt to confront these problems of the industry 's function — and this is an industry which is structured to punish the sufferer of an eating disorder who decides to enter treatment — and to solve them .

White 's perspective on the basic problem is troubling : " The models " got smaller — seemingly of our own volition — and that 's who she " has " to use in fashion stories .
The Cosmopolitan editor goes on to say , " I think women have to protest — and back it up .
Because sometimes women say they want real girls in stories , but often those stories do n't rate as well .
Or if you put a heavy celebrity on the cover it might not sell as well .
So women have to complain , and then back it up with their actions .
Their pocketbooks . "
If we do n't have the magazines we deserve , it 's really our own fault .
[ HTML1 ] I ’m going to go out on a limb and say that Portland — and to some extent the entire Silicon Forest — has a predilection for building iPhone apps .
No , it ’s true .
There are a number of amazing development shops in town — some one - person , some a few people — building iPhone apps that are attracting users by the thousands .
But who are those folks ?
There is n’t really any way to search for “ apps made in Portland ” in the App Store .
So I thought I ’d take the time to share the developers of whom I know off the top of my head — and of course , I ’m always open to your enlightening me on the ones I ’ve missed .
( And yes , you ’ll likely recognize some folks from a similar post last October . )

yes

no
I know several users here have reported it and I 'm incredulous that it 's still online this morning .
Hat tip to Doctor Frog for bring it to our attention .

Now what the fuck do we have to do to bring it to the attention of FB ?
Their corporate HQ phone# is 650-543-4800 but no answer at this hour .
I know this is barely a diary but Facebook needs to re-assess their administrative policy if this type of posting can stay up all night .
Maybe a diary will get their attention .
Originality is also key to making a good first impression , according to the analysis .
Dreary greetings such as " hi " , " hey " and " hello " are far less successful than sparkier openings like " how 's it going " and " what 's up " .

Female gorillas use sex as a tactic to thwart their rivals , new research suggests .
Pregnant apes court their silverback male to stop other females conceiving .
“ It seems to us that mating is another tactic that females use to compete with each other – in this case to gain favour with another male , ” says Diane Doran - Sheehy , a primatologist at Stony Brook University in New York .
Her team chronicled the sex lives of five female western lowland gorillas and one silverback almost every day for more than three years .
“ We wondered if , basically , [ pregnant ] females can mimic [ ovulating ] females and dupe the male into mating with them and distract him from what those other girls are doing , ” Doran - Sheehy says .

This kind of competitive behaviour may even help explain how humans evolved into a mostly monogamous species , she says .
Pleased to meet you
However , Homo sapiens and Gorilla gorilla are n’t the only apes who engage in recreational sex .
Bonobos treat coitus like a handshake , while female chimpanzees mate during pregnancy and outside fertile periods , or oestrus , to gain support from males and to protect against infanticide .
“ All of the males think they could be the father of your offspring , ” Doran - Sheehy says .
Yet paternity is n’t an issue for silverback gorillas , which usually enjoy exclusive access to a harem of females .
“ It does n’t have all that much to do with the males , ” Doran - Sheehan says .
“ It ’s what ’s going on with the females in the group . ”
Her team recorded most copulations and all births among a human - habituated group of gorillas at the Mondika research centre in the Republic of Congo for 1147 days between September 2003 and January 2007 .
All five females gave birth to one infant during the study and all engaged in sex after pregnancy , the researchers found .
However , females seemed to time such post - conceptive romps with the fleeting fertility of another female .
Strategic sex
For instance , after one female , MK , became pregnant she mated with the silverback during three consecutive oestrus cycles of another gorilla , EB , who left the group afterwards .
With only lactating – and therefore sexually inactive – females remaining , MK ceased offering herself to the silverback .
Another female named UG mated throughout her pregnancy , almost always when another female was trying to become pregnant .
The silverback seemed none the wiser .
Unlike male mountain gorillas , which prefer to mate with fertile females , Doran - Sheehy ’s silverback went for higher - ranking females , fertile or not .
Such prestige could be one reason why pregnant females fake oestrus : group sizes are limited , and females must curry favour with a male to stick around .
By delaying the pregnancy of others , females could also gain a reproductive advantage over competitors , says Tara Stoinski , a primatologist at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia , who found that pregnant female gorillas in captivity also time their sexual advances to coincide with those of other females .
“ I agree with Diane ’s assertion that females are competing with each other . ”

A body is sprawled across the middle of the road , but no one stops .
And why would they ?
This is George St. , home to Seaton House – the city 's largest homeless shelter , a booming drug trade and a scuzzy strip club - hotel , all in the most violent quarter of the city .
More than North York 's Jane St. and Finch Ave. intersection or the west end 's Keele St. and Eglinton Ave. neighbourhood , the downtown Dundas and Sherbourne Sts. corridor ranks first in virtually every category of violent crime , based on sheer volume and crime per square kilometre , according to documents obtained by the Star .
In street robberies , assault - related offences and what police call " violent calls for service " ( which encompasses shootings , stabbings , a person with a knife or gun , and sex attacks ) the six downtown blocks south of Allan Gardens top every list .
By volume , Dundas and Sherbourne ranks fourth behind Jane and Finch , Keele and Eglinton , and Albion Rd. and Finch Ave .
But on a per-square - kilometre basis , the area is No. 1 .
" That 's what happens when you put all the city 's poorest people together on the same block , " said Garry De Jong , a 48 - year - old janitor who pays $ 440 a month to live in a rooming house on Dundas St. E. , just east of Jarvis St .
The downtown east side , south of Gerrard St. E. and north of Queen St. E. , and between Jarvis and Sherbourne Sts. , houses three of the city 's largest shelters .
On any given day , as many as 1,000 homeless people will descend on the region , napping on the sidewalks and fighting in the streets .
Million - dollar townhouses guarded by two - metre iron fences line these streets .
Many have surveillance cameras over the front door .
Prostitutes work the east side of Allan Gardens .
Addicts twitching from withdrawal walk in circles in front of Moss Park .
And crack dealers flock to George St. to ply their trade .
It 's busiest on Thursdays , says 30 - year - old Julie Harland , because that 's the day the transients get their " personal needs allowance . "
Harland began renting a townhouse on the north end of George St. in 2000 when she was attending Ryerson University .
Four years later , the unit next to hers went on the market for $ 180,000 .
" What can I say , it 's about 1,800 square feet .
Five floors with two bedrooms .
( My husband and I ) got a great deal , " she said , walking her perfectly groomed Yorkshire terrier , Izzie , near the Allan Gardens dog park .
For the most part , she says , they do n't have any problems with the locals , although she has had to spray a few with the garden hose to get them off her property .
Last summer , 51 Division 's Dundas and Sherbourne was selected – along with Jane and Finch in North York – to receive additional support from the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy during the peak crime months of May to September .
During those months between 2004 - 2008 , there were 257 street robberies in the Dundas and Sherbourne neighbourhood – compared to 196 at second - place Jane and Finch .
Over the same period , there were 3,947 assault - related calls in the downtown region , as opposed to 2,579 in the Dundas and Dovercourt area .
This year , based on the crime data report , TAVIS was deployed to Jane and Finch and 12 Division 's Keele and Eglinton after a rash of shooting homicides in the spring .
Staff Supt . Glenn De Caire , who decided not to return TAVIS officers to 51 Division this summer , says there are considerable city resources in that area .
( A city official cited the Streets to Homes program , counselling , housing and health support provided at Seaton House and the massive revitalization of nearby Regent Park . )
" The TAVIS - focused neighbourhood deployment had great success last summer , " he said .
Compared to this time last year , there has been a 6.5 per cent drop in overall crime .
" And TAVIS , the divisional strategy , is still being used in 51 ( Division ) this year – we have n't just forgotten about the neighbourhood . "
But the region requires a community approach to policing , he said .

" We can go out there and fill up the cells every night , but that 's the wrong thing to do .
There is the education .
There is prevention .
We need to get some of the people who are homeless into shelters .
Some of the people who suffer from emotional disturbances , we need to get them to a place of help , " he said .
" These are people who do n't belong in jail , they need to be somewhere where they can get the help they need . "
The report was compiled in February by the Crime Information Analysis Unit .
The TAVIS officers deployed in 31 and 12 Division this summer were scheduled to leave on Sept. 20 , but that 's been extended .
If you have read previous State of the Computer Book Market posts , you know we typically publish between 3 - 5 posts that summarize the computer book market for a given year .
SInce it ’s mid-year , I thought I ’d do a shorter , one - post summary of where things stand in 2009 thus far .
The picture looks like our US economy : lots of bad news peppered with small glimmers of hope .
So let ’s look at the Market , Categories , Publishers , and Languages .
The market has been on a steady decline since mid-2008 and has continued downward right through the first half of 2009 .
And there are very few signs that the book - buying slump is going to turn around anytime soon .
Overall , the market saw 595,821 fewer units sold in the first half of 2009 than were sold in the same period of 2008 .
Although we do not have data to show the trends between 2000 and 2003 , the market performance this year is the worst we ’ve seen since the fall of of 2001 .
You ’ll notice in the chart below that the seasonal patterns have remained consistent , but sales are at a much lower volume than any previous year .
No matter how we look at the data , it ’s not great news .
Of our top 121 established categories , only 8 of them showed an increase in units sold for the first half of 2009 .
In descending order those categories are :
Mac Programming Objective C Online Video Global Positioning Device Computerized Home Mobile Programming Coordinated Systems Open Source Topics .
The eight categories showing the biggest decrease in unit sales for the first half of 2009 , in descending order are :
Office Suites Web Programming Mac OS Web Page Creation Spreadsheets Rich Web Interface Digital Photography Windows Consumer
In other words , Windows Consumer was the biggest loser year - over - year .
Unfortunately , none of the categories that showed growth were large enough to make the top 20 ( of the 121 categories ) from a units sold perspective .
I do find it interesting that Open Source seems to be doing better during this time of economic uncertainty
The chart below shows our top 20 categories for the first half of 2008 and 2009 .
From a publisher / imprint perspective , John Wiley , the non-Dummies part , was the only imprint that demonstrated growth for the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 .
The other 19 imprints sold fewer units in 2009 , and the imprints with the largest declines were the ones that had the best performances in 2008 — namely O’Reilly , Dummies , and Peachpit .
Unfortunately for us , O’Reilly experienced the largest drop - off in units for the first half of 2009 compared to the first - half of 2008 , where we had a tremendously strong start .
The chart below shows the imprint performance for the first half of 2008 and 2009 .
The big success story among programming languages is Objective - C , which has grown from a small ( low unit sales ) language into a large ( high units sales ) language .
i Phone and Mac development is fueling this growth .
After Objective C , PHP and Actionscript are the only languages with more units sales in 2009 than in 2008 .
C# continues to be the largest language for unit sales , followed by Java , PHP and Objective C. C# also experienced the largest decline in units sold sold during the first half of 2009 and was followed on its decline by Ruby , SQL and Javascript .
I almost forgot about the glimmers of hope I mentioned at the beginning of the post .
Mac Programming , Objective C , and Open source are doing well , but I do believe there are other events happening this year that will give the market a boost .
A highly anticipated release of Windows 7 should give a large segment of the market a significant boost .
Two other Microsoft technologies will also help the market : Sharepoint and Visual Studio releasing new versions later this year .
And of course , there is Mac OS X Snow Leopard coming “ soonish . ”
That will also be a nice boost for computer book sales .
HTML 5 is getting lots of attention , and I would imagine that books will be showing up soon .
Finally both Adobe and Apple keep bringing out new releases of their products , so there is always a bump upwards in our industry .
What we hope for is that new books on new releases sell more units than books that are returned due to obsolescence .
In other words , will there be more Windows Vista books being returned from retailers to publishers than Windows 7 books are being sold to consumers ?
We ’ll see in about six months .
A little disclaimer material : This information comes from Nielsen Bookscan and is the US Retail Point - of - Sale data .
In other words , a “ sold unit ” is recognized when you walk into a bookstore like Barnes & Noble or Borders or order online at Amazon .
This is NOT data that is used to calculate royalties or report on the financial health of any particular publisher .
Many publishers report that more than 50 % of their revenue is achieved as direct sales , and those numbers do not get reported into Bookscan .
Sales at traditional college bookstores are typically not reported into Bookscan as well .
Again this is US Retail Sales data recorded at the point of sale to a consumer .
Thank you for reading .
If there is something that you are itching to see ( understand more clearly ) , please let me know and I will try to help .
I plan to excerpt updated pieces of these posts on twitter throughout the year .
They ’ll come from @mikehatora and will likely get RT ’ed by @oreillymedia .
PITTSBURGH 
A federal judge on Thursday ordered the City of Pittsburgh to allow a group ’s tent city protest during the Group of 20 meeting next week , but he denied two other requests for permits for demonstrations , saying the city ’s goal of “ protecting visiting foreign leaders is of the highest interest . ”
The judge , Gary L. Lancaster of Federal District Court , made his ruling just over a week before the leaders of 20 of the world ’s largest and emerging economies meet here in a gathering that has become a rallying point for a variety of protesters .
Six groups sued the city , state and federal governments last week after being denied permits after months of discussions .
Since their lawsuit was filed , the city granted permits to three of the groups : for an interfaith march by the G6 Billion group ; for another march by the group Bail Out the People ; and for permits for a group of artists to use a city park .
I attended KDD this year .
The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects .
It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences .
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at .
KDD also experimented this year with crowdvine which was interesting .
Compared to Mark Reid ‘s efforts with ICML , they managed to get substantially more participation .
There seemed to be two reasons : the conference organizers more deeply integrated and encouraged the use of crowdvine , and crowdvine has certain handy additional uses — you can create your own personal schedule for instance , which incidentally provides some vague global notion of the popularity of various papers .
The biggest drawback I found was that the papers themselves were not integrated into the website .

Lauren Weber ’s father is , to put it bluntly , cheap .
When she was growing up in the cold winters of Connecticut , he refused to turn the thermostat above 50 degrees .
He washed all the dishes by hand , in cold water , even though the family owned a dishwasher .
He even used hand motions to signal a turn while driving so his turn - signal bulbs would last longer .
As a kid , Lauren bristled at her dad ’s frugality ( and when she wanted an extravagance , like Guess jeans , she went to Mom ) .
She feared that her family was secretly on the verge of bankruptcy .
They were n’t — her father was , in fact , a professional economist , teaching at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy .
He did n’t lack for money .
A lifestyle of extreme thrift simply felt right to him .
Then , when Lauren grew up , a funny thing happened :
She realized that she ’s now cheap , too .
And she noticed something else .
Her older sister , like her and her father , is very mindful of money .
Her older brother is not .
Although Lauren carefully compares the prices of dried beans ( $ 1.49 for twelve servings ) and canned beans ( 79 cents for four servings ) , her brother thinks nothing of eating out all the time .
He does n’t live beyond his means , but he definitely has n’t adopted the same tightwad attitude that Lauren did .
This scenario might sound familiar to you :
One sibling winds up a saver while another is a spender , despite having been raised in the same household .
That this happens is not that unusual .
What ’s interesting is why .
Since the Great Bust began , we ’ve heard a lot of talking about thrift .
We are , it seems , a nation of newly converted tightwads .
Consumer spending has plummeted , the savings rate is going up , and magazines and newspapers have declared this “ The New Frugality ” as we collectively embrace “ The End of Excess . ”
Invariably , this conversation is framed in terms of morality .
During the boom years , we were reckless .
We spent wildly .
We were the grasshoppers ( Live for today ! ) and not the ants ( Save for tomorrow ! ) .
This moralistic attitude toward thrift has a provenance in America .
Our puritanical forefathers , from Cotton Mather onward , preached thrift as a virtue , akin to kindness or temperance — a fortifying concept you should choose to embrace .
But what if thriftiness is not a virtue at all ?
What if being thrifty is not a question of choosing between good and bad behavior but is instead akin to a character trait , like being shy ?
What if some people are born thrifty and some are not ?
Let ’s imagine there are four people in a room .
The first person is a classically trained economist .
The second is Benjamin Franklin .
The third is a behavioral psychologist .
The fourth person is you .
And you are considering the price tag on an expensive pair of boots .
To the economist , your decision to buy the boots should be purely rational .
You should think :
Do I have the money to afford these boots ?
If so , is the pleasure they will give me equal to or greater than the cost ?
And if I save this money , will it afford me greater pleasure in the future — for example , by contributing to a vacation or simply to an increased sense of security ?
To Benjamin Franklin , your decision is a moral one .
Could n’t you go another season with your old boots , maybe if you got them resoled ?
And by denying yourself this indulgence now , might you not become a better person in the long run ?
As for the behavioral psychologist , well , until fairly recently , no one was really sure what he would think .
While there have been plenty of studies on why we spend money , there have been relatively few studies on why we do n’t .
“ The standard economic theory says that when we save , we ’re making a trade - off between today ’s pleasure and tomorrow ’s pleasure , ” says George Loewenstein , a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University .
Yet most of us recognize that decisions about money are rarely that rational .
Loewenstein decided to find out why .
So , together with Scott Rick of the University of Pennsylvania and Cynthia Cryder of Carnegie Mellon , he completed a study in 2007 in which a group of people — over 13,000 respondents — were given a questionnaire in which they ranked themselves on a “ Spendthrift - Tightwad ” scale .
Then they were presented with several simple spending decisions ; for example , they were asked whether , when buying a DVD , they would be willing to pay an extra $ 5 fee to have it shipped overnight .
According to classic economic theory , such a decision should be made through a series of rational considerations , like whether the cost ( $ 5 ) was worth the benefit ( getting the DVD right away ) .
What Loewenstein discovered , however , is that our decisions about money are often driven not by what ’s rational but by a purely emotional response that he came to call the “ pain of paying . ”
Simply put , tightwads find spending money painful .
Spendthrifts do n’t — even if they ’re engaging in detrimental behavior , like running up debt .
He also discovered a third group : frugal types who find saving money more enjoyable than spending it .
If you have ever stood considering the price tag of an expensive item — albeit not in the presence of Milton Friedman or Ben Franklin — you ’ll intuitively recognize that these findings are correct .
Decisions about spending and saving evoke a complex mess of positive associations , negative emotions , and moral quandaries .
Often , our sense of self is deeply connected to our attitudes toward money .
Lauren Weber has collected many such stories in her new book , In Cheap We Trust : The Story of a Misunderstood American Virtue .
She describes a food activist from New York who spotted a necklace during a trip to Italy .
She loved the necklace , but it cost $ 1,000 .
She did n’t calmly weigh the pleasure of spending versus saving ; rather , she described the ordeal as “ an existential crisis . ”
Did she want the necklace ?
She did .
Could she afford the necklace ?
She could .
Did she buy the necklace ?
She did not — because she ultimately concluded , “ Who spends a thousand dollars on a necklace ?
Not me . ”
But if tightwads naturally feel a pain of paying , where does this pain come from ?
And why do some people feel it and others do n’t ?
Scott Rick explains it this way : “ My unverified instinct is that it ’s largely something you ’re stuck with , ” he says in Weber ’s book .
“ It ’s genes , parenting , schooling , a combination of influences . ”
Loewenstein likens our spending tendencies to a behavioral trait like shyness — i.e. , something you develop very early and that is subsequently very hard to change .
“ Studies have shown there are huge differences in shyness in young children , ” he told me .
“ And while you can take a young child who starts out very shy and , given the right environment , move him toward the middle , it ’s very unlikely and unusual for a shy child to transform into a real extrovert .
I think this is similar . ”
So just as one sibling might be bashful while another is outgoing , one can become a tightwad while another spends freely .
Of course , circumstances can influence your spending decisions — but not as much as you might think .
A tightwad who wins the lottery may splurge a little more often , and a spendthrift who gets laid off will tighten his budget by necessity , but neither one is likely to convert into the other .
Thus you have another example that Weber collected : a Manhattanite tightwad who walked three hours to work and back every day to avoid paying subway fare — then left $ 23 million to charity when he died .
Another recent experiment helps explain these irrational decisions .
In a study published in 2007 , Loewenstein teamed with Drazen Prelec of MIT and psychologists at Stanford to determine exactly which part of our brain makes decisions about spending .
To do so , they took MRI brain scans of subjects who were given $ 40 , then presented with a series of items they could purchase with the understanding that they ’d keep any cash they did n’t spend .
First a subject was shown a photograph ( of , say , wireless headphones ) , then the price .
When the team studied the scans , they discovered the subjects were making their spending decisions in an intuitive , even animalistic , manner .
When a subject saw an item he wanted , it activated his nucleus accumbens , which is the area of the brain associated with anticipating or experiencing pleasure , such as eating a piece of cake .
But when he saw a price he did n’t like , it activated the insula , the portion of the brain that reacts to unpleasant shocks , like a bad smell .
So for tightwads , encountering an expensive item was literally unpleasant — like sniffing a carton of spoiled milk .
Of course , the Spendthrift - Tightwad scale might hold true for individuals , but as a nation , we ’re irresponsible , rapacious consumers , right ?
Did n’t Americans just spend the last twenty years blithely racking up charges and running up debt ?
Well , yes and no .
It ’s true that , when you spend more than you can afford — either as an individual or as a country — you will get yourself in trouble .
That ’s not morality ; that ’s math .
But if Loewenstein ’s findings are correct , we ’ve been approaching the question of consumption in the wrong way .
Because we regard thrift as a virtue , not a trait , our national discussion often echoes the tone of early alcohol - temperance meetings .
Spender , repent !
Debtors , you can be reformed !
Loewenstein sees it differently .
One of the most surprising findings in his tightwads - and - spendthrifts study was that , on average , tightwads outnumbered spendthrifts 3 to 2 .
This was a small sample , of course , but it suggests that , rather than a nation of spoiled hedonists , we ’re naturally inclined to be cheap — we just do n’t always act that way .
He also found that minor enticements — for example , adding the word small to the proposed $ 5 delivery fee — made tightwads 20 percent more likely to relent .
In other words , if we feel a pain of paying , that pain can also be anesthetized .
Loewenstein suggests that many of the now - identified culprits of the bust — easy credit , unsustainable home prices , a falsely robust economy — worked together to ease our collective pain .
This is actually good news , because it means that the downturn — with its restrained spending , rising savings , and the disappearance of economic anesthetics like easy credit — is n’t forcing us to resist our natural tendencies .
It ’s returning us to them .
This shift in thinking on thrifty behavior has led some economists to believe we ’ll be best served not by sermons on virtue but by devising ways to help people act in their financial best interest — much as previous conditions “ helped ” them to act against it .
Imaginative economists are already devising ways to help spenders become better savers .
In a recent YouTube address , President Obama laid out what he called “ common - sense changes that will help families put away money for the future . ”
One such change would expand the implementation of a program championed by economist Richard Thaler and law professor Cass Sunstein in their book Nudge : Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth , and Happiness .
Rather than having workers opt in to their employer ’s 401 ( k ) retirement - savings plan , as is commonly the case now , Thaler and Sunstein advocate a system by which employees would automatically be enrolled , with an option to opt out .
When one company adopted such a strategy , participation in its 401 ( k ) program went from 65 percent to over 90 percent .
These new participants had n’t been magically convinced that savings were a rational idea or a moral obligation .
Instead , they ’d been presented the choice in a new way that helped overcome their natural proclivities .
Ironically , Lauren Weber now sees herself as lucky to be cheap :
She comes by it naturally .
In her book , she extols the values of cheapness , but she also understands that it ’s time to put the wagging finger away .
“ It just does n’t work to preach at people , ” she told me .
“ Cotton Mather tried it 300 years ago , and where did it get us ?
We ’re now $ 10 trillion in debt . ”
Loewenstein suggests that , whether you ’re a spender or a saver , you should accept this trait rather than struggle against it — then find a way to live a financially manageable life .
“ We do n’t need to cultivate a different national character , ” he says .
“ We need to work with the existing national character to achieve national goals . ”
Cheapness may not be a virtue , but it is akin to greatness .
Some are born cheap .
Some achieve cheapness .
And some can hope to have cheapness thrust upon them .
By Sarah Braasch
When I was about seven years old I almost died .
It was n’t the only time I almost died , but it was one of my most colorful near death experiences .
I had acquired some sort of flu bug or food poisoning or I do n’t know what , but my mother , in her either infinite ignorance or indifference , failed to procure anything in the way of medical attention for her ailing child .
In all fairness , at first , I attempted to minimize my illness in order to be able to participate in a planned trip to a local amusement park .
I know it sounds silly to say that I almost died from a flu bug in the US during the later part of the 20th century , and , yet , my story is true .
I had n’t eaten anything solid for about two weeks , and I could n’t remember the last time I ’d been able to hold down water .
It seemed like I was either vomiting or dry heaving non-stop .
I was parched and too weak to lift my head off of my pillow .
I had n’t realized it at the time , but my mother later told me that I looked like a little concentration camp survivor , I had lost so much weight .
I remember that there was an old black and white movie on the tiny television on the dresser at the foot of the bed .
I remember that the movie took place in a faux harem in a faux Middle Eastern palace in a faux Arabia .
I think Gregory Peck may have been involved .
I was n’t scared .
I just remember how I wanted nothing more than for the overwhelming waves of pain and nausea rolling through my body to stop .
I could n’t sleep .
I could n’t eat .
I could n’t drink .
I could n’t move .
All I could think about was the pain .
I did n’t have the strength to dry heave anymore , but I kept dry heaving while lying on my back .
I did n’t even have the strength to turn onto my side or even turn my head .
My body was convulsing involuntarily .
Then , the convulsions started to fade .
My body no longer possessed the ability to exercise its involuntary impulses .
The ripples in my stomach waned .
Everything slowed down .
My heartbeat .
My breathing .
I felt nothing so much as relief .
I just did n’t want to feel anything anymore .
I lost the will to live .
It was so strange how everything came into such clear focus at that moment .
I remember the bizarre brown and gold patterned wallpaper .
I remember these tiny clip on cabbage patch dolls I had purchased at the local five and dime .
I remember the huge yellow plastic bowl I had been throwing up in , when I still had something inside of me to vomit .
I remember the bedroom furniture and the way the bedspread draped over my legs and feet .
I remember the light in the room .
I was completely still .
My little legs began to rise .
Actually , my entire body began to rise , but flat as a board , as if someone was lifting me by the feet , but my head was secured to my pillow .
I watched this with great curiosity .
I realized that my legs remained swathed in my nightgown , even as my legs were lifted higher and higher , until my feet were directly overhead .
Then I watched as my body swung back down , in the same manner , towards the bed .
As I watched my legs and feet return to the bed , I discovered that my body was also still on the bed , covered in the bedspread , completely still .
This occurred multiple times .
My head never left my pillow .
I did n’t feel fear , only intrigue , and , even , amusement .
At that time , death was not particularly terrifying .
I had no fear of hell , not because I thought I was without sin , but because I did n’t think hell existed .
I was a little Jehovah ’s Witness girl , and Jehovah ’s Witnesses do not believe in hell .
But , I was confused .
It seemed to me as if a version of me , a spirit , a soul had left or was trying to leave my physical body .
But , I had been taught that I was a living human soul , but that I did n’t have a soul , which survived the death of my physical self .
My feet were directly overhead again .
It felt final .
It felt like I was being asked to make a choice , like I was on the edge of a precipice , about to jump .
It felt like my feet were being tugged on , but something inside of me was resisting .
My head remained securely on my pillow , as if it were attached .
Not exactly terror , because I was n’t afraid , but determination , and , maybe , panic washed over me , almost instantaneously .
Then , I chose .
I was n’t ready .
But , I was n’t sure how to get back inside myself .
I did n’t know what to do .
I was n’t sure I had the strength to do anything .
With everything and anything I had left inside of myself to give , I screamed for my mother .
It came out as a barely audible , raspy plea .
I tried again .
Louder .
Again .
Then , she was beside me , looking down at me .
“ What is it ? ” she asked , seemingly unable to see that which I could see .
“ Mommy , why are my feet up there ? ” I asked .
“ What are you talking about ? ”
“ My feet are up there , in the sky . ”
“ No they are n’t .
They ’re right here . ”
My mother sat on the bed , placing her hands on my lifeless limbs under the bed covers .
It was the strangest sensation .
It was like I fell back into myself .
My mother looked terrified .
She called the doctor .
I guess it would be pretty easy to chalk up the entire experience to an illness induced hallucination , but I ’ve never forgotten it , and I ’ve never stopped feeling as if there was something more to it than just dehydration or religious fervor induced psychosis .
It was hardly my only mystical experience as a child , or even as an adult .
I ’ve had tons of mystical and spiritual ( i.e. allegedly nonmaterial , supernatural ) experiences .
I was able to conjure up transcendental experiences at will as a child , which could probably best be described as astral projection , although I would n’t have understood that term at the time , of course .
But , somehow , I knew that I had separated from my ostensible physical self .
All I had to do was contemplate the unfathomable idea that nothing would have ever existed if Jehovah God had n’t chosen to create everything , including existence itself .
I would float around in outer space , amongst the planets and stars .
It was the strangest feeling .
It made me feel high , even after I ’d returned to my body .
I became addicted to it , and it became more and more difficult for me as I got older .
I would spend hours alone in my room trying to recreate the sensation .
As I grew older , it also got scarier .
I had been raised to believe that anything even remotely attributable to spiritism and the occult was the product of demonic influence .
I became obsessed with the notion that I was inviting demons into my life .
I ’ve seen what would commonly be referred to as ghosts , demons , and angels , not to mention the future .
I practically have a mystical experience once a day .
None of these experiences , past or present , compel me to believe in God , certainly not the God as typically conceived by any of the major mainstream religions .
There are lots of things in the world , which I neither understand nor can explain , starting with my personal existence .
This does n’t presume a divine source .
This does n’t even presume a supernatural or metaphysical cause .
The very act of employing the term supernatural is rather arrogant when we understand so little of our natural world .
How do we know that these mystical experiences are n’t the result of interacting with alternate dimensions or alternate universes or alternate versions of ourselves ?
As our perception of reality approaches our wildest science fiction fantasies , we realize just how disappointing , prosaic , and mundane the world ’s religions ’ gods are , seemingly endlessly fascinated and preoccupied by the quotidian sexual exploits of my next door neighbor .
With the ever exponentially telescoping expansion of knowledge , especially scientific knowledge , I believe that we are moving closer and closer to answering those most difficult ontological and teleological existential questions .
We will know the nature of God , and we will discover that God is nature .
General relativity , special relativity , quantum mechanics , string theory , M theory , supersymmetry , the multiverse .
We just keep getting closer and closer .
I am not troubled at the thought of losing life ’s zest and purpose once the mystery is gone .
First of all , that point is far , far away , still , despite our amazing progress .
Second , just imagine the possibilities .
The infinite universes to explore , the infinite selves with whom to acquaint oneself .
Ultimately , we will harness our ability to shape our myriad existences and universes .
Time and materiality will be of little consequence .
We will become gods with the ability to determine our own destinies , our own realities .
And I , for one , unlike Jehovah , Yahweh , Jesus , and Allah , will not be much bothered with the sexual goings - on of my neighbors .
European roads and a new Hypermotard 796 .
Joy !
An upright seating position , unless you ’re cranking .
2010 Hypermotard 796 Instrument Cluster – Little Protection 2010 Hypermotard 796 Folding Mirror and Hand - guards – grateful for the protection .
The 2010 Hypermotard 796 comes in 3 color schemes
Bologna , Italy , and we were suiting up to ride the new 2010 Hypermotard 796 , just tens of feet from where it left the factory doors , in the courtyard of Ducati ’s world headquarters .
A row of white and matte black 796 ’s awaited under a tent , shielded from the bright sunshine .
A glance at the cloudless , blue sky confirmed the weather forecast , which called for sun throughout the day with no chance of rain and temperatures in the mid 70s Fahrenheit .
All the elements were in place for a wonderful ride through the Italian countryside : a new motorcycle designed to attack winding roads , miles of serpentine tarmac waiting for the assault , and of course the splendid weather , which we were told was unusually clement .
Perfect , until we discovered that Italian weathermen have a sardonic sense of humour …
NEW MOTOR
If the number ’s in the name did n’t give it away , I ’m this is the media introduction of the Hypermotard 796 , Ducati ’s smaller - displacement version of the 1100 mega - motard model launched in late 2007 .
With the introduction of the new Hypermotard , the Italian motorcycle maker wants to expand on the success of the Hypermotard 1100 , a model that has come to represent 10 percent of new Ducati sales in North America .
Despite rumours that the 796 would borrow the motor from the Monster 696 , it has an entirely new engine .
The air - cooled , four - valve V - twin actually displaces 803 cc and though it uses the same bore as the 696 , it has a longer stroke ( 66 versus 57.2 mm ) , resulting in 5 lb - ft boost in peak torque , that arrives 1,500 rpm sooner ( max output of 55.7 lb - ft @ 6,250 rpm ) .
Claimed horsepower is 81 , an impressive number when considering BMW ’s F800 twin pumps out just a handful more horsepower using liquid cooling and eight valves .
Service intervals are at every 12,000 km .
Despite a smallish 3.3 gallon ( 12.4 - litre ) fuel tank , Ducati says the Hypermotard 796 is the most fuel efficient bike in its lineup , claiming 59 mpg ( 4.8L/100 km ) .
Given the fuel efficiency that tank size is n’t as disastrous as it sounds and should be enough to make most Hypermotard 1100 owners jealous – Ed .
Weight has been reduced on various components including the tripleclamps , fork bottoms and frame ( the crankcase alone weighs 2.65 lbs / 1.2 kg less than the 696 ) , contributing to a claimed dry weight of 368 lbs ( 167 kg ) , 26.5lbs ( 12 kg ) less than the Hypermotard 1100 .
Upright seating combines with unusually wide handlebars to provide a dirt - bike - like riding position , though a new seat drops seat height .8 inches ( 20 mm ) lower than the 1100 to 32.5 inches ( 825 mm ) .
Ample seat foam provided enough comfort for a painless journey during our 130 - km loop , though I suspect a longer stint in the saddle would eventually take its toll .
Visually the 796 and 1100 are nearly identical .
Probably the biggest distinguishing feature is the bulbous pre-muffler located beneath the 796 ( which contains a catalytic converter and dual oxygen sensors ) , though more subtly , and to keep costs down , the 796 uses a tubular steel handlebar , as opposed to the other bike ’s tapered aluminum handhold .
HYPER EURO
I love riding in Europe , not only because the area is steeped in history and abounds in visual splendor , but because Europeans ride the way we should : hard and fast .
Within 10 minutes of leaving the factory ’s parking lot , I was pitching the 796 into tight hairpin turns arcing through stone roadway arches barely wide enough to allow a midsized car through .
The Hypermotard felt perfectly comfortable in these cramped corners , as it should being the engineers that built it probably used these same stretches of blacktop to develop the bike .
We meandered about the Italian countryside heading south out of Bologna for about one hour when the sky got menacingly dark .
Then , as Italy ’s weathermen laughed it up , the skies opened up and it began to rain … then it poured .
Although most everyone brought raingear to the launch , no one brought it on the ride , as the puckish forecasters had duped us all .
To add insult to injury the temperature dropped from the low 70s to the chilly 50s .
Being professionals with a job to do we soldiered on through this freakishly unexpected monsoon , while gusting winds blew leaves and branches from trees .
Okay , we had no choice but to continue as there was no immediate cover available .
Shaking uncontrollably and on the verge of hypothermia , I cursed myself for leaving my rain gear neatly folded in my luggage back in the changing room at Ducati HQ .
I was , however , relieved to discover that the stock Bridgestone BT015 radials displayed excellent wet grip .
Also as a consolation , the hand guards that double as turn signals provided a small measure of wind protection for my now sodden , leather - clad claws .
We eventually stopped for a late lunch and waited out the storm , which fortunately dissipated as quickly as it appeared to reveal blue skies once again .
After the lunch stop , we picked up the pace .
I then began to truly appreciate the new engine ’s more subdued , but ultimately very engaging powerband .
Although just nine horsepower down on the 1100 , power delivery is much smoother with fluid throttle response .
Yet there ’s enough low - end grunt to allow the engine to easily pull a taller gear , thus allowing a numbed foot drowning in a boot full of cold rainwater to neglect shifting gears on occasion .
Gear ratios are lower than on the 1100 , as is the final drive ratio , making the 796 easier to launch from a stop , as well as shudder - free in top gear at 68 mph ( 110 km / h ) .
This compares favourably to the 1100 which needs to be ridden faster than 75 mph ( 120 km /h ) to experience a smooth ride in top .
For riders with a streak of hooliganism in their genes , they may be a tad disappointed to find that wheelies are n’t as effortless as on the 1100 .
Having said that , clutchless lofting of the front wheel is quite easy in first gear , and with clutch assistance the front lifts in second gear on flat surfaces and in third gear over humps in the road .
A rigid 43 mm , Marzocchi inverted fork is non-adjustable , while the Sachs shock absorber has provisions for spring preload and rebound damping adjustment ( the 1100 has fully adjustable suspension ) .
Suspension settings were a bit too soft for me at a sporting pace , especially since the machine had to carry my waterlogged body .
The rear end wallowed a tad through some of the tighter turns , where it was under a heavy load , and the fork sometimes soaked up all of its travel when braking hard .
I could have cranked up the rear rebound damping , which would have improved rear - end control , but I was still too wet and too cold to care .
Abundant cornering clearance allowed me to confidently pitch the bike low and deep into the apex of a corner , dirt - bike style , with my body poised upright and knees tucked in .
The wide handlebar provided the necessary leverage to pick the machine up quickly at corner exit without making the steering overly sensitive and prone to instability .
That handlebar width , however , made dodging slow - moving Fiat Pandas somewhat dodgy in town , especially with the unique bar - end mirrors threatening to clip the boxy utilitarian cars in tight quarters .
Although not entirely practical for threading through tightly packed urban traffic ( something I dare only when I ’m abroad – where it ’s tolerated ) , the mirrors provided an unobstructed rear view .
When in town , I got into the habit of folding the mirrors back for added clearance .
Steering lock sits on the borderline of being too limited , with just enough wheel angle to make a straight - through U - turn if the start and end of the U are as close to the road ’s shoulders as possible .
Brembo radial brakes provided eyeball - bulging stops with light , easily modulated lever pressure .
The rear brake was just how I like it with a firm pedal that needed considerable effort to lock the rear wheel .
A moderately light - effort APTC wet slipper clutch did away with any rear wheel chatter on those forced corner entries .
WARMED UP
I liked the Hypermotard 1100 when I ’d first ridden it , but its firm suspension and high price left me a tad cold .
By the time we ’d returned to Ducati HQ I had warmed up to this new , more accessible Hypermotard ( I had also personally been blown dry ) .
Decreasing engine displacement by no means diluted the Hyper experience , and in fact , for me it enhanced it .
With its more controllable powerband and lighter weight the 796 proved more user - friendly and manageable , and despite budget suspension components , the softer ride was more tolerable than the racetrack - ready suspension on the 1100 .
These factors should make the 796 more appealing to fledgling Ducatisti , as should its $ 9,995US ( $ 11,495 CND ) price tag , which is a $ 2000 ( $ 3,500CND ) less than the 1100 .
MUSINGS AT THE MUSEUM
Post ride , there was one last thing I needed to do .
I ’d seen the Ducati museum ( located at the factory ’s entrance ) on the morning of our test ride , but I would have never forgiven myself if I ’d left Bologna without seeing the factory from the inside .
John Paolo Canton , PR coordinator for Ducati North America , graciously offered to give me a personal tour of the premises the following day ( I begged , actually ) .
Inside the factory , I was surprised to see that all Ducatis are still hand built ; there were no robots in sight .
Frames came from a supplier up the road , as did engine castings , but all assembly was hands - on .
Also surprising was the section of the factory that looked like a big service bay , replete with bike lifts , tools and electronic equipment .
Here , each machine was started up and manually tuned by a technician before heading to the dyno for final testing and subsequent shipping .
In a time when the urge to be productive and profitable outweighs the importance of maintaining jobs , seeing such basic principals being applied in a modern assembly plant gave me a better appreciation for Italian bikes , and their occasional idiosyncrasies .
As for those ungrateful Italian weather forecasters : may the rest of their days be spent commuting to work in 1980s - vintage Fiat Pandas .

Troops train with Army and Air Force for G20 Summit as part of martial law acclimation
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , September 23 , 2009
As military - run internal checkpoints rapidly multiply across the United States and the country sinks into a state of de facto martial law , it has been announced that no less than 2,500 National Guard troops will work with Army and Air Force personnel to undertake “ crowd control ” duties during the upcoming G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
As we reported earlier today , uniformed soldiers are being deployed all over the country to fulfil roles normally ascribed to police as Americans are incrementally conditioned that men in cammo with machine guns will now provide “ security ” in the new Amerika .
Part of that “ security ” includes dealing with civil unrest and crowd control , a role also being undertaken by the 20,000 battle hardened troops that are being redeployed inside America under Northcom after returning from Iraq .
In the meantime , the Pentagon is attempting to station a further 379,000 active duty troops inside the U.S. , a plan being fiercely opposed by the National Governors Association .
That ’s also a role being performed by the Pittsburgh National Guard , along with the Army and the Air Force in preparation for the G20 Summit which gets underway tomorrow .
More than 2,500 Guardsmen have been called up for “ Operation Steel Kickoff , ” the description of which by the DefenseLink website sounds more like a military assault than an act of peacekeeping .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Operation Steel Kickoff started Sept. 20 with a joint reception , staging , onward movement and integration point process led by the Guard ’s 213th Area Support Group , which is working out of a hangar at the 171st Air Refueling Wing in Coraopolis , Pa. , ” reports DefenseLink .
“ We ’re the support role , helping the soldiers and airmen get out and do the things they need to do , ” said Army 1st Lt. Matthew Springer , the team leader for Operation Steel Kickoff ’s JRSOI process .
“ Our focus is on ensuring the war fighter is getting the things they need to be successful in their mission . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The Guardsmen ’s “ mission ” as those involved term it , will be to work with the Army and Air Force to “ help local , state and federal authorities keep Pittsburgh safe as demonstrators take to the streets in protest of the worldwide economic summit ” .
Troops are training to perform , “ movement techniques , formations and crowd and riot control . ”
“ We ’re working hard right now because we have Army and Air Force members who have n’t trained together before , ” said Army Sgt. 1st Class Ronald Bittner , a platoon leader from 1/110th , D Company .
“ We are working to mesh , because we all take a lot of pride in this mission . ”
“ This is definitely a different mission , ” said Air Force Master Sgt. Pauline Gonzalez , a 23 - year veteran and personnel specialist with the 211th Engineering Installation Squadron .
“ It ’s very hard and very challenging , but it ’s been a rewarding experience . ”
The fact that soldiers see it as a “ rewarding experience ” to completely violate the oath that they swore by undertaking duties totally at odds with Posse Comitatus , the law that bars the military from engaging in law enforcement duties , is a damning indictment of how far the specter of troops on the streets has seeped into everyday life in America .
Claims that the troops are merely there to “ make sure the citizens are protected ” do not correlate with the fact that the entire scope of their mission is to intimidate and oppress peaceful protesters .
Military weapons used in Iraq are now being turned on the American people .
Tea Party protesters in San Diego were recently targeted with Long - range acoustic devices [ LRADs ] , a torture device used to control insurgents that can cause serious and lasting health problems .
LRADs are now a routine fixture at all major demonstrations and now it seems as small local protests too as the entire apparatus of Homeland Security and the war on terror is shifted to focus on Americans who dare attempt to exercise their rights .

Glenn Beck connecting the dots , via Bob Cesca ’s GDAB
“ Six Degrees of Glenn Beck ” could be a fun game , too !
Let me see…he works for Rupert Murdoch .
You know , this guy :
And Rupert , of course ,
has extensive connections with communists — not just some communists , but some of the most powerful communists in the world .
According to an extensive report in the New York Times , this man has “ flattered Communist Party leaders and done business with their children , ” met repeatedly with senior members of the communist Politburo , “ cooperates closely ” with communist censors and propaganda networks , and “ cultivates political ties ” with communists in the hope that they will “ insulate his business ventures . ”
Not only that , but he “ often supports the policies ” of communist leaders and “ attacks their critics . ” ( Emphasis mine )
French Vogue has never been one to tiptoe around controversy .
Recently it has published photos of supposedly pregnant models puffing cigarettes and leather - clad glamazons kissing with blood pouring from their mouths .
Now , though , the magazine may have gone too far for even the most dedicated followers of fashion .
Its October edition features pictures of Dutch model Lara Stone in which the naturally pale - skinned blonde 's face and body are painted black .
The photo shoot , styled by the magazine 's long - time editor , Carine Roitfeld , provoked outrage today as its subject spread through internet forums and fashion websites .
The US blog Jezebel criticised the decision of Roitfeld and photographer Steven Klein to alter the model 's skin colour , accusing them of cultural insensitivity .
" What Klein and Roitfeld should know … is that painting white people black for the entertainment of other white people is offensive in ways that stand entirely apart from cultural context , " it said .
" France and Australia may not have the United States ' particular history of minstrel shows … but something about the act of portraying a white woman as black ought to sound an alarm , somewhere . "
Dominique Sopo , president of the French organisation SOS Racisme , said that even if the shoot was not racist in intention it was certainly " tactless " .
" If the aim was artistic , and not to pass off the model as a black girl , the fact that it produces such reactions shows that the world of images – advertising , fashion , whatever – is now paying for its long tradition of not allowing black people to show their bodies in public . "
French Vogue said the magazine was unaware of any controversy .
Neither Roitfeld nor Stone 's agents at the IMG model agency in New York or Paris were available for comment .
Last week an Australian variety show host was forced to apologise for a skit in which singers parodying the Jackson Five painted their faces black .
American singer and actor Harry Connick Jr , who was a guest judge on Hey Hey It 's Saturday , was visibly shocked by the skit .
Shame on me !
I ’ve been a die - hard Omega Constellation fan all this while and have never looked beyond it .
This was till I discovered the treasure trove of watches , right here on Yanko !

A first release candidate of JRuby 1.4 is expected soon , so it 's time to have a look at what 's coming up .
JRuby team member Nick Sieger gave a quick overview of what 's to come in JRuby 1.4 .
Next to new YAML support and further improvements in the 1.9 support , work on the JRuby 's 1.8.7 support continues .
JRuby 1.4 will default to Ruby version 1.8.7 .
While most of the 1.8.7 support is done , Charles Nutter explains why external iterators , added in 1.9.x and 1.8.7 , are currently slow and hard to optimize :
Ruby 1.8.7 added the ability to " next " your way through an Enumerator .
At a glance , this seems fine ; it 's just external enumeration .
The problem , however , is that enumeration can be arbitrarily complex . [..]
In Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9 , [ external iterators are ] implemented using continuations ( delimited continuations , i.e. Fibers or coroutines ) , making it dreadfully slow to " next " your way through a collection .
On JRuby , because there 's an in - progress #each we have to pause for every element , Enumerator # next has to spin up a * new native thread * .
Each #next call then pings the thread to produce a new result .
It remains to be seen whether a fast solution can be found .
JRuby 1.4 will probably also bring improvements in the Java integration , making it easier ( or in some cases , at all possible ) to access overloaded methods in Java classes from Ruby code .
Possible changes will include improvements in type coercion and new methods such as java_send ( GitHub commit for java_send ) which takes the method signature of the method to invoke .
The specific feature set in 1.4 is still in flux , and it remains to be seen what parts of the Java integration overhaul make it in .
Future versions of the JVM are supposed to include support for improving the speed of dynamic languages .
First bundles of JRuby and the MLVM with the new dynamic features are available .
Finally , very soon after the announcement of the first JRubyConf , it was booked out .
Engine Yard now announced the final program of JRubyConf
as well as the availability of further tickets :
Last , but certainly not least exciting : with the addition of our new sponsors , and some magic logistical mojo at the Embassy Suites , we 've managed to move the event to a larger space , doubling the attendee headcount .
RAILWAY TRACK DESTROYER
There have been a number of reports concerning a German railway track destroyer and the devastating damage caused by it in Italy .
According to one report , the equipment consists of a locomotive , a flat car , a freight car for explosives , a freight car for personnel and a hook or claw as shown in the accompanying photograph .
The crew is reported to consist of one noncommissioned officer and 12 men .
a. Use on Ties
Two or three ties are first removed and a hole dug deep enough to accommodate the hook or claw .
The hook is lowered and placed in position underneath the first tie and the first two or three ties loosened .
The hook is then drawn forward by the locomotive , dragging up the ties and breaking them in the middle .
The road bed is damaged considerably in the process .
When not in operation , the hook is kept clear by means of a distance block .
b. Use on Rails
There is a box arrangement forward of the hook providing room for six men and a number of cases of explosive charges . *
Each 2.2 pound charge is initiated by an 8 - inch length of safety fuze .
There is a 20 - second delay after ignition of the fuze .
The men are divided into two teams of three each .
The first man hands the charges to the next who passes them to the third man who initiates the charges and drops them into guide chutes which rest on the rails .
The charges automatically attach to the inside of the rail by means of metal clips fixed to them by grubscrews .
c. Speed of Operation
As the rear wheels on which the hook is based lack firm support , the apparatus is subjected to a pronounced swaying movement which necessarily slows the operation .
The speed of the destroyer has been reported as about 9.4 miles per hour .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ( R ) blasted President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting '
MORE 's approach to Iran and bemoaned what he described as the United States 's weakening relationship with Israel .
In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in San Diego , Romney called the Iranian government the world 's " greatest immediate threat , " an " unalloyed evil , run by people who are at once ruthless and fanatical . "

" Stop thinking that a charm offensive will talk the Iranians out of their pursuit of nuclear weapons .
It will not , " Romney said , referring obliquely to Obama 's insistence on talks with the rogue nation .
" And agreements , unenforceable and unverifiable , will have no greater impact here than they did in North Korea . "
" Once an outstretched hand is met with a clenched fist , it becomes a symbol of weakness and impotence , " Romney added .
Romney called for " comprehensive , withering sanctions , " along with American support for anti-government activists in Iran .
Taking a hawkish line , Romney said military options should remain on the table even as Iran participates in nuclear talks with the U.S. , Russia and France this week in Vienna .
" Unfortunately , for reasons that are unfathomable to me , our government has signaled that the military option is effectively off the table .
How can that be countenanced when an ally of the United States faces an existential threat ? " he asked .
Romney has long been critical of Obama 's approach to foreign policy .
He has portrayed the tone of Obama 's relations with the rest of the world as apologist , and Romney 's newest book will continue the theme .is to be released early next year .
Romney also said the United States is putting too much pressure on Israel , and not enough on Palestinians , in the pursuit of a lasting Middle East peace .
"
In pursuit of a peace process , the United States today has exerted substantial pressure on Israel while putting almost no pressure on the Palestinians and the Arab world , " Romney said .
" We can encourage both parties in the conflict , but we must never forget which one is our ally .
" The United Nations " has become a forum for invective against the Jewish state , " Romney said , insisting that the U.S. has landed on the wrong side when condemning Israel for building new settlements .

Welcome to the Starting Small series .
The aim of this series is to take a programming language that you hopefully know a bit about ( enough to feel comfortable using ) or that you want to try out and show you how to use it to make games .
The language that this tutorial focuses on is Python using Pygame .
Unfortunately , if you ’re reading this article because you want to start developing something spectacular in Pygame , I have to disappoint you .
Though , hopefully , by the end of the article you will be able to use Pygame and understand the basics of it .
We are going to make something step by step ; that is , the “ hello world ” of game development : Pong .
If you are still here and want to follow the tutorial it would be a good idea to get Python and Pygame now .
Python and Pygame are quite are both lightweight and easy to rapidly develop in .
The only major drawback is that Python requires an interpreter to run ; there are ways to compile projects into exe files , but I wo n’t touch on that any further in this article .
The best way to learn something is to try it for yourself , so I encourage you as a reader to try out the code for yourself ( not just copying and pasting it ) and experimenting with it to see what you can do .
To begin with we will need to import the modules we are going to use .
We also need to import everything from “ pygame.locals ” for use in event handling .
Immediately after importing “ random ” and “ pygame ” , we initialise the “ pygame ” engine , and give our random module a seed so that we get decent pseudo- random numbers .
import pygame , random from pygame.locals import * pygame.init( ) random.seed ( )
The next step is to create our game window .
For the purpose of this tutorial we will use a 400 by 400 resolution ; there ’s no need to make it massive .
We create our window and keep a reference to it using the following , which handles the window creation for you :
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(( 400 , 400 ) )
The next step is to create a game loop for this new window we have to draw on .
run =
True while run : # game logic
The next addition should be indented to be in line with the “ # game logic ” placeholder comment .
This new code handles refreshing of the window ’s contents and filling it with a background colour .
Once we ’re done drawing we then can “ flip ” the backbuffer to the screen
screen.fill ( ( 0,0,0 ) ) pygame.display.flip ( )
If you run your game now , you will be unable to close it without closing python completely because we are within an infinite loop and we are n’t checking for input .
To stop this infinite loop we will check if the user clicks on the close button and stop the game loop .
This code will actually allow our game to handle all user events , so that at a later stage we can check for other game - related input .
for event in pygame.event.get ( ) : if event .
type == QUIT : run = False
Finally , right at the end of your code you need to add the line ( outside of your loop ) which will result in allowing you to run your game and exit it .
pygame.quit ( )
Pygame Framework
Your final code should look like this .
I have inserted some comments for you to refer to in the next section .
import pygame , random from pygame.locals import * pygame.init( ) random.seed ( ) screen = pygame.display.set_mode(( 400 , 400 ) ) #--- Place 1 run =
True while run : # game logic #--- Place 2 screen.fill ( ( 0,0,0 ) ) #--- Place 3 pygame.display.flip ( ) for event in pygame.event.get ( ) : if event.type == QUIT : run = False pygame.quit ( )
The next step is to load your objects .
For this example we will stick to sprites , which means we also need to get their bounding rectangles .
This is the space that the sprite will occupy on the screen and it has two properties that interest us : its “ top ” and “ left ” properties .
The top property is the distance , in pixels , the object will be drawn away from the top edge of the window , and the left property is the distance from the left side of the window .
Note that Pygame also handles other objects you might want to use , such as sounds .
To load our sprites we use the following :
sprite_[name ] = pygame.image.load ( " [ name of file ] " )
You will want to give each a descriptive name , like “ sprite_paddle ” or “ sprite_ball ” .
Replace [ name of file ] with the file name to the image , either fully qualified , or relative to the game ’s root folder .
“ Mysprite.png ” , “ data/mysprite.bmp ” or “ c:/mysprite.jpg ” , for example .
Then , to get the rectangle , we use the following bit of code .
This rectangle will give
Pygame the info it needs to draw your sprites where you want them and to the correct proportions .
rect_[name ] 1 = sprite_[ name].get_rect ( )
Now , you may think my naming of objects is weird and makes no sense , but here is the explanation : Firstly , each type of object should be distinguishable by its name , so a sprite variable naturally starts with “ sprite_ ” and rectangles with “ rect_ ” .
This makes it easier to read and understand the code .
Secondly , by making the name of an object the same as the name for its rectangle can be naturally paired with their sprites .
Having a rectangle variable name ending with a number is a simple way to represent multiple instances of the same sprite .
Before you continue , make yourself 2 sprites of the following dimensions ( or 3 if you want to do separate sprites for the each of the paddles ) , then load them into your game so that they can be used .
The loading code goes in at the comment marked “ Place 1 ” .
1x ball – 25 by 25
1x ( or 2 x ) paddle – 100 by 25
The next step we will handle is the drawing of the sprites .
This code would go into Place 3 , between clearing the screen , and flipping the backbuffer .
Blitting a sprite is fairly easy :
screen.blit(sprite_[name ] , rect_[name ] ) screen.blit(sprite_[name ] ,rect_[name ]1 )
Now , place your sprites where you want them by changing the top and left properties ( left , top ) , I have placed my ball at ( 187.5,187.5 ) and my paddles at ( 150,0 ) and ( 150,375 ) .
This gives you 2 paddles , one at the top , one at the bottom , and a ball in the middle of the window .
If you run your game now it should look like this image below .
You are now ready to work on your game logic , to make your game actually work .
Your game logic should go in at Place 2 , and , at the very least should be handling player input and updating of things like the positions of your objects if they are moving .
Input handling from the keyboard in Pygame is fairly easy : you simply check specific keys against the list of all keys currently pressed down .
keys = pygame.key.get_pressed ( ) if keys [ pygame .K_LEFT ] : # left is pressed if keys [ pygame .
K_a ] : # a is pressed if keys [ pygame .
K_ENTER ] : #enter is pressed
Now , for Pong , we need to move our paddles left and right .
We ’ll do this by changing the left property of the rectangles we are using for them .
For now , only make the increase or decrease of the left property by 1 .
Another thing to keep in mind is that we do n’t want the paddle to leave the left side of the screen , so we only move the paddle left if the left property is already larger than 0 .
The same applies to the right side of the screen , but we will need to check to make sure the left property is smaller that 300 .
This is because our sprite is 100 pixels long , so we can only move its left edge a maximum of 100 pixels away from the right side of the window .
The following is an example of how to do the checks and make the paddle move , you would just need to repeat it for each key that you wish to use .
if keys [ pygame.K_LEFT ] : if ( rect_paddle1.left > 0 ) : rect_paddle1.left -= 1
If you cannot decide what keys to use for each paddle , make the one paddle use the left and right arrows , and the other use “ a ” and “ d ” ( K_a and K_d ) .
Finish the paddle movement code so that both paddles can move left and right independently .
You should now have a game where you have two paddles and a ball drawn on the screen .
You should be able to move each paddle using a separate set of keys , and exit the game with the quit button with no problems .
Now we are going to make our ball move .
To do this , we will be making two variables to control our balls movement , “ hspeed ” or horizontal speed , and “ vspeed ” or vertical .
This way , all we have to do is add “ hspeed ” to the left property of the ball to move it from side to side , and when the ball hits the side of the window , all we have to do is invert the sign of “ hspeed ” .
The same is done for the “ vspeed ” with the ball ’s top property , but instead of changing the direction of the ball , we place it back in the centre of the window as a reset of sorts if it reaches the top or bottom of the screen .
First , let ’s declare hspeed and vspeed at Place 1 .
We give them the starting value of 0 , and we keep looping till it is randomly assigned a non -zero integer between - 1 and 1 , making sure that we have a direction to move .
Just below that we ’ll make a variable to slow down the updating of the ball ’s movement
hspeed = 0 vspeed = 0 while hspeed == 0 : hspeed = random.randint ( - 1,1 ) hspeed = hspeed while vspeed == 0 : vspeed = random.randint ( - 1,1 ) vpseed = vspeed slower = 15
We then move to Place 2 – which is where we will update the balls movement – and add in the following code :
slower -= 1 if slower == 0 : slower = 15 # ball movement updating code will go here
I ’ve used 15 as the number of repeats we want between each time the ball moves , if you find that this is too slow for you feel free to decrease it .
The movement for the ball is slightly more complicated then it is for a paddle because you have more things to do .
If we are at either horizontal edge of the window we will have to reverse the hspeed .
With vertical edges we wo n’t reverse the direction , but rather move the ball to the middle again .
if hspeed < 0 : if ( rect_ball.left + hspeed > 0 ) : rect_ball.left += hspeed else : hspeed = - hspeed else : if ( rect_ball.left + hspeed < 375 ) : rect_ball.left += hspeed else : hspeed = - hspeed #vertical movement for ball if vspeed < 0 : if ( rect_ball.top + vspeed > 0 ) : rect_ball.top += vspeed else : rect_ball.left = 200 - 12.5 rect_ball.top = 200 - 12.5 else : if ( rect_ball.top + vspeed < 375 ) : rect_ball.top += vspeed else : rect_ball.left = 200 - 12.5 rect_ball.top = 200 - 12.5
The biggest drawback you will have with using Pygame when you start out will be its lack of built in collision detection .
I will explain very briefly how the collision detection works and give you the code for this game .
Be sure to read our series on collision detection for games for an expansion of this concept .
When we check if the ball collides with a paddle we check two things : is the top left corner of the paddle inside the ball , or is the top left corner of the ball inside the paddle .
If you are feeling brave you can write yourself a function that takes your 2 rectangles and returns whether or not they are colliding or not .
After we have found a collision , we ’ll check if the ball is heading towards the paddle .
If the “ vspeed ” is negative , the ball is moving up , so if the ball ’s top property is above the halfway line and it has collided , I need to make the value of “ vspeed ” its opposite .
This ensures that when the ball hits the paddle it will change direction and not get stuck on the paddle , which will happen if its “ vspeed ” changes constantly every frame .
The following code handles the collision with paddles and does n’t get put inside the slower if - statement , but goes into the main game loop
# ball collision with paddle1 coll = False if ( ( rect_ball.left >= rect_paddle1.left ) and \ ( rect_ball.left <= rect_paddle1.left + rect_paddle1.width ) and \ ( rect_ball.top > = rect_paddle1.top ) and \ ( rect_ball.top < = rect_paddle1.top + rect_paddle1.height ) ) : coll = True elif ( ( rect_paddle1.left >= rect_ball.left ) and \ ( rect_paddle1.left <= rect_ball.left + rect_ball.width ) and \ ( rect_paddle1.top > = rect_ball.top ) and \ ( rect_paddle1.top < = rect_ball.top + rect_ball.height ) ) : coll =
True #ball collision with paddle2 if ( ( rect_ball.left > = rect_paddle2.left ) and \ ( rect_ball.left <= rect_paddle2.left + rect_paddle2.width ) and \ ( rect_ball.top + rect_ball.height >= rect_paddle2.top ) and \ ( rect_ball.top + rect_ball.height <= rect_paddle2.top + rect_paddle2.height ) ) : coll = True elif ( ( rect_paddle2.left >= rect_ball.left ) and \ ( rect_paddle2.left <= rect_ball.left + rect_ball.width ) and \ ( rect_paddle2.top > = rect_ball.top ) and \ ( rect_paddle2.top < = rect_ball.top + rect_ball.height ) ) : coll =
True if coll : if ( ( rect_ball.top < 200 ) and ( vspeed < 0 ) ) : vspeed = -vspeed elif ( ( rect_ball.top > 200 ) and ( vspeed > 0 ) ) : vspeed = -vspeed
If all has gone well and you have n’t run into any problems , you have now completed Pong in Python using Pygame .
Things to try yourself :
Try loading a sound or two and playing them ( for instance when the ball hits a paddle or wall ) sound_[ name ] = pygame.mixer.sound ( " [ file name ] " ) sound_ [ name ] .play ( )
Try changing the caption of the window pygame.display.set_caption ( " Game . Dev " )
Try make the one paddle be controlled by the computer rather than another human player
Hint :
To do this you need to use if statements that check if the balls left property is to the left or right of the middle of the one paddle , and then move towards it if the balls vspeed makes it head towards that paddle .
This should make it seem like you ’re playing against a human player .

And even strict parents can’t always keep out the rest of the world .
Kathryn Murray , a mother from the Upper East Side who asked to use her middle name instead of her first to protect her family ’s privacy , said she limits pictures of her son to Picasa , a site that allows for invitation - only access .
But she recently had an awkward moment when a friend told her she had posted pictures of her son on Facebook .
She was considering how to ask her politely to take it down , when her friend , sensing the tension , beat her to it .
“ My facial expression was enough , ” she recalled .
Fueling the anxiety of parents like Ms. Murray is a doomsday scenario : a predator finds pictures of a cute child on the Internet , figures out where the child lives or goes to school and snatches him .
“ It ’s probably not too difficult to go through those pictures and figure out we live on the Upper East Side , ” Ms. Murray said .
“ And then it ’s ‘ Oh , I ’ve been to that park , ’ or ‘ I know that street , ’ What ’s to stop a pedophile from putting two and two together ? ”
Her fears are misplaced , experts on online safety say .
“ Research shows that there is virtually no risk of pedophiles coming to get kids because they found them online , ” said Stephen Balkam , chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute .
While the debate makes this crime seem common , he said , all the talk is really just “ techno - panic . ”
Prof. David Finkelhor , director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire , says TV shows like the “ Dateline NBC ” program “ To Catch a Predator ” have falsely inflated the danger of the Internet .
“ There is this characterization of pedophiles using the Internet as an L. L. Bean catalog , but this is not the way it happens , ” he said .
Predators are much more likely to look in chat rooms or other sites , he said , where teenagers are suggesting that they may be open to a sexual relationship .

Brain training is a billion dollar industry , but does it actually work ?
The BBC is launching Britain 's biggest ever brain training experiment to find out .
Millions of copies of console and computer - based " brain trainers " are sold worldwide every year , claiming to make peoples ' brains younger , better , faster or bigger .
The theory seems to make sense : regularly exercising the brain with tests and puzzles can improve brain skills and help people become better at everyday thinking tasks .
But recent research suggests scientific evidence is lacking .
The BBC's Brain Test Britain experiment wants to find out if brain training really works , and is aiming to get thousands of members of the public to train for 10 minutes a day , three times a week , for at least six weeks .
There are five main problems with current research : 1 . SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS 'NOT PROPERLY CHECKED '
Which flower is the odd one out ?
The answer is the square , the second one Scientific experiments and their findings should be evaluated by independent experts in a process called " peer review " .
This is the minimum standard by which the quality of any research is judged .
Very little research on commercial brain trainers has been peer reviewed .
Instead , manufacturers often link to white papers and conference reports , or quote unsupported testimonials from " satisfied users " .
None of these are acceptable substitutes for peer review .
2 . BRAIN IMAGING ' NOT PROOF '
Dr Jessica Grahn said scans only showed the energy the brain used Several companies use pictures of brains lighting up to support claims that their brain training is effective .
Brain scans and other imaging may look good , but what do they really show ?
It is a very persuasive technique , but in reality only shows how hard the brain is working , rather than how effective the training is .
Dr Jessica Grahn , a neuro - imaging expert at the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit , said : " What we are looking at with these brain scans is simply a measure of the energy that the brain is using while performing the tests .
" It does not constitute evidence that the brain is being trained , or indeed altered , in any way . "
3 . CONTROL GROUPS
Which is the heaviest object on the see-saw ?
The answer is the hexagon A proper " control group " is the backbone of any valid scientific study .
Without a control group , it is hard to tell whether results are down to brain training , or simply because the participant is doing something - anything - to stimulate their brain .
With a brain training study , the control group of participants should do the same amount of a mental activity as the brain - training group , but using a " non-brain training " activity such as a crossword or Sudoku .
Scientists should then be able to compare the results from the two groups to see how genuinely effective the brain training tasks were .
BRAIN TRAINERS Nintendo DS Mindfit ( PC ) Luminosity ( online ) Mindspa Studies that have been used to support the claims made by commercial brain trainers often have no control group at all , or a control group that is not as mentally active as the trained group .
4 . THE BENCHMARKING TEST
In order to see how much you have improved , you need to know where you were at the start .
To do this , scientists use a " benchmarking test " - the same test , taken at the beginning and end of an experiment .
Studies used to support the claims made by commercial brain trainers often use tests for benchmarking that are identical - or very similar - to the tests used during training .
Research has suggested Tetris can help reduce traumatic stress
But all this proves is that practice makes perfect : if you played Tetris for a month and got better at it , should we conclude that playing Tetris is a useful form of brain training ?
Probably not .
Benchmarking tests should be different from the brain training tasks .
This way , scientists can see if the effects of brain training are transferable to other mental tasks .
If you played Tetris for a month and found , say , your memory was suddenly much better , it would indicate that playing Tetris has improved your brain in some way other than making you good at Tetris .
5 . WHAT WORKS FOR ONE MIGHT NOT WORK FOR ANOTHER Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Does the research show the brain trainer is effective in participants who are similar to you ?
Just because a system claims to improve the memory of a group of elderly participants , for example , it does not necessarily mean that it will have the same - or indeed any - effect in younger users .
The BBC's Brain Test Britain experiment , created with the Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and the Alzheimer 's Society , has made sure it meets all the accepted standards for a scientifically valid study .

How Chronic Stress Leads To Bad Choices - By Restructuring The Brain
Every day we make a multitude of decisions based on the consequences of our actions ; goal - orientated responses .
In an always changing environment this capacity is crucial but , because it is complex , it also requires a lot from the brain .
So repeated actions , like to press the elevator button to our floor , become linked to other type of neural responses , which are automatic and so less demanding .
And if necessary it is always possible to switch back to the first kind of response .
New research by Portuguese scientists in the July 31st of Science reveals that chronic stress – too many times a feature of modern life - interferes with this switching capacity , by freezing individuals into automatic / habit responses mode .
This effect is associated with morphological changes in the brain , where areas linked to habitual responses are enlarged and have thus potentially better neural connectivity , and the opposite – atrophy and less connections - occurs in those areas mediating goal - orientated responses .
The discovery of these stress effects have important implications : to understand better the pathology of stress - related disorders and how the brain works in general but also to a variety of more “ real ” issues from understanding the impact of modern life styles or how to prevent bad choices in situations where constant stress seems to be unavoidable .
Chronic stress is major issue in today ’s society and is known to lead to a variety of health problems from ulcers to hypertension .
We all also have experienced how our decision making can become affected by stress and how many wrong choices we have made as result .
How exactly this occurs is the question behind the work now published by Eduardo Dias - Ferreira , Nuno Sousa and colleagues from the University of Minho in Portugal and the National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , USA .
The researchers looked into goal - orientated decisions ( so those where consequences are taken into account ) and automatic decisions ( so those resulting from habit ) as well as the switch between the two , and how this was affected by chronic stress .
To answer that Ferreira and colleagues used rats exposed to chronic stress and , together with normal control rats , put them through training to learn to press a lever in order to obtain food rewards .
Both stressed and control rats responded very similarly , rising the number of pressings with time as they learned that this would increase the rewards obtained .
But when the situation was changed by feeding the animals on the side , so making the food rewards less appealing , while control rats were able to re-evaluate the situation and diminish the number of pressings , stressed rats continued to push the lever constantly despite the effort this required .
This suggested that once a habit was established stressed animals were no longer capable of switching the response back .
To assure that these results were not simply a consequence of a particular predilection for the food supplied , other rats were instead trained to press different levers to achieve different rewards but the same conclusion was reached : chronic stress predisposes animals to switch rapidly from goal - orientated to automatic kind of responses and make them incapable of switching back when new conditions required it .
Ferreira , Sousa and colleagues also looked into the stressed rats brain to access if this behavioural dysfunctionality could be associated with changes in this organ .
For that the researchers analysed the dorsomedial striatum ( DMS ) and the dorsolateral striatum ( DLS ) , which are brain areas previously associated to goal - orientated actions and habit formation respectively .
And in fact major changes were found with the stressed brain showing an atrophied DMS with a reduced number of connections between neurons , and an enlarged DLS with increased neural connectivity when compared with the brain of non-stressed control mice .
A proper response to a constant changing environment gives individuals an important advantage in life .
But the elaborated brain response that this demands requires a lot of energy to maintain , so to switch to automatic responses when possible , helps to save time and brain resources and can always be switched back if necessary .
Chronic stress is here shown to affect this capability of switching the responses according to need by restructuring the neural connectivities of the brain areas linked to the two responses .
It is known that inactivation of DMS or DLS can bias behaviour towards the other type of response which suggests that the behavioural effects of stress result from a competition between the two areas , with the enlarged , better connected , DLS “ winning ” .
Ferreira , Sousa and colleagues ’ study has several implications as it can , for example , help to explain why so many times stress - related diseases are associated with addictive or compulsive behaviour .
But also , in a stress - dominated society like ours , to understand how constant stress can directly affect our choices can help to develop mechanism to deal with it , a particularly important issue , for example , for army personnel in war zones
And in fact Nuno Sousa , the head to the research group involved in the work says when asked about future work “ We are now focusing our research efforts in unravelling the molecular and functional mechanisms underlying these findings , in order to develop in the future new strategies that can revert these stress - induced bias in decision - making processes ”

By Kif it Kunta in forum Discussion
If you ’re driving alone through the plains of Nebraska and need a little company , you ca n’t do better than the nationally syndicated maestros of political talk radio .
Hour after hour , rant after rant , it is a feast of words and feverish emotion , interrupted only by regular commercials and the occasional call from the awe - struck fan .
I ’d heard these voices before , but only in sound bites .
When you do n’t own a car and do n’t tune in at home , you probably do n’t run into Michael Savage , Rush Limbaugh or Mark Levin .
On the highways of the Cornhusker State , they ran into me , every time I hit the scan button .
After a while , it felt like a series of visits from very colorful and highly agitated relatives .
Or it would if I had a lot of relatives certain that America is slouching toward a socialist abyss .
The apparent influence of these conservative talk professionals has caused more hand - wringing than usual in recent weeks , in the wake of our summer of angry town hall meetings and the “ You lie ! ” outburst of Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina .
And when you hear Barack Obama likened to Pol Pot  as Mr. Savage did in a recent show you can understand the concern .
But to my uninitiated ears , there was something reassuringly familiar about political talk radio , and not because I know a lot about firebrands .
It ’s because I listen to a lot of rap .
Gangsta rap , in particular .
I ’ll admit that the parallels between Jay - Z and Rush Limbaugh do not seem obvious , and to grasp them you need to look beyond the violence and misogyny that have made rap a favorite target of the right wing .
( Come to think of it , perhaps each of these realms will be chagrined to be likened to the other . )
But as soon as you dig beneath the surface , the similarities between talk radio and gangsta rap are nothing short of uncanny .
And these similarities are revealing , too .
( This blog post is about a web - based version of BBC iPlayer launched in 2009 .
You may also be interested in the BBC iPlayer application for PS3 , designed for the remote control in the living room , that was launched August 8th 2011 - inserted Ian McDonald 12 Aug 2011 )
Good news for PS3 owners - last week we released an updated version of iPlayer that offers improved video quality and an enhanced user interface .
We first released a version of iPlayer for PS3 about a year ago .
It worked pretty well , but back then the PS3 used an older version of Flash that did n't support H.264 playback and did n't support full - screen mode , which somewhat limited the playback experience we could provide .
A few months ago Sony released an updated version of Flash that provided support for H.264 content .
However , that version of Flash was still unable to play back our higher quality streams at the full frame rate of 25 fps .
Since then , Sony have done a great job of enhancing the PS3's Flash playback experience , and the latest V3.0 firmware update now includes hardware acceleration in full - screen mode , allowing for a substantial improvement in the playback experience .
Over the past year , we 've also done a lot of tuning and enhancements to our iPlayer video encoding , including adding a new 1500 Kbps " SD quality " format .
Put the two together and the result is an iPlayer on PS3 with brilliant video quality - almost as good as broadcast television !
As part of the V3.0 firmware update , Sony have added a big iPlayer icon to the PS3's cross-media bar , giving easy one - click access to iPlayer :
As well as optimising the video quality , we 've also optimised our " designed for TV viewing " BigScreen interface in a new larger size to take advantage of the extra real estate offered on high - def displays :
i Player BigScreen interface on 576 p screens
i Player BigScreen interface on 720 p and 1080 p screens
You can see these two interfaces in action by going to https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/bigscreen in your regular browser , then resizing your browser window larger or smaller to simulate our BigScreen interface at various PS3 resolutions .
You 'll see the interface automatically resize itself to the large size once your browser width reaches 1280 pixels ( the best way to experience our BigScreen interface on a PC is to hit F11 to maximise your browser window ) .
By the way , you can experience our BigScreen version of iPlayer on your PC as well - just head over to https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/bigscreen on any computer .
Connect your computer 's video out to your TV set and use our BigScreen interface to play your favourite programmes on demand from the comfort of your couch .
Finally , some iPlayer on PS3 tips and tricks :
1 . If the iPlayer icon does n't appear in the XMB
Some users have reported that the iPlayer icon has n't appeared after they 've installed the V3.0 firmware update , so if you 're not seeing the iPlayer icon here 's what to do :
Sign up for the PSN network ( it 's free ) using a UK address , which seems to be a requirement for getting the iPlayer icon to appear .
Reboot ( important ) .
You should now see the iPlayer icon in the XMB .
If you still do n't see the iPlayer icon , check the serial number on the back of your PS3 - it should end with CECH - XXX3 , where the " 3 " indicates a UK model .
Only UK models get the iPlayer icon , meaning that if you purchased your PS3 abroad or through a retailer that imported non-UK models then you wo n't get an iPlayer icon .
If the iPlayer icon still does n't appear , do n't worry about it - you can get exactly the same iPlayer experience by launching the PS3 browser and going directly to the iPlayer site at https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer
On the PS3 , to exit full - screen mode , double - click the " X " key on the PS3 remote .
To re-enter full - screen mode , position the mouse pointer over the video ( which will now be playing in a small window in the BigScreen site ) and double - click " X " again .
3 . Turn off the screensaver
By default the PS3 screensaver kicks in after 20 minutes , dimming the screen right in the middle of your favourite programme .
So you might want to disable the screensaver : Settings > Display Settings > Screensaver
Over the coming weeks we 'll be adding some extra functionality and fixing a few glitches in the UI .
User response to our new iPlayer for PS3 has been amazing .
Although it 's less than a week since we launched , iPlayer on PS3 now accounts for a massive ~ 10 % of all iPlayer viewing , overtaking Mac ( 8.5 % ) to be our 2nd most popular platform for IP - delivered content .
We 'll have to wait and see whether this holds up in the coming weeks , but this enthusiastic reception makes it clear that users do want iPlayer on their TV - something that bodes well for Canvas and other IPTV propositions .

Jordan Crawford Dunks On LeBron James Secret Video Released !
Total Pro Sports –
It took quite some time , but we are finally witnesses to the infamous Jordan Crawford dunk on LeBron James .
We told you earlier in the day that the video footage was to be released at 6:45 , but it has appeared a few hours early .
It happened just the way Crawford described it in his interview afterwards , when he said “ I was coming from the right wing , and I came down the middle and ( LeBron ) just happened to be there . ”
LeBron happened to be there alright .
I can see why Kobe Bryant did n’t want the same thing to happen to him at his camp .
Now we just have to get this video to Hugh Hefner .
Maybe then he will know who LeBron is , but that likely wont change his decision on whether he is better than Kobe .

The Linear RPG
Sophie Houlden の
The Linear RPG は，最低限の構成要素によって構築された RPG だ。プレイヤーは直線の上を進むか戻るかすることができる。直線上を移動していると，勝手に戦闘が発生したり，勝手に経験値を得たりする。直線の各所に配置されている点は「町」で，跨ぐことによって体力を回復することができる。ストーリーは背景で勝手に流れているので，読んだり読まなかったりすればいい。
このゲームは，いわゆる 「 一本道 な RPG 」の抽象的な表現とみることができる。非常にシンプルな内容であるにもかかわらず，それなりの達成感を得ることができるとの意見も存在する。
( CNN ) -- Alicia A.S. Duque knew she had some pounds to lose , but she had no idea how much being overweight affected her until the television cameras started rolling .
Alicia Duque performs with her partner on Oxygen 's new hit " Dance Your Ass Off . "
" Going into it , I knew it was a TV show , I knew it was a weight - loss show and I knew it was a dance show , but I did n't think I was going to learn so much about myself through the process , " said the 23 - year - old Duque , a contestant on the new show " Dance Your Ass Off . "
" I did n't know how many issues and problems I had with my weight until I faced it on the show . "
Duque 's struggle with weight loss is one of many on television that is resonating with those tuning into programming aimed at and featuring the plus - sized .
Style Network's " Ruby , " NBC's " The Biggest Loser , " Lifetime 's " Drop Dead Diva " and Fox 's forthcoming dating show " More to Love " all center on the overweight and are tapping into an audience that can relate to the desire to shed a few pounds .
Obesity has risen dramatically in the United States during the past 20 years , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
And this year television has seen an increase in shows featuring participants and stars who look more like the viewing public .
Oxygen Channel 's " Dance Your Ass Off " combines elements of ABC's " Dancing With The Stars " and NBC's " The Biggest Loser . "
Contestants learn dance routines for which they are judged before weighing in to determine how much they have lost .
Amy Introcaso - Davis , senior vice president of original programming and development at Oxygen , said dance and diet are two areas of interest for younger viewers of the channel , so combining the two made sense .
The 12 contestants , from the smallest to the largest , have struck a chord with viewers , she said .
" People find the contestants so relatable , " she said .
" We cast very purposely across the board in terms of how many pounds people needed to lose -- we had anywhere from people who needed to lose 40 [ pounds ] to over 150 . "
The premier of " Dance " rated highly for Oxygen , with more than 1 million viewers tuning in .
Oxygen also found success earlier with " Mo'Nique 's F.A.T.
Chance , " a plus - size pageant where women of substance strutted their stuff to be crowned " Miss Fabulous And Thick . "
For a nation grappling with obesity , Introcaso - Davis said , there is a hunger for such shows .
" If you have five pounds to lose or you have 150 pounds to lose , it 's something you think about all day long , " she said .
" You take a bite of cheesecake and you think ' Should I be doing this ? ' "
Esther Rothblum , a professor of women 's studies at San Diego State University and co-editor of the forthcoming anthology " The Fat Studies Reader , " said she wonders if part of the appeal of plus - sized shows stems from the overweight being held up for public ridicule .
The subject of her book is an emerging field that has been defined as " confronting and critiquing cultural constraints " against notions of " fatness " and " the fat body . "
" Most people feel too fat in this country and are made to feel very unhappy with their bodies , " she said .
" So by portraying somebody who weighs so much more than they do , it 's almost a way to make the audience feel like ' I could look worse ' or ' At least I 'm not them . ' "
Ruby Gettinger said she supports any show that does not mock the overweight .
Her hit show " Ruby " started out as a documentary and has transformed Gettinger into a reality star who has lost more than 100 pounds and appeared on " Oprah . "
" We are really all on this journey together , and I tell [ viewers ] that all of the time , " said Gettinger , who at her heaviest weighed 716 pounds .
" There are a lot of shows out there and I think people are trying to find a way to beat it and lose weight . "
Gettinger , who is traveling around the country walking in various cities to inspire fans to become more active , said shows featuring the obese can really touch the audience if they are authentic .
" [ My show ] is the truth , not to say that the others are n't , " she said .
" When I started out on this journey and met with Style [ Network , which airs the show ]
I said ' I have to keep my truth because this is about my journey and addiction and I want to deal with that because too many people are struggling . ' "
Her show portrays her grappling with everything from temptation to embarrassment at having to visit the gynecologist , but Gettinger said it 's all worth it if it inspires others .
Actress Marissa Jaret Winokur , who starred in the Broadway musical " Hairspray , " said she agreed to host " Dance Your Ass Off " because she saw the potential for inspiration in viewers witnessing overweight people being active and feeling confident and sexy -- even in skimpy dance outfits .
Reality television has become so popular because viewers are attracted to watching real people , and there is a craving for viewers to see folks like themselves , she said .
" It became that so many people on reality shows were only beautiful skinny people , and I think a lot of people got sick of that , " said Winokur , who has been blogging about her own struggles with weight for People magazine .
" Really , who 's home watching TV is the everyday person who is not a TV model .
I think there is much more interest in watching people like yourself . "

Police in Texas just made a remarkable discovery that could potentially turn the domestic marijuana industry upside down .
Although a recent drug raid only turned up a single marijuana plant , officers determined that it is the most valuable marijuana ever reported .
According to Sheriff Thomas Kerss , this type of marijuana has a street value of $ 6,000 per ounce !
That 's some very impressive pot .
According to the government 's own data , collected by the National Drug Intelligence Center , high - grade marijuana prices top out at around $ 7,500 per pound in high - value markets .
That 's around $ 470 an ounce .
Similarly , the marijuana magazine High Times estimates the average price of high - grade marijuana at $ 428 per ounce in August 2009 .
As you can see , the marijuana just discovered in Texas is more than 12 times as valuable as anything currently on the market .
Even the hippies athave never heard of anything like this , but maybe that 's because the police are doing such a good job keeping it off the streets .***** Or maybe the police lied about how much it 's worth .
After finding only one little pot plant in a big dramatic drug raid , they wildly inflated the value of their drug seizure in order to make newspaper headlines .
It 's happened before , although this is by far the most laughably outrageous marijuana price ever claimed by police in the three years I 've been documenting this behavior .
At $ 6,000 an ounce , that would mean one little joint costs $ 200 .
A dimebag would be invisible to the naked eye .
It just does n’t make sense , which is why I refuse to believe it's an honest mistake when cops say stuff like this .
Narcotics investigators buy drugs all the time so they can arrest people for selling to them .
They know the market well and if their estimates come out all crazy , it 's because they 're trying to impress people with the fruits of their filthy labor .
But the stupidity does n’t end there .
Lying about the value of marijuana rather obviously encourages people to grow it .
If these guys really gave a damn about " winning " the war on drugs , they would n’t be running around in the middle of an economic crisis telling people you can make thousands of dollars from a single marijuana plant .
Nonsense like that could quickly blow up in your face .
Unless , of course , the people who get paid a good salary and benefits to bust marijuana growers actuallymore people to do it .
Say it ai n't so .
I just heard back from KRTE9 News and the online version of the story has been corrected to say $ 6,000 per pound , which makes a lot more sense .
I 'm told that " the DEA mistakenly told the sheriff 6 , th an oz , " which is pretty weird .
That means multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in disseminating this number and no one noticed how absurd it was ?
I 'll take their word for it that someone just screwed up here , which is what a couple readers suggested to me as well .
But please understand that this is hardly the first time I 've encountered police claiming ridiculous marijuana prices that artificially inflated the value of their drug seizures .
Whether it 's done deliberately or not , this behavior serves to misinform the public and should n’t be tolerated .
A near - vertical wall of water in what had been an otherwise placid sea shocked all on board the ocean liner Teutonic — including the crew — on that Sunday in February , more than a century ago .
" It was about 9 o'clock , and [ First Officer Bartlett ] , as he walked the bridge , had not the slightest premonition of the impending danger .
The wave came over the bow from nobody seems to know where , and broke in all its fury , " reported The New York Times on March 1 , 1901 : " Many of the passengers were inclined to believe that the wave was the result of volcanic phenomena , or a tidal wave .
These opinions were the exception , however , for had the sea been of the tidal order Bartlett would have seen it coming . "
The volcano theory was just as unlikely : " Absurd , absurd , " one of the Teutonic 's officers told the Times .
" It was a giant sea , and there is no doubt of that . "
This is just one of the many anecdotal accounts in maritime history of waves upward of 30 meters devouring ships , even swallowing low - flying helicopters .
But what sea captains and scientists have long believed to be true only gained widespread acceptance after the first digitally recorded rogue wave struck an oil rig in 1995 .
" The seamen tales about large waves eating their ships are correct , " says Tim Janssen , an oceanographer at San Francisco State University .
" This was proof to everybody else , and a treat for scientists .
They suspected it , but to see it and have an observation is something else . "
Now that there is no longer a question of rogue waves ' existence , other mysteries have arisen :
How frequently do they occur ?
Just how do they come about ?
Are there areas or conditions where they are more likely ?
Janssen is among a growing group of researchers in search of answers to these questions , which could someday lead to safer seas .
Rogue waves by the numbers
Before any answers could be attempted , scientists first had to characterize a rogue ( or freak ) wave .
The widely accepted definition , according to Janssen , is a wave roughly three times the average height of its neighbors .
This is a somewhat arbitrary cutoff .
Really , he notes , they are just " unexpectedly large waves . "
The wave that swept onlookers off the coast in Acadia National Park in Maine on August 23 may not fit the former definition , for example , because background waves were already quite large due to Hurricane Bill , and rogues typically occur in the open ocean .
Yet that wave has still been readily referred to as a " rogue " .
No one is certain yet just how frequently freak waves form ; accurate numbers are extremely difficult to collect given the waves ' rare and transient nature .
With more sophisticated monitoring and modeling — and as first - hand accounts are taken more seriously — the waves ' prevalence appears to be rising .
" [ Rogue waves ] are all short - lived , and because ships are not everywhere , the probability that a ship encounters one is relatively small , " says Daniel Solli , who studies the optical version of rogue waves at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" But with increasing amounts of oceanic traffic in the future , the likelihood of encountering them is getting larger . "
Some areas seem to breed the waves more than others .
Janssen and his colleagues recently used computer models to determine that regions where wave energy is strongly focused could be up to 10 times more likely to generate a freak wave .
He speculates that approximately three of every 10,000 waves on the oceans achieve rogue status , yet in certain spots — like coastal inlets and river mouths — these extreme waves can make up three out of every 1,000 waves .
A paper describing these results was published last month in the Journal of Physical Oceanography .
Forming fearsome waves
Various theories exist for how rogue waves form .
The simplest suggests that small waves coalesce into much larger ones in an accumulative fashion — a faster one - meter wave catches up with a slower two - meter wave adding up to a three - meter wave , for example .
Janssen and his colleagues build on this with a more complex , nonlinear model in their recent paper .
Waves might actually " communicate — sometimes in a bad way — and produce more constructive interferences , " Janssen explains .
By communicating , he means exchanging energy .
And because the conversations are n't necessarily balanced , he says , " Communication can get amplified enough that a high - intensity large wave develops . "
In other words , one burgeoning wave can actually soak up the energy of surrounding waves .
Again , in those places where variations in water depths and currents focus wave energies , this line of communication can get especially busy .
Janssen 's models identified these rogue - prone zones .
Certain conditions such as winds and wave dissipation , however , could not be included , limiting the simulation 's predictive power .
Meanwhile , Chin Wu , an environmental engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison sees another likely scenario spurring the monster waves : " If a wave propagates from east to west , and the current moves west to east , then a wave starts to build up , " says Wu , who studies wave –current interactions in a 15 - meter pool .
The wave basically climbs the current 's wall , rising out of what appears to be nowhere .
Rogue waves have in fact been more common in regions such as the east coast of South Africa where surface waves meet currents running in the opposite direction .
Focusing on forecasts
The only way to really know what is going on in the unpredictable oceans is to watch , Wu says .
He acknowledges , however , that the investments in the instruments and time necessary for such fieldwork are immense .
" We need to identify places where [ rogue waves ] are more likely to occur , " he says , emphasizing the importance of numerical models — including the nontrivial accounting of wind and wave breaking — at this step , " and then focus on those areas . "
Focusing on an optical wave analogue may actually help scientists limit where they need to look .
Light waves travel in optical fibers similarly to water waves traveling in the open ocean .
" In optics we 're dealing with a similar phenomenon , but doing experiments on the tabletop and acquiring data in only a fraction of a second , " says U.C. Los Angeles 's Solli .
Although he does n't suggest that optical experiments should replace ocean research , he suggests it could be a guide .
Mapping light - wave conditions to the ocean could uncover parallel parameters that give rise to water waves .
" Instead of looking for a needle in a haystack in the water , you could benefit from some beginning wisdom and narrow down the range , " adds Solli , who co-authored a paper on optical rogue waves in the December 2007 edition of Nature .
( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group . )
Janssen agrees with the need for more direct observations of ocean behavior .
" We can make a theoretical prediction , " he says .
" But then we have to go out and see if nature agrees . "
If it does , the results " could provide a prediction scenario — made visible on maps — of hot spots that could change day to day , " Janssen says .
This could work much like tornado forecasting .
Only two passengers were seriously hurt in the Teutonic incident — one suffered a broken jaw and the other a severed foot .
They were fortunate .
" Had it struck us later on in the day many passengers would have been promenading in the sunshine , without doubt , " Officer Bartlett told the Times .
" There is no telling how many of them would have been injured . "
Extreme waves do not always offer such merciful timing , however .
Forecasts could be crucial in helping future ocean liners evade the voracious sea monsters .
If you ’ve kept an eye on the federal government ’s “ Cash for Clunkers ” program ( which will end on Monday ) , you know that it ’s been a huge success on a number of fronts : hundreds of thousands of people have traded in older , less fuel - efficient vehicles for new models with better gas mileage , and some auto manufacturers are even rehiring .
Of course , the program ’s had its downsides , also : dealers have complained about slow reimbursements , and some environmentalists have worried that the fuel economy requirements were n’t quite stringent enough .
Portland , Oregon - based businessman Joe Doebele has another complaint about the program : there ’s nothing in it to get commuters to shift from four wheels to two .
Rather than just throw stones , though , Doeble decided to do something about this shortcoming : he ’s started his own “ cash for clunkers ” program at his cargo bike shop Joe Bike .
[ social_buttons ]
OK , yes —
Doebele has a personal financial stake in getting more people on bikes .
But he ’s also right about some of the shortcomings of Cash for Clunkers .
He told the Oregonian ‘s Hard Drive blog :
I realized that if people are driving a clunker , they probably do n’t have too much cash to spend on a new car and we ’re asking them to go deeper into debt to drive more …
My Cash for Clunkers program is partly out of a sense of humor and partly out of economical activism . ”
Trade Your Car — or Your Bike — for a New Bike
The Joe Bike Cash for Clunkers program has two options : your “ clunker ” can be either a car or a bike .
For cars : Donate it to the American Lung Association .
Bring in the receipt for the donation , and Joe Bike will give you 10 % off a new bike , and a discounted - for - life membership in Zipcar .
Donate it to the American Lung Association .
Bring in the receipt for the donation , and Joe Bike will give you 10 % off a new bike , and a discounted - for - life membership in Zipcar .
For bikes :
Bring in your repairable bike , and get $ 50 - $ 100 off a new one .
The old bike will be donated to the Community Cycling Center .
While the Joe Bike program probably wo n’t get quite as many clunkers off of the road as the federal initiative , it ’s a fantastic means of promoting bicycling as not only a greener means of transportation , but also a much more economical one .

People have become significant earth movers , outpacing all sources of natural erosion .
More and more of our footprint can be seen from space in many forms , including cities , reservoirs , agriculture and deforestation .
Among the most impressive human scars on the planet are open - pit mines .
We ’ve gathered some of the biggest , most spectacular and interesting mines , as captured by astronauts and satellites on the following pages .
Above : Berkeley Pit , Butte , Montana
This former copper mine operated between 1955 and 1982 .
Gold and silver were also mined .
An elaborate system of pumps and drains kept the local water level low enough for mining .
Today , the 1,780 foot - deep pit is filled with around 900 feet of very contaminated water filled with metals and chemicals such as arsenic , cadmium , pyrite , zinc , copper and sulfuric acid .
The water can be as acidic as battery acid , and copper can actually be “ mined ” directly from the water .
Currently , the 1 - mile - by - 0.5 - mile pit is listed as a federal Superfund site with the potential to contaminate surrounding ground water , and , surprisingly , is also a tourist attraction , complete with gift shop and $ 2 admission fee .
This photograph was taken Aug. 2 , 2006 , by astronauts aboard the International Space Station .

Escondida Mine , Chile
The Escondida mine , opened in 1990 at 10,000 feet in northern Chile ’s Atacama desert , currently produces more copper than any other mine in the world , with 1.5 million tons in 2007 , worth more than $ 10 billion and representing nearly a tenth of world copper production .
More than 6,000 people work at the mine .
This image was captured in 2000 by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer aboard NASA ’s Terra satellite .

Bingham Canyon Mine , Utah
Located 20 miles outside Salt Lake City in the Oquirrh Mountains , the Bingham Canyon copper pit has produced more than 18 million tons of copper over its lifetime , more than any other mine in the world .
The pit is about 2.75 miles wide and 4,000 feet deep .
Two Empire State buildings stacked one on top of the the other would n’t reach the top .
By 2015 , the mine will be 500 feet deeper , and a third Empire State building will fit inside .
The terraces inside the pit , which provide a base for the digging equipment and also stabilize the slopes , can be more than 80 feet high .
Opened in 1904 , the site has been named a historic landmark .
This photograph was taken Sept. 20 , 2007 , by astronauts aboard the International Space Station with a digital camera and an 800 mm lens .

Yuba River Goldfields , California .
The Yuba Goldfields are a strange culmination of years of pressure - jet mining for gold upstream in the Sierra Nevada , dredging the tailings out of the river , and mining the tailings for gold and then later for gravel .
The result is an odd landscape of reddish - brown and gray hills of gravel with water - filled ravines in between .
Shortly after gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevada in 1848 , panning gave way to highly destructive hydraulic mining , which involves blasting sediment away with high - powered jets of water .
Gold was extracted from the gravel , which was then dumped and carried downstream by rivers into the Sacramento Valley .
The Yuba River ended up with 685 million cubic feet of the mine waste , which raised the level of the river , overflowed the banks and buried farms .
Dredging of the Yuba began in 1893 , and soon after , mining companies began to sift and resift through the debris to extract ever - smaller bits of gold .
By 1970 , all economically feasible gold removal had been completed , and mining of the gravel for concrete began .
Today , ownership of the land is disputed among mining companies , private owners and the government .

Toquepala Copper Mine , Peru
Located in the Andes Mountains in southern Peru , the Toquepala mine is 1.5 miles wide and 2,300 feet deep .
The mine ’s main output is copper , but it also produces gold , silver and molybdenum .
The railroad that was constructed to carry the ore 60 miles to the coast can be seen winding down a canyon left of the center , heading southwest from the mine .
This image was captured by astronauts aboard the International Space Station on Sept. 22 , 2003 .

Freeport Mine , Indonesia
The Freeport Mine , also known as the Grasberg complex , is a huge mining operation in Indonesia ’s Sudirman Mountains .
Copper was discovered here in 1936 , and gold was first found in 1988 .
Today , the mine is one of the largest gold - and copper -extraction operations in the world .
The open pit is 2.5 miles wide , and there is extensive underground mining in the area as well .
Glaciers are also visible in the image .
This photograph was taken June 25 , 2005 , by astronauts on the International Space Station .

Cananea Mine , Mexico
The Cananea mine is located 25 miles south of the United States border in Sonora , Mexico .
The active Colorada Pit in the upper right is 1.6 miles across .
It is one of the largest copper producers in the world and also contains gold .
Those two metals are often found together where hot magma forced its way up into the overlying bedrock .
The magma crystallized there while hot fluids circulated through it and into fractures in the surrounding rock , altering the rock to produce copper - rich minerals and gold .
A 1906 miner ’s strike at Cananea turned violent and resulted in 19 deaths , contributing to events that led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910 .
Another strike stopped work at the mine in 2007 .
This image was taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station on March 3 , 2008 .

Phosphate Mines , Jordan
Phosphate mining is an important industry in Jordan , which has abundant deposits of the mineral on approximately 60 percent of its territory .
Phosphorus is essential to living things , and food ca n’t be produced without it .
Some scientists fear a shortage of this critical resource is impending and have predicted the world will reach “ Peak Phosphorus , ” the point at which production will begin to decline , just 30 years from now .
There is currently no synthetic alternative .
This image was capture by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite Sept. 17 , 2005 .

Vegetation appears red , water is blue , and rock and soil can be anywhere from buff to black .
The mining operation is the area just left of center in the lower part of the image that appears striped .

New Cornelia Mine , Arizona
Copper was first mined from this area just south of the mining town of Ajo , Arizona , around 1750 .
The open - pit mine pictured above began being excavated in earnest in 1912 .
It was shut down in 1983 when the price of copper dropped .
The scalloped land just to the right of the mine is covered in tailings , and the large gray rectangles above that are containment ponds where the metal was extracted .

Hambach Coal Mines , Germany
The bright white - and - dark - blue–striped areas on the right side of this image are opencast coal mines in midwestern Germany .
One of the mines is currently being worked by the Bagger 293 , the largest machine in the world .
The bucket - wheel excavator is twice as long as a soccer field and as tall as a 30 - story building , and digs up 30 million tons of lignite per year .
This image , captured by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer aboard NASA ’s Terra satellite Aug. 26 , 2000 , is a simulated natural - color image .
The bright - green rectangular patches are crops , the gray patches are bare ground , and the bluish - gray areas are towns .

With all the interest over Disney buying Marvel Comics , the news this week that Warner Brothers Entertainment was restructuring its comic division was nearly lost in the shuffle .
Time - Warner created DC Entertainment , Inc , a new entity under which DC Comic will continue to operate .
The new company is headed by Diane Nelson .
While Nelson has a world of business experience , her most recognizable job is overseeing the franchise management of the Harry Potter property .
She said in an interview that the new company is not just about the big properties , like Superman , Wonder Woman , and Batman , but also about developing lesser known characters into household names .
As a long - time DC reader , there are some lesser known properties that I would love to see on television or on the big screen .
So I made a list .
1 . The third Blue Beetle , Jaime Reyes .
This character is tailor - made to appeal to older kids and teenagers .
Jaime Reyes first appeared as the new Blue Beetle just three years ago , in 2006 , in the big crossover event , Infinite Crisis .
Jaime 's story is a great coming of age tale , as he learns how to sort out the new powers given by the alien technology grafted to his spine , fight super villains , and deal with the normal problems of growing up , like girlfriends and how to tell your parents that you 're a superhero .
( Okay , the last is n't normal . )
My eldest son has read all the trade paperbacks of his book and loves them .
Jaimie has already appeared a number of times on Cartoon Network 's The Brave and the Bold , making him familiar and liked by kids already .
( Listen to our interview with Jaime 's creator , John Rogers , here . )
2. Gotham Central
This award - winning series written by Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka lasted forty issues before being canceled .
Though set in Batman 's Gotham City , it focused on the major crimes unit , telling the stories of ordinary human police officers who deal with a city full of costumed heroes and villains .
As a television show , it would be like Hill Street Blues .
Well , save for the occasional crazy sociopath , like the Joker .
3 . The Spoiler , Stephanie Brown .
The Spoiler , copyright DC Comics
Teenage Stephanie Brown has a serious problem .
Her father is a third - rate super - villain called the Cluemaster who is supposedly rehabilitated .
Except Stephanie overhears him planning a new crime and feels obligated to don a costume and stop him .
And so the Spoiler was born .
The character , created by Chuck Dixon , first appeared back in 1992 , and she quickly took on a life of her own , becoming a popular supporting character in Robin , as a foil and later girlfriend to the new Robin , Tim Drake .
DC has n't quite known what to do with Stephanie lately .
She had a short stint as Robin , was supposedly dead , then not dead , then she was the Spoiler again , and now she 's the new Batgirl .
But the original concept , of a regular teenage girl determined to stop her father from returning to a life of crime , would make a great television show .
4. Sandman Mystery Theatre
This comic , from DC 's adult Vertigo line , would fit right in the the noir theme popular in the more recent superhero movies .
Sandman Mystery
Theatre is set in New York City in the late 1930s , right on the eve of World War II .
Our hero is Wesley Dodds , the Sandman , who fights crime with a special gun that shoots sleep pellets and the hints that appear to him in strange , prophetic dreams .
The dreams are a side effect of his contact with the DC 's mythical Sandman , from the books written by Neil Gaiman .
The comic also features a slow - developing romance between Wesley and Dian Belmont , a woman struggling to forge her own way in a world not quite ready for independent woman .
5. Kamandi , The Last Boy on Earth .
My youngest son , who loved the Kamandi strip in DC's Wednesday Comics , insisted I add this character to the list .
Originally a creation of Jack Kirby , Kamandi lives in a post - apocalyptic world where the only intelligent beings are evolved animals .
He 's continually caught in a struggle between warring animals , and is also on a quest to discover more of his kind .
And , my son wants to add , has many cool adventures that would make a great movie .
What are your picks ?
According to Chinese TV , Chinese scientists at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing are claiming that they have recorded clear UFO footage while observing total solar eclipse on July 22 .
Observatory director Ji Hai - sheng says they need to study it :
Purple Mountain Observatory and Chinese Academy of Sciences said that during the July 22 total solar eclipse observation , China had discovered near the sun , by observing staff , an unidentified object , it 's physical nature remains to be further studied .
Currently manpower is being organized to deal with this data , complete the data analysis and reveal the scientific results and this will take at least one year 's time to finalize .

The unemployment rate as I write is inching toward 10 percent nationally , and that is only counting people who were still looking for a job recently .
A vast bank robbery by the corrupt on Wall Street has deprived them of the credit that made the economy go .
Labor Day was passed by Congress under Grover Cleveland to celebrate not only the individual American laborer but the labor movement– yes , unions , workers ’ parades , hard hats and blue jeans ( before the youth movement of the 1960s appropriated them , blue jeans were working class clothing , and my working class relatives upbraided me for wearing them as an undergraduate ) .
It is to celebrate all those icons that shills for the barracuda billionaires , such as Glenn Beck , now castigate as “ fascist ” and “ communist . ”
It is to celebrate what Carl Sandberg did in his poem , “ Chicago : ”
Hog Butcher for the World ,
Tool Maker , Stacker of Wheat ,
Player with Railroads and the Nation ’s Freight Handler ;
Stormy , husky , brawling ,
City of the Big Shoulders ;
And of course , the home - makers and retail workers who move the manufactured goods and the teachers are all doing the hard foundational work as well .
Who is not working are the Wall Street thieves who have largely gone unpunished or been actively rewarded for their peculation .
Now Americans have convinced themselves that we do n’t have a working class .
Everybody is middle class , even those who make minimum wage in the fast food industry , or those who are kept as part - timers so that the store ( I ’m looking at you , Walmart ) does n’t have to enroll them in a health care program .
The closest we get to celebrating the workers who built this country is when we talk about “ working families , ” an odd locution , since aside from the idle rich who defrauded the country into bankruptcy last fall , would n’t that be everyone ?
While we have lots of workers , we no longer have an effective labor movement , because Ronald Reagan by example essentially overturned the mid-20th century traditions that had made it unseemly for employers to fire striking workers and hire scab labor .
Even the anti-worker Taft Hartley law of 1947 prohibited companies from firing workers for their union activities .
But the penalties for illegal union - busting are so light that companies frequently fire employees who so much as suggest organizing a union .
Damon Silvers convincingly ties our current economic woes to this union - busting .
( H/t Jake McIntyre ) .
Fewer effective unions have left American workers at the mercy of predatory company policies .
Government has , since Ronald Reagan ( who hated organized workers the way the devil hates holy water ) , also socially - engineered the tax laws so as to throw enormous further wealth at the wealthy .
As a result , the average wage of the average worker in the United States has not increased since 1970 ( in 2004 the bottom 60 % of the population was actually making less in real terms per capita each year than in 1979 ) .
In contrast , the top 1 % of the population by income now takes home nearly 20 % of the country ’s annual income .
The top 1 % , about 3 million persons , has gone from owning 25 % of the privately held wealth in the 1950s under Eisenhower to owning over a third today .
The top 10 percent of Americans own almost all the country ’s privately - held property .
Now , the US has increased its productivity very substantially since 1970 , but working Americans have captured very little of the resulting extra wealth .
It has been hogged by the rich .
William Domhoff notes , “ Although [ by 2004 ] overall income had grown by 27 % since 1979 , 33 % of the gains went to the top 1 % . ” Silver ’s graph is eloquent .
Domhoff adds , “ As of 2007 , income inequality in the United States was at an all - time high for recent history , with the top 0.01 % — that ’s one - hundredth of one percent — receiving 6 % of all U.S. wages , which is double what it was for that tiny slice in 2000 ; the top 10 % received 49.7 % , the highest since 1917 ( Saez , 2009 ) . ”
Reagan - Cheney between 1980 and 2008 created a new American aristocracy , a small sliver of super - rich , who buy and sell legislators , create whole “ news networks ” to present far rightwing fantasies as “ news , ” have their lackeys invade and occupy whole countries , hold themselves above the law , falsify financial statements , and suffer little or no punishment for stealing billions from the pensions of “ working families ” ( i.e. those of us about whom P.T. Barnum remarked , “ one is born every minute ” . )
The Republican Party has come to represent these super - rich .
Since .1 % of the population could n’t actually win elections , they ally with other groups in society .
About two - thirds of evangelicals have joined up with them , about a third of Latinos , significant numbers of midwestern rural families , and obviously large numbers of white southerners .
In some cases these are lower middle class people on the make , who want to hitch their wagons to the brightest stars in the sky .
In others , they share with the super - rich various resentments of the federal government .
This alliance of odd bedfellows ( think of Paris Hilton married to Joe Sixpack ) is what produces the wackiness of Republican Party politics and media .
They ca n’t come out and say that they want the country run for the benefit of 300,000 multi-millionaires and billionaires ( almost all of them white ) , so they say they are all in favor of guns , apple pie , Jay - sus and the Confederacy .
Sometimes , as with Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney , the pretense is so forced as to be implausible even to their minions .
Clearly , racism and fear - mongering are also key irrational talking points for the plutocrats seeking support from the white lower middle class ( though this route can backfire , as it did in 2008 when Republican fear - mongering about Latino immigration alienated most Latino voters and drove them into the arms of the Democrats . )
The unbalanced and unhealthy distribution of wealth in the United States , which Cheney ’s tax cuts accelerated , explains why the Democratic Party faces such difficulties whenever it is allowed into power .
It represents the poor schmucks who make up the 80 percent of the population that has been reduced to peasants by our new dukes , viscounts and princesses who have captured the lion ’s share of the country ’s wealth and income .
Obviously , elements in the top 20 % ( and even moreso in the top 1 % ) are not happy about any outbreak of democracy .
They have been given by tax breaks and union - busting the wherewithal to purchase legislators ( including Democratic ones ) , buy crowds , and put weeping rednecks on their corporate media waxing hysterical about the prospect of a black president being allowed in their childrens ’ schoolrooms .
It is the unscrupulous super - rich who do n’t want universal health care .
They think you only get to be super - rich by refusing to pay for the government services you use ( via e.g. off - shore registration ) and finding ways to make the middle class pay for essential government services to the poor .
And they think it helps to be heartless if you want to be super - rich , you have to say of the poor , if they get sick and ca n’t afford health care , they should just die .
( There is nothing wrong with being rich or super - rich in and of itself ; Warren Buffett is admirable ; it is just that over - concentration of wealth creates temptations for persons in that class that only the principled can resist ) .
And since the middle classes know that many among the rich will try to make them pay for any increased services for the poor , many of them oppose such progressive legislation .
If we repealed the law making corporations a person and if we constrained all corporations that do the bulk of their business in the US to pay taxes here , there would be plenty of money to provide health care to everyone .
The ultra-concentration of wealth in so few hands has damaged American democracy because democracy implies equality of rights , and the super - rich have more rights than the rest of us ( there are now people on the FBI ’s no -fly list who are simple peaceful dissidents from the super - rich program of ‘ globalization ‘ ) .
Many of our corporations are essentially using us as garbage dumps for their unhealthy corporate food , creating a crisis of obesity that in turn is causing our bulging bellies to devour our brains and for men , to make it impossible for them to get it up .
A government genuinely concerned with our welfare would outlaw anything but diet sodas .
The unwillingness of our government to regulate this assault on our brain mass via our bellies is owed directly to the power of corporate lobbies that shape and even outright author legislation on such issues .
( This paragraph is not meant to hurt the feelings of the victims of these policies ; I ’m saying you are victims – you have a right to expect your food to be healthy , and your government to care if it is n’t . )
The super - rich are fattening us up , not for the kill , but for imbecility and impotence .
At least we wo n’t remember to miss the fun .
Not to mention that if the government cared about the people , cigarettes would have been banned as soon as it became clear that they cause lung cancer .
Cigarette manufacturers would have been forbidden to spray extra nicotine ( yes ) on the leaves to hook people .
I think it is still the case that if any third world country , whose citizens the US is mowing down with its poisonous weed export , tried to ban the heinous stuff , the US congress would accuse it of unfair trade practices .
( In contrast , the US is trying hard to stop Afghan farmers from raising opium poppies , which are also highly addictive but differ from tobacco in not being guaranteed to kill the consumers ; questions of what tobacco farmers should raise instead could equally be raised in the case of the poppy farmers ; but then they have n’t yet organized a powerful lobby on the Hill . )
There are other dimensions of the crisis .
Since for most non-super - rich Americans , the bulk of their wealth is tied up in their homes , the mortgage crisis is the biggest imaginable blow to ordinary people in the United States .
And the crisis of health care costs ( which are now about 18 % of national income , due to double in the next 10 years ) has a direct implication for middle class well - being :
“ Using a conservative definition , 62.1 % of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical ; 92 % of these medical debtors had medical debts over $ 5000 , or 10 % of pretax family income .
The rest met criteria for medical bankruptcy because they had lost significant income due to illness or mortgaged a home to pay medical bills .
Most medical debtors were well educated , owned homes , and had middle - class occupations .
Three quarters had health insurance .
Using identical definitions in 2001 and 2007 , the share of bankruptcies attributable to medical problems rose by 49.6 % .
In logistic regression analysis controlling for demographic factors , the odds that a bankruptcy had a medical cause was 2.38 - fold higher in 2007 than in 2001 .
[ Himmelstein , D , E. , et al , “ Medical Bankruptcy in the United States , 2007 : Results of a National Study , American Journal of Medicine , May 2009 . ] ”
If this is the situation for middle class families who have health care , imagine the plight of the tens of millions who do n’t .
I cannot entirely explain why the American super - rich are so much more heartless and stupid than their counterparts in Europe .
In fact , they behave politically much more like Afghan and Pakistani big landlords , who pay their peasants a dollar a day and call in the army to put down any organized protests .
In part , they have been offered an irresistible temptation by the destruction of organized labor ; French workers would n’t put up with a tenth of the insults visited upon us by our overlords .
But it is a dead end , even for the uber - rich .
Healthy , educated workers will be key to American economic competition in the world in the coming century .
Our super - rich and our politicians are hollowing the country out with their ponzi schemes and their Sparta strategy of projecting military force even as the country ’s economic base in manufacturing and productivity sinks in comparison to rivals .
As we barbecue on imported grills and watch sports on our foreign - made LCD televisions and lament the bad economy , we should take a moment Monday to celebrate not just the individual worker but what is left of the American labor movement , since only if it is strengthened is our country likely to succeed in stepping back from the abyss .
Aristotle warned us that each form of legitimate government is subject to decay .
Aristocracies too easily become juntas .
And democracies too easily become demogoguery and mob rule .
The first eight years of the twenty - first century took us perilously close to both at once .
I celebrate today the organized workers , the ones who can push back against the crooks in pinstripe :
Bareheaded ,
Shoveling ,
Wrecking ,
Planning ,
Building , breaking , rebuilding ,
Under the smoke , dust all over his mouth , laughing with
white teeth ,
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young
man laughs ,
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has
never lost a battle ,
Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse .
and under his ribs the heart of the people ,

The establishment media and the Southern Poverty Law Center are again floating the talking point that militia groups and worried gun owners are growing in the United States and that this could portend a violent act of domestic terror , despite the fact that every major domestic terror attack in the 1990 ’s was carried out by the federal government itself , from Ruby Ridge , to Waco , to the Oklahoma City bombing .
“ Militia groups with gripes against the government are regrouping across the country and could grow rapidly , according to an organization that tracks such trends , ” reports the Associated Press .
“ The stress of a poor economy and a liberal administration led by a black president are among the causes for the recent rise , the report from the Southern Poverty Law Center says .
Conspiracy theories about a secret Mexican plan to reclaim the Southwest are also growing amid the public debate about illegal immigration . ”
The article cites people who own guns and implies that they are domestic terrorists or cop killers in the vein of Richard Poplawski , the Pittsburgh man who gunned down three officers during a domestic dispute earlier this year .
The report cites a Homeland Security “ threat projection ” which states “ White supremacists and militias are more violent and thus more likely to conduct mass - casualty attacks on the scale of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . ”
Of course , the irony behind all this is the fact that all the major acts of violence in connection with the militia movement during the 1990 ’s were committed by the government and federal agents .
It was an FBI sniper that killed Randy Weaver ’s son and also his wife as she was holding their 10 - month - old baby while running for cover during the Ruby Ridge standoff in 1992 .
It was the BATF that burned the Branch Davidian ranch to the ground , killing seventy - six people including more than 20 children and two pregnant women , during the Waco massacre in 1993 .
And it was high level FBI officials that groomed Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in the run up to the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in 1995 .
McVeigh ’s accomplice Terry Nichols ’ revelation that McVeigh was being steered by a high - level FBI official are supported by a plethora of evidence that proves McVeigh did not act alone and that authorities had prior warnings and were complicit in the bombing .
The Deseret Morning News named the FBI agent at Larry Potts , but that information was later sealed by the court .
The affidavit was filed in a lawsuit brought by attorney Jesse Trentadue , whose brother Kenneth was tortured and beaten to death in an Oklahoma City federal prison in 1995 .
Authorities claimed Trentadue had committed suicide but he was being held in a suicide proof cell at the time and autopsy photos of his body showed he had been shocked with a stun gun , bruised , burned , sliced and then hung .
[ efoods ]
Jesse Trentadue has amassed evidence that his brother was mistaken for one of Timothy McVeigh ’s alleged bombing accomplices and in attempting to get him to talk , federal agents went too far and then tried to instigate a cover - up of the murder .
During the process of his lawsuit , Trentadue was able to receive documents with names blacked out that show the FBI ’s OKC bombing informants were conducting armed robberies with Timothy McVeigh in order to fund the construction of the fertilizer bomb used in the attack on the federal building .
“ One of the foreign informants was actually the explosives instructor who taught him how to make the bomb , ” said Trentadue , confirming that Nichols told him the criminal activities were part of a process of creating a ledger or a storyboard to which the government ’s version of events could later be pinned to .
The documents also show that McVeigh called Elohim City two days before the bombing asking for help .
Four months before the bombing , an FBI informant told his superiors of the attack plan and said that the Alfred P. Murrah building had been scouted .
Just like 9/11 , the official story of the Oklahoma City Bombing , that McVeigh alone carried out the attack using a fertilizer truck bomb , is contradicted by a plethora of eyewitness account as well as physical and circumstantial evidence .
– In early April 1995 a Ryder truck identical to the one used in the bombing was filmed by a pilot during an overflight of of an area near Camp Gruber - Braggs , Oklahoma .
A June 17th , 1997 Washington
Post article authenticates the photos as being exactly what they appear to be , photos of a Ryder truck in a clandestine base at Camp Gruber - Braggs .
Why were the military in possession of a Ryder truck housed in a remote clandestine army base days before the Alfred P. Murrah bombing ?
– In a 1993 letter to his sister , McVeigh claimed that he was approached by military intelligence and had joined an “ elite squad of government paid assassins . ”
McVeigh often contradicted himself and changed his story on a whim to fit in with the latest government version of events .
Is the Camp Grafton footage evidence of McVeigh ’s enrollment in such a clandestine program ?
– Multiple reports of Arabs at the scene assisting McVeigh were ignored and surveillance tapes were withheld under national security .
The likely reason for this was the fact that Bush senior and Clinton were responsible for bringing in nearly 1,000 Iraqi soldiers captured by U.S. forces during the 1991 Persian Gulf War , some of whom were involved in the bombing .
– The FBI claimed McVeigh scouted the Alfred P. Murrah building weeks before the bombing and yet on the morning of the attack he stopped at a local gas station to ask directions , lending credibility to the new claims that he was being controlled by other conspirators and that the target of the bombing had been changed .
– Original reports of two explosions and several failed devices being defused by bomb squads were buried by the establishment as the official explanation that McVeigh acted alone was pushed .
Scientific analysis conducted by General Benton K. Partin revealed core columns were blown out from within the building and the extensive damage to the Alfred P. Murrah building was completely inconsistent with the explanation of a single and relatively weak fertilizer truck bomb .
– Many eyewitnesses reported that bomb squads in full reaction gear were seen around the building immediately before the blast .
Police officer Terence Yeakey , who helped save dozens of victims , was one such witness .
Yeakey compiled extensive files on his observations but was later found with his throat and wrists slashed having also been shot in the head after he had told friends he was being followed by authorities .
– Several individuals received prior warning that the bombing was about to take place .
Bruce Shaw , who rushed to the Murrah building to find his wife who was employed there with the Federal Credit Union , testified that an ATF agent told him that ATF staff had been warned on their pagers not to come to work that day .
– The aftermath of the bombing led to the passage of the Omnibus Crime Bill and the demonization of the ‘ Patriot Movement ’ , which was spreading like wildfire as opposition to federal government abuse grew following the events at Ruby Ridge and Waco .
The consequences of the Oklahoma City Bombing effectively dismantled the Patriot Movement before the turn of the century .
This is the true history of “ domestic terrorism ” and the militia movement .
In every instance , the terrorism has been carried out by the government and the militia movement or the patriot movement have either been the victims or the patsies .
This is key should the Obama administration attempt to stage another false flag and blame it on patriots in an attempt to neutralize the groundswell of grass roots outrage currently spreading like wildfire across the country in response to the march of big government and the loss of liberties .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States accounted for more than two - thirds of foreign weapons sales in 2008 , a year in which global sales were at a three - year low , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
A U.S. Air Force F - 15E Strike Eagle aircraft from the 492nd Fighter Squadron , Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Lakenheath , United Kingdom ( UK ) releases a GBU - 28 " Bunker Buster " 5,000 - pound Laser - Guided Bomb over the Utah Test and Training Range during a weapons evaluation test hosted by the 86th Fighter Weapons Squadron ( FWS ) from Eglin Air ForceBase , Florida , in this August 5 , 2003 photograph , obtained by Reuters on August 2 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Technical Sgt. Michael Ammons / USAF / Handout
Citing a congressional study released on Friday , the Times said the United States was involved in 68.4 percent of the global sales of arms .
U.S. weapons sales jumped nearly 50 percent in 2008 despite the global economic recession to $ 37.8 billion from $ 25.4 billion the year before .
The jump defied worldwide trends as global arms sales fell 7.6 percent to $ 55.2 billion in 2008 , the report said .
Global weapons agreements were at their lowest level since 2005 .
Italy , the second ranked country , amassed only $ 3.7 billion in arms sales , while Russia ranked third with sales falling to $ 3.5 billion in 2008 , down from $ 10.8 billion in 2007 .
The report attributed the increase in U.S. sales to “ major new orders from clients in the Near East and in Asia ” as well as to continued contracts for equipment and support services with globally based U.S. clients , the Times said .
The United States also led in arms sales to the developing world , signing 70.1 percent of these weapons agreements at a value of $ 29.6 billion in 2008 , the report said .
Such deals with the developing world included a $ 6.5 billion air defense system for the United Arab Emirates , a $ 2.1 billion jet fighter for Morocco and a $ 2 billion attack helicopter for Taiwan .
India , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , South Korea and Brazil also reached weapons deals with the United States , the Times said .
The report revealed the United Arab Emirates was the top buyer of arms in the developing world with $ 9.7 billion in arms purchases in 2008 .
Saudi Arabia ranked second with $ 8.7 billion in weapons agreements , and Morocco was third with $ 5.4 billion in deals .
In an attempt to convert The Pirate Bay into a site with a seal of approval from the entertainment industry , Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) said it will install a torrent removal / approval system .
However , the Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN said today that GGF has to come up with a better plan if they want to avoid legal issues .
When GGF has acquired The Pirate Bay they will give copyright holders the chance to remove infringing torrents , or approve them to be published on the site .
With this move they hope to avoid conflicts with the entertainment industry , but this might not go as smoothly as they might have hoped .
GGF ’s proposed notice and takedown is in fact not very different from those operated already by sites such as Mininova .
What they add is the option for copyright holders to keep their content on the site and get paid for it .
Plus , the users have to pay a monthly fee to use the site .
As one of our commenters put it yesterday : “ Cool , a paid private tracker without dedicated servers or seed - ratio enforcement , and with arbitrary censorship . ”
And the users of the site are not the only ones who are complaining .
In response to GGF ’s plans , Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN , that acts on behalf of the music , movie and gaming industries , issued a press release today in which they argue that the plans for the new Pirate Bay are not sufficient to please the copyright holders .
“ In the proposed system the right holder must detect illegal content on the website and remove it .
That is insufficient , ” BREIN director Tim Kuik says .
“ This sort of Notice and Take Down system works in case of incidental infringement but not for the structural infringement that happens at The Pirate Bay . ”
“ The point is that The Pirate Bay is responsible for what happens on the site .
They must keep preventive supervision and take care that no illegal torrents become available on the site .
The site provides access to content which to an important and even overwhelming extent is illegal , ” Kuik continued .
“ So they can not assume that there is permission and leave it up to the right holders to check continuously for infringements .
It is their site , their business and so their job to clean it up and keep it clean ” , Kuik added , demanding a stricter removal system .
BREIN ’s response makes sense from their perspective , since they have a pending court case in which they demand a proactive content removal system from the Dutch - based torrent site Mininova , who already have quite an elaborate content removal system in place .
GGF ’s CEO was contacted for a comment on BREIN ’s response , and we will add that to the article once it comes in .
It is clear though that not all copyright holders are wildly enthusiastic about the plans for the new Pirate Bay .
QUEBEC CITY , Canada —
Like a songbird calling another out , one male humpback whale may make another change his tune .
Studying humpbacks with methods adapted from bird research has uncovered the first known instances of what look like whales responding musically to each other ’s songs , says Danielle Cholewiak , a researcher for the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary based in Scituate , Massachusetts .
Cholewiak and colleagues detected melodic adjustments when a solo singer encountered another singer nearby and when researchers played their song remixes for whales .
Male whales may be using music to tell another male , “ Hey , I ’m talking to you , ” Cholewiak reported Oct. 14 at the Society of Marine Mammology ’s biennial conference .
Cholewiak “ showed short - term acoustic interactions between males — that was the new thing , ” said Adam S. Frankel of Marine Acoustics Inc. , an independent consulting firm in Arlington , Virginia .
Among humpback whales , only males boom out long strings of repeating phrases of hums and whups and chirps .
The sounds can make a boat vibrate , said Salvatore Cerchio of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City , who worked with Cholewiak on the new study .
Scientists use the word song to describe this patterned male vocalization , just as they do for elaborate bird serenades .
Male songbirds sing at each other to claim their territory or seduce females .
Though humpbacks do n’t defend territories , they certainly have rivalries .
Typically three to eight males surround a female and battle for the position closest to her .
“ These guys are streaming blood , ” Cerchio said .
“ The gentle giant is a myth . ”
But observations so far have n’t helped scientists understand whether humpbacks use songs the way birds do .
Tests have n’t shown male or female humpbacks consistently swimming toward or away from recorders playing songs .
And scientists have yet to see humpbacks mate .
So instead , Cholewiak took a different approach , boating around a breeding ground recording and analyzing songs .
“ I was drooling over what she was able to do , ” says Sharon Nieukirk of Oregon State University ’s Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport , Oregon .
Whales rarely cooperate with field biologists ’ experimental plans .
Cholewiak undertook the song analysis while at Cornell University , which has a renowned flock of birdsong researchers .
She adapted measurements used in bird studies to analyze the humpbacks ’ songs .
For example , the whales repeat a phrase of notes several times in one block , or “ theme , ” before moving on to another , and Cholewiak looked at how often the whales switched among these themes .
To record whales , Cholewiak spent four winters on the small island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo Archipelago off the Pacific coast of Mexico .
She dropped recorders weighted with sandbags into the ocean to eavesdrop on whales .
After months , she transmitted an acoustic signal that released the recorders so they popped to the surface .
Analyzing the recordings , Cholewiak could determine where the singers were and reconstruct their movements .
In the sea of sound recordings , she found 14 cases in which a male sang alone for at least 45 minutes and then continued for another 45 minutes after another male started singing .
Cholewiak noticed two changes in song when humpbacks sang together .
Overall , the first singers switched more often among various musical themes when a second singer hung around .
Also , the first males adjusted their songs so that the pair was more likely to sing the same theme simultaneously .
When males meet , Cholewiak concluded , songs change .
When she found a male singing by himself , she attempted a playback experiment .
She recorded his song and used a computer program to create a simplified version incorporating three of his themes .
Then she broadcast the version to him via speakers dangling below the boat .
Confronted with simplified recordings of their songs , males tended to make their singing more even .
This change meant that a male came closer to spending equal amounts of time singing each theme .
Researchers do n’t yet know what these changes mean , but the new work opens the way for questions about what messages whales may be communicating .
If humpback songs follow the pattern of birds , the messages could get pretty macho .
And females could be tuning in .
That the humpbacks appeared to respond to the playback at all was a pleasant surprise , Cholewiak says .
Song playbacks had fallen into disfavor after researchers found no pattern in the movements of listeners .
“ I was initially very reluctant to try it , ” she says .
Yet checking song characteristics instead of whale movements made all the difference .

Well , you were probably happy to learn Susan Burk – now President Obama ’s Special Representative for Nuclear NonProliferation and former head of President Clinton ’s delegation to the 1995 Review Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – told the folks at the Geneva Center for Security Policy last week , on the eve of the September meeting of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , that the world now has a real opportunity to " strengthen " the NPT - IAEA associated nuclear - weapons proliferation - prevention regime and that the Obama - Biden administration was determined to make an ambitious effort to do so .
According to Burk , there is a perception that , as result of certain actions in recent years , the NPT - IAEA regime is doomed to collapse and " that is a view that is wrong and must be refuted . "
It is more than a " perception , " Burk .
Most members of the IAEA General Conference , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Arab League , even the UN General Conference , itself , reckon that the Bush - Cheney - Bolton administration deliberately set out to emasculate the NPT - IAEA nuke proliferation - prevention regime .
And largely succeeded .
Never mind , that in " celebrating " the 40th anniversary of the NPT at last years Conference on Disarmament , Dubya ’s Representative Garold Larson began by claiming that :
" President Bush has reaffirmed the strong support of the United States for the NPT and our commitment to work diligently to strengthen it further . "
You see , arguably , the United States is the most flagrant violator of NPT commitments , frequently intervening to prevent other NPT - signatories from exercising their " inalienable rights , " affirmed under the NPT , to access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , " without discrimination . "
And , at this point , it ’s worth noting that the NPT – in and of itself – contains no enforcement mechanism , whatsoever .
( Bush - Cheney - Bolton wanted all the NPT - signatories to " elect " them NPT - enforcer .
And failing that , sign - on to their NPT - alternative , the Proliferation Security Initiative . )
So , NPT - drafters had taken advantage of the existing Safeguards System of the International Atomic Energy Agency , requiring that each no - nuke NPT - signatory enter into a bilateral " safeguards " agreement with the IAEA " with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons . "
The principal mission of the IAEA was – and still is – to facilitate " the contribution of atomic energy to peace , health and prosperity , throughout the world . "
But the IAEA – in carrying out its principal mission – " shall ensure , so far as it is able " that materials and activities under its " supervision " are not " diverted " so as " to further any military purpose . "
Whenever the IAEA ’s inspectors detect possible " diversion , " the Director - General reports that to the Board of Governors .
The Board can then decide – by a two - thirds majority – whether or not the " diversion " furthers " any military purpose " and should be reported to the UN Security Council for possible action .
In Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ’s opening statement to the 2000 NPT Review Conference held at UN Headquarters , she encouraged conferees to focus on three key issues : how the treaty is working to ( a ) prevent nuclear proliferation , ( b ) advance nuclear disarmament , and ( c ) enhance cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
The final report of the 2000 NPT RevCon proceeded to " affirm " :
" An unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear - weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states parties are committed under Article VI .
" The importance and urgency of signatures and ratifications , without delay and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional processes , to achieve the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test - Ban Treaty . "
Furthermore ;
" The [ 2000 ] Conference reaffirms that IAEA is the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring … compliance with its safeguards agreements … with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . …
It is the conviction of the [ 2000 ]
Conference that nothing should be done to undermine the authority of IAEA in this regard .
" The [ 2000 ] Conference notes the reaffirmation by the nuclear - weapon states of their commitment to the United Nations Security Council resolution 984 ( 1995 ) on security assurances for non-nuclear - weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons . "
How ’s that for strengthening the NPT ?
Of course , at the 2005 NPT RevCon , Bush - Cheney - Bolton prevented the 2000 NPT RevCon Final Report – including all the affirmations made within – from even being discussed , much less re-affirmed .
So , is Burk referring to the actions taken by the Bush - Cheney - Bolton administration to repeatedly violate the NPT , subvert the NPT and to corrupt the IAEA Board of Governors ?
Well , no .
Burk first cited action was the sale of what she called " sensitive nuclear technology " ( in reality , uranium - enrichment equipment , quite openly for sale , internationally , in 2000 ) by A. Q. Khan , Director of Pakistan ’s Khan Research Lab ( sales , perfectly legal under the NPT since Pakistan is not a signatory ) .
Next cited was North Korea ’s withdrawal ( perfectly legal , resulting from serious Bush - Cheney - Bolton threats and provocations ) from the NPT and subsequent development and testing of nuclear weapons ( all perfectly legal since North Korea is no longer a NPT - signatory or a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ) .
After that Burk cited " violations " of the NPT by NPT - signatory Iran and by North Korea ( while still a signatory ) .
Finally she cited NPT - signatory Syria ’s construction of " a covert nuclear reactor . "
Incredible !
Unbelievable !
Bizarre !
NPT - strengthener
Burk seems to be channeling NPT - emasculator Bonkers Bolton !
Not only have Iran , Syria and North Korea not violated the NPT , but none of the three has ever been determined by the IAEA Secretariat – despite exhaustive on - the - ground inspections – to have diverted NPT - proscribed materials to a military purpose .
Actually , if President Obama really wants to strengthen the NPT - IAEA regime , he ought to study the remarks made by Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi at the conclusion of that Bush - Cheney - Bolton sabotaged 2005 NPT RevCon .
Speaking , as it were , for most delegates to that disaster , including members of the Non-Aligned Movement , the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League , he said ;
" Following the major efforts by states parties to strengthen the treaty , the 2000 NPT Review Conference welcomed enthusiastically ‘ the unequivocal undertakings by the nuclear - weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament , to which all States Parties are committed under Article VI . ’
" Therefore , we propose that the Conference would establish an ad hoc committee to work on a draft legally binding instrument , on providing security assurances by the five nuclear - weapon states to non-nuclear - weapon states parties to the treaty , and to submit the draft of the legal instrument to the next review conference for its consideration and adoption . "
Why is what the Iranian delegate to the 2005 NPT RevCon said worth studying by Obama ?
Well , it is more than likely that the President of the 2010 NPT RevCon – to be selected by members of the NAM – will be the Iranian delegate .

Now a system that can draw on real - time video from traffic and surveillance cameras , or weather sensors , is set to change that .
It populates virtual towns with cars , people and realistic skies .
The video above shows how computer scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta put the idea into practice using video feeds from cameras around the city .
Their augmented version of Google Earth incorporates sports scenes , traffic flows , the march of pedestrians and weather .
Surveillance footage
The system looks out for moving objects in a video feed .
Anything moving along a street is classified as a car and replaced with a randomly chosen 3D car model .
Moving objects on sidewalks are replaced with human figures , which are animated with stock motion - capture data to make them walk .

Although surveillance cameras are used , no one ’s privacy is at stake because the models obscure identifying details such as a car ’s colour and licence plates , says Kihwan Kim , who led the research .
“ Every moving object is rendered symbolically , ” says Kim , who worked with colleagues Sang Min Oh and Jeonggyu Lee , and his doctoral supervisor Irfan Essa .
Sports action is recreated more directly , with less regard to privacy , using multiple camera views to create 3D models of the players .
Movement modelling
Because cameras do n’t cover every part of Atlanta ’s streets , the system has to fill in the gaps .
For example , the movement of cars is modelled to allow the virtual traffic to follow realistic paths once the real vehicles have left a camera ’s field of view .
The system involves a combination of computer vision , graphics and machine learning : a complex mix that means some situations are beyond the system for now , such as intersections with traffic lights , says Essa .
Adding action to virtual cities has a range of applications , say Essa and Kim .
For example , adding local weather data could provide a new way to check current conditions in a city .
Live action
Sports broadcasts could be merged with aerial maps to offer viewers a different experience of the game .
“ Imagine watching the Champions League soccer in Google Earth , ” says Kim .
Already , the interface allows users to “ shift ” a game to a stadium of their choice in another part of the world .
This upgrade to the usually static virtual globes is an impressive first step in allowing users to “ be ” somewhere else in real - time , says Ramesh Raskar , who leads the Camera Culture Group , at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Media Lab .
That experience could be further enhanced , he adds , thanks to cellphone cameras that can provide live audiovisual feeds proliferating , and small - scale devices that sense temperature and humidity being readily available .
Tapping into those sources of data could gradually transform the static virtual globes of today into a live feed of all the action on Earth .
The Georgia researchers ’ work will be presented at the International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality in Orlando , Florida , next month .
Giuliani received the same warning – victims and firefighters inside the tower did not

Friday , October 16 , 2009
During a recent interview on Danish television , the former Prime Minister of Denmark admitted that he received a message 5 to 10 minutes beforehand telling him that the south tower of the World Trade Center was going to collapse , prompting questions as to why the victims and rescue personnel inside the building did n’t get the same warning .
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told Denmark ’s largest broadcast television network , The Danish Broadcasting Corporation , that before he walked into his office to hold a security meeting on the morning of 9/11 , he got advance knowledge of the south tower ’s imminent collapse .
“ I am told that the first tower has completely collapsed ….
I received a message 5 - 10 minutes before it physically happened saying there was impending danger the tower would collapse so I knew disaster was coming ” said Rasmussen .
Rasmussen added that the imminent collapse of the building was confirmed as soon as he entered his office .
The Danish Prime Minister was not the only high - level official to receive advance knowledge that the World Trade Center was going to collapse .

During an interview on 9/11 with ABC News ’ Peter Jennings , then New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stated , “ I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barkley Street , which was right there with the Police Commissioner , the Fire Commissioner , the Head of Emergency Management , and we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse .
And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building , so we were trapped in the building for 10 , 15 minutes , and finally found an exit and got out , walked north , and took a lot of people with us . ”
In the eight years since the attacks , Giuliani has failed to explain how and why he received advance knowledge of this unprecedented event and why that same warning was not passed on to those inside the towers , who had been told to remain in their offices via loudspeaker after the first plane struck at 8:46 am .
“ Some people — it ’s not clear how many — returned to their offices after announcements on the building ’s emergency loudspeaker system said that it was safe to stay in the south tower , ” reported USA Today under the sub headline “ announcements caused deaths , ” adding that to some this sounded like an order to return , not an option .
The fact that officials knew the tower was about to collapse as much as 10 minutes before it fell was completely ignored by the 9/11 Commission .
If that same warning had been transmitted to those inside the towers who still had the capability to get out , hundreds of lives could have been saved .
Add to this the fact that the collapse of a steel building that was purposefully built to withstand the impact of a commercial airliner without collapsing through fire damage was a completely unprecedented event , and the notion that the 9/11 Commission would n’t even question these advance warnings sounds alarm bells and provides yet another reason why a new investigation is needed .

Comment on this article
A secret assessment of Iran 's nuclear weapons program , leaked to the press over the weekend , is offering a window on how far Iran has advanced toward building a nuclear bomb – and how much is still unknown .
The information is , in same cases , remarkably precise .
" Project 110 " is the code name of Iran 's secret effort to produce a nuclear warhead capable of fitting inside the nose cone of a Shahab 3 missile .
" Project 111 " is corresponding work aimed at reshaping the space inside the nose cone itself .
In addition , Iranian scientists already may have developed sophisticated bridgewire detonators and associated high - voltage firing systems necessary to initiate an implosion warhead 's explosion .
Yet the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report has been the subject of fierce debate within the IAEA itself .
US officials say they continue to stand by the conclusion of the US intelligence community that Iran halted nuclear weaponization work in 2003 .
The report appears to be based on data smuggled out of Iran by the wife of an Iranian who was recruited by German intelligence , according to the Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , which has posted excerpts from the report on its website .
The smuggled information contains large quantities of test data that would be difficult to fake convincingly , according to experts consulted by ISIS .
Still , the internal IAEA study that draws on this information has critics within the agency .
Some IAEA officials worry that it goes too far in concluding that Iran now has " sufficient information to be able to design and produce a workable implosion nuclear device " .
And some experts outside government caution that the parts of the report so far leaked to the public do n't necessarily support that conclusion .
The report does not have much in the way of timelines , for instance , meaning it is possible that Iran may have had a " Project 110 " at one time , which has since been halted , as the US holds .
The IAEA report " could be consistent " with US intelligence conclusions , says Greg Thielmann , a former US intelligence official .
It may also be important to remember that in general a nuclear weapons project and a successful nuclear weapons project are two different things .
Drawing up and producing a nuclear warhead capable of fitting on a missile is a difficult challenge .
" If it were easy , handing someone the design of a warhead would be tantamount to giving them a nuclear capability .
That 's not the case , " says Mr. Thielmann , who is now a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association .

Das ist eine Übersetzung einer Pressemitteilung von La Quadrature du Net zu den aktuellen Verhandlungen rund um den letzten umstrittenen Paragrafen im EU - Telekom - Paket .
Danke an Sebastian L. vom AK - Zensur für die Übersetzung .
Artikel 138 : Parlament von seinen Verhandlern betrogen .
Brüssel , 14 .
Oktober 2009 – die Verhandlungen über das Telekommunikationspaket haben eine für Bürgerrechte und Freiheiten besorgniserregende Wende genommen .
Die Delegation des Europäischen Parlaments wurde von seinen Verhandlern betrogen , angeführt von Catherine Trautmann ( Sozialisten und Demokraten , S&D , die SPD ist in dieser Gruppe Mitglied ) und Alejo Vidal - Quadras ( Europäische Volkspartei , EPP , u.a. CDU / CSU ) .
In totalem Widerspruch zu dem Mandat , das ihnen ihre Kollegen stellvertretend für das Parlament gegeben hatten , willigten die Verhandler unilateral ein , als Arbeitsgrundlage einen Vorschlag des EU - Ministerrates zu verwenden , der Bürgerrechte negiert .
Dieser gefährliche Vorschlag ist nun auf dem Weg , den Artikel 138 im Trautmann - Report zu ersetzen , für den sich das Parlament zweimal mit einer Mehrheit von 88 % ausgesprochen hat .
Am Mittwochmorgen hatte die Parlamentsdelegation ihren Verhandlern ein klares Mandat gegeben .
Wenige Stunden zuvor hatte der Verwaltungsdienst des Europäischen Parlaments eine zweifelhafte rechtliche Analyse herausgegeben , mit der ein Aufgeben des Artikel 138 , der Bürgerrechte sichert , gerechtfertigt wurde .
Dank einer beeindruckenden Mobilisierung von Bürgern in ganz Europa wurden MdEPs informiert , wie wichtig es ist , Bürgerrechte im Artikel 138 sicherzustellen .
Mehrere MdEPs stellten sich deshalb mit Nachdruck gegen die Analyse der Verwaltung , und die Delegation trug ihren Verhandlern auf , diese Analyse in den kommenden trilateralen Gesprächen nicht zu berücksichtigen .
Zuvor hatte die Delegation bereits beschlossen , dass die Verhandlungen alle drei Texte zur Grundlage haben sollten : Zusatz 138 , den Kompromiss des Rates aus zweiter Lesung und den neuen Vorschlag .
Ungeachtet dessen verletzten die Verhandler ihr Mandat in dem trilateralen Gespräch mit Vertretern des Rates und der Kommission , indem sie ihr Einverständnis gaben , dass der letzte Woche präsentierte falsche „ Kompromiss “ die Basis der folgenden Verhandlungen sein würde .
Damit gaben sie das Prinzip auf , dass Internetzugänge nur durch „ vorherigen Beschluss einer richterlichen Autorität “ eingeschränkt werden dürfen , und ignorierten damit den Kern dessen , was das Europäische Parlament zweimal mit einer Mehrheit von 88 % beschlossen hatte .
„ Diese Kehrtwende untergräbt die Macht des Parlaments in besorgniserregender Weise .
Sie zeigt einen schweren Mangel an Transparenz und demokratischer Glaubwürdigkeit in den europäischen Institutionen .
Die Verhandler unter der Führung von Catherine Trautmann haben sich entschieden , das Mandat zu ignorieren , das sie von der Parlamentsdelegation bekommen hatten , und eine Verhandlungsbasis zu akzeptieren , die Bürgerfreiheiten reduziert im Vergleich dem Niveau , das mit der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention etabliert wurde “ , analysiert Philippe Aigrain , Mitgründer der Bürgerlobbygruppe La Quadrature du Net .
Der neue Vorschlag könnte den Mitgliedsländern das Recht geben , in nationaler Internet - Gesetzgebung Ausnahmen vom Recht auf ordentliche Gerichtsverfahren vorzusehen .
Dadurch kommt der Vorschlag einer Legitimation von Orwellscher Überwachung im Netz gleich .
Selbst die Meinung des Verwaltungsdienstes , die darauf zugeschnitten scheint , um die Position des Rates während der Verhandlungen zu unterstützen , ergibt keine Rechtfertigung , diesen Text als neue Verhandlungsbasis zu nehmen .
Der originale Artikel 138 könnte falls nötig angepasst werden , um der Rechtsprechung des Europäischen Gerichtshofs zu entsprechen .
„ Als das Parlament den Artikel 138 zweimal angenommen hat , hatte es mutig ausgesprochen , dass ein freier Zugang zum Internet ein wesentlicher Teil von grundsätzlichen Freiheitsreichten ist und nicht ohne eine richterliche Entscheidung eingeschränkt werden kann .
Frau Trautmann und Herr Vidal - Quadras haben dem Rat der EU geholfen , Bürgerrechte willkürlich einzuschränken .
Dieses unerhörte Manöver könnte die Tür für „ three strikes “ - Regeln öffnen , für Inhaltsbeschränkungen und - filterungen im Internet in ganz Europa “ , schließt Jérémie Zimmermann , Mitgründer und Sprecher von La Quadrature .
The authorities say that at any one time 55 to 65 people were packed for a two - hour period into a 415 - square foot structure that was 53 inches high at the center and 30 inches high on the perimeter .
Mr. Ray ’s employees built the wood - frame lodge , which was wrapped in blankets and plastic tarps .
Hot rocks were brought into the lodge and doused with water .
Mr. Ray , who conducted the ceremony , left the area on Thursday after declining to give a statement to the police .
Sheriff Steve Waugh of Yavapai County said a death investigation would continue for several weeks .
Mr. Ray , the Angel Valley owners , Michael and Amayra Hamilton , and all the participants are part of the investigation , the sheriff said .
The results from autopsies that were conducted Friday have not been released and results from toxicology tests are not expected for several weeks .
Dr. Carroll , who is partly of Mescalero Apache descent , said the Angel Valley sweat lodge was the “ best example I have seen , sadly , in a long time of why it is extremely dangerous to conduct sweat lodge ceremonies without proper training . ”
Katherine Lash , a co-owner of Spiritquest Retreat in Sedona and a veteran of more than 100 sweat lodge ceremonies , said she had never heard of a sweat being conducted with as many people as were involved in the Angel Valley event .
“ In my experience it has been very rare to have more than 20 people , ” she said .
Limiting the number of people inside a sweat lodge is critical because the person leading the event is supposed to carefully monitor the mental and physical condition of each participant , experts said .
“ It ’s important to know who is responsible for your spiritual and physical safety in that lodge , ” said Vernon Foster , a member of the Klamath - Modoc tribe who regularly leads ceremonial sweat lodge events in central Arizona .
Mr. Foster said native people would use only natural materials in the construction of a sweat lodge .
“ We would never use plastic to cover our lodges , ” he said .
“ The lodge has to breathe , that steam has to go someplace . ”
On this date in 1974 , Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal , exiting in a spiral of crime , shame and paranoia that no subsequent disgraced president has even come close to matching .
Not that they have n't tried .
Jimmy Carter did his best to top Nixon by running his presidency straight into the ground .
But even with the energy crisis , record inflation , a skyrocketing national debt , and one very ugly sweater , Carter 's presidency lacked the " evil genius " quality that made Nixon 's disgrace so complete .
Carter simply went out by going on national TV , babbling something about " malaise , " and rubbing his own nipples in a shameful public display of auto - erotic masochism .
Of all disgraced presidents , only George W. Bush has even came close to topping Nixon 's mark for ' Worst Performance by a Commander - In - Chief . "
But Bush 's unique mixture of Machiavellianism and pure incompetence was so entrenched in his presidency that the public soon grew numb to it .
Katrina , WMD's , Abu Gharib , Scooter Libby , the Attorney General 's politicizing of the justice department -- any one of these would have been enough to put any other president right next to Nixon on the first plane out of town .
But with Bush , disgrace became the new normal .
And so it is unlikely that any future president will shock the world by doing anything .
A fact that will probably ensure that Richard Nixon 's mark for presidential humiliation will stand for centuries to come .

Let 's say you need to migrate existing code to take advantage of concurrent execution or scale on parallel hardware .
In that case , you 'll probably find yourself in one of these two common situations , which are actually more similar than different :
Migrating an application :
You 're an application developer , and you want to migrate your existing synchronous application to be able to benefit from concurrency .
Migrating a library or framework :
You 're a developer on a team that produces a library or framework used by other teams or external customers , and you want to let the library take advantage of concurrency on behalf of the application without requiring application code rewrites .
You have a mountain of opportunities and obstacles before you .
Where do you start ?
This column is about the most basic strategy to have in our toolchest .
It may seem so simple that it goes without saying , but there are a few important details to keep in mind to do it correctly .
Adding Concurrency : Target It , Localize It , Hide It
Perhaps the most effective way to deliver concurrency is to hide it inside " synchronous " APIs .
The key is to inject concurrency in a targeted , localized way inside key functions or methods , and let the application code that calls those methods stay happily sequential and blissfully unaware of the concurrency .
We want keep from exposing concurrency throughout the entire application , because the existing code is n't designed with concurrency and nondeterminism in mind .
The less code has to be upgraded to know about concurrency , the better .
First , identify the places where we can benefit from concurrency .
Here are two major kinds of situations to look for :
High - latency operations that can benefit from concurrent waiting .
Here we want to look for places where our lower - level or library code is doing synchronous work when the caller requests it .
If that work could be launched actively sooner ( even if sometimes speculatively ) , then the waiting can overlap with the caller 's execution , so that when the caller finally does ask for the result some or all of the work or waiting is already complete .
Compute - intensive operations that can benefit from parallel execution .
Here , we want to look for " hot spot " functions or methods where your application or library code is spending significant parts of computational effort .
Focus on the ones that are amenable to parallelization because we can readily break the work into chunks that can be performed in parallel .
Typically , we 're looking for natural parallelism that we can exploit in the algorithm ( e.g. , recursive divide - and - conquer where nonoverlapping subranges can be processed in parallel ) or in the data structures ( e.g. , nonoverlapping subtrees or subgraphs or hash table buckets can be processed in parallel ) .
These are our initial targets .
Of course , there 's overlap between these two categories , as we 'll see in the following examples .
Second , once we 've found that low - hanging fruit , add concurrency in those functions internally .
Note that word " internally " is essential -- we do n't want to expose the concurrency in the API we present to the caller .
Ideally , all concurrency is bounded within the scope of the function call , so that the caller calls our function and we launch the concurrency and join with it before returning , and the function just appears to execute faster .
Next best , concurrency is not bounded but is managed automatically , so that the caller calls our function and we launch the concurrency and return with something still running under the covers , and the caller does n't need to know because in some subsequent call into our code ( or upon a timeout , or some other automated way ) we join with the concurrent work .
With the concurrency thus compartmentalized , the calling code does n't have to know about the parallel work .
As far as the caller is concerned , our library method just happens to execute better or faster than before .
Cooking Help » Cheese How To Make Creamy Smooth Cheese Sauce << Views : 70643
Cheese sauce is a very versatile sauce that goes well on sandwiches , over vegetables , with pasta , with meat etc ...
If you succeed it will be creamy , flavorful and quite fantastic .
However , it can be a little tricky to create a perfect cheese sauce .
If you are not careful enough and you try to add the cheese too fast , or if your temperature is too high , you will end up with something looking far from smooth and creamy with a very grainy texture .
While it 's not difficult to create a cheese sauce , it does require some patience .
Once you 've mastered this technique you can apply it further and create fondues , soups etc ... since the principle is the same .

This cheese sauce is based on a Béchamel Sauce .
We utilize sharp cheddar cheese for this recipe , but any good , flavorful melting cheese can be used , or a combination of various cheeses .
Good choices include Emmental , Gouda and Monterey Jack .
Ingredients :
1 tablespoon of butter
1 tablespoon of flour
1 cup of milk
1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon of dry vermouth ( or white wine )
2 cups of sharp , grated cheddar cheese
salt , pepper Method : Start out with a saute pan on medium heat .
Melt the butter , then add the flour and whisk vigorously until a paste forms .
By letting a paste form and continuing to whisk the flour begins to cook and smell nutty .
Once this occurs , add the milk .
Once you begin to whisk the milk in the mixture will thicken fast .
It will be at its most thick when it is at or near a boil .
Add the lemon juice and lower the heat to low .
Take off the pan and start to add the cheese slowly .
First off , add about 2 tablespoons of cheese , then stir and whisk until it ’s absolutely incorporated – this may take a minute or two .
If your sauce gets a little too cold , place it back on low heat until it ’s warm again and stir continuously .
Once your cheese is completely integrated , add some more and do the same process over again .
It ’s very important that your sauce does n’t get too hot , and that you never stop stirring , Do n’t add too much cheese at once and always take your time so that each batch is completely melted before you add more cheese .
Once all the cheese is incorporated , add the vermouth and some salt and pepper .
Stir and possibly add some more liquid ( milk / vermouth / lemon juice depending on the taste ) if your sauce is too thick and taste with salt and pepper .
Serve immediately .
If you need to keep your sauce warm , then simply keep it on low heat and continue to stir .
Another alternative is to pour into a warm thermos and keep on hand .
Once the cheese sauce cools off , its consistency might become slightly grainier – so serve this sauce immediately while it ’s warm .
The government mandates a " Nutrition Facts " label on all packaged food sold in the US .
Since 1958 , it has required a " Monroney sticker " on the window of each new car .
Even home appliances come with a yellow " EnergyGuide " tag showing the device 's estimated yearly energy use and cost to operate .
But what about broadband ?
Truth in labeling
The New America Foundation 's Open Technology Institute suggested last week the government require a broadband disclosure sticker that would let consumers know what they are truly signing up for when they switch to a new Internet provider .
Here it is , in all of its black - and - white glory :
The suggested form is self - explanatory to geeks , though we do wonder whether requiring disclosure of the " maximum round - trip latency to border router " will do more than induce eye glaze among most broadband users .
According to New America , " Broadband subscribers are often frustrated that the actual performance of their internet access service regularly falls far below the advertised speeds .
Consumers set their expectations based on phrases like ' up to 16 Mbps , ' and are disappointed to learn that these quotes are worthless as assurances .
Currently , there is no lawful requirement for ISPs to reveal the contents of the broadband services they are providing ; customers might be harmed by the invalid or ambiguous languages . "
One of the key parts of FCC Chairman Julius Genchowski's proposed network neutrality rules is a disclosure requirement about traffic shaping and data limits , and ISPs have generally reacted quite positively to the idea of disclosure ( especially if it helps stave off actual regulation ) .
These disclosures are included on the sample form , and it's hard to imagine ISPs really putting up a fight against providing most of this information .
But they will certainly balk at listing minimum speeds and offering " service guarantees " to consumers .
New America 's plan would be for these minimums to " be supported by the ISP as guarantees in the delivery of broadband services , backed by technical support and service charge refunds or credits . "
In other words , even consumer broadband should get service level agreements ( SLAs ) , complete with refunds for downtime and slow speeds .
Will this ever become a law ?
Unlikely ( and that 's being polite ) , though ISPs do have some responsibility to provide the service they are actually advertising , as do all companies .
A look at the UK shows one way that the issue could be handled through disclosure , but without any sort of guarantees .
UK telecoms regulator Ofcom recently worked out a voluntary deal with the leading UK ISPs to adopt a " code of practice " relating to broadband speeds .
One of the key points in the code is providing information at the point of sale ; before a customer can sign up for DSL , he or she must be given a line speed estimate based on the customer 's address .
This number , which will always be below the advertised " up to " rate , is supposed to tell people what the maximum real top speed is at their particular location — though with further explanation of the factors that influence Internet access speeds .
" Explain to the consumer in a clear and meaningful way that the actual throughput speed that a consumer receives is likely to be lower than the estimated access line speed and headline speed , " says the code .
" ISPs should explain that the actual throughput speed experienced by a consumer will be influenced by a number of factors including the ISP ’s network capacity , the ISP ’s traffic shaping and management policy , the number of subscribers online at any one time , by time of day etc.
ISPs should also indicate to consumers the times of day when the network is likely to be most congested . "
Ofcom will evaluate these estimates for accuracy and step in it finds any problems .
In addition , ISPs must disclose up front " information relating to their respective policies on fair usage , traffic management , and traffic shaping . "
This information should list " the types of applications , services , and protocols that are affected " and provide " specific information on peak traffic periods . "
President Barack Obama draws fire from some conservatives who say he 's trying to indoctrinate school children to his beliefs .
Right blasts Obama speech to students
President Barack Obama 's plans for a televised back - to - school address to students next week are drawing fire from some conservatives , who say he 's just trying to indoctrinate them to his political beliefs .
In the Sept. 8 speech , Obama will challenge students to work hard , set goals for their education and take responsibility for their learning , Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a letter to principals .

The Education Department is encouraging teachers to create lesson plans around the speech , using materials provided on the department website that urge students to learn about Obama and other presidents .
" He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students , parents and educators to ensure that every child in every school receives the best education possible so they can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as American citizens , " Duncan said in a press release .
But already , some conservatives are crying foul .
The chairman of the Florida Republican Party is condemning Obama 's speech as an attempt to " indoctrinate America 's children to his socialist agenda . "
" The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the President justify his plans for government - run health care , banks , and automobile companies , increasing taxes on those who create jobs , and racking up more debt than any other President , is not only infuriating , but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans , while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power , " Chairman Jim Greer said in a press release .
Added conservative talk show host Tammy Bruce , in a Twitter feed : " Make September 8 Parentally Approved Skip Day .
You are your child 's moral tutor , not that shady lawyer from Chicago . "
And conservative author Michelle Malkin said the lesson plans have a " heavy activist bent . "
Texas school districts are discussing whether the president 's speech will be shown — some districts are leaving it up to individual teachers with an opt out for parents who do n't want their children to view the speech , according to the Houston Chronicle .
In his letter to principals , Duncan said viewing of the speech is encouraged , not mandatory .
It 's the first time a president has ever given a speech addressed directly to students .

Doug Johnson , vice president for risk management policy at the American Bankers Association , said that American banks were concerned about security but that there were no plans to move to chip - and - PIN cards .
“ There are a lot of hurdles , ” he said , “ both from a cost standpoint as well as a network standpoint , we need to broach . ”
It should be noted that chip - and - PIN cards are different from the radio frequency chip that some American credit cards now have , which allows customers to wave their card at a check - out scanner , instead of physically swiping it .
Visa ’s payWave cards and Expresspay cards from American Express are two examples .
But regardless of the technology used , merchants have a certain amount of control over what kinds of cards they accept .
Vélib ’ , for example , accepts American Express cards whether they have chip - and - PIN technology or not .
But it does n’t accept Visa or MasterCards unless they have the chip - and - PIN technology .
CREDIT card issuers acknowledge the problems but offer few solutions at the moment .
Randa N. Ghnaim , a spokeswoman for Visa , said the company was working with banks and merchants across Europe to ensure that they accept magnetic stripe cards in addition to chip- and - PINs .
“ We have heard of limited instances where merchants have refused to accept Visa magnetic stripe cards , but by and large , the majority of Visa cards are seamlessly accepted internationally , ” she said .
“ It ’s usually a lack of understanding that could lead to any issues rather than any issue related to the type of card a consumer may carry . ”
And at least one company , Travelex , the global payment services company , says it is working on a chip - and - PIN card for Americans that could be loaded with up to 6,000 euros or £ 4,500  about $ 9,000 or $ 7,400 at recent exchange rates .
But that solution is still at least a year away .
“ It ’s definitely something we ’ve been hearing more and more of , ” said Tracy Hammock , a senior vice president at Travelex .
Maybe .
Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Ninomiya started laying out their case for doom in the spring of 2008 .
It was later that fall , of course , after the CERN collider was turned on , that a connection between two magnets vaporized , shutting down the collider for more than a year .
Dr. Nielsen called that “ a funny thing that could make us to believe in the theory of ours . ”
He agreed that skepticism would be in order .
After all , most big science projects , including the Hubble Space Telescope , have gone through a period of seeming jinxed .
At CERN , the beat goes on : Last weekend the French police arrested a particle physicist who works on one of the collider experiments , on suspicion of conspiracy with a North African wing of Al Qaeda .
Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Ninomiya have proposed a kind of test : that CERN engage in a game of chance , a “ card - drawing ” exercise using perhaps a random - number generator , in order to discern bad luck from the future .
If the outcome was sufficiently unlikely , say drawing the one spade in a deck with 100 million hearts , the machine would either not run at all , or only at low energies unlikely to find the Higgs .
Sure , it ’s crazy , and CERN should not and is not about to mortgage its investment to a coin toss .
The theory was greeted on some blogs with comparisons to Harry Potter .
But craziness has a fine history in a physics that talks routinely about cats being dead and alive at the same time and about anti-gravity puffing out the universe .
As Niels Bohr , Dr. Nielsen ’s late countryman and one of the founders of quantum theory , once told a colleague : “ We are all agreed that your theory is crazy .
The question that divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct . ”
Dr. Nielsen is well - qualified in this tradition .
He is known in physics as one of the founders of string theory and a deep and original thinker , “ one of those extremely smart people that is willing to chase crazy ideas pretty far , ” in the words of Sean Carroll , a Caltech physicist and author of a coming book about time , “ From Eternity to Here . ”
Another of Dr. Nielsen ’s projects is an effort to show how the universe as we know it , with all its apparent regularity , could arise from pure randomness , a subject he calls “ random dynamics . ”

We had a recent reminder with Trojan : W32/ LongLeeb .
A .
On booting up Windows , the trojan displays the following message box :
The message is in Tagalog , and reads : " Long live Gloria , FG , Abalos , Chavit , Jok Jok , Gonzales , Jose Pidal ! " .
All the names mentioned refer to real Filipinos .
Again , on the Desktop , the following message is displayed :
Which basically says : " Again , Long live Philippines !
Long live Manny Pacquiao , too !!! "
The trojan itself is fairly cookie - cutter , but the messages are so reminiscent of early 90's viruses , it almost makes us feel … nostalgic .

Whenever I pick up a new RPG to learn , whether if it ’s for the purpose of running a game ( which is mostly the case ) , playing a character , or just for leisure reading , I ’ve been applying a system to trying to get all that information in my head in a neat , orderly fashion .
This is a step - by - step breakdown of how I study corebooks , and I hope that this will prove to be useful ( or at the very least , interesting ) for those who find themselves having to learn an entirely new game as of late .
Initial Read Through – I ’m sure everyone does this .
The first pass of reading of a book is surface level comprehension .
There ’s a lot of skimming , flipping back and forth , and skipping large tables and lists of minutiae .
At this point I try to familiarize myself with the book , where to find what , which chapters cover which sections , and take the time to admire the pretty pictures .
Setting –
The second pass of my read is devoted completely to the setting .
I try to forget that this is a game and go through the setting with a fine - toothed comb .
I try to figure what kind of games I can run with it , as well as what setting - specific plot hooks I can use if I end up playing .
Some games do n’t have this ( like the HERO System ) , so I skip this part if the game has no setting to speak of .
Character Creation – The third step isolates sections dedicated to Character Creation .
Confining myself to the Character Generation and skills / powers chapters , I try to build a character along with the read .
Nowadays I do this on notepad , typing salient stats and trying to assemble a character as I go along .
I do away with the temptation to “ optimize ” as I just want to be familiar with the process .
On a separate file , I keep track of important pages like Character Creation Summaries , or relevant tables .
Powers –
This is where the min-maxers like to play .
As a GM ( most of the time ) I have to be at least passingly familiar with the powers in the game .
Isolating specific powers that may unbalance the game , and mentally earmarking them as requiring more scrutiny ( nMage ’s Free Council Order Book ’s “ Gain Skill ” Rote , I ’m looking at you ) .
This will help me later on when the enterprising player finds and decides to see if they can exploit these powers .
Systems –
This is where I hunker down .
Moreso than in the powers section , I find that I need to put extra attention to understanding the basic , underlying system in any game I end up playing .
This is because the familiarity I have with the system is directly proportional to the speed of play .
The last thing I need is to put the game on hold due to yet another rules lookup .
Throughout the process , I try to keep notes .
These can be anything from minor rules that are hidden within the text of a given paragraph from a different section , to things like page numbers and little observations .
As a GM I also try to write down the plot hooks that interest me , so that I can go back to it and use them as fodder if I ever end up running a campaign .
For the past two years , Sudanese - born cellphone magnate Mo Ibrahim has given out $ 5 million prizes to outstanding African presidents who had served their country with good sense , and then had the good sense to step aside when their terms were over .
Today , Mr. Ibrahim – the founder of the cellphone giant Celtel – announced that his team was unable to agree on a candidate for the $ 5 million prize this year , leaving many Africa watchers wondering if he had simply run out of good choices .
For the record , Ibrahim told reporters that " the prize committee could not select a winner , " although there has been some speculation that Ibrahim simply lost too much money in the global meltdown last year to be handing out money now .
Yet several observers note that the lack of a prize can be seen as a rebuke to African leaders at a time when African democracy seems to be sliding backward .
" Generally what we 've observed in Africa , and this is worrying , is that leaders are massaging their constitutions and cooking elections in order to get elected , " says Guillaume Lacaille , a Central Africa expert for the Nairobi office of the International Crisis Group , a Brussels - based think tank .
" In general , a number of leaders have learned how to preserve the symbols of democracy without following the spirit of democracy , all in order to stay in power .
So in a sense , for Mo Ibrahim not to give a prize this year might be a cry for change .
We are seeing a trend that is very worrying . "
Signs of progress , too
To be sure , Africa in 2009 is not the famine - ridden , dictator - ruled continent of yesteryear .
Today there are far fewer conflicts in Africa than a decade ago , and far more Africans today have the chance to choose their leaders among a variety of credible parties .
Even Ibrahim 's own foundation has taken pains this year to point out the top countries in Africa that have shown the strongest signs of progress both in terms of democratic governance and the rule of law – with Southern Africa leading the way , with four of the top 10 performers .
" At a time when we are seeing overall progress in Africa , despite worrying setbacks in some countries , it is vital that African stakeholders and institutions come together to look for a way forward on the major challenges facing the African continent , " Ibrahim said in a statement in Dar - es - Salaam , Tanzania .
In an earlier interview with all Africa.com , a news website focusing on African affairs , Ibrahim told editors that some 26 of Africa 's 53 countries had made progress in governance in the past year .
His index measures 84 factors , including rule of law , human rights , and economic opportunity .
" The index does n't say Africa is bad , " Ibrahim says , referring to a report by his foundation that rates African nations in terms of governance .
" The index shows countries that are doing well ; it shows countries which are doing badly ... .
It is a mirror .
Some of us are good - looking ; we look beautiful in the mirror .
Some of us are ugly and are going to look ugly because the mirror will not lie .
Do n't blame the mirror ! "
See the index here .
Leaders who wo n't let go
Yet the past year has seen a worrisome trend nonetheless , a move of African leaders to change constitutions to extend their time in power , or to hand power down dynastically to members of their own family .
There have been military coups in Mauritius and Guinea , postelection violence and forced power - sharing governments in Kenya and Zimbabwe , and drastic constitutional changes in Uganda , Chad , and Cameroon to allow presidents to stay in power .
In short , there is still a long rocky road ahead for democratic reform in Africa .
" I commend Mo Ibrahim for acknowledging that in Africa , good governance is the exception , " says Marian Tupy , an Africa watcher for the Cato Institute in Washington .
" This notion of a ' new morning in Africa ' was greatly exaggerated , and now Africa 's lack of economic growth , and the lack of general security is catching up with African leaders .
Over the past four or five years , the growing global economy gave an incorrect perception , it camouflaged the problems . "
Investors often make a better judgment about how a country 's reforms are going than do diplomats , Mr. Tupy adds , noting " Now that the global economy is going through a rough patch , money is looking for safe predictable places to go where the rule of law is obeyed , and we are seeing the problems of African governance in full view . "
This NASA Marshall Space Flight Center image shows on - orbit functions for the reusable X - 37B space plane , now under the wing of the U.S. Air Force .
You would think that an unpiloted space plane built to rocket spaceward from Florida atop an Atlas booster , circle the planet for an extended time , then land on autopilot on a California runway would be big news .
But for the U.S. Air Force X - 37 B project ?
seemingly , mum ?s the word .
There is anair of vagueness regarding next year ? s
Atlas Evolved Expendable launch of the unpiloted , reusable military spaceplane .
The X - 37B will be cocooned within the Atlas rocket ?s launch shroud ?
aride that ?s far from cheap .
While thelaunch range approval is still forthcoming , SPACE.com has learned thatthe U.S. Air Force has the X - 37B manifested for an April 2010 liftoff .
As amini - space plane , this Boeing Phantom Works craft has been under developmentfor years .
Several agencies have been involved in the effort , NASA as well asthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) and various arms of the U.S. Air Force .
Over the lastfew months , I ?ve been in touch with DARPA , Boeing , the Pentagon , the U.S. AirForce Space Command , as well as NASA itself .
Either you get a ? not in ourportfolio ?
or are given a ? go to ?
pass to another agency .
Just a few weeks ago , Ieven commandeered a face - to - face ? no comment ?
from a top Pentagon official forAir Force space programs about X - 37B .
Tight - lippedfactor
Thetight - lipped factor surrounding the space plane , its mission , and who is incharge is curious .
Such a hush - hush factor seems to mimic in pattern that mysterycommunications spacecraft lofted last month aboard an Atlas 5 rocket , simplycalled PAN .
Its assignment and what agency owns it remains undisclosed .
But in abrief burst of light eking from the new era of government transparency , I didscore this comment from NASA .
While theprogram is now under the U.S. Air Force , NASA is looking forward to receivingdata from the advanced technology work .
? NASA has along history of involvement with the X - 37 program .
We continue to monitor andshare information on technology developments , ? said Gary Wentz , chief engineerScience and Missions Systems Office at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center .
?
Weare looking forward to a successful first flight and to receiving data fromsome advanced technologies of interest to us , such as thermal protectionsystems , guidance , navigation and control , and materials for autonomousre - entry and landing .?
The vehicleitself is about 29 feet long with a roughly 15 - foot wingspan and weighs in atover five tons at liftoff .?
Speeding down from space , the craft would likelymake use of Runway 12/30 ?
15,000 feet long by 200 feet wide ? at Vandenberg Air Force Base inCalifornia .
Vandenberg servesas an emergency space shuttle landing strip , as a second backup afterCalifornia ?s Edwards Air Force Base ?
which has also been noted as a landingspot for the X - 37B .
Once inorbit , what such a vehicle might enable depends on the eye of the beholder .
Intelligence gathering , kicking off small satellites , testing space gear arefeasible duties , as is developing reusable space vehicle technologies .
Spacetest platform
Just lastmonth , a U.S. Air Force fact sheet noted that the Air Force Rapid CapabilitiesOffice ( RCO ) , located in Washington , D.C. ? is working on the X - 37B Orbital TestVehicle to demonstrate a reliable , reusable , unmannedspace test platform for the United States Air Force .?
The missionof the RCO is to expedite development and fielding of select Department of Defense combat support and weapon systems by leveraging defense - wide technologydevelopment efforts and existing operational capabilities .
? Theproblem with it [ X37 - B ] is whether you see it as a weapons platform , ?
saidTheresa Hitchens , former head of the Center for Defense Information ?
sSpace Security Program , now Director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research ( UNIDIR ) in Geneva , Switzerland .
? It thenbecomes , if I am not mistaken , a Global Strike platform .
There are a lot of reasonsto be concerned about Global Strike as a concept , ?
Hitchens told SPACE.com .
The implications of the program as apossible space weapon are surely not lost on potential U.S. competitors , Hitchens said , who may well seeanti- satellites ( ASATs ) as a leveler .
? Would this thing be vulnerable toASATs ?
Yes , if it stayed on orbit any length of time , ?
Hitchens added .
?
While Isee value of such a platform as a pop-up reconnaissance or even communicationsplatform , if weaponized it becomes yet another reason for other nations to considerbuilding dangerous ASATs , ? she cautioned .
Anothermission question is , to what extent the X - 37B might play into the recentannouncement that NASA is partnering with the U.S. Air Force ResearchLaboratory to develop a technology roadmap for the commercial reusable launchvehicle , or RLV , industry .
All thatsaid , and after years in the making , the X - 37B is approaching its firstglobe - trotting , milestone making and historic flight ?
that much is known .

The Goldstone Report documents in detail Israel 's attacks on Palestinian life in Gaza .
If nothing is done , the indifference of the international community will also be evident , writes Curtis Doebbler *
October 3 , 2009
On 15 September 2009 , the Independent Fact Finding Mission on Palestine released its meticulously documented report concluding that Israel between December 2008 and January 2009 in Gaza had not only carried out atrocities but had done so intentionally .
The extent of the atrocities documented in the report , which was based on thousands of documents and interviews , according to the Fact Finding Mission were acts whose perpetrators should be investigated as responsible of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
In one of the best documented reports on Israeli violence against Palestinians to ever appear , the Fact Finding Mission concluded not only that in " all of the cases described ... both the act and the consequence were intended , " but also that action should be taken to prosecute the perpetrators .
The suggested action included referring the case to the International Criminal Court ; something that the Palestinian Authority requested after the ceasefire was announced in January 2009 .
It is a request that the prosecutor of the court has been considering for more than nine months without a reply .
It is disappointing that the report focuses on action that should be taken by Israel and the UN Security Council , both entities that have refused to act .
Within days of the report 's release , the Israeli government publicly dismissed any suggestion that it would act and the US ambassador to the UN in New York arrogantly rebuked the report 's explicit call for follow - up action .
The report documents , on the basis of eyewitness reports , photographs and interviews with Israelis , Palestinians and international aid workers , the allegations of international crimes that were committed in Gaza and brought to the Fact Finding Mission 's attention .
Much of the evidence was accumulated during site visits by the Fact Finding Mission to Gaza during the summer months , approximately six months after the cessation of major hostilities .
The 575 - page report , which contains an executive summary of 33 pages , begins by outlining its methodology that consisted of considering all relevant events since 19 June 2008 and the acts of all parties related to the treatment of the Palestinian people living in Gaza .
Not only are these events analysed , they were put in the broader context that included the blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza as well as inter-Palestinian violence .
The events occurring between 18 June 2008 and 27 December 2008 , for example , are thus outlined in detail in the report , as is the history of Israel 's policies and treatment of the Palestinian people .
The value of the contextual description is that it provides convincing evidence that Israel 's aggression against the people of Gaza was not an isolated instance , but part of a longstanding oppression of the Palestinian people .
The description of facts is not always complete .
Although an obvious effort was made to hear both the Palestinian and Israeli side of all events , equally apparent is the Fact Finding Mission 's concern with giving too much attention to the views of the Hamas government , which is the entity perhaps most affected by these events , after the civilian victims .
For example , while the report mentions that " Hamas forces and armed groups had seized all Palestinian Authority security installations and government buildings in the Gaza Strip " in June 2007 , no mention is made of the widely known efforts of Palestinian strongman Mohamed Dahlan , acting ostensibly with the support of Fatah authorities who had lost the 2006 election , to oust elected Hamas government officials in Gaza .
The lack of views by Hamas officials is perhaps part of the Commission 's effort to mitigate the political controversy that it was aware would inevitably surround any report criticising Israel .
The most technical part of the report is the outline of the international law that applies .
While the discussion of the law has been noticeably abbreviated , it makes some important points that are usually not included in UN reports on Palestine .
For example , the discussion begins with an important , albeit brief , statement about the applicability of the right to self - determination of the Palestinian people .
In one of its most important and succinct statements of the law , the Fact Finding Mission concludes that " [t ] he right to self - determination has an erga omnes character whereby all States have the duty to promote its realisation ... [ moreover ] ... peoples who resist forcible action depriving them of their right to self - determination have the right to seek and receive support from third parties . "
Critics of the report have cited the reports ' statement that " [ t ] hose who take action amounting to military force must comply with IHL [ international humanitarian law or the laws of war ] " as implicitly supporting Palestinian violence against Israel .
Such criticism misunderstands the nature of the law , which applies without prejudice to whether the initiation of the use of force is legal or illegal .
Moreover , the consensus of the majority of states reflected in UN resolutions acknowledges the right of people striving for their self - determination against an oppressive foreign occupying power to use force .
The report , in sections five through 29 , details the evidence that exists of violations of these laws in Gaza .
These details include evidence that the blockade imposed on Gaza by Israel is illegal and that Israel 's " military hostilities were a culmination of the long process of economic and political isolation imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel . "
In its main findings on Israel 's use of force in Gaza , the report details Israel 's deliberate attacks on civilians , on humanitarian aid workers , on government buildings and police as well as Israel 's use of prohibited weapons and the use of civilians as human shields , their arbitrary detention and their inhumane treatment .
In one section of the report , the Fact Finding Mission details the accumulative effect of Israel 's attacks on " the foundations of civilian life in Gaza " which include the " destruction of industrial infrastructure , food production , water installations , sewage treatment plants and housing " .
In each case the Fact Finding Mission report painstakingly describes the situation , the evidence or facts , and its legal perspective on the facts .
While the overwhelming focus of the report was on Israel 's more numerous and more deadly acts of aggression , the report also criticised non- state actors such as the Hamas authorities in Gaza and Palestinian authorities more generally for carrying out actions whose perpetrators should also be investigated for having committed international crimes .
Hamas is criticised for inter- Palestinian violence as well as indiscriminate attacks on Israel through the firing of rockets and mortars .
The Palestinian authorities based in Ramallah and exercising some control over the occupied West Bank are criticised for their detention and harassment of Hamas affiliated officials in the West Bank .
The conclusions of the report make it clear that follow - up action is expected and necessary .
The report suggests first giving Israel and the Palestinians the opportunity to search for , take into custody , and prosecute the perpetrators of international crimes .
If this fails , the report then suggests that the UN Security Council should act .
And finally if this also fails the report suggests that the UN General Assembly can act .
The report also includes copies of the correspondence between the head of the Fact Finding Mission , Judge Richard Goldstone , and the Israeli authorities that sheds light both on the painstaking effort that Israel made to block this UN mandated mission and the effort that the Fact Finding Mission made to ensure that only reliably documented allegations are mentioned in its report .
While the report provides incontrovertible evidence of Israel 's illegal treatment of the Palestinian people , it also raises some uncomfortable questions .
Most knowledgeable observers of Palestine -- surely all 15 members of the UN Security Council -- know that Israel has been mistreating Palestinians for the best part of a century .
Why has no meaningful action been taken to protect Palestinians ?
Despite the well - documented evidence of serious international crimes committed on a large scale by Israeli forces it is unlikely that a Security deadlocked for the better part of a century will be convinced to act now .
Given this situation , why does the report focus its call for action on the Israeli government and the UN Security Council ?
Both have made it clear that they will not act , both before and after the report appeared .
Why was n't more attention given to the role of the world 's more legitimate international body , the UN General Assembly ?
Not only was this body the most proactive body in reacting when the fighting broke out in Gaza in late December , but it has the most explicit mandate for taking action .
According to Article 22 of the Charter of the United Nations the General Assembly has an explicit mandate to create bodies , including international courts of tribunals , to follow - up the report 's recommendations on prosecutorial action .
Unfortunately , the report merely gives a very weak nod to this power by mentioning the " Uniting for Peace " process , which means little to most people .
In fact the mention of this extraordinary procedure by which the General Assembly may act when the Security Council does not act on a matter related to the maintenance of peace and security is misplaced .
This matter is already one on which the General Assembly may act .
The Human Rights Council , which is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly and under whose auspices the report was produced , has already acted on this matter of human rights and humanitarian law .
The General Assembly needs no additional arguments or mandate to follow - up on the action of one of its subsidiary bodies .
There is no obstacle to the General Assembly creating a special international tribunal with judges to deal with the violations of international law that took place in Gaza .
The Assembly 's authority to do so is clearer than that of the Security Council that has repeatedly created such bodies .
Perhaps the most difficult and still unanswered questions are those created by Palestinian leaders and diplomats .
There is almost complete silence in New York and Geneva , and what is being said is perhaps even more frightening .
At the UN in Geneva , where the report will be discussed this week in the UN Human Rights Committee , a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly , the Palestinian Permanent Mission appears to be trying to limit the impact of the report .
The Palestinians began discussing the resolution on the report not with Arab or even African delegates , who are their natural and longstanding allies , but with the United States and the Europeans .
The situation has reached such absurd proportions that Arab diplomats talk about the possibility of voting against a Palestinian proposed resolution for the sake of the Palestinian people .
At the UN in New York , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas played down the report , instead relying on the mediation of the United States government , whose weapons and financing Israel used to carry out its mind bogglingly inhumane aggression against the Palestinian people of Gaza .
Instead of confronting the United States , Abbas has been more concerned to cosy up with them , expressing his humble appreciation for the new administration 's willingness to speak with him and the Israeli leader , who not only supported the slaughter in Gaza but who has threatened to repeat it again and again if need be .
Is negotiating a surrounded Palestinian state on a fraction of the territory decreed by the UN in the same resolutions that created Israel the best way to achieve justice and to represent the Palestinian people ?
Unfortunately , the position of the Palestinian authorities based in Ramallah and the diplomats who represent these authorities is not new .
In January 2009 , as the aggression against Gaza took place , the same diplomas in New York tried to block the General Assembly from taking timely and strong action to stop the slaughter in Gaza .
In the end , the report of the UN's Independent Fact Finding Mission may have exposed , even more than the atrocities committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza , indifference towards Palestinian life .

LAKE FOREST , Ill . --
Finally healthy after two years , Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher launched his regular season by making a run at Aaron Rodgers , lowering his shoulder and plowing over the Packers quarterback in the first quarter .
His 10th season was off to a good start .
And then , it was over .
Chicago 's star linebacker underwent surgery Monday to repair a dislocated right wrist , was put on injured reserve and will not be back this season , a major blow for a team with high expectations .
There was no immediate word from Urlacher other than a text message to the Chicago Tribune that said simply : " season is over . "
But coach Lovie Smith said Urlacher clearly was disappointed .
" He had put himself in position to have an outstanding year , " Smith said .
" He was playing well in the game before he went down with the injury .
Even after the injury to his hand , the competitor in him wanted to continue to play .
It 's a tough break .
There 's no way around it , but he 's been injured before and he 's come back before . "
During Monday 's procedure , Urlacher had multiple pins inserted in the wrist , a source told ESPN's Chris Mortensen .
Urlacher will wear a cast for 11 to 12 weeks and then undergo a month of rehabilitation .
The injury occurred in the first quarter of Sunday night 's 21 - 15 loss at Green Bay , though it was not clear when .
Urlacher briefly shook his wrist after tackling Packers running back Ryan Grant late in the period , though Smith said he was n't sure when the injury happened .
Urlacher played in the second quarter , but left on the Packers ' first drive of the second half .
" Talk about a guy that 's a great leader , " said Hunter Hillenmeyer , who replaced Urlacher at middle linebacker .
" First , he plays an entire half of football with a dislocated wrist .
I do n't think there 's many people who can do something like that . "
The arrival of Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler sent expectations in Chicago soaring in the offseason , though he threw four interceptions and looked average at best in the loss .
Now the Bears are without the longtime face of the franchise and a stalwart defender in a division with top - tier running backs in Grant and Vikings star Adrian Peterson along with elite quarterbacks such as Rodgers and Minnesota 's Brett Favre .
The 31 - year - old Urlacher , a six - time Pro Bowler , appeared to be in better shape after being limited by a bad back and neck the past two years .
Urlacher had started 49 consecutive games .
He missed seven games in 2004 , and the Bears went 0 - 7 in those contests .
He looked like his old self midway through the first quarter when he flattened Rodgers just as the quarterback released a pass downfield that a leaping Donald Driver juggled and dropped .
Later , with about four minutes left in the quarter , Urlacher took down Grant for one of his three tackles and Packers guard Josh Sitton landed on him .
Urlacher got up and briefly shook his wrist before walking away with what looked like nothing more than a minor injury .
" No one knew the severity of it , " linebacker Lance Briggs said .
" We knew that it had to be checked out .
Now we know . "
Smith dismissed the idea of moving Briggs to the middle , meaning the job is Hillenmeyer 's for now .
He also did not rule out bringing in help from the outside .
The Bears had been in contact with free - agent linebacker Derrick Brooks , a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter on Monday , but they informed the former NFL Defensive Player of the Year that they intend to go with their younger players for now .
" They just want to take more time with their decision , " Brooks said .
Brooks , who was cut by Tampa Bay in February , has a good relationship with Smith dating to his days on the Buccaneers ' staff .
Zach Thomas , who was cut by Kansas City earlier this month , might also be a possibility in the future .
Neither of those two veterans would appear to have much " special teams value , " something Smith said the Bears would be seeking in a new linebacker .
To fill that void , the Bears agreed to terms on a one - year contract with former Jaguars linebacker Tim Shaw on Tuesday .
Shaw appeared in three games last season and 14 in 2007 .
He has 17 special teams tackles in his career .
Chicago could also be short - handed in other areas , too , with Pittsburgh coming to town on Sunday .
Tight end Desmond Clark took a hard hit after making a catch in the third quarter and left the game with a rib injury .
He had little to say Monday , other than this : " Report that to the fans -- I'm OK .
Just got a little shot to the back ; I 'm all right . "
Smith simply said Clark has a rib injury that will be evaluated .
Left guard Frank Omiyale also went down for several minutes moments after spraining his ankle and limping off the field .
Linebacker Pisa Tinoisamoa and cornerback Trumaine McBride also suffered sprained knees .
The Chicago Tribune reported that Tinoisamoa wore a heavy brace after Sunday 's game but is day to day .
The biggest hit for a defense looking to regain its dominant form after two mediocre seasons was losing Urlacher , though .
" It 's disheartening , but we 've still got a job to do , " defensive tackle Anthony Adams said .
Information from ESPN.com NFC North blogger Kevin Seifert , ESPNChicago.com 's Jeff Dickerson and The Associated Press was used in this report .

ISRAEL is reeling from the accusations of a UN fact - finding mission that it deliberately sowed death and destruction among civilians in the Gaza Strip during a three - week military operation ending in January .
The mission was chaired by a respected South African judge , Richard Goldstone and published its report on Tuesday September 15th .
It concludes that “ While the Israeli government has sought to portray its operation as essentially a response to rocket attacks in exercise of its right to self - defence , the Mission considers the plan to have been directed , at least in part , at a different target : the people of Gaza as a whole . ”
The purpose , the mission added , was “ punishing the Gaza population for its resilience and for its apparent support for Hamas ” .
It held that Israel 's partial blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas took power there three - and - a - half years ago amounted to collective punishment and violated the Geneva Conventions .
The mission recommends international legal action not only against Israel , but also against Hamas , for war crimes and possible crimes against humanity .
It has recommended that the findings are handed to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in The Hague and also urged the UN Security Council and , separately , the General Assembly , to ensure that those responsible for the crimes are brought to justice .
In particular the mission would like to see the Security Council set up a committee of experts to monitor whether Israel and Hamas conducts domestic investigations and , if so , to see how thorough these are .
It also urges that , if the experts are not satisfied , the Security Council should refer the matter to the ICC prosecutor .
The death toll in Israel 's “ Operation Cast Lead ” , between December 27th and January 18th , is put at around 1,400 by Palestinian sources and non-governmental aid agencies .
Israel estimates the toll at 1,166 .
Three Israeli civilians were killed by rocket fire into Israel , and ten soldiers were killed during the fighting , four of them by “ friendly fire ” .
“ The data provided by non-governmental sources with regard to the percentage of civilians among those killed are generally consistent and raise very serious concerns with regard to the way Israel conducted the military operations , ” the Goldstone mission concludes .
It accuses Israel of “ indiscriminate attacks ” that resulted in civilian deaths and injuries , and also , on several occasions , of deliberately targeting civilians .
It also concluded , among other findings , that 240 Palestinian policemen were killed unlawfully , 99 of them in bombings on the first day of the operation , even though some of them may have been Hamas fighters .
The bombing of public buildings , including the parliament and the main prison , was found to be unlawful .
Israel 's warnings to civilians to flee targeted areas were described as inadequate .
The report notes that the mission found no evidence of the Palestinians firing from mosques , hospitals or UN facilities , although “ this might have occurred ” .
The mission also concludes that “ It may be that the Palestinian combatants did not at all times adequately distinguish themselves from the civilian population . ”
In addition it concluded that repression within Israel fosters “ a political climate in which dissent with the government and its actions in the Occupied Territories is not tolerated . ”
Israeli officials argue that the last two points are so patently biased that they ought to reflect on the credibility of the whole 575 - page report .
Israel refused to co-operate with the mission ( although individual Israelis did testify ) , noting that the UN Human Rights Council , which established it , has a long record of egregious bias against the Jewish state .
In correspondence with Justice Goldstone , Israel noted pointedly that other eminent jurists had declined to serve on the mission because of its provenance .
Israel 's government argues , too , that one of the mission 's four members , Professor Christine Chinkin of the London School of Economics , had expressed “ prejudgmental assertions , including that ‘ the rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas do not amount to an armed attack entitling Israel to rely on self - defence ' . ”
The other two mission members are Hina Jilani , a Pakistani jurist and Desmond Travers , a retired Irish army officer .
Justice Goldstone , who was a prosecutor at the international criminal tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda , insists that his mission had “ unbiased and even - handed terms of reference ” and functioned as a “ completely independent body . ”
Israeli officials wondered privately yesterday whether he had set the tone of the report , or was swept along by other mission members and staffers .
In its formal reaction , Israel declares itself “ appalled ” at the report .
Officials say privately they had expected a tough document accusing the army of a disproportionate response to the years of incessant but largely ineffective firing of rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel .
They were shocked , they said , that the mission accused Israel of deliberately targeting the Palestinian civilian population .
The prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has given orders for a diplomatic campaign to discredit the report and counter the mission 's effort to have Israelis charged with war crimes .
The Israelis dismiss the mission 's ostensible evenhandedness in recommending that the Palestinians , too , be held to account for firing rockets at Israeli civilians and for acts of brutality and repression against their own people .
In the prevailing atmosphere at the UN , they say , this will remain a dead letter while the recommendations against Israel will be assiduously followed up .

Little wonder , for today there are many people who would wish him harm .
Simon is leader of the English Defence League , the organisation which has organised a string of anti-Muslim marches , culminating yesterday in the largest so far , in Manchester , at which 40 people were arrested .
The Sunday Herald met him at a Bolton pub before he and other league members set off for yesterday ’s protest .
He spelled out in detail the views which have brought thousands of anti-far right protesters out on the streets to show their opposition to his organisation .
“ Extremists are inciting and recruiting terrorists to fight against this country and we ’ve had enough , ” said Simon , who claims to be the voice of an increasingly angry British working class which has fundamentalist Islam in its sights .
“ We want to wake up the government , who are treating Muslims like a master race and bending over backwards to appease them . ”
Scotland will see for itself the Defence League tactics when it stages a protest in Glasgow at the beginning of November .
It will be bolstered by activists from across England , who will travel to Scotland to show support .
The organisation ’s Scottish leader , nicknamed Don and refusing to give his full identity , gave his first newspaper interview to the Sunday Herald .
Even though Muslim immigrants in Scotland are widely regarded to have integrated well , Don sees only parallel societies .
“ We are against fragmented communities living side by side , divided by hatred and distrust .
It ’s time to take action because there will be bloodshed if we do nothing , ” he said .
These are familiar and discredited arguments to those who have mounted protests against the Defence League , which they brand fascist .
The organisation has been called many things : racist by its opponents , and MI5 collaborators by the party you would imagine to be closest to its own views – the British National Party .
The BNP reportedly believes the Defence League was set up by the state to encourage violence and whip up anti-right wing feelings .
Around 2000 people from around the country converged in Manchester yesterday .
Police said there were angry scenes and some people were detained on suspicion of racially - aggravated offences or for possession of weapons or drugs .
Police largely succeeded in keeping the two sides apart , bisecting Piccadilly Gardens , a square at the centre of Manchester , with a luminous line of reflective jackets .
Penned into the square , the two sides were divided by only a few yards , with mostly white - faced , short - haired football casuals from the Defence League and its regional allies facing off against a cosmopolitan , youthful mass of anti-fascists .
“ We will protest outside every council building , police station and school that tries to erode the voice of the working class majority in Britain , ” said Simon .
“ This is only the beginning of our struggle .
The Scottish Defence League has already been set up , but this will sweep Europe too .
We ’ve been in contact with groups from several major European cities who have the same goals . ”
The first Defence League was formed in Luton after a controversial protest by Muslims at a homecoming parade for soldiers returning from Iraq .
The United People of Luton , which became the English Defence League , converged with a Welsh group called Casuals United .
Using Facebook , the two groups found other like - minded people and held protests in Harrow and Birmingham , which both ended in violence .
The Scottish Defence League claims to have 180 members and says a further 500 people have contacted the group to express an interest in joining .
The defence leagues are keen to distance themselves from the BNP , which they depict as white only .
The leagues say they have black and even Sikh members , although the Sunday Herald saw just two Afro- Caribbean faces joining the league at Manchester yesterday .
The anti-league protests yesterday were organised by Unite Against Fascism , whose joint national secretary Weyman Bennett said : ‘‘ These people are street soldiers for the BNP , drawn from groups of football hooligans .
The BNP have a voice and an electoral presence , but no storm - troopers , so the defence leagues serve that role .
“ We need to recognise that the recession will throw up fascist groups just like the 1930s , but instead of anti-Semitism , these new groups promote Islamophobia .
We can not let history repeat itself .
‘‘ In the 1930s fascists marched against Jewish people and then marched against society .
These defence leagues will march against Islam and then turn on us all . ”
MANILA ( Reuters ) - The Philippines placed soldiers and civilian emergency teams on the main island of Luzon on alert on Thursday as a powerful typhoon moved closer , less than a week after an earlier storm killed 277 people in and around Manila .
Parma , a category 4 typhoon , packing winds of 175 kph ( 108 mph ) , was 520 km ( 320 miles ) east of the central Philippine island of Samar on Thursday , said chief weather forecaster Nathaniel Cruz .
It was expected to make landfall near northeastern Quirino and Isabela provinces on Luzon by Saturday unless it changed direction .
“ It ’s gathering strength into a category 5 typhoon , ” Cruz told Reuters , adding it could be the one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country since November 2006 when Typhoon Durian left death and destruction in the central Philippines .
“ By Saturday afternoon , Parma could be packing center winds of more than 200 kph and could be weakened once it slams into the Cordillera mountain region in the north . ”
Gilberto Teodoro , head of the defense and disaster agencies , ordered troops to evacuate coastal and low - lying areas as well as landslide - prone areas in the northern Philippines .
Teodoro has also ordered civilian agencies to stockpile food , water , medicine , fuel and other relief supplies as relief work continued five days after Typhoon Ketsana dumped record - high rain that submerged 80 percent of the capital region and nearby areas .
Ketsana killed 277 people and left tens of thousands homeless .
It also damaged or destroyed more than $ 100 million in crops , infrastructure and property .
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates will share words of wisdom on Sept. 22 at the opening ceremony for a computer science center bearing his name at Carnegie Mellon University , the home of the nation 's first such department in 1965 .
The Gates Center for Computer Science , which will be home to undergraduate computer science programs , is funded in large part through a $ 20 million gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
The Pittsburgh - based center will be part of a complex also including the new Hillman Center for Future - Generation Technologies , which is also being dedicated this month .
The buildings , which include 217,000 square feet of interior space , are built to the latest energy efficiency standards and will serve as central buildings on the 140 - acre campus .
A footbridge on the fifth floor of the Gates Center will be dedicated in the fall to Randy Pausch , the late CMU computer science professor who gained worldwide notoriety through his inspiring " Last Lecture . "
Gates , of course , is famed for having dropped out of Harvard University , though he did pick up an honorary degree and deliver a commencement speech at the Cambridge , Mass . , institution in 2007 .
Earlier this summer , Gates made headlines for his generosity by joining with Microsoft Research on a new website featuring the physics lectures of Richard Feynman , as presented at Cornell University in 1964 .
Here at Disney Parks , the three - dimensional stars of our attractions are animated .
It ’s been that way since shortly after Audio - Animatronics development began decades ago .
But our latest innovation takes it to another level .
We ’ve unveiled the first - ever Disney figure that can hear , see and sense whether or not you ’re in the room .
Yes , “ Otto ” is interactive .
The figure can sense if you ’re happy , hold conversations and react , according to Imagineer Scott Trowbridge .
Scott Brinegar / @ 2009 Disney
We first mentioned the technology , Autonomatronics technology , via Twitter ( @DisneyParks ) when Otto was displayed in our Disney Parks and Resorts Pavilion during the D23 Expo .
Now , we have details .
Autonomatronics technology is different from Audio - Animatronics technology .
Audio- Animatronics technology repeats a pre-programmed show over and over again .
Autonomatronics technology is driven by sophisticated cameras and sensors giving
Otto the ability to make choices about what to say and do .
Otto can also detect a number of things about a crowd , including how many people are in attendance .
And Otto knows if you ’re smiling too .
But your smile will be obvious if you ’re a lover of things high - tech .
Walt Disney Imagineers are currently working on places where we might put the technology into our Parks and Resorts around the world so you can experience yourself .
And of course , we ’ll be bringing you more Autonomatronics technology updates on the blog in the future .
Let us know what you think .

COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON
Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics here .
And catch up on interesting news with USA TODAY's
Cathy Lynn Grossman .
THINKING ABOUT GOD THINKING ABOUT GOD About 15 % of Americans say they have no religious identity -- but they do n't all believe the same things .
Their responses when asked about the existence of God :
Men : Women : Source : American Religious Identification Survey of 1,106 people who do n't identify with any religion Americans who do n't identify with any religion are now 15 % of the USA , but trends in a new study shows they could one day surpass the nation 's largest denominations — including Catholics , now 24 % of the nation .
American Nones : Profile of the No Religion Population , to be released today by Trinity College , finds this faith - free group already includes nearly 19 % of U.S. men and 12 % of women .
Of these , 35 % say they were Catholic at age 12 .
FAITH & REASON : Were Founding Fathers ' Nones ? '
" Will a day come when the Nones are on top ?
We can't predict for sure , " says lead researcher Barry Kosmin .
But if Nones , now 22 % of all adults ages 18 to 29 , continue to gain among young adults , to draw more people " switching out " from denominations and to replace more religious older people , researchers forecast one in five Americans will be Nones in 20 years .
" Trends clearly favor this , " Kosmin says .
But he also notes , " There could be a Great Awakening ( massive Protestant revival ) or immigration may bring in more Catholic believers . "
Kosmin and Ariela Keysar of Trinity College , Hartford , Conn. , directed three editions of the American Religious Identification Survey over 18 years .
The 2008 ARIS ( pdf ) , based on a sampling of 54,000 U.S. adults , also burrowed in for a closer look at 1,106 Nones , who answered extra questions about their beliefs and behaviors and views on God.
ARIS : Most religious groups have lost ground in USA ' NONES ' : Now 15 % of population
The report finds : • Not all Nones are alike .
Half ( 51 % ) still believe in God or a higher power .
• Nones also are the only major U. S. faith group that 's majority male .
Even when girls grow up with unbelieving parents , they 're more likely to find a faith as adults than their brothers .
" Women are also less skeptical than men and less drawn to irreligious and anti-religious views .
They are more likely to reject a secular upbringing , " Kosmin says .
" There is a lot of ' churning ' going on but Nones gain much more from switching ( people leaving religion ) than from natural growth ( children emulating unbelieving parents ) , " he says .
• The percentage of atheist Nones — who say there 's no such thing as God — has n't budged in years .
" It 's not as though dozens of people at the Methodist Church read ( atheist Richard ) Dawkins and suddenly decided God does n't exist , " says Kosmin .
" There are so many misconceptions about who the Nones are .
They 're not New Age searchers or spiritual or even hardened atheists , " says Kosmin .
" They 're a stew of agnostics , deists and rationalists .
They sound more like Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine .
Their very interesting enlightenment approach is like the Founding Fathers ' kind : Skeptical about organized religion and clerics while still holding to an idea of God . "
One quirky fact : 33 % of Nones claim Irish ancestry , although the U.S. Census says only 10 % of the USA does .
" We have no idea why , " he says .
" Maybe you could ask ( Fox newscaster ) Bill O'Reilly .
In some way , researchers found Nones are very much like the overall , largely religious , U.S. population .
There 's no statistical difference on education , or income or marital status .
They are just as likely to be divorced as anybody else .
" Nones are not a fringe group anymore and are now part of Middle America .
They 're present in every socio- demographic group , Keysar concludes in their report .

Fearful that they ’re losing ground on immigration and health care , a group of House Democrats is pushing back and arguing that any health care bill should extend to all legal immigrants and allow illegal immigrants some access .
The Democrats , trying to stiffen their party ’s spines on the contentious issue , say it ’s unfair to bar illegal immigrants from paying their own way in a government - sponsored exchange .
Legal immigrants , they say , regardless of how long they ’ve been in the United States , should be able to get government - subsidized health care if they meet the other eligibility requirements .
“ Legal permanent residents should be able to purchase their plans , and they should also be eligible for subsidies if they need it .
Undocumented , if they can afford it , should be able to buy their own private plans .
It keeps them out of the emergency room , ” said Rep. Michael M. Honda , California Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus .
Mr. Honda was joined by more than 20 of his colleagues in two letters laying out the demands .

Coverage for immigrants is one of the thorniest issues in the health care debate , and one many Democratic leaders would like to avoid .
But immigrant rights groups and the Democrats who sent the letters say they have to take a stand now .
President Obama has said he does not want health care proposals to cover illegal immigrants .
The bill drawn up by Sen. Max Baucus , Montana Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , excludes illegal immigrants from his proposed health care exchange .
Mr. Honda and his allies , though , say illegal immigrants should be allowed to pay for insurance if they can afford it , even if it comes through a government - established exchange .
As a generally young , healthy part of the population , illegal immigrants could help reduce overall costs for those who buy into health exchange plans , the lawmakers said .
The Democrats ’ letters , however , do not issue ultimatums or threaten to withhold support for the bills if their requests are n’t met .
The National Council of La Raza launched its own “ flood their voice mail ” campaign last week to put pressure on Mr. Baucus to expand coverage in his proposal to include all legal immigrants and to drop verification language in the legislation that would prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining coverage .
Mr. Honda told The Washington Times that he ’s not pushing for illegal immigrants to gain access to taxpayer - subsidized benefits .
“ That ’s an argument that ’s been done already , ” he said .
Rep . Steve King , Iowa Republican , said proposals that include government coverage for illegal immigrants leave him incredulous .
“ If anybody can , with a straight face , advocate that we should provide health insurance for people who broke into our country , broke our law and for the most part are criminals , I do n’t know where they ever would draw the line , ” he said .
Mr. King , who opposes Democrats ’ health care plans in general , said illegal immigrant access in legislation “ would be a poison pill that would cause health care to go down ” to defeat .
Twenty - nine Democrats signed on to the letter on legal immigrants , while 21 signed the letter on covering illegal immigrants .
Although the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus signed the legal - immigrant letter in their capacity as CBC officials , they signed the other letter as individual members of Congress .
Under the 1996 welfare law overhaul , Congress restricted most federal benefits to longtime holders of green cards - those who have been in the country at least five years .
But Democrats chipped away at that rule when they reauthorized the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program earlier this year and allowed states to cover all immigrant children and pregnant women , regardless of how long they ’ve been in the country .
In their letter , the Democrats said health care costs are much lower for legal immigrants than for native citizens .
“ Immigrants are part of our families , our communities , our economy , and contribute to the fabric of America , ” they wrote .
“ It is simply wrong that their taxes would pay for public health insurance programs to which they are not allowed access . ”

15 Awesome Bouldering Pictures
Bouldering is a style of rock climbing that does n’t require the use of ropes due to the fact that most times it ’s limited to short climbs at heights that would n’t cause serious injury if you did fall .
Typically you ’ll tackle large boulders , which is probably why it ’s called bouldering .
Want to know some more about Apple ’s upcoming tablet device ?
You ’re in luck .
We ’ve received the scoop from our reliable source — who correctly called the iPod nano 5G , iPhone 3GS and Chinese iPhone 3G months ago .
Apple has created at least three separate prototypes of its tablet computer .
Let ’s call it “ iPad . ” Version 1 was designed with a 7 ” screen , which was judged to be too small .
The latest version has a 10.7 ” screen .
It runs iPhone OS .
There have been reports that it looks like an iPhone .
They ’re sort of true .
It looks like an iPhone 3G , complete with a curved back .
It will come in two different variations : one with 3G networking capabilities , and one without 3G networking capabilities .
Think of the 3G version as a bigscreen iPhone 3GS , and the non -3G version as a bigscreen iPod touch .
Screen resolutions will obviously jump considerably from the iPhone and iPod touch 480×320 - pixel displays , enabling easy reading of full - sized book and magazine pages , plus cropped newspaper pages .
Expect something like 5 - 6 times the resolution of an iPod touch or iPhone screen ( 720 p or thereabouts ) and 7 times the touchable surface area .
It is designed to expand the iPhone and iPod touch media concept to its next potential level : as a slate - like replacement for books and magazines , plus all of the media , gaming , app , and web functionality of the iPhone and iPod touch .
It is not meant to compete with netbooks .
It ’s an iPhone OS media player and light communication device .
Apple is currently planning to announce it on or before January 19 , 2010 , and to use an iPhone - like hype buildup period to start selling it in May or June .
It is apparently awaiting a final green light from Steve Jobs ; chances of it appearing in the market are believed to be 80 % at this point .
Feel free to discuss it all below .
Just do n’t make the mistake that some of these people made back in May ( “ what ’s the point of putting a camera on the Nano ? ” ) .
Keep an open mind .
Residents across Melbourne 's south - eastern suburbs have told of shaking houses and loud " bangs " after two small earthquakes rocked the area last night .
Geoscience Australia recorded magnitude 3 and 2.6 earthquakes south of Frankston within 13 seconds of each other at 6.21 pm .
There have been no reports of injuries or serious damage to property .
Frankston resident Rosa Totaro said she was scared and ran from her double - storey house when she felt the tremor .
She said window and cabinet glass shook , and she believed the tremor was stronger than those felt on two previous occasions over the last year .
This week sees the official start to autumn .
Autumn starts on or around September 15 , with this year being on the 22nd , and ends on about December 20 in solar terms .
Autumn ( also known as fall in North American English ) is one of the four temperate seasons .
Autumn marks the transition from summer into winter , usually in late September when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier .
In Ireland , the autumn months according to the national meteorological service , Met Éireann , are September , October and November .
However , according to the Irish Calendar which is based on ancient Celtic traditions , autumn counts throughout the months of August , September , and October .
As all of us know we can have a blustery autumn day in the middle of July too !
One of the best things about the autumn is getting out of the city and seeing the leaves change color , but why do they do this ?
Well let me tell you a little bit about photosynthesis :
Leaves are the parts of plants and trees that make the food necessary for sustaining life .
Trees use sunlight , water , and carbon dioxide taken from the air to produce energy .
The carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose , which is a type of sugar .
The glucose is then used as energy for the tree to live and grow .
This entire process is called photosynthesis .
Leaves are green because they contain the chemical chlorophyll , which facilitates photosynthesis .
Once the days and nights begin to cool and the nights get longer , the trees sense that fall and winter are approaching .
In the trees ' preparation to go dormant , circulation to the leaves , which are no longer needed to produce food , is cut off .
Due to the longer nights and reduced sunlight , the production of chlorophyll is reduced , meaning that the green will eventually disappear from the leaves .
Some of the pigments responsible for causing the vibrant colors in the leaves , such as carotenoids , are already present in the leaves , but are obscured by the green chlorophyll .
Carotenoids are responsible for yellows , oranges , and browns .
The pigments that cause bright reds , russets , and purples are called anthocyanins .
These are produced in the leaves of some species in the fall due to the excessive amounts of glucose in the leaves , along with the bright light of fall .
This is why certain species of trees produce bright red leaves as opposed to others that turn out yellows or golds .
Phew , with all that out of the way ( and thank you Google , you truly are a friend ) let ’s make some pudding .
IRISH AUTUMN PUDDING
This is similar to a luscious summer pudding , but the gorgeous tartness of the Bramley apples adds another dimension to the usual very - berry pudding .
The plums also work really well , adding great texture and color .
Ingredients :
14 oz Bramley apples .
14 oz plums .
9 oz fresh or frozen blackberries .
4 ½ oz golden brown sugar .
4 fl oz dry red wine .
4 tablespoons crème de cassis ( blackcurrant liqueur ) .
About 10 - 12 slices of white bread , crusts removed .
Fresh mint sprig , to decorate ( optional ) .
A sprig of redcurrants , to decorate ( optional ) .
Cream or crème fraiche , to serve .
For the berry sauce
1lb fresh or frozen blackberries or mixed berries .
Juice of 1 lemon , or to taste .
5 oz sugar , or to taste .
Method :
Peel , core and roughly chop the apples .
Aim to make the pieces about the same - size so that they cook evenly .
Halve and stone the plums and roughly chop them .
Place the apples and plums in a medium - sized saucepan along with the blackberries , sugar and wine and place over a medium heat .
Bring to the boil then simmer gently for about 15 minutes , or until the apple pieces are soft and rather mushy .
Take off the heat and add the crème de cassis .
Leave to cool .
Line the inside and base of a 1 - litre ( 13¼4 - pint ) bowl or mould with the slices of bread .
Overlap the slices slightly on the sides to ensure that the filling does not leak through .
Any leftover bits of bread can be used to cover the filling ( this will be the bottom of the pudding when it is turned out ) .
Place the cooked , cooled fruit carefully in the lined mould and press it down quite firmly .
Fill it nearly to the top , and then cover it completely with the remaining bread .
Weigh this down with a can on a plate and place in the fridge overnight .
To make the berry sauce , simply purée the berries with the lemon juice and sugar in a food processor .
Pass through a fine sieve and taste for flavour .
Adjust with more sugar or lemon juice as necessary .
To serve , carefully turn the pudding out onto a serving plate .
Brush any uncolored bits of bread with a little sauce and decorate with a mint sprig and a sprig of redcurrants on the top , if you wish .
Cut the pudding into wedges and serve with a dollop of fresh cream or crème fraiche , and some of the berry sauce on the side .
Missionary film leads to people ' hating Indians and wishing them dead '
March 19 , 2009

To mark the UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , March 21 , Survival is accusing the makers of a controversial film of inciting racial hatred against Brazilian Indians .
The film , ‘ Hakani ’ , has been watched by more than 350,000 people on YouTube and claims to be the true story of a Brazilian Indian child buried alive by her tribe .
Survival argues the film is faked , that the earth covering the children ’s faces is ‘ actually chocolate cake ’ , and that the film ’s claim that infanticide among Brazilian Indians is widespread is false .
‘ People are being taught to hate Indians , even wish them dead , ’ says Survival ’s director , Stephen Corry , in an exclusive interview about ‘ Hakani ’ .
‘ Look at the comments on the Youtube site , things like , ‘ So get rid of these native tribes .
They suck ’ , and , ‘ Those amazon mother f***ers burrying ( sic ) little kids , kill them all . ’
‘ The film focuses on what they claim happens routinely in Indian communities , but it does n’t , ’ Corry says .
‘ Amazonian infanticide is rare .
When it does happen .
. . it is the mother ’s decision and is n’t taken lightly .
It ’s made privately and secretly and is often thought shameful , certainly tragic . ’
‘ Hakani ’ was directed by David Cunningham , the son of the founder of an American fundamentalist missionary organisation called ‘ Youth with a Mission ’ , which has a branch in Brazil known as Jocum .
Corry argues that the missionaries try to downplay their involvement in the film .
‘ You ’re invited to give money to UNKF , but you are n’t told what the initials mean ( it ’s part of the mission ) , ’ Corry says .
‘ The evangelical involvement is not mentioned at all .
Even if you download the full film , the credits are unreadable , so you ca n’t tell who is behind it . ’
Corry says the film is part of the missionaries ’ campaign to pressure Brazil ’s government to pass a controversial bill , known as ‘ Muwaji ’s law ’ .
This would force Brazilian citizens to report to the authorities anything they think is a ‘ harmful traditional practice ’ – a law which would ‘ foster witch - hunts ’ , ‘ roll Brazil back centuries ’ and ‘ could bring catastrophic social breakdown ’ .
Survival believes that cultural practices should be based on the free and informed consent of all participants and that infanticide is wrong .

>> Review
Remember those kids in the lunch room who ’d claim they had the best idea for a video game ever ?
They ’d always have ridiculous scope , whether it was a city where you could explore every building , or a racing game that mapped every road in the country .
But if you really think about it , does that sound fun ?
Sure , it ’d be amazing for a little while , just to experiment , drive around your home town , or dig through some NPC ’s desk drawers , but once the actual game starts all that stuff would just be extraneous .
Sometimes though , you need to at least try something once to see if it will work .
Enter Scribblenauts , the game where you can type in almost any common noun in the English language and it will appear before your eyes .
What do you do with all this power ?
Well , you solve puzzles , of course !
But humans do n’t work well with toolboxes that consist of everything in the known world .
In fact , some of the most creative ventures come from the most limited palettes .
Consider Forza 2 ’s car painting tool , where people recreate the Sistine Chapel on their cars using basic shapes and colors .
Or look at Halo 3 ’s Forge , where budding level designers shape multiplayer maps out of crates and barrels .
People need limits because they allow for experimentation and breaking boundaries .
Without well - defined limits , we tend to make our own .
What works ?
In Scribblenauts it ’s all - too - often “ wings ” , “ grappling hook ” , and “ helicopter ” .
Your personal toolbox may be slightly different , but it ’s sure to be a fraction of the objects actually offered .
By failing to cover every object interaction in the known world ( an impossible task ) , developer 5th Cell only fuels this quirk of human nature .
For every real - world interaction that works in Scribblenauts , there are ten more equally sensible ones that fail .
The result is a subjective universe , one in which 5th Cell is your god .
Technically , that ’s not different from any other game – Hideo Kojima thinks most soldiers are legally blind , Infinity Ward thinks you can shake off a bullet wound , and Miyamoto thinks your teenage daughter is fat .
But the rules in Metal Gear Solid , Call of Duty , and Wii Fit are so few that you quickly learn to adapt .
In Scribblenauts , there are more rules than anyone can experience in a lifetime .
So we experiment a bit – wings let us fly , a time bomb can be activated manually , engineers will pull switches – and with every discovery of what works our toolbox fills a bit more .
Eventually , we ’ve limited ourselves to 10 - 20 objects out of thousands , and yet it ’s enough to solve the entire game .
The further you delve into Scribblenauts , the more you ’ll find things that do n’t work , and the more you ’ll limit your toolbox .
But it ’s not just the fault of human nature and the game ’s subjective universe – the more complicated things get , the more Scribblenauts reveals itself to be broken .
The game uses the stylus for almost everything from moving your character Max , to picking up objects , or dropping them into the environment .
The result is not unlike the overuse of the A button in Gears of War .
Putting all their eggs in one basket leads to conflicts , frustration , and mad button / stylus mashing that only exacerbates the issue .
The thing is , you eventually adjust to Gears of War , because the A button may be overused , but it always works in its current context .
Scribblenauts is actually broken .
Often , Max simply wo n’t respond , and if he does he ’ll walk too far ahead , flailing wildly and getting himself killed .
The camera does n’t help either because it insists on snapping back to Max every half - second .
Try performing objectives with Max off - screen , and before you know it he ’ll be swimming in lava or running towards a T - Rex .
As Max searches for any excuse to kill himself , the more challenging puzzles will leave you less and less likely to experiment – there ’s no sense in introducing further trial and error .
With hundreds of puzzles in the game , it becomes trivial to skip the harder ones , until that ’s all that ’s left .
Eventually you ’ll find yourself begging for scraps of fun while wading in the shallow end of a giant pool of content .
For some people , this will be enough .
Simply seeing all the objects they can think of will be worth the price of admission .
But for those looking for an actual game , Scribblenauts is more likely to leave you bored , frustrated , and worst of all creatively - drained .
Still , 5th Cell deserves some credit for trying .
Scribblenauts may fail on many accounts , but it ’s still an important and ambitious title .
Perhaps one day it will even be held in high regard , as a stepping stone to a much more fun and entertaining game .
Muntadhar al - Zaidi , the Iraqi who threw his shoe at George Bush gave this speech on his recent release .
In the name of God , the most gracious and most merciful .
Here I am , free .
But my country is still a prisoner of war .
Firstly , I give my thanks and my regards to everyone who stood beside me , whether inside my country , in the Islamic world , in the free world .
There has been a lot of talk about the action and about the person who took it , and about the hero and the heroic act , and the symbol and the symbolic act .
But , simply , I answer :
What compelled me to confront is the injustice that befell my people , and how the occupation wanted to humiliate my homeland by putting it under its boot .
And how it wanted to crush the skulls of ( the homeland ’s ) sons under its boots , whether sheikhs , women , children or men .
And during the past few years , more than a million martyrs fell by the bullets of the occupation and the country is now filled with more than 5 million orphans , a million widows and hundreds of thousands of maimed .
And many millions of homeless because of displacement inside and outside the country .
We used to be a nation in which the Arab would share with the Turkman and the Kurd and the Assyrian and the Sabean and the Yazid his daily bread .
And the Shiite would pray with the Sunni in one line .
And the Muslim would celebrate with the Christian the birthday of Christ , may peace be upon him .
And despite the fact that we shared hunger under sanctions for more than 10 years , for more than a decade .
Our patience and our solidarity did not make us forget the oppression .
Until we were invaded by the illusion of liberation that some had .
( The occupation ) divided one brother from another , one neighbor from another , and the son from his uncle .
It turned our homes into never - ending funeral tents .
And our graveyards spread into parks and roadsides .
It is a plague .
It is the occupation that is killing us , that is violating the houses of worship and the sanctity of our homes and that is throwing thousands daily into makeshift prisons .
I am not a hero , and I admit that .
But I have a point of view and I have a stance .
It humiliated me to see my country humiliated .
And to see my Baghdad burned .
And my people being killed .
Thousands of tragic pictures remained in my head , and this weighs on me every day and pushes me toward the righteous path , the path of confrontation , the path of rejecting injustice , deceit and duplicity .
It deprived me of a good night ’s sleep .
Dozens , no , hundreds , of images of massacres that would turn the hair of a newborn white used to bring tears to my eyes and wound me .
The scandal of Abu Ghraib .
The massacre of Fallujah , Najaf , Haditha , Sadr City , Basra , Diyala , Mosul , Tal Afar , and every inch of our wounded land .
In the past years , I traveled through my burning land and saw with my own eyes the pain of the victims , and hear with my own ears the screams of the bereaved and the orphans .
And a feeling of shame haunted me like an ugly name because I was powerless .
And as soon as I finished my professional duties in reporting the daily tragedies of the Iraqis , and while I washed away the remains of the debris of the ruined Iraqi houses , or the traces of the blood of victims that stained my clothes , I would clench my teeth and make a pledge to our victims , a pledge of vengeance .
The opportunity came , and I took it .
I took it out of loyalty to every drop of innocent blood that has been shed through the occupation or because of it , every scream of a bereaved mother , every moan of an orphan , the sorrow of a rape victim , the teardrop of an orphan .
I say to those who reproach me :
Do you know how many broken homes that shoe that I threw had entered because of the occupation ?
How many times it had trodden over the blood of innocent victims ?
And how many times it had entered homes in which free Iraqi women and their sanctity had been violated ?
Maybe that shoe was the appropriate response when all values were violated .
When I threw the shoe in the face of the criminal , Bush , I wanted to express my rejection of his lies , his occupation of my country , my rejection of his killing my people .
My rejection of his plundering the wealth of my country , and destroying its infrastructure .
And casting out its sons into a diaspora .
After six years of humiliation , of indignity , of killing and violations of sanctity , and desecration of houses of worship , the killer comes , boasting , bragging about victory and democracy .
He came to say goodbye to his victims and wanted flowers in response .
Put simply , that was my flower to the occupier , and to all who are in league with him , whether by spreading lies or taking action , before the occupation or after .
I wanted to defend the honor of my profession and suppressed patriotism on the day the country was violated and its high honor lost .
Some say :
Why did n’t he ask Bush an embarrassing question at the press conference , to shame him ?
And now I will answer you , journalists .
How can I ask Bush when we were ordered to ask no questions before the press conference began , but only to cover the event .
It was prohibited for any person to question Bush .
And in regard to professionalism :
The professionalism mourned by some under the auspices of the occupation should not have a voice louder than the voice of patriotism .
And if patriotism were to speak out , then professionalism should be allied with it .
I take this opportunity :
If I have wronged journalism without intention , because of the professional embarrassment I caused the establishment , I wish to apologize to you for any embarrassment I may have caused those establishments .
All that I meant to do was express with a living conscience the feelings of a citizen who sees his homeland desecrated every day .
History mentions many stories where professionalism was also compromised at the hands of American policymakers , whether in the assassination attempt against Fidel Castro by booby - trapping a TV camera that CIA agents posing as journalists from Cuban TV were carrying , or what they did in the Iraqi war by deceiving the general public about what was happening .
And there are many other examples that I wo n’t get into here .
But what I would like to call your attention to is that these suspicious agencies — the American intelligence and its other agencies and those that follow them — will not spare any effort to track me down ( because I am ) a rebel opposed to their occupation .
They will try to kill me or neutralize me , and I call the attention of those who are close to me to the traps that these agencies will set up to capture or kill me in various ways , physically , socially or professionally .
And at the time that the Iraqi prime minister came out on satellite channels to say that he did n’t sleep until he had checked in on my safety , and that I had found a bed and a blanket , even as he spoke I was being tortured with the most horrific methods : electric shocks , getting hit with cables , getting hit with metal rods , and all this in the backyard of the place where the press conference was held .
And the conference was still going on and I could hear the voices of the people in it .
And maybe they , too , could hear my screams and moans .
In the morning , I was left in the cold of winter , tied up after they soaked me in water at dawn .
And I apologize for Mr. Maliki for keeping the truth from the people .
I will speak later , giving names of the people who were involved in torturing me , and some of them were high - ranking officials in the government and in the army .
I did n’t do this so my name would enter history or for material gains .
All I wanted was to defend my country , and that is a legitimate cause confirmed by international laws and divine rights .
I wanted to defend a country , an ancient civilization that has been desecrated , and I am sure that history — especially in America — will state how the American occupation was able to subjugate Iraq and Iraqis , until its submission .
They will boast about the deceit and the means they used in order to gain their objective .
It is not strange , not much different from what happened to the Native Americans at the hands of colonialists .
Here I say to them ( the occupiers ) and to all who follow their steps , and all those who support them and spoke up for their cause : Never .
Because we are a people who would rather die than face humiliation .
And , lastly , I say that I am independent .
I am not a member of any politicalparty , something that was said during torture — one time that I ’m far - right , another that I ’m a leftist .
I am independent of any political party , and my future efforts will be in civil service to my people and to any who need it , without waging any political wars , as some said that I would .
My efforts will be toward providing care for widows and orphans , and all those whose lives were damaged by the occupation .
I pray for mercy upon the souls of the martyrs who fell in wounded Iraq , and for shame upon those who occupied Iraq and everyone who assisted them in their abominable acts .
And I pray for peace upon those who are in their graves , and those who are oppressed with the chains of imprisonment .
And peace be upon you who are patient and looking to God for release .
And to my beloved country I say :
If the night of injustice is prolonged , it will not stop the rising of a sun and it will be the sun of freedom .
One last word .
I say to the government :
It is a trust that I carry from my fellow detainees .
They said , ‘ Muntadhar , if you get out , tell of our plight to the omnipotent powers ’ —
I know that only God is omnipotent and I pray to Him — ‘ remind them that there are dozens , hundreds , of victims rotting in prisons because of an informant ’s word . ’
They have been there for years , they have not been charged or tried .
They ’ve only been snatched up from the streets and put into these prisons .
And now , in front of you , and in the presence of God , I hope they can hear me or see me .
I have now made good on my promise of reminding the government and the officials and the politicians to look into what ’s happening inside the prisons .
The injustice that ’s caused by the delay in the judicial system .
Thank you .
And may God ’s peace be upon you

The suspected assailant was taken into custody by UCLA police , who sealed off Young Hall , home of the school 's chemistry department .
Police said they do n't know of any motive for the attack .
The victim , whose name was withheld , was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , where she apparently was undergoing surgery .
Witnesses said they saw a woman staggering out of the sixth - floor Young Hall lab with a teacher 's assistant applying pressure to her bloody neck moments after the attack , which was reported at 12:21 p.m .
Law enforcement sources said some type of verbal altercation occurred just before the attack , but the relationship , if any , between the assailant and the victim was unclear .
One student who was inside the lab when the attack occurred shortly after noon told The Times that he looked up as the assailant appeared to repeatedly punch the victim .
Then the man calmly turned and walked away as the victim lay bleeding profusely .
Students in the UCLA science lab described the horrifying moments this afternoon when a male classmate slashed the throat of a female student , who was critically injured .
" We have asked students to stay away from Young Hall , " said UCLA police spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein .
The attack apparently took place between class sessions in an organic chemistry lab on the top floor of Young Hall .
The undergraduate level lab , known as 30CL , enrolls about a dozen students and is usually led by teaching assistants .
It is part of a class for about 60 students that is overseen by lecturer Alfred Bacher , according to department officials .
Bacher , who joined the UCLA faculty in 2001 after work as a postdoctoral fellow there , could not be reached for comment .
By at least one account of a chemistry department employee who asked not to be identified , the assailant turned himself in to a campus employee in a third - floor reception and mail room area in the building .
UCLA chemistry professor Robin Garrell , who is chairwoman of the UCLA campuswide Faculty Senate , was leaving her fourth - floor office in Young Hall when she saw emergency crews wheeling out the victim on a stretcher on the ground floor .
Students and faculty “ are obviously very shaken ” by the incident , Garrell said .
“ It ’s very shocking . ”
Psychological counselors were on the scene to help students cope with the situation , she said .
Two hours later , traumatized students who witnessed the attack , still in their lab coats , lined the sixth floor , waiting to be interviewed by detectives .
Many of their personal possessions , including books and keys to their cars and residences , remained behind in the lab room that had become a crime scene .
[ Updated at 4:45 p.m. : UCLA campus spokeswoman Carol Stogsdill said she had no information about the alleged assailant 's past behavioral record and had not heard of any reports of previous trouble in the class or between the two students .
She said both students were 20 - year - old seniors and that their identities were being withheld by police .
Chemistry department vice chairman Peter Felker said he did not know any of the students in the class and that the department had not received any reports of trouble in the lab or complaints about the alleged assailant ’s past behavior .
" Nothing that I ’m aware of , ” he said .
UCLA biochemistry professor Sabeeha Merchant was close to the crime scene soon after the stabbing and praised the other students and faculty who came to the aid of the victim and alerted police .
" They were responsible and calm and really helped , ” she said .
Merchant and others described the mood in Young Hall as stunned .
“ People are shocked that something like that would happen .
But because we are at the university does n’t mean we are immune from what goes on in the rest of the world , " she said .
" This could happen in a restaurant or a shopping mall . ” ]

BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA -- Wednesday , October 7th , 2009 -- The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today launched the next stage of its " Windows 7 Sins " campaign at http://windows7sins.org, making the case against Microsoft and proprietary software by writing to 500 leaders of the most influential nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) worldwide , asking them to make the switch to freedom - respecting free software , and to help foster awareness of the ethical importance of computer user freedom .
The letter warns these " Windows 7 decision makers " about the " lack of privacy , freedom , and security " they will suffer should they adopt Windows 7 , and makes the case that they should instead adopt free software by outlining seven major areas where proprietary software like Windows is hurting society : invading privacy , poisoning education , locking users in , abusing standards , leveraging monopolistic behavior , enforcing Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) , and threatening user security .
FSF executive director Peter Brown said , " The dependency of organizations working for social change and improvement on software owned and exclusively controlled by Microsoft is leading society into an era of digital restrictions , threatening and limiting our freedoms .
Free software on the other hand , is about freedom , not price , and it is designed to give you the ability to study and improve the software for your own needs .
Today , we 're asking leaders in the nonprofit sector to switch to the free software GNU / Linux operating system for all their desktop and computer infrastructure needs . "
The GNU / Linux operating system is readily available , easy - to-use , and supported by numerous vendors and a worldwide community .
GNU / Linux distributions come with thousands of freely licensed software applications , including complete accounting and fundraising solutions suitable for charities .
FSF campaigns manager Matt Lee added , " Charities , NGOs , and other nonprofit organizations that choose proprietary software are undertaking bad public policy , often through misinformation or a failure to see their technology choices as connected to their social missions .
We hope to alert these decision makers to the positive contribution they can make to society by switching their organizations to free software .
I hope these groups will make a public policy commitment to freedom and join a growing list of organizations who understand that sinking money and time into proprietary software is inconsistent with the core values of freedom and progress . "
More information about the campaign , including the text of the letter and a mailing list that will provide subscribers with information updates and action alerts , is online at http://en.windows7sins.org.

About Free Software and Open Source
The free software movement 's goal is freedom for computer users .
Some , especially corporations , advocate a different viewpoint , known as " open source , " which cites only practical goals such as making software powerful and reliable , focuses on development models , and avoids discussion of ethics and freedom .
These two viewpoints are different at the deepest level .

Canonical is touting private cloud capabilities in an upgrade to its Ubuntu Linux OS being announced on Tuesday .
Available for free download on October 29 , Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition introduces UEC ( Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud ) , an open source cloud computing environment based on the same APIs as Amazon EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud ) .
Businesses can take advantage of private clouds , Canonical said .
[ See how Unix is holding up to challenges from Linux and Windows Server . ]
" Essentially , what this release is doing is targeting cloud computing , in particular , " said Steve George , director of support and services for Canonical .
With version 9.10 , users can take core ideas of cloud computing , including agility , resource pooling , and virtualization , in deploying clouds on their own hardware , George said .
Users can set up 10 to 15 private servers and use the same APIs as in Amazon EC2 , thus leveraging the same capabilities they would use with Amazon , George said .
Applications can be taken off the Amazon cloud and put into the user 's own cloud , or vice versa .
UEC is an umbrella name for a set of cloud technologies including the Eucalyptus project , which provides an open source system for implementation of on - premise and hybrid clouds using hardware and software already in place .
UEC , Canonical said , makes it easy to deploy and manage a cloud environment .
Eucalyptus backing piqued the interest of analyst Stephen O'Grady , of RedMonk .
" As far as the server aspect to the release , the Eucalyptus inclusion is certainly the most interesting development , enabling as it does private cloud functionality with an Amazon and VMware compatibility story , " O'Grady said .
Previously codenamed " Karmic Koala , " Ubuntu 9.10 also will be available on the Amazon EC2 environment as an Amazon Machine Image .
UEC images are identical to Ubuntu AMI ; work done in one environment can be uploaded to the other , Canonical said .
A store capability is being prepared in UEC to provide users with access to ready - to - deploy applications in the UEC environment .
Also featured in version 9.10 is the addition of the MySQL 5.1 database .
The directory stack and single sign - on tools add improved directory integration and Django now ships as a supported framework to enhance Web server options .
Kernel improvements better support Xen and KVM virtualization and improve caching performance .
Support for the USB 3.0 protocol enables " super speed transfer rates " when devices become available , Canonical said .
OpenLDAP integration is featured for mixing Ubuntu into an existing LDAP network , providing for centralized authentication and authorization .
System management support is featured for WBEM ( Web - based enterprise management ) protocols .
This enables support of the Ubuntu environment via popular system management tools .
Canonical provides engineering , online and professional services to customers and partners .
The company will provide maintenance , security updates , and critical fixes for version 9.10 for the next 18 months .

BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin reports on how a push toward electric scooters in one Chinese city could be a bellwether for a global revolution .
The incredible limestone karst pinnacles of Guilin are indeed a wonder of the planet .
I am still shaking my head in disbelief at this freak of nature .
But the world may owe another debt to this remarkable city by helping to popularise the electric scooter .
Battery - powered motor scooters are popping up in cities right across China .
But in Guilin , they have been given an extra boost by the decision of the local authority to stop issuing licences for conventional motorbikes , which were sullying the city 's green reputation with their pollution and noise .
As a result , most of the powered two - wheelers in Guilin are now silently electric - sometimes alarmingly so , as I discovered while turning to cross the road .
Air pollution has been reduced at a two - stroke , and there 's also a bonus cut in greenhouse gases .
As the UK government 's chief energy scientist David MacKay shows in his recent book , it 's better to run vehicles on electricity than petrol even if the power is generated by coal .
That 's because electric motors are so much more efficient than internal combustion engines .
A simple change in regulations in just one large city can make a small difference in terms of orders and production for a clean technology like this .
As production volumes increase , prices come tumbling down .
Cycle swap
If locals in Guilin are determined enough to buy a petrol scooter , they can still scam a licence from a friend in the county area .
But now most wannabe two - wheel speedsters are choosing electric scooters because they are cheaper to buy and to run .
My guide in the city Joy Hu told me he bought his scooter because it was good for the environment , easy to ride , and cheaper to buy and to run than a petrol model .
But he confessed that for almost all other riders , the price was the only significant factor .
He said you could now buy scooters in the town for £ 450 - £ 500 .
Charging them overnight gives you enough power to do anything you needed to do in the day for much less than a tank of petrol .
Micro minibus encouraged by local government in pollution - conscious Yangshuo China 's population is so vast and demand is so huge that it is surely just a matter of time before the prices for electric scooters are driven so low that they are commonplace around the world .
A couple of caveats though : the Chinese government is not quite as omnipotent as it often appears from abroad .
The provinces have enormous influence and politicians do all they can to protect their local industries regardless of the wishes of the state .
So we can expect that the areas that manufacture dirty , noisy old bikes will try to find a way to keep them for a while .
The second caveat goes deeper .
Greens may enthuse about the rise of electric vehicles but Wan Li , my interpreter in Yangshuo near Guilin , told me almost all of the scooters in the region were being driven by people who had given up their pedal cycles .
This has implications for health policy as the Chinese increasingly eat a more Western - style , high - fat diet .
It also has emissions consequences if low - pollution electric bikes become so cheap that they replace not just high - pollution petrol motorbikes but zero-pollution bicycles as well .
" In 30 - 40 years ' time I do n't think anyone will ride a bicycle in China , " opined Mr Li .
" Everyone will want to have a car . "
Of course , his prediction may be wrong : in developed countries some people who can afford a car still choose to cycle .
And there are other factors - like lack of space - which will restrict limitless ambition for mobility .
But it is a sobering thought that the world needs to generate enough energy and create enough pollution - absorption room in the atmosphere to cope not just with current demand , but with the future demands of nine billion of us .

textorize is a Ruby - based font rasterizer command line utility for Mac OS X .
It generates PNG files from an input string and options , using Mac OS X's pristine typography facilities .
Subpixel antialising
The biggest advantage over other web font rendering techniques is full support of OS X's advanced subpixel antialiasing .
You can see this in action in the zoomed - in " textorize " headline at the top of this page .
In essence , the apparent resolution of the screen is tripled ( see the presentation below for more info ) .

Find out more at the textorize article at Thomas ' blog .
Download
You 'll need to install Gemcutter first if you have n't yet , then it 's as easy as :
$ gem install textorize
textorize
This will install the textorize Ruby Gem , and thecommand line tool .
If you ’re not using the default ruby environment on OS X , you ’ll need to install RubyCocoa .
You can download this project in either zip or tar formats .
You can also clone the project with Git by running :
$ git clone git://github.com/madrobby/textorize
Stay informed

Usage
textorize [ options ] string -f , -- font= [ FONT ]
Font name -s , -- size= [ SIZE ]
Font size in point - l , -- lineheight = [ HEIGHT ]
Line height in point -t , -- ligatures = [ TYPE ]
Ligatures usage : all , standard or off -- list - fonts List available fonts -k , -- kerning = [ VALUE ]
Kerning adjustment - p , -- padding = [ VALUE ]
Padding in px -o , -- output= [ FILENAME ]
Specify filename for saving -b , -- obliqueness = [ ANGLE ]
Slant angle - c , -- color= [ COLOR ]
Render text in specific color ( CSS color value ) - g , -- background = [ COLOR ]
Render background in specific color ( CSS color value ) - a , -- smoothing = [ VALUE ]
Font smoothing : 0 = no subpixel AA , 1 =light , 2=normal , 3=strong -h , -- help Display this message and exit
The color parameters take any CSS color , in #abc , #aabbcc , rgb ( 1,2,3 ) or rgba( 1,2,3,0.5 ) format .
For some fonts , you will need to specify a padding to avoid glyphs being cut - off .
Antialiasing options
These options are great for optimizing the appearance of light fonts at small fonts sizes .
Here 's an example comparing the rendering of Helvetica Neue Ulitralight at 12pt , with the various Photoshop and textorize smoothing options .
- a0 ( or -- smoothing=0 ) turns of subpixel antialiasing .
-a1 ( or -- smoothing=1 ) turns on light subpixel antialiasing .
This mode makes glyphs rendered thinner , and is a bit more akin to Cleartype on Windows than the default OS X font rendering .
- a2 ( or -- smoothing=2 ) turns on medium / normal subpixel antialiasing .
This is the default OS X font smoothing .
-a3 ( or -- smoothing=3 ) turns on strong subpixel antialiasing .
Examples
Generate a output.png file of the string " Hello " in black on white 200 pt Gotham .
textorize - f " Gotham " - s200 Hello
Generate a foo.png file of the string " foo bar " in 19pt Lucida Grande , 75 % opacity white on a dark green background , with additional spacing between glyphs :
textorize - fLucida\ Grande - s19 - k1.5 - ofoo.png --color=rgba\( 255,255,255,0.75 \ ) -- background=#003800 foo\ bar
Generate a fancy.png file of the string " fancypants " in 60pt NeoRetro :
textorize - fNeoRetro - s60 - ofancy.png fancypants
Generate a transparent.png file of the string " transparent " in white on a transparent background in 50pt ProFont ( note that the transparent background forces normal , non-subpixel antialiasing ) :
textorize - fProFont - cwhite - gtransparent - s50 - otransparent.png transparent
Above image is a 24 bit transparent PNG on a DIV with a background image .

I recommend using the smusher command line tool to losslessly shrink the resulting PNG images .
Recurring outages on major networking sites such as Twitter and
LinkedIn , along with incidents where Twitter members were
mysteriously dropped for days at a time ,
have led many people to challenge the centralized control exerted by
companies running social networks .
Whether you ’re a street
demonstrator or a business analyst , you may well have come to depend
on Twitter .
We may have been willing to build our virtual houses on
shaky foundations might when they were temporary beach huts ; but now
we need to examine the ground on which many are proposing to build our
virtual shopping malls and even our virtual federal offices .
Instead of the constant churning among the commercial sites du
jour ( Friendster , MySpace , Facebook , Twitter ) , the next
generation of social networking increasingly appears to require a
decentralized , peer - to - peer infrastructure .
This article looks at
available efforts in that space and suggests some principles to guide
its development .
Update : a few days ago , OpenID expert Chris Messina and
microblog developer Jyri Engeström published
an article with conclusions similar to mine ;
clearly this is a felt need that ’s spreading across the Net .
Interestingly , they approach the questions from a list of what
information needs to be shared and how it needs to be transmitted ; I
come from the angle of what people want from each other and how their
needs can be met .
The two approaches converge , though .
See the
comments for other interesting related blogs .
The peer - to - peer concept
The Internet was originally a parliament convened among peers .
Every
host was a server , almost always providing file downloads and usually
email as well .
To this day , ISPs “ peer ” when they accept data from one
ISP ’s customer and delivers it to the other ISP ’s customer .
To peer does n’t mean simply to be of equal status–in fact , that
notion could be misleading , because two systems with vastly different
roles and resources can peer .
More importantly , to peer means to have
no intermediary .
When the architecture requires an intermediary , it should play as
unobtrusive and minimal role as possible .
For instance , Napster and
Skype have central servers , but they are used just to sign up
participants and set up connections among them .
Napster ’s and Skype ’s partial decentralization won them a key benefit
of peer - to - peer networking that Twitter could well take note of : they
offload most traffic from their central servers to the users and the
ISPs that connect them .
But being partially centralized means the service can still be
disrupted as a whole .
Napster was shut down by a court ruling ;
Skype
shut itself down once through a programming error that it never
clearly explained to the public .
The Internet itself quickly developed into this hybrid model as well .
Modems and terminals created a new layer of second - class citizens ,
vastly expanded by the PC revolution .
These Internet users were tucked
away behind firewalls and blocked from using any services not approved
by system administrators .
By the year 2000 , new companies springing up in the dot - com boom found
themselves frustrated by these restrictions , and designed their
innovative protocols to deliver data over port 80 because everybody
kept that open for Web traffic .
When the practice started , traditional
Internet developers derided it as “ port 80 pollution . ”
Now it ’s called
Web Services .
As happens so often , the way forward proved to be the way
backward –that is , to restore the democracy of the early Internet–and
also predictably , was pioneered by outlier movements with dubious
legality , ethics , and financial viability .
Napster made the first
impact on public consciousness , followed by services that rigorously
avoided any hint of central servers ( see my 2000 article ,
Gnutella and Freenet Represent True Technological Innovation ) .
By the end of 2000 , the term peer - to - peer had become a
household word .
But the movement quickly went into retreat , facing
difficult design problems that were already under discussion in the
O’Reilly book
Peer to Peer ,
published in February 2001 .
I summarized the problems , which remain
ongoing , in the articles
From P2P to Web Services : Addressing and Coordination and
From P2P to Web Services : Trust .
The issue of addressing would arise right away for a social network
developed in a pure peer - to - peer fashion .
How would you check whether
your old college buddy was on the network , if you could n’t query a
central server ?
And how could you choose a unique name , without a
single place to register ?
Names would have to be qualified by domain
names or some other identifiers – which is actually a step forward
right there .
It seems to me ridiculous that a company would plan to
provide a service to the whole world using a flat namespace .
And while
we ’re at it , you ought to be able to change your name and bring along
all your prior activity .
Trust would also become an issue in decentralized social networks .
You
could ban a correspondent from your personal list , but you could n’t
inform a central authority about abuse .
And the problem Twitter has
recently started to tackle –preventing random users from impersonating
well - known people –would be a challenge .
But decentralization brings many benefits .
A failure at one person’s
site , or even on a whole segment of the network , would have no effect
on the rest of the world .
A misconfigured router in Pakistan could not
keep everyone from accessing the most popular video content on the
Internet .
And because each peer would have to obey common , understood
protocols , a decentralized social network would be transparent and
support the use of free software ; nobody would have to puzzle over
what algorithms were in use .
Visiting many different sites instead of central server to pull
together information on friends would increase network traffic , but
modern networks have enough bandwidth to stand up to the load .
Even in
places with limited bandwidth , service would degrade gracefully
because messages would be small .
The
StatusNet
project , which underlies
identi.ca ,
represents a half - way step toward the kind of full decentralization
illustrated by RSS .
StatusNet can power a variety of microbloggin
services , each signing up any number of members .
The services can
interchange data to tie the members together .
The rest of this article looks at two possible models for a
distributed social network ( RSS and XMPP ) , followed by an examination
of the recurring problems of peer - to - peer in the social networking
context .
Possible models
Many examples can be found of filesystems , version control systems ,
and other projects that lack central servers .
But I ’m just going to look
at two protocols that other people are considering for decentralized
social networking .
When thinking of decentralized systems for sending short messages , RSS
and Atom have to come to mind first .
They ’re universal and work well
on a large scale .
And Dave Winer , the inventor of RSS , has created an
enhanced version called
rssCloud ,
recently
incorporated into WordPress .
Given the first question I asked about decentralization –how do you
find the people you ’re looking for ?
–the RSS answer is “ by
serendipity . ”
Like everything else on the Internet , you could come
across new treasures in many ways : surfing , searching , friends , or
media outlets .
Lots of bloggers provide links from their sites to
their own faves .
And RSS has developed its own ecosystem , sprouting
plenty of aggregators that offer you views into new fields of
information .
rssCloud is meant to carry more frequent traffic and more content than
the original RSS and Atom .
It maintains an XML format ( making it
relatively verbose for SMS , although Winer tries to separate out the
rich , enhanced data ) .
Perhaps because of the increased traffic it
would cause , it ’s less decentralized than RSS , storing updates in
Amazon S2 .
XMPP was invented about the same time as RSS by a programmer named
Jeremie Miller , who wanted a standard instant messaging protocol with
tags that could support semantics , and therefore powerful new
applications .
Most important , his creation , Jabber , made it possible
for individual users to run their own servers instead of depending on
America Online or Yahoo !.
Jabber had the potential to complement Tim
Berners - Lee ’s idea of a Semantic Web .
Because Jabber used XML , it was seen as a bit heavyweight , and the
servers were reportedly hard to configure .
But the possibilities were
too promising to pass up .
So the IETF formalized it , gave it a clumsy
name suitable for a standard , and released a set of RFCs about it .
Unfortunately , XMPP languished until Google adopted it for their Talk
and Wave services .
These high - profile applications suggest that it has
the scalability , flexibility , and robustness for social networking .
The P2P problems , in today ’s context
Even if decentralized protocols and clients were invented , there will
be a long road to democratizing social networks .
The messages are
expected to be lightweight , so photos and other large batches of
content would have to be stored somewhere outside the messages .
Most
users would n’t trust their laptops ( much less their mobile devices ) to
store content and serve it up 24 hours a day , so they would need a
cloud service , which might or might not be distributed .
A backup service is also necessary in order to recover from a local
disk failure or other error that wipes out several years of your
accumulated identity .
Problems such as impersonation and unsolicited communications ( spam )
are hard to solve in decentralized systems because trust is always a
hierarchical quality .
This is true everywhere in life , beyond the
level of a family or neighborhood .
We expect our professors to be good
because they were hired by the college , and expect the college to be
good because it was accredited by a centralized facility , whose
managers were in turn appointed by elected officials .
This system can
and does break down regularly , so mechanisms for repair are always
built in .
Nobody can be banned from a decentralized social network because
there ’s nothing to ban them from .
But there are ways to re-introduce
enough centralization to validate credentials .
For instance , the
American Bar Association could register lawyers in good standing , and
you could check whether someone claiming to be a lawyer in the US was
registered .
But we would n’t want to take this process too far and
create a web of accreditations , because that would devalue people
whose skills and viewpoints lie outside the mainstream .
You could still check whether someone shares friends with you , because
one person ’s claims of friendship could be traced back to the sites he
claims to be friends with .
Someone could game the system by setting up
fake sites claiming to be people you know and linking back to them ,
but this is a huge amount of work and leaves the perpetrator open to
arrest for fraud .
Free software developer Thomas Lord suggests that
identity could also be verified through “ a fairly shallow and
decentralized hierarchy of authentication like the system of notary
publics in physical life . ”
All in all , the problems of finding people and trusting people
suggests that there ’s role for aggregators , just as in the case of
RSS .
And these aggregators could also offer the kind of tracking
services ( who talked about me today ? ) and statistical services ( is
Michael Jackson ’s death still a major topic of conversation ? ) that get
business people so excited about Twitter .
A decentralized social
network could still be business - friendly , because traffic could be
analyzed in order to target ads more accurately –but hopefully ,
because peering clients are under the users ’ control , people who
did n’t want the ads could configure their systems to screen them out .
When you set up an account , you could register with aggregators of
your choice .
And whenever you connected to someone , you could
automatically register his account with a list of your favorite
aggregators , in case he had n’t registered himself .
If people wanted
control over where they ’re aggregated , I supposed something equivalent
to a robots .
txt file could be invented .
But it ’s not sporting
to refuse to be counted .
And there ’s no point in invoking privacy
concerns–face it , if the NSA wants to read your tweets , they ’ll find
a way .
So those are some of the areas where the problems of P2P and social
networking intersect .
Let ’s remember that current social networks are
far from solving problems of findability , trust , and persistence as
well .
I do n’t check how many followers I have on Twitter ; I figure
most of them are spam bots .
( Apologies to any of my followers who
actually are sufficiently embodied to be reading this . )
Could
OpenSocial
be used to implement a P2P social network ?
It ’s based on a single
object that is expected to query and update a single server .
But the
interface could probably be implemented to run on a single user ’s
system , registering the users or aggregators with whom she
communicates and querying all those users and aggregators as
necessary .
Industry analysts have been questioning for years whether Twitter is
financially viable .
Well , maybe it is n’t –maybe this particular kind
of Internet platform is not destined to be a business .
Responsibility
for the platform can be distributed among millions of sites and
developers , while business opportunities can be built on top of the
platform as services in analytics , publicity , and so forth .
Like Google , Twitter and the other leading commercial Internet sites
have made tremendous contributions to the functionality of the
Internet and have earned both their popularity and ( where it exists )
their revenue .
But the end - to - end principle and the reliability of
distributed processing must have their day again , whenever some use of
the Internet becomes too important to leave up to any single entity .

The recession has apparently had a lot to do with the spike in the number of inebriated women who turn abusive .
" The typical case is a single mother who has an alcohol problem and who 's become exhausted by work , " explains Police Sergeant Pekka Hätönen , who 's in charge of the child abuse unit at the Helsinki Itäkeskus police department .
" She might have recently lost her job .
All these pressures become focused on a misbehaving child , and the mother becomes easily enraged and lashes out physically , violently . "
Normally , police are alerted to suspected child abuse through day cares , schools , and social workers .
Prosecution Tough for Kids
In Finland , children under the age of 15 are rarely ever brought into the court room .
Instead , videotapes of police interviews them are shown .
But even conducting an interview with a child is a delicate and difficult task .
Gaining trust is key .
" Before we even go to the video interview room , we try to connect with the child .
We might read Donald Duck or other comic books , play , or even sing together if that feels right .
Sometimes we 've even played with the police badge , " says Hätönen .
Hätönen says that he has heard children describe cruel acts by their mothers .
" One child we interviewed did n't heat up some water enough .
The mother became enraged , boiled the water , and put the child 's hand in it to show how hot the water should have been , " he said .
According to Finnish law and interpretations by the courts , flicking , slapping , and hair - pulling are all forms of mild child abuse .
After a long day at the office , imagine logging onto Facebook to see what your friends have been up to , only to have your boss or colleague message you about an urgent work matter .
Aside from the fact that you are officially off duty , is it appropriate for your co-worker to reach out to you through a social networking forum ?
Was it wise to accept a colleague or higher - up as a “ friend ” to begin with ?
And — perhaps more importantly — in this day and age , when people are seemingly available around the clock because of smartphones and our endless appetite for all things online , is anyone ever really “ off duty ? ”
As Facebook , Twitter and 24 - hour Blackberry access blur the lines between business and personal lives , managers and employees are struggling to develop new social norms to guide them through the ongoing evolution of communications technology .
Wharton faculty and other experts say the process of creating rules to cope with the ever - expanding reach of modern communications has just begun , but will be shaped largely by individuals and organizations , not top - down decrees from a digital Emily Post .
Generational differences in the approach to openness on the Internet will also be a factor in coming to common understandings of how and when it is appropriate to contact colleagues , superiors or clients .
“ There are huge etiquette issues around the new social media , especially the interactive type , ” says Wharton management professor Nancy Rothbard .
“ What if your boss friends you on Facebook ?
That ’s a dilemma .
How do you not accept that friend ?
What if you really are friends ? ”
According to Rothbard , new communications technology is eroding the boundaries between home and office , which creates a “ double - edged sword ” for companies .
“ On the one hand , it enables flexibility .
In some ways , it makes you more effective .
But it can also lead to a lot of burnout .
In the long term , it may lead to conflict about how you feel towards your other life roles and your ability to be fully present in any one domain . ”
For example , a Blackberry can allow parents to attend their children ’s soccer games while remaining in contact with colleagues at the office in case an emergency comes up .
But , she adds , “ you have your Blackberry at your kid ’s soccer game .
That ’s another … line you may be crossing . ”
The explosion in the popularity of Facebook has made the site a key battleground in the struggle to establish consensus on correct social networking behavior .
Rothbard notes that initially , many businesspeople attempted to use LinkedIn for business contacts , reserving Facebook for more personal interactions .
Gradually , however , professional colleagues , clients and supervisors have now become “ friends . ”
Wharton professor of legal studies and business ethics Andrea Matwyshyn had intended to keep her Facebook page strictly personal , but was forced to open it up when colleagues in Europe chose to use Facebook as a means for organizing a conference .
Through that initial group of professional friends , other business contacts began to reach out to Matwyshyn on Facebook .
“ I felt social pressure to build out my social network , because at that point I had about three friends , ” she says .
“ That ’s how Facebook gets you . ”
Multiple ‘ Selves ’
For most people who use Facebook and other social networking sites , says Wharton marketing professor Patricia Williams , “ there is an understanding of the multiple roles we play .
There is the self we are for our friends , a self for our family [ and ] a professional self .
What ’s interesting is the degree to which we are comfortable playing all of those ‘ selves ’ at one time . ”
And that is something that people are not used to doing .
Before the advent of such networks , it was unusual for someone to display a persona that would seem familiar to friends , coworkers and family — all at the same time .
“ I ’ve heard people say that Facebook is for personal friends and LinkedIn is for professional contacts , ” Williams notes .
“ But many of my Facebook friends are my colleagues — people who work just down the hall — and I do n’t have a problem with that .
I do , however , have some discomfort being ‘ Facebook friends ’ with my students , because it gives them access to my personal self that ’s not normally available to them . ”
At the same time , Williams ’ students , especially the undergraduates , have not yet developed a sense of their professional self .
Consequently , she believes , they may be less cautious about the image they project on social networks , even when they may be visible to bosses , clients — or teachers .
Williams and a colleague , Wharton marketing professor Americus Reed II , are conducting research that examines the conflict between individuals ’ various identities , “ such as when my role as a professional comes into conflict with my role as a mother , ” Williams says .
In mixing up personal and professional roles , people can get themselves into embarrassing situations .
“ I think some people are good , and some people are not so good , at finding a balance in these roles ” and keeping information that would be perceived as too personal out of a professional context .
Workplace conflicts have also come up at companies where managers have limited or banned Facebook for being a distraction and monitor employees ’ personal pages for images or comments that might reflect poorly on the business .
At the same time , Matwynshyn says some companies require employees to maintain blogs or to Twitter as a way to market the firm .
Microsoft , she notes , encourages social networking on the job .
“ It all depends on how people use the social media .
For some people , Twitter feeds can be a great business outreach mechanism , and so posting items to Twitter may be considered by some companies or individuals to be part of their job . ”
Social networking can help personalize or humanize a business culture , and many companies have their own Facebook page , she adds .
Generational Approaches
Communications researchers , and the companies that look to them for advice , have a lot to learn about how or if employers should control or encourage their employees ’ use of social networks , according to Williams .
Certainly , employees who are talking about their workplace on Facebook could be considered to be “ exposing the brand , ” which can be good or bad , depending on what aspect of the brand is being exposed .
“ So , the question is whether that is helpful or harmful to the workplace or the brand . ”
Monica McGrath , a Wharton adjunct management professor , says that some of the misunderstanding about social networking is generational .
Older workers and managers may have a Facebook page , but it is not essential to them .
Younger workers now entering the corporate world rely heavily on Facebook , Twitter and other social media to communicate .
“ Right now , there is tension between those two generational approaches , ” notes McGrath .
While networking etiquette is in flux , standards will develop , she predicts .
Typically , business norms evolve through official policy disseminated by organizations and by “ reality ” that bubbles up from the organization ’s grassroots .
“ The question is : How accessible do you want to be ?
[ Today , ] young people want to be very accessible , and in an international corporation you are expected to be available [ around the clock ] .
Time zones mean nothing .
The norms will continue to develop based upon generational leadership . ”
While the norms are in transition , McGrath says she does not think that corporations will try to create standards through official policies .
“ It really depends on the corporate context or even the individual context .
If you are working on an important project and a number of people depend on your input , you would [ want to ] be much more available than if you have finished the project and are on vacation .
The etiquette of that is more dependent on the individual and his or her priorities . ”
McGrath , who is also human resources consultant , says she — like most entrepreneurs — is typically available around the clock .
But “ as long as nothing is perking , ” she turns off her phone .
“ People need to determine what makes sense .
If the boss is up at midnight sending e-mail , some people are okay with that , but other people are not .
If you have family priorities that are different than [ those of ] the boss , you have to work that out . ”
Business consultant Terri Thompson , founder of Etiquette in Action in Paris , Kentucky , says the same idea applies to managing the scope of social networks .
Cautious friending is one way to keep a Facebook page from becoming a business liability , she adds .
“ It ’s not that impressive to have 500 friends on Facebook or Linked In whom you do n’t know , and you do n’t know what they might say . ”
Blackberrys in Meetings
Sigal Barsade , a Wharton management professor , says the uncertainty over access etiquette is the result of fundamental changes that computer - mediated technologies have made to basic human communication .
Much of the confusion is due to the inability to have a reciprocal conversation in the context of , say , Twitter or Facebook postings .
“ So it ’s hard to cue in exactly as to what the etiquette should be at the moment , because it ’s sequential .
The brevity and lack of richness of these computer - mediated technologies make it harder to behave in ways that people are used to . ”
She says there are likely to be two major paths to developing etiquette for today ’s new forms of communication .
One is through the introduction of new people into an organization who bring with them norms that gradually become accepted .
For example , she recalls a student who had worked at an investment bank in New York and transferred to an office in the Midwest .
During a one - on - one meeting with a manager , the newcomer made the mistake of answering his Blackberry .
The manger scolded the transplant , who was baffled because his former manager in New York had always answered his Blackberry during meetings .
For now , Barsade says , the Midwest customs would prevail in that setting , but as others from outside organizations enter , the office ’s subculture is likely to change .
The other way that etiquette around new communication devices is likely to evolve is through social information within the organization .
“ People influence each other , ” she says .
The most important determinants of socialization in any organization are managerial role models .
Workers watch top managers and their immediate supervisors to learn what is accepted and , better yet , rewarded in the organization .
This is more powerful than corporate edicts issued by the human resources department , and even stronger when senior leaders and operational managers are in sync .
“ If this is something senior management cares about , it will be a top - down process , which can be more systematic and effective than a bottom - up process , ” she notes .
Given that power , would n’t managers demand all - access , all the time ?
Not necessarily , says Barsade : “ Senior management is increasingly recognizing the downside to constant availability , and may well need to [ rein ] employees in from over - using the technology .
This can be seen in firms that have days , or times of day , that employees are told not to use computer - mediated technology .
Also , senior management would have to manage being [ on the receiving end ] of that much access , which could be a problem in its own right . ”
Communication ‘ Pecking Order ’
According to Thompson , there is a general “ pecking order ” in the business community when it comes to responding to different forms of communication .
E-mail should be answered within 24 hours and a telephone call returned even sooner .
Social networking sites take the lowest priority .
The order makes sense because a phone call or e-mail seeks specific information from the one individual being contacted .
Social networks come last because , she notes , they are a wide - open forum where communications is less targeted at one individual .
Then there is the question of the professional colleague on Facebook who , while eagerly awaiting your response to a work - related deliverable , notices that you have been busy updating your Facebook page with social news .
Is it proper to call someone out for such an apparent dereliction of duty ?
Again , it all boils down to context , says Williams .
“ I can imagine being in a situation where maybe I need to take a break and blow off steam by saying something on Facebook . ”
Rothbard notes that Facebook itself is not likely to take a role in establishing norms to sort out the conflicts between business and personal friending .
“ I do n’t know if Facebook wants to be Emily Post , ” she says .
Social networking sites might emphasize options that allow users or organizations to tailor their own norms for dealing with problems that can crop up when mixing business and personal communications , she suggests .
Matwyshyn does not expect another site to evolve as a replacement for the highly personal space that once defined Facebook before it was infiltrated by business and professional users .
“ If you have built up 500 Facebook friends , that ’s a sunk cost , ” she says .
“ If you stop using it , you ’re cutting off 500 connections and the switching costs are high .
So , there ’s a stickiness in the use of the application . ”
Meanwhile , the root of many of the awkward situations that arise around the use of Facebook and other social networking sites is giving out too much information , faculty emphasize .
Rothbard says that in face - to - face communications , people are much more careful about the volume and nature of the information they disclose .
On the Internet , however , “ there is a lot of lack of awareness — or obliviousness — about who is receiving this information . ”
Someone using Twitter , for example , may think that only 20 people will read their message ; meanwhile , millions of unknown people may stumble upon the information .
Matwyshyn agrees that users of social networking sites must be more cognizant of the viral nature of their posts , especially in any context where work and private life are intertwined .
“ They have to realize there are potential negative consequences that can flow from coworkers knowing more about you than is prudent . ”
Cellphone use on airplanes , it would seem , is on extended hold in the United States .
The national union representing flight attendants wants Congress to ban in - flight phone calls , and survey after survey of airline passengers shows strong opposition to allowing cellphones on planes .
So while domestic airlines rush to wire their cabins to provide in - flight Wi -Fi connectivity , there is no indication whether , or when , passengers in the United States might be able to make a cellphone call at 37,000 feet .
In much of the rest of the world , meanwhile , passengers on various foreign airlines are already routinely using cellphones and other personal wireless devices to make and receive calls in flight .
Industry officials say cellphones can be used on more than 15,000 flights a month .
Despite dire warnings that cellphone use on planes would unleash social turbulence and possibly even violence in the cabin , there have been remarkably few complaints so far , industry executives and passengers say .

Renault has told the FIA that it will remain in Formula 1 , despite the fall - out caused by the Singapore race - fix controversy .
Although there had been widespread suggestions that the matter , which has resulted in a two - year suspended ban from F1 , could see the French car manufacturer exit the sport , it has emerged the team informed the governing body this week that it was keen to remain in the world championship .
In a statement it submitted to the FIA at Monday 's World Motor Sport Council hearing in Paris , Renault stated : " Renault F1 and its parent company have given serious consideration as to whether it should remain in the sport following the prejudice caused to its corporate image by the conspiracy , in addition to the existing background of financial pressures that have caused car manufacturers to withdraw .
" But it has concluded that it would like to remain in Formula 1 and continue to make an important contribution to the sport . "
Renault also promised to introduce a new team structure in light of the events of last year 's Singapore Grand Prix to ensure there can never be a repeat of what occurred .
Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds - who both face bans from involvement in F1 - have also resigned from the team .
The Enstone - based outfit admitted to the conspiracy - and stated it could never have believed its staff would have acted in such a manner .
Its statement came after internal investigations within the team revealed that there had been a conspiracy for Nelson Piquet to deliberately crash in last year 's Singapore event .
" Renault F1 had no reason to believe that the conspirators were capable of this kind of behaviour .
Clearly the conspirators acted against the interests of Renault F1 and the sport generally , " said the statement .
" If they had applied their minds to their actions , they could not have thought that their actions benefited Renault F1 .
The acts of the conspirators were so outside what they were employed to do and so contrary to Renault F1's interests , they ought not to be attributed to Renault F1 .
This is truly a case where the conspirators were on a frolic of their own . "
It added : " Renault F1 will introduce a new structure within the team and will review its internal procedures in an effort to ensure that this type of incident will never happen again . "

Point 1 : People do n’t know what they want
Time and again , psychological studies have found that we overestimate how happy we will be after winning a prize , starting a new relationship or taking revenge against those who have wronged us .
We also overrate our disappointment at bad test results , disability or failure to progress at work .
Try as we might , we consistently fail to forecast our own emotional reactions , and we even fail to accurately remember our past experiences to be used as guides .
Gilbert says that the main reason for this is an inability to accurately imagine future events .
We can close our eyes and try to picture ourselves in the future but we focus on the wrong things , we predict that our emotions will last longer than they do , and so on .
Some scientists have tried to improve things by training people to mentally time - travel with more accuracy but these attempts have been largely unsuccessful .
Science Blogs
Us trying to understand ourselves is a risky proposition .
First , it freaks us out that our consciousness arises from our bodies , because our consciousness “ feels ” more like a gift from the gods .
Second , we do n’t know ourselves that well .
Third , because we ’re accustomed to measuring everything by impact on ourselves , we reduce the world to a binary : me versus It .
The result is a paranoid , weird , self - important overestimation of all emotional effects .
Point 2 : Everyone has something to lose
A landmark effort to transform Southern California ’s coastal waters into a network of havens for marine life has sparked a fierce debate over where to locate no-fishing zones that ecologists believe are needed to replenish the surrounding seas .
“ Every square foot of the Southern California coastline is somebody ’s favorite fishing spot , ” said Steve Benavides , a tax attorney and diver of 40 years who is among the group of stakeholders hashing out their differences .

That ’s right : you cannot make an omelette without breaking some eggs .
To make intelligent decisions , you need to ruin someone ’s dream .
Oh well — their dream was probably unrealistic then .
Move on , instead of wallowing .
Wallowing is to demand that everyone be represented , which dooms us by another process : the arrival of the stupid .
Stupid people destroy any political system they get their hands on .
Whether it ’s democratic , or autocratic , at some point stupidity prevails .
We need more people who can recognize stupidity and beat it down .
Otherwise , when they arrive , as they inevitably do , they wreck the whole process .

When George P. Shultz took office as Ronald Reagan 's secretary of state in 1982 , his first trip out of the country was to Canada .
His second was to Mexico .
" Foreign policy starts with your neighborhood , " he told me in an interview here in the Canadian capital last ...
I met a woman the other day with a full - time job in the health care industry .
She noted that her 14 - year - old boy was just starting his first year of high school and that he had never been to school before .
As she worked full - time , did her husband stay home to teach the kid ?
No .
They could n’t afford to give up his $ 10,000 + / month income , plus great benefits and a pension .
Had she been home - schooling the kid ?
“ No !
My husband does n’t believe in home - schooling .
Our son has been unschooled .
He does whatever interests him and sometimes asks us questions .
The only thing that we ’ve done is work with him using some standard math textbooks starting at age 9 . ”
How come the kid was going to high school now ?
“ It was his decision .
He really wants to try it out .
We did not want him to go . ”
What did her husband do that he was so adamantly opposed to sending his child to a traditional school ?
“ He ’s been a public school teacher for 15 years . ”
By the time the letter landed in his mailbox six years ago , Ray Moreno had long tried to put the Vietnam War behind him .
He had packed away his Army uniform in 1971 -- and never put it on again after protesters at the San Francisco airport shouted “ baby killer ” at him when he returned from a terrifying year in the jungle .
He had worked for a time in construction , picked oranges and eventually became the supervisor of the Tulare County roads department .
Moreno opened the letter , uncertain of what was inside .
His former commander wanted to know if he would share his memories of one terrible day so men like him would finally receive the recognition they deserved .

But Moreno did not respond .
“ I just wanted to be left alone , ” he said .

This is an account of a desperate battle that no one bothered to name in a war few care to remember .
( end italics )
-- John Poindexter , Troop A , 1st Squadron , 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment

Poindexter , Moreno ’s lanky and debonair captain , had taken charge of Alpha Troop at the age of 25 .
His men numbered about 100 .
Most had been drafted , but Poindexter -- the son of a well - to - do Houston family with a history of military service dating to the Revolutionary War -- had volunteered .
His unit was assigned to a pocket of thick jungle about 60 miles northwest of Saigon , where engineers were rebuilding an old French road that soon would be used to invade Cambodia .
The men lived in their vehicles and ate out of cans .
In the rainy season , the place was like a swamp ; in the dry season , a dusty furnace .
There were almost daily firefights .
In the summer of 1970 , Poindexter left Vietnam and did n’t look back .
He finished graduate school in New York , made a fortune on Wall Street and built a successful manufacturing company in Houston .
Then , 33 years after leaving the war zone , he picked up a book titled “ Into Cambodia , Spring Campaign , Summer Offensive ” and found a two - page account of a bloody rescue mission he had led .
For the first time , he realized that most of the men he had recommended for medals had never received them .
“ All these guys , they had been stiffed by me , ” he said .
“ I assumed that it was done , and I was just dead wrong . ”
Advertisement
In his files , Poindexter had a yellowing carbon copy of an unpublished article he had prepared for a military journal .
The draft contained useful information , but he needed more .
Getting his troops honored would require details , documentation , witness statements , maps .
So he turned to a veterans group for help finding his men .
He needed them to share their recollections of the battle .

Without [ Alpha Troop ] , I and all the men of Charlie Company would be names on a wall in Washington , D.C. ( end italics )
-- Kenneth Woodward , Company C , 2nd Battalion , 8th Cavalry Regiment , 1st Cavalry ( Airmobile ) Division
March 26 , 1970 , was a bad day long before the sun came up .
During the night , the soldiers of Alpha Troop , 1st Squadron , 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment had circled their tanks like a wagon train in the Vietnamese jungle .
But a faulty round inside a mortar carrier ignited , killing three troops and injuring a dozen .
In the morning , a ferocious gun battle erupted less than three miles away .
A company of about 100 infantrymen from the 1st Cavalry ( Airmobile ) Division had stumbled into a North Vietnamese army bunker complex near the Cambodian border .
They were pinned down , outnumbered 4 to 1 , and taking huge casualties .
Helicopters could n’t get in close enough to drop off ammunition or evacuate the wounded .
It seemed the entire company would be wiped out .

Poindexter ordered his men and another company of infantrymen to “ mount up . ”
They were going to rescue those “ grunts . ”

It ’s easy to pick out Vietnam veterans in a crowd whenever a helicopter flies overhead .
It ’s those 50 - to 60 - year - old guys looking up and just staring into a time gone by .

-- Pasqual Gutierrez , Troop A , 1st Squadron , 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment
Advertisement
Gutierrez had arrived in Vietnam as a 20 - year - old staff sergeant -- a “ Shake - ' N ' - Bake NCO ” as the Army ’s fast - track noncommissioned officers were then called .
Within months , the East Los Angeles native was promoted to platoon sergeant , replacing a much older and more experienced man who had been wounded on patrol .
When Alpha Troop set off on the rescue mission , he expected little resistance .
“ Who in their right minds would ever challenge an armor unit ? ” he said recently at the sleek Ontario office of HMC Architects , where he is now an owner and director .
Alpha Troop punched through thick forest for two hours to reach the trapped infantrymen .
When they burst into the firefight , all guns fell silent .
Gutierrez was puzzled to see rows of ponchos on the ground .
They were wrapped up like burritos , he said , with boots sticking out .
Advertisement
With a sickening feeling , he realized that he was looking at dead and injured American soldiers .
Without warning , he heard an explosion and saw a trail of smoke coming at him .
A rocket - propelled grenade narrowly missed his tank .
For an earsplitting minute , Alpha Troop opened up with every cannon and machine gun it had , leveling the trees in front of them .
When the dust settled , the huge enemy bunker complex came into view .
Gutierrez could see shadows flitting between the structures .
As he watched , the nose of a grenade launcher emerged from a bunker , then another and another .
The fight was on .
“ The intensity just never let up , ” Gutierrez said .

A loud explosion spun Gutierrez around in his hatch .
Sgt. 1st Class Robert Foreman , 31 , another platoon sergeant , had taken a grenade to the chest .
Poindexter , in a nearby tank , grimaced as shrapnel struck him .
::
( italics )
Just the day before the battle , I talked with Sergeant Foreman about returning to California to take up life where we had left off .
He had a wife back in Monterey , near Fort Ord .
I wanted to finish getting my BA degree and teacher ’s credentials .
I had enrolled in the Army correspondence program with the University of California at Berkeley .
The books had arrived out in the field .
( end italics )
-- Craig Wright , Troop A , 1st Squadron , 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment
Advertisement
Wright , then a 24 - year - old conscientious objector , was sent to Vietnam as an unarmed medic .
In the heat of battle , he struggled through thick underbrush and whining bullets to reach Foreman .
Peering down the tank ’s hatch , all he could see was a blur of blood and fatty tissue .
“ I told myself not to think about it , ” Wright , now retired in Whittier , wrote to Poindexter years later .
“ It was such a traumatic sight that it would have disabled me . ”
Wright ran to the next tank to wrap Poindexter ’s bloodied hand .
He got back to his own vehicle as a rocket - propelled grenade slammed into the side .
He patched up two faces before accepting help to bandage his own arm .
His new college books were scorched beyond repair .
At nightfall , Poindexter ordered his men to retreat .
The survivors piled the dead and the wounded onto the vehicles .
They had to use flares to see the way .
Advertisement
Although no official tally was recorded , Poindexter said at least seven Americans were killed and 69 wounded in 24 hours .
The next day , the exhausted survivors returned to find the complex abandoned .
The stench of death lingered .
::
Until he started to hear from his former troops , Poindexter had looked back at the battle on March 26 , 1970 , with a commander ’s detachment .
Reading his men’s letters and e-mails , he saw it for the first time through their terrified eyes .
He also quickly realized that he could never get individual awards for all those deserving .
Of those he could find , many reached by letter or phone did not respond .
Others had died .
Advertisement
“ These men were not thanked .
Not all were treated respectfully , ” Poindexter said .
“ For these reasons , I felt we should apply for the Presidential Unit Citation so all could be honored without favor . ”
The blue ribbon , the nation ’s highest honor for a military unit , has been awarded about 100 times since it was created during World War II .
When Poindexter finished compiling the necessary paperwork , the application was 6 inches thick .
Worried that the drama would be lost in the dry and bureaucratic language required on military forms , he tucked in “ The Anonymous Battle , ” a book he had compiled with his men ’s letters and his own article .
Finally , in April , a package containing the Presidential Unit Citation arrived in the mail at Ft. Irwin in Southern California .
As is the custom , it was issued to the current members of Alpha Troop .
But on Tuesday , the men who fought so bravely 39 years ago were honored at ceremonies at the White House and Pentagon .

For the first time since he returned from the jungle , Moreno pulled out his old war medals and pinned them to his suit .
The diminutive man , with a shy and gentle demeanor , took his place with Gutierrez , Wright and more than 80 other Alpha Troop members in the White House ’s Rose Garden .
President Obama told the graying ex-soldiers , some of them in wheelchairs , that the treatment of Vietnam veterans has been a “ national disgrace . ”
“ One of the saddest episodes in American history was the fact that these vets were often shunned and neglected , even demonized when they came home , ” Obama said .
“ And on days such as this , we resolve to never let it happen again . ”
Moreno listened solemnly .
Barely 19 when he was drafted , he had spent most of his adult life fleeing the stigma of being a Vietnam vet .
Tormented by nightmares , he refused to discuss the experience even with his wife .
Advertisement
“ I am proud of it now , ” he said , offering his hope that no other veterans would go through what he did .
“ The men and women who serve should always be treated with honor . ”

Back in April , the Obama administration announced a big shift in missile - defense priorities :
It would move away from ambitious , technologically shaky " boost phase " defenses , and pour more money into fielding anti-missiles that might actually stop an attack from Iran or North Korea .
This week , those retooled defenses get a big test – in Israel .
This week , the United States and Israel kicked off a major air - defense exercise that will test scenarios including coordinated missile barrages launched from Iran or from Syria , as well as shorter - range rocket attacks by Hezbollah or Hamas .
The exercise , Juniper Cobra , is part of a series of biannual war games that dates back to 2001 , but it 's worth watching closely for several reasons .
First , there 's politics .
Brig .
Gen. Doron Gavish , commander of the Israel Air Force ’s Air Defense Division , said in a press conference that the exercise was not related to Iran 's continued missile tests and enrichment of nuclear fuel .
“ It is a carefully designed exercise that has been taking place for years . ”
But Ha'aretz describes the drill as " preparation for a faceoff with Iran . "
Case in point : Juniper Cobra includes a major civil - defense exercise that will test readiness against a catastrophic missile strike against an Israeli city .
As part of the contingent of 1,000 U.S. troops taking part in the exercise , the Ohio Army National Guard 's Chemical , Biological , Radiological , Nuclear and high - yield Explosive Enhanced Response Force will take part ; the Guardsmen have been training with the Israeli Home Front Command as part of the exercise .
Some of the Obama administration 's favored missile - stoppers will also be deployed for the exercise , including the Army ’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) and the Navy ’s Standard Missile - 3 ( SM - 3 ) , part of the sea - based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense .
The deployment of THAAD – pictured here in a 2006 test – is particularly important .
“ This unique system intercepts in an transitional area between earth ’s atmosphere and space to include a range of 20 miles below and above the 62 mile or 100 kilometer line , " said Riki Ellison , a prominent missile - defense advocate .
" None of the current or future deployed missile defense systems intercept in this vertical space .
Because of this vertical engagement area capability , the THAAD system can take multiple shots and use the atmosphere to strip off debris and countermeasures to better target the incoming warhead .
The larger land - based missile defense system , the GBIs [ Ground - Based Interceptors ] as well as the sea - based missile defense system , the Aegis and SM - 3 , intercept above the 100k line at a higher altitudes in space , while the Patriot System ground - based system intercepts missiles in air below the atmosphere . ”
The AN / TPY - 2 radar – the powerful X - band radar that is part of the THAAD system – was deployed to Israel last year .
Military officials have discussed tying this land - based radar to missile - defense ships offshore , creating a more mobile and flexible missile - defense system with wider coverage .
Finally , the exercise looks to be a pre-test of Iron Dome , a system being developed to provide defense against the short - range rockets like those fired by Hezbollah at northern Israel during the 2006 Israel - Lebanon war or the Qassams fired by Hamas from Gaza .
While not fully operational , Iron Dome is also supposed to be integrated into the drill .
Writing at Esquire , Tom Barnett teases out the implications for Israel .
" After almost a quarter - century of quiet cooperation with the Americans , Israel is now on the verge of perfecting a multi- layered missile - defense shield that protects against short - range rockets coming out of southern Lebanon and Gaza , plus anything Iran can toss its way , " he writes .
" Not only will Israel remain on the map following a potential first strike , it 'll have second - strike capabilities secure enough to wipe off the map any fantasy - league roster of neighboring Islamic regimes you care to name . "

Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful civilian purposes Russian PM Vladimir Putin has warned against military action targeting Iran or imposing new sanctions to curb its nuclear programme .
Iran 's latest proposals on its nuclear ambitions have brought diverging views from the US and Russia .
Earlier , a US official told the BBC that Washington was unhappy with the proposals , submitted on Wednesday .
Correspondents say parties involved are making their positions clear ahead of the UN General Assembly this month .
President Barack Obama has given Tehran until the end of September to respond to his friendlier overtures or face new sanctions .
But the US and Israel have never ruled out the option of air strikes on Iran to stop it acquiring an atomic weapon .
In contrast to Washington 's negative response on Iran 's new proposal , Russia 's foreign minister described them as a positive step forward and ruled out sanctions on Iran 's oil sector .
Terror warning Mr Putin , speaking in Moscow , said any attack on Iran would be " very dangerous , unacceptable " and would lead to " an explosion of terrorism " .
" I doubt very much that such strikes would achieve their stated goal , " he added .
However , Mr Putin called on Tehran to " show restraint " in its nuclear programme .
" This is a dangerous region and Iran should show responsibility , especially by taking into account Israel 's concerns , " he said .
The five - page Iranian proposal was submitted to the group of six global powers negotiating over its nuclear enrichment programme - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , plus Germany .
Mr Putin has warned Iran to show restraint in its plans Details have been published on the website of the US non-profit investigative journalism group , ProPublica .
In it , Tehran offers to hold " comprehensive , all - encompassing and constructive " negotiations on a range of security issues , including global nuclear disarmament .
But the document makes no mention of Iran 's own nuclear programme .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Friday he was seeking an urgent meeting with Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili , after consulting the six powers .
" We are in contact with Dr Jalili 's office to arrange a meeting at the earliest possible opportunity , " he said in a statement .
" We are all committed to meaningful negotiations with Iran to resolve the international community 's concerns about their nuclear programme . "
French foreign ministry spokeswoman Christine Fages said they wanted the meeting to take place before the UN General Assembly on 23 September .
Philip Crowley , US Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs , earlier told the BBC's World Today programme that Iran had to prove it was ready to live up to commitments it had made .
" Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core issue of the international community and the core concern , which is Iran 's nuclear ambitions , " he said .

What are these ?

A press release from the American Institute of Mathematics two weeks ago announced that all the congruent numbers up to 1 trillion have been enumerated .
Two questions leap to mind .
What the heck is a congruent number ?
And who cares ?
I ’ll return to those questions .
But first I ’d like to pause just a moment to marvel at the idea of calculating anything up to 1012 .
A few decades ago , such a project would have been unthinkable .
Today , counting to a trillion takes only an hour or so , even on plain vanilla hardware .
This is truly one of the wonders of the age , and we should n’t grow too blasé about it .
But the computation of all those congruent numbers involved a lot more than looping through “ +1 ″ a trillion times , and it took considerably longer than an hour .
Okay , so what ’s a congruent number ?
I would like to sidle up to that question rather than face it straightaway .
The definition is not hard to understand — it ’s all about right triangles with rational side lengths and integer areas — but when I started looking into this story , it took me a while to appreciate why those particular triangles might be worth thinking about .
Let ’s begin with Pythagorean triples — sets of positive integers ( a , b , c ) that define a right triangle , with a and b giving the lengths of the legs and c the hypotenuse .
The familiar ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) triangle is everybody ’s favorite example .
For which right triangles with integer side lengths is the area also an integer ?
That ’s easy :
All of them .
The area of a right triangle is ab / 2 ; in any Pythagorean triple either a or b ( or both ) must be an even number , which implies that ab / 2 is a whole number .
For the ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) triangle the area is ( 3 × 4 )/2 = 6 .
Knowing one such triangle , we can make more .
Lots more .
Just multiply a , b and c by any integer k , which has the effect of multiplying the area by k2 .
If k = 2 , we get the ( 6 , 8 , 10 ) triangle with area 24 ; k = 3 yields the ( 9 , 12 , 15 ) triangle with area 54 , and so on .
The resulting sequence of triangles is infinite but not very interesting ; all the larger triangles are just scaled - up versions of the original , like photographic enlargements .
We can view the entire infinite series as a single class of triangles , and take the smallest member of the series as the prototype .
That smallest triangle is given by a primitive Pythagorean triple — one where a , b and c have no factors in common .
It turns out there are also infinitely many primitive triples .
Euclid bequeathed us an algorithm that will generate all of them , if you let it run forever .
Given this infinite set of infinite series of triangles , it ’s clear that infinitely many integers can be the area of a Pythagorean triangle .
But that certainly does n’t mean that every positive integer has this property .
For example , there ’s no Pythagorean triangle with an area of 5 .
To convince yourself of this fact , just measure the area of every integer - sided right triangle with legs no longer than 10 .
None of those triangles has an area of 5 , and no triangle with longer integer legs can have an area that small .
In principle , the same laborious but reliable procedure could be applied to any integer N to determine whether or not it is the area of some Pythagorean triangle .
Here are the first few integers that appear in such an enumeration ( sequence A009112 . ) :
6 , 24 , 30 , 54 , 60 , 84 , 96 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 , 216 , 240 , 270 , 294 , 330
Rational triangles .
Suppose we relax the constraints a little , allowing the sides of a right triangle to be rational numbers — either fractions or integers but not irrational values such as the square root of 2 .
The area is still required to be an integer .
A first question is whether right triangles with fractional sides and integer areas even exist .
Maybe the cupboard is bare ; maybe there are no such triangles .
But no , they do exist .
Here ’s a proof by example :
There ’s no trickery here .
If you ’re in any doubt , do the arithmetic ; you ’ll find that the numbers define a genuine right triangle ( the Pythagorean theorem holds ) and the area really is exactly 7 .
At last we have arrived in the realm of congruent numbers .
A congruent number is an integer that ’s the area of a right triangle with rational sides .
All integer - sided right triangles are included in the category , along with those whose sides are rational fractions .
Here ’s a more formal definition :
A positive integer N is congruent if there exist rational numbers a , b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2 and ab / 2 = N .
All the same questions we were asking about Pythagorean triples also come up in this new context .
Where do we find rational triangles with integer area , or how can we manufacture them ?
Which integers N can be the area of such a triangle ?
Answers are n’t quite as easy to come by in this case .
In particular , the strategy of enumerating triangles from the smallest up wo n’t work , because there is no smallest rational triangle .
There are other ways of imposing an ordering on the rationals , but none of them lead to a good algorithm for enumerating congruent numbers .
So where did I get the example illustrated above ?
I did n’t just stumble upon it by trying random rational triangles .
Note that multiplying each rational side length by the common denominator of the fractions will return us to the land of integer - sided triangles .
For the example shown , multiplying through by 60 yields a ( 175 , 288 , 337 ) triangle ; these numbers have no factor in common , so they form a primitive Pythagorean triple .
The area of the new triangle is 7 × 60 × 60 , or 25,200 .
Thus we ’ve recovered an integer triangle from a rational one ; what ’s more important , the process can be reversed to derive rational triangles from integer - sided ones .
I mentioned a Euclidean method for generating primitive Pythagorean triples .
It goes like this :
Take any two positive integers m and n that satisfy the following conditions :
m > n ;
one of the numbers is odd and the other even ;
the numbers are coprime ( no common factors other than 1 ) .
Then ( 2mn , m2 – n2 , m2 + n 2 ) is a primitive Pythagorean triple .
By counting through all suitable values of ( m , n ) starting with ( 2 , 1 ) , all primitive triples are generated .
A postprocessing step built atop Euclid ’s procedure will generate congruent numbers .
The plan is to produce a primitive Pythagorean triple and calculate the area N = ab / 2 of the corresponding triangle .
If the area is “ square - free ” — that is , it has no pairs of repeated prime factors and thus cannot be divided evenly by a perfect square — then we ’re done ; that value of N is a congruent number and cannot be reduced to a smaller congruent number .
But if N is not square - free , we can divide out each square factor , leaving a smaller triangle with rational sides and integer area , and thereby generating another congruent number .
A worked example : The ( m , n ) pair ( 5 , 4 ) produce the primitive triple ( 9 , 40 , 41 ) , with area N = ( 9 × 40 ) / 2 = 180 .
Thus 180 is identified as a congruent number , but it is not square - free ; it factors as 22 × 32 × 5 .
We can therefore divide the area by 4 and the sides by 2 , producing a shrunken ( 9/2 , 20 , 41/2 ) triangle of area N = 45 .
In this way we learn that 45 is also a congruent number , but again it is not square - free .
Dividing the area by 9 and the sides by 3 yields the ( 3/2 , 20/3 and 41/6 ) triangle with area N = 5 .
And so 5 , too , is congruent ; it ’s also square - free and therefore cannot be reduced further .
There is no smaller triangle similar to the ( 9 , 40 , 41 ) triangle that has integer area .
This scheme can produce an unlimited supply of congruent numbers .
Unfortunately , it ’s not so well suited to answering the question of whether a particular integer is congruent .
The problem is that the congruent values are not generated in order from smallest to largest .
If we turn the crank for a while and discover that a certain integer N appears in the algorithm ’s output , then we know for sure that N is congruent .
But if N has not shown up , we ca n’t conclude that it is not among the congruent numbers ; we might simply have to wait longer for N ‘s turn to come .
When I turn the crank on my own little program for generating congruent numbers , these are the first 101 values to pop out , in order of appearance :
6 , 30 , 60 , 15 , 84 , 21 , 210 , 180 , 45 , 5 , 330 , 630 , 70 , 924 , 231 , 546 , 504 , 126 , 14 , 1320 , 1560 , 390 , 840 , 1386 , 154 , 2340 , 585 , 65 , 1224 , 306 , 34 , 990 , 110 , 2730 , 3570 , 1710 , 190 , 2574 , 286 , 4620 , 1155 , 5610 , 5016 , 1254 , 2310 , 1716 , 429 , 7140 , 1785 , 7980 , 1995 , 3036 , 759 , 4290 , 7956 , 1989 , 221 , 10374 , 10920 , 8970 , 3900 , 975 , 39 , 7854 , 11970 , 1330 , 14490 , 1610 , 11550 , 462 , 4914 , 6630 , 12540 , 3135 , 19320 , 4830 , 6090 , 4080 , 1020 , 255 , 11856 , 2964 , 741 , 18480 , 23184 , 5796 , 1449 , 161 , 25200 , 6300 , 1575 , 175 , 7
Here ’s the same list sorted into ascending order of magnitude :
5 , 6 , 7 , 14 , 15 , 21 , 30 , 34 , 39 , 45 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 84 , 110 , 126 , 154 , 161 , 175 , 180 , 190 , 210 , 221 , 231 , 255 , 286 , 306 , 330 , 390 , 429 , 462 , 504 , 546 , 585 , 630 , 741 , 759 , 840 , 924 , 975 , 990 , 1020 , 1155 , 1224 , 1254 , 1320 , 1330 , 1386 , 1449 , 1560 , 1575 , 1610 , 1710 , 1716 , 1785 , 1989 , 1995 , 2310 , 2340 , 2574 , 2730 , 2964 , 3036 , 3135 , 3570 , 3900 , 4080 , 4290 , 4620 , 4830 , 4914 , 5016 , 5610 , 5796 , 6090 , 6300 , 6630 , 7140 , 7854 , 7956 , 7980 , 8970 , 10374 , 10920 , 11550 , 11856 , 11970 , 12540 , 14490 , 18480 , 19320 , 23184 , 25200
The problem , again , is that we ca n’t conclude anything about the numbers that do n’t appear in this collection .
For example , 13 is absent , even though it is in fact a congruent number ; it just does n’t turn up until we get well down the list — it comes from the 49,485th triangle examined , which has sides ( 780/323 , 323/30 , 106921/9690 ) .
On the other hand , 8 is unlisted because it is not congruent ; it will never show up in the output hopper no matter how long we keep cranking away .
Here are the first 101 true congruent numbers ( sequence A003273 ) :
5 , 6 , 7 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 34 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 41 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 101 , 102 , 103 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 , 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 , 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , 137 , 138 , 141 , 142 , 143 , 145 , 148 , 149 , 150 , 151 , 152 , 154 , 156 , 157 , 158 , 159 , 161 , 164 , 165 , 166 , 167 , 173 , 174 , 175 , 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 184 , 188 , 189
Ancient history .
The search for congruent numbers does not stretch back all the way to Pythagorus or Euclid , although Diophantus apparently considered a couple of special cases .
L. E. Dickson ’s big history of number theory attributes the first full statement of the problem to “ an anonymous Arab manuscript , written before 972 . ”
Other sources cite the works of Abu Bakr al - Karaji , a mathematician who worked in Baghdad at the end of the 10th century .
A couple of centuries later Fibonacci , who straddled the Arabic and European worlds , had more to say about the problem in his Liber Quadratorum .
Later still , Pierre de Fermat proved ( in a marginal note , for which he had sufficient room ! ) that 1 is not a congruent number .
( The proof extends to 4 and 9 and 16 and all other square numbers , none of which are congruent . )
These early writers formulated the problem in a somewhat different way than the rational - triangle scheme explained above .
Given an integer N , they asked whether it ’s possible to find three perfect squares in arithmetic progression with the interval between the squares equal to N .
In other words , they sought a number s2 such that s2 – N , s2 , and s2 + N are all perfect squares .
For example , if N = 24 , then the solution is s = 5 ; the three perfect squares are 25 – 24 = 1 , 25 , and 25 + 24 = 49 .
The two versions of the problem — the integer - area right triangles and the squares in arithmetic progression — are equivalent , although that ’s not exactly obvious .
Here ’s the connection : If a2 + b2 = c2 and ab / 2 = N , then setting s = c / 2 guarantees that s2 – N , s2 , and s2 + N are all perfect squares .
( For the algebraic exercise proving this , see the book by Neal Koblitz cited below . )
By the way , the squares - in - arithmetic - progression version is where we get the term “ congruent numbers . ”
The three numbers s2 – N , s2 , and s2 + N are all congruent modulo N. For example , 1 , 25 and 49 are all congruent to 1 modulo 24 .
If you ask me , “ congruent numbers ” is a poor excuse for a name , and is particularly confusing in the context of triangles , where “ congruent ” has another meaning altogether .
But after a thousand years I suppose it ’s too late to fix it .
“ Karaji numbers , ” anyone ?
By 1915 , all the integers up to 100 had been classified as either congruent or noncongruent .
But as recently as 1980 , when Ronald Alter wrote a brief review of the status of the problem , there were still 189 square - free numbers less than 1,000 for which the question of congruence remained unsettled .
Then everything changed in 1983 .
In that year the nature of the congruent - number problem was transformed by Jerrold B. Tunnell of Rutgers , who not only found a better way to calculate congruent numbers but also showed why it ’s worth the effort to do so .
From right triangles to elliptic curves .
Before I go on , a warning : I am about to walk up to the blackboard with a piece of chalk in my hand and impersonate one of those masterful , self - confident lecturers who rattle off long trains of equations , invent lemmas on the fly , and always come to QED just as the blackboard fills up and the class ends .
In my case any such air of mastery is a complete illusion ; I ’m just learning this stuff as I go along .
But I ’ll do my best to make it an entertaining illusion .
So here goes .
It ’s not hard to see that any product of perfect squares is also a perfect square : a 2b2c2 = ( abc ) 2 .
Therefore , if N is a congruent number , and s2 – N , s2 , and s2 +
N are all squares , we can set the product of these three factors equal to another square ; call it y2 .
Thus we get the equation :
y2 = ( s2 – N ) s 2( s2 + N ) .
Multiplying the three terms on the right , this becomes :
y2 = ( s2 ) 3 – N2s2 .
Now perform a simple substitution of variables , setting s2 = x :
y2 = x3 – N2x .
This is the equation of an elliptic curve — another mathematical object with a really unfortunate name .
An elliptic curve looks nothing like an ellipse .
Here ’s the graph of a particular elliptic curve , the one for N = 6 :
The two pieces of the blue line mark the locus of all points ( x , y ) that satisfy the equation
y2 = x3 – 36 x .
And the hot pink dot ?
That marks a rational point on the curve — a point where x and y both take on rational values .
( Insiders , I ’m told , call it a ratpoint . )
Specifically , the dot identifies the point x = 25/ 4 , y = 35/ 8 .
If you care to plug those numbers into the equation , you ’ll find that indeed 1225 / 64 = 15625/64 – 225 , and so the point does lie on the curve .
Tunnell , elaborating on earlier work of Kurt Heegner , showed that N is congruent if the elliptic curve y2 = x3 – N2 x passes through a certain kind of point on the ( x , y ) plane .
Specifically , we have to search for points whose x and y coordinates are both rational numbers , but we ignore the three points with y = 0 .
Then the x coordinate of the point has to satisfy three more conditions .
Letting x = u/v , we require that :
u and v are perfect squares ,
v is even ,
u has no factors in common with N .
If we can find just one point on the curve that matches all these properties , then we can generate an infinity of other rational points .
Moreover , the existence of such a point implies , according to Tunnell ’s theorem , that N is congruent .
( The hot pink point above clearly qualifies . )
Thus the congruent - number problem appears to be solved :
We have an unambiguous criterion for deciding if a given N is congruent or not .
Just construct the corresponding elliptic curve and check the ratpoints .
Regrettably , we ’ve been set up for yet another disappointment .
Searching for rational points on elliptic curves is a task for which we have no efficient general method .
We ’re really no better off than trying to generate all Pythagorean triples .
But wait !
We ’re not done yet .
From the properties of elliptic curves , Tunnell derived yet another criterion — and this one turns out to be the key to a simple and practical test .
It all hinges on the number of integer solutions to some quadratic equations that on first glance appear to be arbitrary strings of symbols plucked out of thin air .
The criterion is this :
If N is a square - free congruent number , and if N is odd , then the number of integer solutions to the equation N = 2x2 + y2 + 8z2 must be exactly double the number of integer solutions to N = 2x2 + y2 + 32z2 .
( If both equations have no integer solutions , the condition is satisfied , since 2 × 0 = 0 . )
For even N , the two equations are slightly different , but the test works in exactly the same way .
The graphic above shows the 361 square - free numbers up to 1,000 that pass the Tunnell test .
The height of each dot indicates the number of integer solutions to the equation N = 2x2 + y2 + 8z2 ( or the corresponding equation for even N ) .
The two values of N with 160 solutions are 689 and 761 .
( It ’s curious that in most cases — 308 out of 361 — the number of solutions is actually zero .
I do n’t know what this means or whether that pattern continues with larger N. ) [ See Update 2009 - 10 - 10 , below . ]
What sets the Tunnell criterion apart from all the others is that we can actually carry out the test in a reasonable and predictable amount of time .
For any given N , counting the solutions should be doable in time proportional to N3/2 , simply by trying all integer values of x , y and z less than the square root of N .
So that ’s it , right ?
Problem solved at last ?
Well , no , there ’s still a small hitch — a bit of awkward fine print .
Tunnell proved that if N is square - free and congruent , then the criterion on the number of integer solutions must be satisfied .
This much is unconditionally true .
But what about the converse ?
If the criterion is satisfied , can we be certain that N is a congruent number ?
In this direction , the proof is not unconditional .
It ’s contingent on a proposition known as the Birch–Swinnerton - Dyer conjecture , which is widely believed , and supported by an abundance of empirical evidence , but still unproved .
Which leaves just enough doubt to make the game still interesting .
Why should anyone care about this stuff ?
On first acquaintance , the search for congruent numbers sounds like one of those mathematical pastimes that appeal to amateurs ( like me ! ) but do n’t really command the attention of the research community .
There are so many kinds of cutely named numbers out there — perfect , amicable , lucky , happy — and not all of them carry deep significance .
The congruent numbers might well be just another amusing sideshow .
But it turns out they ’re not .
There ’s serious mathematics here , enough to engage the interest of serious mathematicians .
Elliptic curves have been a focus of intense scrutiny for decades .
Henri Poincaré studied them in the early years of the 20th century .
In the 1920s Louis Mordell proved a theorem about the rational points on elliptic curves :
Even when there are infinitely many points , they all come from a finite set of “ generators ” ; the number of generators and hence the number of infinite families is called the rank of the curve .
In the 1950s Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura , with later refinements by André Weil , worked out a conjecture about elliptic curves and another class of mathematical objects , called modular forms .
Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor proved part of that conjecture in the course of settling Fermat ’s Last Theorem in the 1990s ; the rest of the Taniyama - Shimura conjecture has since been proved as well .
And now we have the Birch–Swinnerton - Dyer conjecture , one of the famous million - dollar math problems .
I ’m not going to try to explain the conjecture in any detail — I ’ve used up all my chalk , and probably my readers ’ patience , too — but I think the basic idea goes something like this .
On the one hand we have an elliptic curve , drawn in the ( x , y ) plane .
On the other hand we have something called an L - function , which is defined on the plane of complex numbers .
Think of the L - function as an undulating landscape with mountains rising above the plane and submarine canyons deep under it .
The topography of this surface is determined in part by points selected from the elliptic curve , so there ’s a connection between the two objects .
The conjecture formulated in the 1960s by Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton - Dyer says that the shape of the L - function in the neighborhood where it passes through zero gives us information about the rank of the elliptic curve and thus about the number of rational points .
There ’s an analogy between the BSD conjecture and an even more celebrated problem on the million - dollar list , the Riemann hypothesis .
The zeros of the Riemann zeta function ( which is much like an L - function ) , carry information about the distribution of prime numbers .
The Birch–Swinnerton - Dyer conjecture invites us to suppose that the zeros of L - functions of certain elliptic curves tell us something about the distribution of congruent numbers .
Incidentally , the BSD conjecture must be one of the earliest products of computer - driven experimental mathematics .
The numerical explorations that led to the conjecture were done with the EDSAC , the pioneering electronic computer built at the University of Cambridge .
The trillion triangles .
Hand - waving about elliptic curves and L - functions might provide vague a rationale for interest in congruent numbers , but one part of the story I still did n’t get was why anyone would bother to compute mass quantities of congruent numbers .
So I asked Michael Rubinstein of the University of Waterloo .
Rubinstein had earlier computed the congruent numbers up to 109 , and it was his challenge that provoked the recent thousandfold expansion of the inventory .
Rubinstein explained :
I ’m interested in the statistical distribution of congruent numbers .
A few years ago , Brian Conrey , Jon Keating , myself , and Nina Snaith came up with a prediction for the asymptotic number of congruent numbers up to x , akin to the prime number theorem .
This prediction grew out of remarkable models created by the same researchers and David Farmer for related elliptic curve L - functions that were inspired by random matrix theory and based on a number of unproved assumptions .
The prediction is that the number of congruent numbers less than x , arising from even - rank elliptic curves , is asymptotically $ $c x ^{3/4} \log ( x ) ^ { 11/8 } $ $ where c is a constant .
Our model does n’t let us completely nail down the constant c , and the data will help us understand what the correct constant is .
The asymptotic behaviour stabilizes at a logarithmic rate , so going to 1012 is only 50 percent better than going to 108 .
It will also provide a good amount of data for studying the statistics of ‘ higher rank elliptic curves ’ in the family of elliptic curves related to congruent numbers .
The correct model to use for higher rank elliptic curves is not really understood , and the billions of congruent numbers found will end up yielding several million higher rank curves with which we hope to gain insight into the statistics of higher rank curves ( compared to just thousands of higher rank curves from earlier computations ) .
The enumeration of the trillion triangles was done by two teams .
William Hart of the University of Warwick and Gonzalo Tornaria of the Universidad de la Republica in Uruguay ran their program on a computer called Selmer at Warwick .
Mark Watkins of the University of Sydney , David Harvey of the Courant Institute and Robert Bradshaw of the University of Washington used the SAGE computer at Washington .
The strategy of the computation is based on the Tunnell criterion , but it turns out there ’s a better way to go about it than explicitly counting the number of integer solutions to those various quadratic equations in ( x , y , z ) .
Tunnell showed that all the information about the number of solutions could be encoded in a formal power series , which looks like this :
\ [ A( q ) = a_ { 1} q^ {1} + a_ { 2}q^{2} + a_{3}q^{3} + a_ { 4}q^{4} + ... \]
It ’s a “ formal ” series in the sense that we do n’t actually care about evaluating the sum for any particular value of q ; instead , we just want to know the various coefficients a i .
This is how the Tunnell criterion gets encoded in the series :
If a i is zero in this series , and if i is a square - free number , then i is congruent .
( Actually , there are two separate series , one for odd i and one for even i. )
The odd and even power series are generated by a couple of formidable - looking products .
Here ’s the one for the odd series :
\[A(q) =q\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1-q^{8n})(1-q^{16n} ) \left(1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2q^{2n^2}\right ) \]
Since both the overall product and the sum in the third factor call for infinitely many values of n , we ca n’t multiply out this whole expression .
Fortunately , though , it turns out that larger n contribute only to higher coefficients , and so we can compute early terms in the series without worrying about what might happen later .
Kent Morrison notes that taking just the factors
\ [ q(1- q^8 ) ( 1- q^ {16} ) ( 1- q^ {16} ) ( 1+2q ^2+2q ^8+2q^{18} ) \ ]
is enough to generate all the odd congruent numbers up to 25 .
Those five factors expand to :
\[ A(q ) =q^1+2q^3+q^9-2q^{11}-4q^{17}-2q^{19}-3q^{25}+...\text{ higher terms}\ ]
The terms missing from this series — those with a zero coefficient — are just the odd square - free congruent numbers in this range : 5 , 7 , 13 , 15 , 21 , 23 .
The big computation by Bradshaw et al. used essentially this same scheme , with a few refinements and optimizations .
The challenge is that when you ’re trying to compute all the terms of the series out to a 1,000,000,000,000 q1,000,000,000,000 , you wind up multiplying some enormous numbers .
I do n’t mean just that the numbers are too big to fit into the registers of a 32 - bit or a 64 - bit computer .
They ’re too big to fit into the main memory of a computer with 128 gigabytes of RAM .
Moreover , the arithmetic has to be done exactly ; approximations are useless .
Thus a major part of the effort in setting up the computation was devising efficient “ out of core ” multiplication routines for ridiculously large numbers .
The basic algorithm was a fast - fourier - transform method .
And the result ?
Up to 1012 , the computation identified 3,148,379,694 square - free congruent numbers number candidates with N in the residue classes 1 , 2 , and 3 modulo 8 .
I look forward to reading more about the analysis of their distribution .
[ See Update 2009 - 10 - 10 , below . ]
References and resources .
Two weeks of reading and tinkering have not made me the master of this subject .
For those who would like to explore further I can offer some resources I ’ve found helpful , listed in no particular order .
Special thanks to David Farmer for alerting me to this story in the first place and to Michael Rubinstein for help understanding what it all means .
Update 2009 - 10 - 10 :
In the comments , Barry Cipra points out that the quadratic equations in the Tunnell criterion necessarily have no solution whenever N is congruent to 5 , 6 , or 7 modulo 8 .
In fact all of the zero-solution points in the graph I presented above come from such N. Numbers in the residue classes 0 and 4 modulo 8 cannot be square - free .
If we plot only those N that are square - free and congruent to 1 , 2 or 3 modulo 8 , we are left with just 53 square - free congruent - number candidates up to 1,000 :
Only the numbers in these three residue classes were included in the trillion - triangle computation .

The Arab European League is to be prosecuted for carrying a cartoon which discriminates against Jews on its website , the Dutch public prosecution department said on Wednesday .
The AEL put the cartoon back on its website last month after the public prosecution department decided not to take action against a number of potentially insulting cartoons .
The department said tv programme Nova and politician Geert Wilders will not be prosecuted for publishing the controversial Danish cartoons which poke fun at Mohammed .
The department said reproducing the 12 cartoons , which led to worldwide unrest when published in a Danish newspaper in 2006 , is not punishable by law because they target Mohammed not Muslims in general .
Double standard
However , the AEL was told it did face prosecution unless it removes a cartoon featuring two men in suits discussing how to boost the number of people killed during the holocaust .
That cartoon does ‘ insult Jews because of their race and / or religion ’ because it implies Jews themselves invented the idea that six million were killed during World War II , the department said at the time .
Although the cartoon had been taken off the AEL ’s website three years ago , the league decided to republish it to highlight the double standards operating in society .
‘ The AEL does not think any of the cartoons should be subject to prosecution , ’ the organisation said in a statement .
Should the AEL be prosecuted ?

Unix オペレーティングシステムの動向」という内容で発表を行なった。その時の予稿を読み返してみると、こんなことが書いてある。
BSD Unix は、多くの大学や研究機関において、長い間研究開発のプラットフォームとして利用されきた。もちろん、それは
BSD がオペレーティングシステムとして優れた機能を持っていたからであるが、それ以外に、すべてのユーザがシステム全体に関するすべてのソースを持ち、それを自由に改変し、情報交換を行うことが可能であったという点は忘れてはならない。多くのユーザの研究成果は、CSRG
によって正式リリースに取り入れられ 、BSD 自体を改良するために貢献するという再生産の機構がうまく働いていたのである。
( 中略 ) 今日、ネットワークニュースから流れてくる記事を眺めていると、「パスワードを入力するときに画面に表示させないためにはどうするのですか?」といった質問が少なくない。以前であれば、このような疑問を抱いたユーザは、間違いなく passwd コマンドのソースを見つけ出し、stty によってそれが解決することをたちどころに探り当てたはずだ。商業
Unix の普及はこのような優れた教育環境をユーザから奪い、代わりに膨大な量の関連書籍やマニュアルを生み出した。ユーザは多すぎる参考文献の中から自分の探す答えを見つけ出さなければならない。
僕 は1983年に就職し VAX - 11 上の 4.1BSD で新人研修を受けた。当時は、主記憶1M、ディスク1Gに満たない VAXを100人近いユーザで共有する環境だった。
その後、サンマイクロシステムズが1983年に Sun-2、1985 年に Sun - 3 を発売して以来、国内外のメーカーから相次いでワークステーションが発売され、Unix 環境は多くのエンジニアの身近なものになった。しかし、これらのワークステーションには、システムのソースコードが付随していなかったので、最初からワークステーションで育ったエンジニアは、Unix にはソースコードがあって当り前という環境を経験できなかったことになる。
ウィキペディアによれば、 「オープンソース」という言葉が使われ出したのは1998年からだそうだ。Linux
1.0のリリースは1994年なので、1990年代半ばから、数々のLinux や FreeBSD、NetBSD、OpenBSD
などのオープンソースをベースにした開発環境が、一部のマニアな開発者だけではなく、一般的なプログラミング環境としてに使われるようになったはずだ。
「失われた10年」という言葉は、日本経済では1990年代初めから2000年代初めのバブル崩壊後の期間を指すそうだが、Unix エンジニアにとっては、この1985年から1995年頃が「失われた10年」だったように思う。技術の進歩は、豊かなハードウェア環境の代償として、ソースコードへのアクセスという肝心のものをエンジニアから奪ってしまったのである。
梅田望夫 氏は著書 「 ウェブ進化 論
」の中で、次の10年を変える三大潮流として「インターネット」
「チープ革命」とともに「オープンソース」を挙げ、こう書いている。
もともとプログラマーが書いたプログラムそのものであるソースコードとは、開発した企業の企業秘密そのものであって問外不出の知であったわけだが、その閉鎖的な知だったソースコードが、オープンソース化によってインターネット上に溢れるようになった。その結果、世界最高峰のプログラマーが書いて世界中で利用されているプログラムのソースコードを、誰もが自由に読んで勉強することができるようになった。オープンソース化は、「プログラムを書く」ことを学ぶための高速道路を一気に整備してしまったのである。
この意見にはおおいに賛成である。しかし、一般のプログラマがどの程度「直接的」にオープンソースの恩恵を受けているかというと、ちょっと疑問なのだ。
一体、今時どれだけのプログラマがカーネルやシステムプログラムのソースコードを読んでいるだろうか。そもそも、開発コミュニティに属していない一般のユーザで、ソースコードをダウンロードして持っている人など、ほとんどいないのではないだろか。
原因の一つは文化的なものだろう。失われた10年の間に、人々はコンピュータにはソースコードがあって当り前という文化自体を忘れてしまったのだ。あることは知っていても、そんなものを見るのは一部の開発者だけだと思っているのだろう。ウェブシステムの開発をしていながら、Apache のソースを見たこともないプログラマはざらにいるはずだ。
もう一つの原因は量である 。Unix カーネルに限っても 、4.2BSD
でネットワークコードが追加されて以来、ソースコードの量が格段に肥大してきた。もはや、オペレーティングシステムの開発に携わるプログラマであっても、システムの全容を把握しているのはほんの一部だと思われる。アプリケーションまで含めれば膨大な量になってしまう。
僕はやはり、すべてのプログラマが、いつでも好きな時に自分が使っているすべてのソフトウェアのソースコードに簡単にアクセスできるのが理想だと考える。そういう環境が当り前になれば、ユーザの意識も自然とそれにあったものに変わっていくはずだ。
オープンソース時代初期には、それを実現するにはディスク容量が問題だった。いかにソースが公開されていると言っても、個々のマシンにそれをすべて置いておくには容量が不足していたのである。しかし、今ならラップトップにだって入ってしまうだろう。ほとんど必要ないし、使うか使わないかわからないけど、いつでもそこにある。そのことが重要なのだ。
そうすれば量の問題は技術で解決できるかもしれない。検索エンジンに端を発するウェブ2.0時代の「知の世界の秩序」化は、開発環境にも応用できるはずだ。失われた10年の後、オープンソース時代10年を経て、すべての利用者や開発者がソースコードの恩恵をもっと直接的に享受できるような次の世代の環境を模索していく必要性を強く感じるのだ。
Who knew the humble Windows Notepad was capable of anything other than , well , taking text only notes .
If you ’re searching for a simple application to write a diary or take daily notes , look no further than Notepad .
So , what ’s new you ask ?
Well , with this tip you can make notepad automatically add the current day and time to a document as soon as you open it and save you the headache of doing so yourself .
To accomplish this :
Open Notepad ( START -> Run->notepad.exe )
Type “ .LOG ” on the first line of the new document .
Save the file and close Notepad .
Now when you open the same file again , you ’ll see that Notepad would have added the current Date and time to the document automatically .
Write your entry for the day and close the file .
Everytime you open the file , Notepad will add the current timestamp on a new line saving you the effort to do the same .
Overweight and obese people may be more at risk from swine flu .
( Image : Ciaran McCrickard / Rex Features )
AS IF people struggling with obesity did not have enough to worry about , they now face a new health hazard .
According to statistics from the US , overweight people appear more likely to die of swine flu .
Most of the people who have died from H1N1 swine flu have had an underlying health problem that weakened their ability to fight off the virus .
Among the conditions recognised as increasing the risk from flu are hypertension , diabetes , chronic lung obstruction and coronary disease .
Now …
In the last 36 hours , the US Marines have banned Twitter use , the NFL has banned Twitter , and now comes news that ESPN will only let employees
Tweet if , you know , it ’s not about sports .
What ’s next ?
Shaq ca n’t tweet about random acts of Shaqness ?
CNN ca n’t tweet about news ?
I ca n’t tweet about blog posts and blog about tweets ?
What is the world coming to ?
In all seriousness , ESPN could not be more shortsighted in it ’s gagging of employees and in it ’s approach to Twitter .
Let ’s look at the internal memo which they thankfully ( foolishly ? ) released .
Via Deadspin :
Specific Guidelines
· Personal websites and blogs that contain sports content are not permitted
· Prior to engaging in any form of social networking dealing with sports , you must receive permission from the supervisor as appointed by your department head
· ESPN.COM may choose to post sports related social media content
· If ESPN.com opts not to post sports related social media content created by ESPN talent , you are not permitted to report , speculate , discuss or give any opinions on sports related topics or personalities on your personal platforms
· The first and only priority is to serve ESPN sanctioned efforts , including sports news , information and content
Assume at all times you are representing ESPN
If you would n’t say it on the air or write it in your column , do n’t tweet it
Exercise discretion , thoughtfulness and respect for your colleagues , business associates and our fans
· Avoid discussing internal policies or detailing how a story or feature was reported , written , edited or produced and discussing stories or features in progress , those that have n’t been posted or produced , interviews you ’ve conducted , or any future coverage plans .
· Steer clear of engaging in dialogue that defends your work against those who challenge it and do not engage in media criticism or disparage colleagues or competitors
· Be mindful that all posted content is subject to review in accordance with ESPN ’s employee policies and editorial guidelines
· Confidential or proprietary company information or similar information of third parties who have shared such information with ESPN , should not be shared
Any violation of these guidelines could result in a range of consequences , including but not limited to suspension or dismissal . ”
“ Prior to engaging in any form of social networking dealing with sports , you must receive permission from the supervisor as appointed by your department head . ”
Twitter and social media helps to pass content along and inform viewers of upcoming programming .
This is free advertising !
That fans want to read !
Bill Simmons constantly pimps ESPN ’s fantastic upcoming documentary series ’ 30 for 30 ′ .
Is this a bad thing for ESPN ?
” The first and only priority is to serve ESPN sanctioned efforts , including sports news , information and content . ”
My favorite one .
On ESPN besides the oft - mentioned Simmons , ( who is going to have the biggest name on my tag cloud soon ) Marc Stein and Ric Bucher tweet about in progress reporting before a story is ready for submission .
While this might sound a little dangerous , they use their news judgment as experienced professionals , to decide what little nugget would be simultaneously interesting to readers and harmless to divulge .
Why does ESPN insist on treating their employees like irresponsible children ?
“ Assume at all times you are representing ESPN .
If you would n’t say it on the air or write it in your column , do n’t tweet it ” More of the same .
ESPN has a history of taking itself too seriously .
On a March 27th B.S. Report podcast with his boss John A. Walsh , Simmons shared five gripes about ESPN and the first one was that ESPN could have a better sense of humor about itself .
Walsh agreed .
but he did n’t reallyaddress the concerns .
This is an example of outdated thinking and is exemplified in their approach to employee tweets .
Twitter has many different applications , especially for a giant media company , and its shocking that they would n’t want to embrace this .
Social media connoisseur , Chris Brogan put it this way :
“ You can use your robot feeds to blurt out posts and showtimes and stuff , but if you want connectivity to people , engagement to your content , and a sense of participation on the social web , making people only talk about ESPN is a quick one - way ticket to “ who cares ? ”
Over at Deadspin the writer chronicled how ESPN employees were scared to send over the memo and believed that Bucher was “ flagrantly testing ” the new policy .
Simmons tweeted “ My take on the great unspoken : Ultimately it ’s good if ( redacted ) incorporates ( redacted ) .
Had to start somewhere .
I trust @rfking ( ESPN.com editor - in- chief ) .
So there . ”
Too bad we ’ll never know if that ’s what he really thinks .
UPDATE : I do n’t think my post is what did it but …ESPN responds to backlash and criticism .

わかる ！ＦＸ解説
FXのことをきちんと理解したい場合、何を参考にすれば良いでしょうか。
辞書でしょうか 、Wikipedaでしょうか。
辞書は簡潔に 、Wikipediaはものすごい文字量で詳細に解説してくれています。
ただ・・・どちらも何を言っているのかサッパリ分かりません。
あれだけを見ても、なぜ利益が出るのか、なぜ損失が出るのか。
どうすれば利益を出し続けることができるのか。
何を注意すれば良いのか。
といったことはFXの「え」の字も分からない人は、どうやっても理解できません。
情報量は多ければ良いというものではないのです。
書店で売ってい るFXの書籍はどうでしょうか。
いろいろな本が並んでいますね。
FXのことを一から説明しているような本も少しはありますが、基本的に書籍は勝つための方法です。
基本くらいは分かっている人を対象に書かれていますから、辞書やWikipedaよりはだいぶ良いですが、「FXとは」から知りたい人にはまだ少し敷板が高いです。
基本の 「き」から知りたい人にお勧めなのは、FXをサービスとして取り扱う業者・証券会社のホームページです。
これらの業者は、金融法によって顧客に商品の詳細とリスクを「理解させること」が義務づけられていますから、誰にでも分かる文章とイラスト（動画のこともあります）で、FXについて説明してくれています。
またFX特有のスワップ、スプレッド、ロールオーバーといった基本用語から、実際のトレーダーがトレードのことを話すときに使うボラティリティ、反発、利確、損切りといった用語やボリンジャーバンドやRSI、MACDといったインジケーターの内容まで網羅しているところもあります。
まずは証券会社のホームページに目を通し、そこからステップアップして知識を身につけていくと良いでしょう。
では、辞書 やWikipedia、書籍がダメなのかというとそんなことはありません。
媒体にはそれぞれの役割があります。
辞書などは、そのものの包括的な定義を残す役割があります。
書籍には書籍代に見合った具体的な稼ぐ方法を教える役割があります。
・・・もっとも本当に稼げるようになるかはまた別の話ですけどね。
On Wednesday evening , the President of the United States of America addressed a joint session of Congress ; there is no more solemn setting , and it was , and remains , a legitimate question as to whether this was the right venue for this speech .
I am not convinced that it was , for reasons that will take time to explain .
Presidents very rarely do this .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it only once — to declare war on Japan .
Lyndon Johnson did so , after the assassination of President Kennedy .
George W. Bush did so , after the 9/11 attacks .
And perhaps most tellingly , Bill Clinton did so to speak about health care reform .
It was not an auspicious setting for an intractable public debate .
On the one hand , President Obama runs the genuine risk of media overexposure .
Just 233 days into his presidency , and just two days after an enormous and unnecessary flap over his broadcast address to American schoolchildren , this President once again intended to use the bully pulpit to address the nation and to try to shift the terms of the current debate .
The speech started strong , incredibly so , then bogged down first in partisanship and some rather surprising open heckling , then drifted into a mind - numbing sea of details and fact - checking , then finished with a stirring call to public responsibility and , very nearly , “ the better angels of our nature . ”
But by then the rhetorical moment had passed .
The speech would have been more effective if it went from the strong beginning to the rousing finish , from a history lesson to a reminder of the kind of character we the people aspire to possess .
The details , like the horse - trading , is better done off stage .
What made the beginning of the speech so compelling was that it hung the current debate on a history , a surprisingly long history .
The current US President reminded us that it was Theodore Roosevelt who first proposed health care reform , and thus chastised us into the realization that we have been at this , episodically and with little stomach for it , ever since .
But the darker side of this important reminder came quickly to the surface :
If we ’ve been at this for so long , why have we achieved so little ?
What is really counseling against reform ?
Another major story in today ’s news cycle offers a chilling answer to this question .
And it is not the “ rugged individualism ” that Roosevelt so perfectly embodied , and that President Obama acknowledged appreciatively in his speech .
Not at all .
Care and compassion have ever been the flip - side of the long American experiment in self - reliance .
No , the simple answer is unapologetic and state - sponsored capitalism .
The answer involves the simply shocking fact that ever since the Civil War the US court system has bent over backwards to protect businesses as if they were people .
“ Is n’t a corporation really like an individual , under the law ? ”
On this same solemn day , the US Supreme Court began an unusual second round of public hearings .
The case originally involved an anti-Hillary Clinton “ documentary ” that was produced during the 2008 presidential campaign .
In the spring of 2009 , the Supreme Court declined to rule on the question of whether broadcasting the film violated our new campaign finance regulations .
Instead , the High Court invited the lawyers to come back to address a much larger legal question :
Should current campaign finance laws be jettisoned entirely ?
In the words of PBS ’s Gwen Ifill , “ So how do we go from a case that involved this movie called ‘ Hillary : The Movie , ’ how did that morph into a huge assault on campaign finance law ? ”
An interesting question , and we have some interesting resources with which to answer it .
It is unusual for the US Supreme Court to release audio recordings of their questioning , but they did so today , and the revelations were revealing .
The answer to my question became clear in the course of Chief Justice Roberts ’s insistent questions .
The question he kept pressing on those arguing incampaign finance laws and against the ( anti ) Clinton video was a strange one :
“ Is n’t a corporation really like an individual , under the law ? ”
And it occurs to me that it is this very confusion that has hamstrung reasoned debate about health care reform for the past several months .
In short , health care is about the care of people .
But our legal system is organized to care for , and to protect , corporations as if they were people .
A business thus has the same rights and protections that a person does .
This is a system tailor - made for plutocracy .
And plutocracy is what bedevils any and every attempt at aggressive , and therefore meaningful , institutional reform .
This subtle equation — between individuals and corporations — is the subtle sub - text to the current health care debate .
And there is a history to that equation , one that goes back quite a bit further than Teddy Roosevelt ’s abortive gestures toward health care reform .
( He did better with National Parks , which is telling , in itself — we seem to care more clearly for Nature than for The People ) .
It all goes back to the Civil War , and its aftermath .
The crowning legislative achievements of that War were the Thirteenth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .
Of the three , the Fourteenth was the most ambitious and far - reaching .
It was adopted on July 9 , 1868 , and Section One reads as follows : Section 1 .
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
These provisions announced an entirely new and altogether bold conception of democratic citizenship in a post - enslavement Republic .
Religious groups on all sides of the issue were especially vocal in their various and conflicting advocacies .
But the end result was plain : no State can do what the Federal government says you cannot do to an individual citizen .
States rights do not trump individual rights .
And there are a lot more people who count as citizens , now .
“ Due process ” … “ equal protection ” … the Court placed itself in the business of defending these sacrosanct institutional ideas and the people they were designed to protect .
In short , “ the era of big government was just beginning . ”
The problem is that this same Amendment was immediately put in the service , not of persons who were citizens , but rather in the service of businesses that were almost surreally re-defined as “ persons , ” in the context of this bloody , war - won Amendment .
So businesses received the protection of “ due process , ” and recognition as “ persons , ” even as freed blacks languished under Jim Crow .
The promises of “ equal protection ” waited until 1954 to be delivered by the US Supreme Court to persons of African descent .
To put it very plainly : corporations counted more as persons than “ we the people ” did .
The next two sections of the Fourteenth Amendment were more mundane and predictable : Section
Two redefined how we distribute numbers of representatives state - by - state , by “ counting the whole number of persons in each State , excluding Indians not taxed ” ; and Section Three excluded from future service any member of the government who had previously sworn an oath of office to the State and then joined the Confederacy in open rebellion .
Predictable stuff , really .
After winning the War , Washington intended to re-draw the electoral map and to prohibit southern states from electing popular war heroes back to Congress .
That ’s slightly power - mongering , but certainly benign enough , after the carnage of enslavement and Total War .
It is Section Four of the Fourteenth Amendment that should cause a contemporary US citi Section 4 .
The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned .
But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void .
Translated ?
The US government respects and pays it debts , even and especially its war debts .
That ’s a constitutional requirement , now .
But we will not take on , and we will not permit the individual states that have been forced back into the Union to pay , debts that we deem to be unjust .
Justice matters , even in economic matters , and justice demands the settling of ( certain ) accounts .
There is a chilling message in all of this .
Our history is an ambivalent and ambiguous and violent one .
It has worked against justice as often as not .
A War waged in part over the question of federalism , and in part over the questionable justice of human enslavement , ended in the drafting of a constitutional amendment intended to answer both questions , once and for all .
And what happened ?
The protections intended for the people , real persons , especially persons who had not fully counted as persons until 1865 , were applied instead to big new businesses , like railroads and oil and steel .
Corporations were quite literally re-defined as “ persons ” under the Fourteenth Amendment .
And lest we miss the deep interest Americans have always had in commerce and in debt , the Amendment continues by distinguishing between just and unjust debt .
But that judgment is squarely in the eye of the indebted beholder .
We have been living in that world ever since .
The contest and the collisions between the rights of sick persons and the rights of sick corporations has continued apace .
Is there money for the wars , or for corporate bailouts , or for health care reform ?
The debate over which debts are just and which are not is , amazingly , perennial and intractable .
And since those questions have not come to rest in our time , neither has the endlessly deferred debate over health care reform .
Until the conditions of that debate are changed , real progress is unlikely .
And so long as corporate and business interests continue to select and define the terrain on which we fight our battles , the partisan bickerings will go on without end , and without reasonable hope for justice , or for victory .
October 17th marked the celebration of Diwali among Hindus and other groups around the world .
Diwali is also known as the " Festival of Lights " ( the name translates as " row of lamps " in Sanskrit ) .
The festival marks the homecoming of Hindu God Rama to Ayodhya after a 14 - year exile in the forest following his victory over Ravana , and signifies the victory of good over evil , of light over darkness .
Celebrants observe Diwali with fireworks , colorful lanterns , lamps , garlands , sweet treats and worship .
Collected here are a handful of photographs of Diwali this year .

Political and social conflicts among groups exist in all human societies .
In many societies , groups come to be seen as deleterious to the well - being of the majority or , sometimes , a powerful minority .
How this happens and the character of the pernicious qualities projected onto such groups vary enormously .
When it does , people can deem the perniciousness of such populaces to be so great that they want to neutralize them by eliminating the group or by destroying its capacity to inflict putative harm .
So they employ any of the five principal means of elimination : forced transformation , repression , expulsion , prevention of reproduction , or extermination .
But , whatever means they choose , the desire and the attempt to eliminate peoples or groups should be understood as the core problem .
Precisely because these eliminationist means are functional equivalents , perpetrators typically use several of them simultaneously .
The Turks did so for the Armenians .
The Germans did so for the Jews .
The Sudanese have done so for their victims , and so did the Serbs .
Alisa Muratčauš , former president of the Association of Concentration Camp Torture Survivors in Sarajevo , explains that the Serbs " aimed to eliminate all Bosnian people . "
Yet they used a variety of means : " Some people will be expelled to another country , a Western country .
Some people would be killed .
Some people will be [ kept ] alive for maybe [ the Serbs ' ] personal needs .
Who knows ?
Maybe like slavery . "
Whenever we see these large - scale violent assaults , such as expulsions or incarcerations mixed together with killing , we should immediately recognize them as being eliminationist assaults ( which could also expand into much larger - scale killing ) and respond to them with all the vigor that we ought to apply to genocides .
And we should certainly not sit on our hands with pointless debates about definitions -- does it qualify as genocide ?-- as we have done with the former Yugoslavia and Darfur .
We should realize that the non-lethal aspects of eliminationist assaults are as critical to combat as the killing itself .
Appreciating this helps to make clear that the problem we are confronting is even more vast and more urgent .
Genocide and eliminationism should no longer receive the third - rate treatment that they currently do from our politicians :
They should be at the core of present and future international policy - making .
Beyond appreciating its breadth , there are two other crucial facts we need to recognize about eliminationism .
First , it is a form of politics .
Like war , eliminationism is the extension of politics by other means .
Political leaders use eliminationist measures to maintain or further power , socially and politically transform a country , defuse a real or putative threat , purify a society according to some ideological blueprint , or achieve any of many other aspirations .
Mass murder and elimination are thus politics not in a superficial sense , but at their core , because they are purposeful , calculated acts of leaders meant to achieve political goals .
They are an integral part of the repertoire of political leaders , always in principle available , and , in our time , frequently used .
It is precisely because eliminationism is such a successful form of politics -- those employing it almost always effectively carry out the eliminationist task -- that political leaders have adopted it so often during the last century and this one .

In the video below , a soldier claims she has trained with California police to set - up checkpoints and force vaccinations on the public .
Those who refuse will be boarded on a bus and taken to a concentration camp .
She includes a photo of an RFID device she claims will be used to track people and materiel .
She says the military and police will use electronic bracelets to track the vaccinated .
Former Kansas state trooper Greg Evensen underscored this claim last week .
“ Have you been made aware of the massive roadblock plans to stop all travelers for a vaccine bracelet ( stainless steel band with a micro- chip on board ) that will force you to take the shot ? ” Evensen wrote on July 29 .
“ Refuse it ?
You will be placed on a prison bus and taken to a quarantine camp .
What will you do when your children are NOT allowed into school without the shot ?
What will you do when you are not allowed into the workplace without the vaccine paperwork ?
Buy groceries ?
Go to the bank ?
Shop anywhere ??
Get on a plane , bus or train ?
Use the toilet in the mall ?
Nope .
Police officers will become loathed , feared , despised and remembered for their ‘ official ’ duties . ”

Disclaimer : I love all weddings equally .
Let ’s face it : weddings are quite the money pit .
The average US couple spends $ 20,398 to culminate their eternal union .
No matter what way you cut this five - digit figure , it ’s an exorbitant amount to spend for just several days of celebration .
Almost reckless , even .
Or , at the very least , socially irresponsible .
Unless you are a diehard believer in the trickle - down effect .
From my perspective , which is that of an immature penurious male , it seems like there are sundry ways to cuts costs , and I mean CUT COSTS .
Forget About Paying For Location
I ’m not suggesting you have your wedding on the street or inside your house , but why pay for a romantic spot that means little if anything to you ?
It blows my mind that couples will spend thousands to exchange vows somewhere they ’ve never even visited !
But for some reason this makes sense to the lovebirds because hundreds , if not thousands of couples , have consummated their love in the exact same impersonal and meaningless locations .
Instead of getting married in the nave of some stuffy church , or at the top of some building with breathtaking views of downtown ; instead of paying for three hours at the botanical garden , or some overpriced historical landmark , why not choose a spot that is actually relevant to the life you ’ve built with your loved one ?
Do you have a favorite spot you visit to sit and watch nature , maybe with a bottle of wine , block of cheese , and mountain fresh bread ?
What about a storied tree that has witnessed your passion for each other grow ?
Or a secret and enchanted location with low traffic and scant footprints ?
Oftentimes the places that come to mind are free to use .
Granted , they may not come with seats and tables , but those can be gotten inexpensively .
Make Your Own Invitations
How many wedding invitations have you gotten in the mail and loved so much that you want to keep forever stored in a drawer ?
I have gone so far as to take pictures of each one , but they all end up in the same place .
Some are elaborate and diaphanous with their vellum paper and fancy initials layered like geological strata .
Others are self - made and without the frills .
Take a look at this post on How to Make Handmade Paper .
Although both serve to communicate a momentous occasion , namely , your wedding , in the name of this post , the latter is the way to go .
Rent That Dress
Rather than convince yourself you must buy a wedding dress and have it tailored to your figure , why not rent one for around $ 50 per day ?
On the downside , you wo n’t get to keep the gown , but what are you going to do with it in your closet after the wedding is over ?
If it ’s acceptable for grooms to rent their tuxedos , why not keep things symmetrical and rent that dress ?
Of course , there ’s always the option to do without tux and gown .
Do n’t feel pressured to conform to the standard that the little plastic couple atop wedding cakes set .
Get married in clothes that say who you are .
Get creative if you have to .
Make it personal and , most importantly , make it reasonable .
Crop The Photographer
With digital cameras and snappy fingers , everyone is a photographer .
If you do n’t already own a camera , invest in one before the big day since it ’ll probably come in handy for the conjugal life and its vacations .
Put someone you know in charge .
Give them a small token of appreciation once they take x amount of photos , where x is some large number .
Also , ask everyone to upload the photos they take to a flickr account devoted to your wedding .
That way everyone gets to see the photos without a corporate watermark or size restrictions .
They can also download them and print them reasonably .
Or they can enjoy them online to minimize printing and paper costs .
Scrap The DJ
Unless you have a close friend or relative with turntables , a DJ is superfluous and strange .
Put together a comprehensive playlist .
Like the location and the dress , make your playlist relevant to the life you share with your loved one .
If you are n’t a music lover like everyone else in this world , do a quick search for [ great wedding playlists ] and pick and choose from lists like this one and this one .
Microbrewed Beer and Two - Buck Chucks
I know an open bar is great , but it ’s also gratuitous .
While your guests will attempt to get their money ’s worth in drinks , most will not come close , and those that do will be a wedding spectacle , if not poisoned .
Depending on the magnitude of your party , get 2 - 3 kegs of really tasty beer and several cases of two - buck chucks .
That ’ll do the trick and then some .
Have it in Jackson , Minnesota
If you must have a special and impersonal location , if you must buy a dress , if you must have a photographer and DJ and an open bar , then go ahead and do it all in Jackson , Minnesota .
These are the average costs of weddings by select US zip codes :
Chicago , Illinois , 60622 = $ 16,981 and $ 28,302
Miami Beach , Florida , 33140 = $ 24,325 and $ 40,541
Ocean Beach , California , 92107 = $ 21,418 and $ 35,697
Houston , Texas , 77024 = $ 16,216 and $ 27,027
Jackson , Minnesota , 56143 = $ 9,944 and $ 16,573
Blue Hill , Maine , 04614 = $ 17,899 and $ 29,832
Phoenix , Arizona , 85003 = $ 15,910 and $ 26,517

This blog gives an insiders view into the Action Sports and Music world across Europe .
As a part of our day - to - day activities at KAOS , we report here on the stuff we come across that we think is important or irreverent and worth making a noise about .
Enjoy .
Not having much luck with the PR profession lately .
Let 's take the case of Stuart Bruce of Wolfstar Consultancy .
In July of this year , Stuart came to us with his weblog StuartBruce . biz which he wanted to move from Typepad to WordPress rather urgently .
He dropped the future work promise very early :
Just need to move the A PR Guy 's Musings blog .
It is quite highly ranked so it is important that the permalinks move properly .
As I run a global PR company specialising in social media I might potentially have other WordPress development work in the near future .
Fortunately I do n't fall for that kind of talk anymore .
" Future work " is kind of like the guy on the first date promising that it 's not just a one - night stand .
No worries .
We aim to help people get out of Typepad .
Typepad to WordPress is not really a money maker for us in comparison to the other work we do , as it is such painstaking work ( thanks Anil ) .
We just want to help others get out of the nightmare situation of having years of their lives locked into a limited and rotting system ( the so called improvements actually made Typepad worse and less search engine friendly , i.e. numbered images ) .
We do get lots of additional work from the people we help from Typepad to WordPress , as they are invariably impressed at the smoothness of the move and how quickly they are reindexed in Google and how pleasant and helpful our team is .
We work hard at this .
No reason on this earth that web designers and programmers should be unhelpful and incommunicative .
There is no obligation for follow - up work .
We 're happy to help .
But we are not happy not to be paid .
Nor are we happy to have to send out a manhunt to get paid .
Not only did Stuart Bruce not pay his invoice , he just disappeared without saying thank you or even letting us know the job was finished .
Repeated contact brought absolutely no response .
Apparently Stuart Bruce does n't think much of web designers .
Here 's what he wrote about why decided to go with Typepad instead of WordPress back in 2005 ( emphasis mine ) :
I ’ve experimented with both Movable Type and WordPress but decided to go with Typepad because that ’s what I ’m already using for several clients .
As it has the ability to import / export posts I can always change the platform later .
Despite the recent problems with Typepad I still have faith in it .
It remains a good solution for small businesses and organisations ( although the Yahoo Movable Type offering might present a viable alternative ) .
Movable Type and WordPress might both be better , but a business that does n’t have an IT person needs something that it much easier to install and maintain .
Even in 2006 , he 's still cursing technology and throwing around the geek epithet ( emphasis mine ) :
Typepad – despite the outages it is still the best platform to introduce people and if used with your own mapped domain is ‘ business grade ’ for SMEs / SMBs .
Unless you are a geek or have an IT department to support you then WordPress.org and Movable Type are just too hard .
Most SMEs / SMBs are n’t geeks , do n’t have an IT department and do n’t have time to mess around .
Time is more precious than 0.0005 % annual server downtime !
Stuart , you 'd like your clients to hire professional PR people ( who for inexplicable reasons generally cost far more than competent help setting up a weblog or even a good designer ) but not competent tech support ?
Properly set up WordPress will do wonders for your search engine results .
A strong design will do wonder for your branding .
WordPress can serve as a full - blown website with advanced programming integrated into the core .
Check out our Canadian life insurance site for what can be done in WordPress , so there is room to grow .
Unlike in Typepad where you run into a brick wall as soon as you want to leave the blog format .
WordPress is built on open source so your data remains your own and does n't get surreptitiously encoded into the SixApart data hoard from which it is nearly impossible to rescue it .
In any case , Stuart Bruce is not using Typepad anymore .
Being cheap up front cost him a fair amount of money ( although very little trouble as he engaged us for Typepad to WordPress ) to get out of Typepad .
Stuart did have a nice site as we set it up until he decided to go the DIY route and put in one of the worst contact form plugins I 've ever seen ( the original source is here for perusal and posterity : hopefully Stuart will correct this after he reads this article - free tips , saving money on his IT bill again ) .
Free IT Tips for Stuart Bruce / Wolfstar Consultancy
Stuart :
You'd have more luck with WordPress if you 'd had us build your contact form .
Your pages are 70 % unnecessary gunk for your shoddy DIY contact form Stuart .
Stuart : your site is throwing a lot of 500 errors .
If you had n't cheaped out and gone with 1and1hosting .com you would n't have those .
No need to blame WordPress for the shoddy hosting you chose .
I hope for the sake of his clients that Stuart makes better tech recommendations when they are paying the freight than he does for himself .
Leaving WordPress , Typepad and the web behind , I have a few general business tips for Stuart Bruce and Wolfstar Consultancy .
Free General Business Tips for Stuart Bruce / Wolfstar Consultancy
Tip # 1 : when you ask for special consideration , it 's considered good form to say thank you for a job well done .
Tip # 2 : when you ask for special consideration , pay your bills promptly .
Tip # 3 : when employing an SEO company ( poor you Stuart , you thought we were just a bunch of web coolies to stomp on ) , do n't try and pull a runner .
Tip # 4 : Do n't have old - school English biddies from your accounting department give lectures on " how things are done in England " , i.e .
" We only pay paper invoices , not online ones . "
You had no problems paying the deposit , I do n't see why it was so difficult to pay the balance .
Tip # 5 : Do n't have your assistant lecture said director of web design and SEO company about how busy you are : " Stuart Bruce is a very busy man and director of this company .
He does n't have time to correspond with suppliers . "
Thanks for nothing , Stuart .
Chasing you around for payment for two months was actually worth more than the price of your order .
Martin also really appreciated working over the weekend on your rush job and then receiving neither private thanks nor public acknowledgement .
I hope your clients treat you better than you treat your suppliers .

The problem with OOL is not the OO .
Carl Sassenrath , CTO
REBOL Technologies

Article # 0425
Main page || Index || Prior Article [ 0424 ] || Next Article [ 0426 ] || 34 Comments || Send feedback
This article is in response to reboler Ratio who posted a few comments related to OOL in my R3 article about Concluding on object creation .
And , it 's a broad enough topic that it deserves its own article .
Perhaps you know of my history in OOL .... which began in the early 1980's when I was alpha testing Smalltalk at HP , which was from Xerox PARC .
( But , it should be noted in fairness , I was also programming on an MIT Lisp Machine during those same days ... not in Smalltalk of course . )
For more than ten years , I was a strong believer in OOL .
A bit of a fanatic actually .
At Apple ATG , I worked with many from the Xerox Smalltalk team , and we pushed for stronger models of OO within software designs .
And , we resisted as much as possible the introduction of C++ , which in fact Larry Tesler jokingly called it C+- ( approriate , actually . )
In its purest form , OO is a model of associating behavior with state ( function with data ) .
Originally , back in 1982 , it seemed like a good idea because real world objects had specific actions related to them .
A pen was used to write and draw .
A pencil was used to write and draw .
We thought , " Wow , there 's a pattern , and it seems to be quite natural . "
However , it was a false model .
A pen does not write and draw , it takes a human to make a pen write and draw .
The actions of write and draw do not belong to the pen .
OOL is not a complete solution .
Too many of the behaviors of objects come from ( or are influenced by ) sources that are external to their encapsulated definitions .
After ten years , I concluded that OOL was not the answer -- but it was more from the practical reality that everywhere I used OOL it made my code more complex and more difficult to create , maintain , and improve .
Whenever I used pure OOL , I lost productivity .
( But , if I simply used OO concepts , even without an OOL , such as in the Amiga OS or REBOL kernels , it made the programming model cleaner and easier to understand . )
I realize that in today 's programming world , I am a heretic .
OOL is ingrained within the fabric of nearly all modern software , justified in terms of cost savings , but rarely withstanding any detailed cost analysis of that claim .
Joe Armstrong ( Erlang ) once said " The problem with object - oriented languages is they�ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them .
You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle . "
However , I think that statement is incorrect .
The problem is much deeper than that .
The problem with OOL begins when you try to encapsulate behaviors , that almost always have external influences , and cracks or divisions begin to occur within the class definition .
It breaks apart , and quickly the situation becomes pathological ( diseased ) .
The idea of implicit environment ( large or small ) is a good one .
That 's what we call context in REBOL , and it 's the cornerstone of the language .
That part of OO is fine .
( And in fact it 's the reason there 's an ' O ' in the word REBOL .
Also , it sounds a lot better than REBCL . )
As humans our thoughts and our languages exist within layers of context , a hidden framework , the primary environment of interpretation .
Without that context , thinking and communicating would be impractical .
So , that is what we mean when we talk about objects in REBOL .
It 's about the context of interpretation , and the fact that we really do want that environment wrapped around our expressions .
It makes communicating ( i.e. programming ) so much more efficient .
I do n't think you 've ever heard me make claims about REBOL being an OOL in the classical sense of the definition , but more of a variation on the idea .
It supports many OOP practices , but we do n't beat the drum that these are necessarily the best methods to solve problems - really , we prefer language - oriented - programming ( of which DSL is an important part . )
So , I think at a fundamental level , we agree .
PS : I should also link this old Eric S. Raymond article , Unix and Object - Oriented Languages .

Finding an apartment in Manhattan can be tough .
Just ask the Metropolitan Transportation Authority .
Next year , dozens of New Yorkers in some of the city ’s wealthiest ZIP codes are set to be evicted to make way for the long - delayed Second Avenue subway , and federal law requires the transit agency to find them comparable new homes .
So far , it has not been going so well .
Dave Zigerelli was told to consider low - income housing across from an on -ramp to the Queensboro Bridge .
The first apartment shown to Nicolle Poian was half the size of her own .
Ann and Conrad Riedi , ensconced in the same rent - stabilized apartment for 40 years , said they were encouraged to move out of Manhattan  and their dog , Biscuit , might not be allowed to come along .
“ They told us to think outside the box , ” said Ms. Riedi , 64 .
The Riedis ’ apartment , a big three - bedroom in a stucco - walled walk - up , is one of 60 homes on the Upper East Side that will soon be converted into ventilation shafts , public stairwells and electronics hubs , the infrastructure for the $ 4.5 billion underground line , scheduled to open in 2017 .
The transportation authority said that it was doing its best to accommodate residents who want to stay in the neighborhood , and that no one was being forced to leave the area .
Affordable housing was suggested to residents who might be eligible , said a transportation authority spokesman , Kevin Ortiz .
Seventy years since the beginning of World War II
3 September 2009
The outbreak of World War II 70 years ago today set in motion a chain of events that was to result in the deaths of up to 70 million people .
Over the next six years , the war saw the eruption of barbarism on an unimaginable scale — the horrors of the Russian front , the fire - bombing of Tokyo and Dresden , the mass murder of 6 million European Jews , and the dropping of the atomic bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are some of the events that immediately come to mind .
It is often said that in war , truth is the first casualty .
Seven decades on , all the official organs of public opinion are still working overtime to cover up the causes of the war and the lessons to be drawn from it .
Contrary to the prevailing myths , this was not a war of democracy versus fascism , any more than World War I was a “ war to end all wars . ”
It was an imperialist war waged by the capitalist great powers — “ democratic ” and fascist alike — for the division of the world and its resources in the interests of profit .
Following the outbreak of World War I , Lenin had warned that unless the working class overthrew the capitalist order in a socialist revolution more wars would inevitably follow .
Any “ peace ” among the imperialist powers , he insisted , would be merely an interlude before the eruption of the next conflict .
That warning was now confirmed .
The immediate cause of the war was the Nazi invasion of Poland on September 1 , 1939 .
The previous year , at the infamous Munich conference , the British government under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had conceded to German demands over Czechoslovakia .
Hoping that German expansion could be confined to Central Europe , Chamberlain had returned from Munich declaring that he had achieved “ peace in our time . ”
Just 11 months later , he announced the declaration of war .
The invasion of Poland had made it clear that Germany was not merely seeking to advance its position in Europe , but aspired to become a world power .
This was an outcome which Britain — as the world ’s chief colonial power , dominating the Indian subcontinent as well as vast regions in Africa , and extracting material and financial resources from every corner of the globe — could not tolerate .
One year before the outbreak of war , the Fourth International had been established .
It took on the task of resolving the crisis of working class leadership and preparing the socialist revolution , without which , as the new International declared , “ a catastrophe threatens the whole culture of mankind . ”
The treacherous leaderships of the working class — the Social Democratic and Stalinist Communist parties — bore a direct responsibility for the outbreak of war .
Had the Spanish Revolution , which erupted in 1936 , been victorious , it would have led to a renewal of revolutionary struggles across Europe , threatening even the seemingly powerful Nazi regime in Germany .
Likewise , had the French general strike of 1936 gone forward to a direct struggle for political power , it would have dramatically changed the balance of forces .
But both of these revolutionary movements were strangled by the Stalinist and social democratic leaderships .
Consequently , as Leon Trotsky explained , the bourgeoisie “ convinced itself that with such ‘ labour leaders ’ at its disposal , it could go ahead with anything , even a new slaughter of peoples . ”
In a manifesto issued in May , 1940 as the German armies invaded France , the Fourth International explained the essential social significance of Hitler and the fascist movement he led .
“ The democratic governments , who in their day hailed Hitler as a crusader against Bolshevism , now make him out to be some kind of Satan unexpectedly loosed from the depths of hell , who violates the sanctity of treaties , boundary lines , rules and regulations .
If it were not for Hitler the capitalist world would blossom like a garden .
What a miserable lie !
This German epileptic with a calculating machine in his skull and unlimited power in his hands did not fall from the sky or come up out of hell : he is nothing but the personification of all the destructive forces of imperialism .
Just as Genghis Khan and Tamerlane appeared to the weaker pastoral peoples as destroying scourges of God , whereas in reality they did nothing but express the need of all the pastoral tribes for more pasture land and the plunder of settled areas , so Hitler , rocking the old colonial powers to their foundations , does nothing but give a more finished expression to the imperialist will to power . ”
The war began as a European conflict but rapidly extended to the entire globe .
In the 19th century , the capitalist powers had competed with each other on the basis of an expanding world market .
But the Great Depression and the contraction of the world market had seen the global economy split into rival blocs .
Japan , confronted with the collapse of its export markets , sought to overcome its crisis through the conquest of China and the establishment of an empire in the East .
But this was intolerable to the United States , which also sought expansion into the Pacific , thus making war inevitable .
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 was simply the trigger for a war which had been in preparation over the preceding decade .
For German imperialism , the resources of central and southeastern Europe were insufficient if it was to develop the capacity to challenge the greatest capitalist power , the United States .
The invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 , 1941 was aimed at establishing the economic basis for a German empire able to sustain its position as a world power .
As for the United States , it had risen to power on the basis of the vast resources of the American continent .
But it could no longer sustain itself on that foundation — that was the lesson of the Great Depression which had struck so hard at its economy .
The markets of the world had to be opened up to American exports , to American investment and American technology , so as to secure American profits .
This perspective was incompatible with the attempts of both Germany and Japan to carve out empires for themselves , as well as with the already established empire of Washington ’s ally , Britain .
All would have to give way to the American “ open door ” program .
On the basis of its economic capacity and the vast superiority it enjoyed over its exhausted rivals , the United States was able to stabilize the world capitalist system at the conclusion of World War II .
The subsequent post - war boom and the Cold War with the Soviet Union provided the framework for the regulation of the inter - imperialist rivalries that had twice exploded into world war in the space of just three decades .
Today , the foundations of this equilibrium no longer exist .
The eruption of the deepest economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression is once again creating the conditions for the transformation of competition on the world market into a ferocious conflict of each against all .
The deep crisis of US capitalism and its increasing resort to military means to overcome its loss of economic power , together with the rise of new powers and the renewed strivings of old ones , are creating the conditions for another imperialist conflict , even more terrible than the last .
The lessons must be drawn .
Only through the overthrow of the capitalist profit system and the establishment of a planned world socialist economy — rationally and democratically regulated to meet human needs — can the threat of imperialist war be banished forever .
This is the perspective of the world party of socialist revolution , the International Committee of the Fourth International .

Updated Security researchers have uncovered critical flaws in open - source software that implements the Extensible Markup Language in a staggering array of applications used by banks , e-commerce websites , and consumers .
The bugs uncovered by researchers at Finland - based Codenomicon were contained in virtually every open - source XML library available , Ari Takanen , CTO of Finland - based security testing firm Codenomicon , told The Register .
Many of them could allow attackers to crash machines running applications that use the libraries or even remotely execute malicious code .
The Python and Java programming languages and Apache Xerces are already known to be affected , and Takanen said many more could be as well .
" The number of applications can be enormous , " Takanen said .
" Basically , any application or piece of software that 's using XML libraries is vulnerable . "
The discovery is significant because it highlights holes in the foundation upon which many of the world 's applications are built .
The programs drive cloud computing services , 3 - dimensional programs , and a wide range of business software .
The discovery is the result of a program dubbed CROSS , or Codenomicon Robust Open Source Software , which uses software fuzzers to test the security of open - source programs by throwing manipulated data at them and seeing how they react .
Codenomicon researchers tested every open - source library and all were found to contain vulnerabilities , though their severity varied from library to library .
The bugs " are related to the parsing of XML elements with unexpected byte values and recursive parentheses , which cause the program to access memory out of bounds , or to loop indefinitely , " according to this advisory from the Computer Emergency Response Team in Finland , which has been working with Codenomicon to coordinate fixes among different software providers .
Codenomicon went on to say here that libraries built on the C language are at highest risk because exploits can include the execution attacks .
" Unfortunately , most libraries out there are written in C , and thus errors such as stack overflows are not that uncommon , " the document stated .
" When this is the case , exploitability depends on the anti-exploitation features of the platform ( ASLR , DEP , NX bits , canaries etc. ) . "
C - based libraries used in communications software represent the highest risk because attacks could include remote execution .
Libraries that merely process files are most likely vulnerable to only local attacks .
The bugs could be exploited by tricking a user into opening a booby - trapped XML file or by sending malicious requests to XML - powered Web services .
CERT Finland continues to reach out to software makers who may have embedded the libraries in their offerings or used the libraries to help develop their programs .
The Python Software Foundation is working on a fix , CERT said .
Sun issued at least two XML - related updates , one for OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 Sun Java System Access Manager and the other in its Java Runtime Environment .
The status of Apache Xerces remained unclear , although the foundation issued this patch in June that references Codenomicon .
The discovery is reminiscent of a vulnerability many of the Codenomicon principals found in 2001 and 2002 in a networking standard known as ASN.1 .
The ramifications of the bug were serious enough to lead of months of wrangling by hundreds of companies that relied on the technology and to warrant a briefing of then President George W. Bush .
It 's impossible to know now if the flaws uncovered in XML will be as far reaching as all that .
But if you value your organization 's security , it might be a good idea to monitor the providers of your libraries to see what they have to say . ®
Story updated to add details about bug and fixes from Sun and Apache .
Senator Ted Kennedy , who is gravely ill with brain cancer , has sent a letter to Massachusetts lawmakers requesting a change in the state law that determines how his Senate seat would be filled if it became vacant before his eighth full term ends in 2012 .
Current law mandates that a special election be held at least 145 days after the seat becomes available .
Mr. Kennedy is concerned that such a delay could leave his fellow Democrats in the Senate one vote short of a filibuster - proof majority for months while a special election takes place .

The hotel is on the resort island of Margarita in Nueva Esparta state
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has ordered the obligatory acquisition of a Hilton - run hotel on the resort island of Margarita , it has emerged .
The move was ordered just weeks after the hotel housed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe during the Africa - South America Summit .
The hotel would help develop tourism projects in a " socialist framework " , a decree signed by Mr Chavez said .
Hilton Worldwide , which manages the hotel , said it was analyzing the move .
The hotel " remains a member of the Hilton system of hotels , and welcomes guests with the same level of service they have come to enjoy , " spokeswoman Karla Visconti said in a statement from Miami , Florida .
Nationalisation drive
The hotel complex , on the Caribbean resort island of Margarita in Nueva Esparta state , includes more than 450 rooms and suites , a casino , restaurants , shops and offices , as well as an adjoining marina .
It is owned by two local companies who are facing problems with the government 's financial regulator , the Dow Jones news service reported .
The presidential decree said the forced acquisition of the Margarita Hilton & Suites Hotel Complex would be carried out without assuming existing liabilities , and the assets would be held by the tourism ministry .
It is President Chavez 's second takeover of a Hilton - run hotel .
In 2007 , the government assumed control of the Caracas Hilton , renaming it the Alba Caracas .
In the past four years , Mr Chavez 's government has nationalised industries it considers strategic to the state , including electrical utilities , cement , steel , oil services and banking .

For 96 long minutes , Colonel Gaddafi spoke to UN delegates about Somali pirates , the death of JFK , jet lag and his conspiracy theories about swine flu .
Call that a long speech ?
It 's but a tiddler .
But wait , there 's more ...
Speaking schedule : First up , Barack Obama .
Next , for 15 minutes , Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , followed by Gordon Brown .
That was the planned running order at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday .
Only instead of speaking for 15 minutes , the Libyan leader launched into a passionate and wide - ranging invective in which he touched on everything from the failings of the Security Council to his theory that swine flu was developed for military purposes , by way of complaints about the time difference and promoting his own website , Gaddafi Speaks .
After an hour and a half of Mr Gaddafi speaking in person , it is not known how many of those listening logged on for more .
But while lengthy , his debut speech to the UN is by no means the longest delivered to that organisation .
Castro 's speeches were so long , meal breaks were factored in Four hours and 29 minutes is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest speech in front of the General Assembly , given in September 1960 by Fidel Castro .
The former Cuban leader is known for his interminable speeches - his longest on record in Cuba clocking up seven hours and 10 minutes at the 1986 Communist Party Congress .
Even that was topped , when at the UN Security Council in 1957 , the Indian politician VK Krishna Menon talked for nearly eight hours defending India 's position on Kashmir .
( The transcript is on the UN website and runs to 160 pages . )
Learned gentleman
Yet Mr Menon 's place in the annals of marathon speech making is unusual in that he represented a democracy .
" You are only ever going to get long speeches when the speaker does n't have to worry about the audience running away , " says Robert Service , professor of Russian history at Oxford University .
" At the UN Gaddafi was depending on the good manners of the people listening .
But at home , it is more about the self - preservation of the audience . "
Every leader likes an ovation
It was also made in an age when the political elite made long , elegantly constructed speeches liberally sprinkled with quotations , says historian Hywel Williams , author of In Our Time : The Speeches That Shaped the Modern World .
" Now [ a long speech ] is seen as a sign of political weakness , for example Neil Kinnock or Gordon Brown when he uses too many words and too much jargon .
" But earlier generations , ending with Harold Macmillan , had a taste for very long speeches which demonstrated their learning .
We have now less patience with people who show their authority by speaking at great length . "
Standing ovation
One factor that drives moderately long speeches into the realms of eternity is the amount of time taken for applause .
Soviet leaders , for example , gave long speeches with orchestrated applause and ovations , " because particularly in the 1930s those listening did n't want to get arrested " , says Prof Service .
In the 1930s those listening did n't want to get arrested
Professor Robert Service on response to Stalin 's speeches
In the book Gulag Archipelago , author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recounted how a fellow prisoner in the USSR labour camps told how he came to be arrested .
At a local party conference , someone toasted Stalin and " stormy applause , rising to an ovation " , broke out .
Even though the great leader was absent , it continued .
" But palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching ...
However , who would dare be the first to stop ?
" Then , after eleven minutes , the director of the paper factory assumed a business - like expression and sat down in his seat . "
That same night , he was arrested .
And Robert Conquest 's Stalin : Breaker of Nations recalls a recording of a speech by Stalin released on vinyl - the eighth side consisted entirely of a standing ovation .
It 's an anecdote that makes it into Martin Amis 's 2002 novel Koba The Dread .
Although associated with long orations , Stalin only ever spoke at length while delivering Central Committee reports at congress , as did his successors , says Prof Service .
" These were enormously long , but did have to cover economic , political , cultural and foreign policy developments and predict what was going to happen in the next 10 to 20 years .
And when Brezhnev did it , he was so doddery that he sometimes read the same page twice .
The speech was long enough without that . "
And when that other communist leader associated with marathon speeches , Fidel Castro , visited Chile in the 1970s to drum up support , Salvador Allende criticised his speaking style .
Ataturk made a six - day speech " Allende took the view that his vastly long speeches haranguing the Chilean people were counter - productive , " says Prof Service .
But the roots of Castro and Gaddafi 's oratory lie in ancient Greece , and the first demagogue Cleon , who understood the power of speech to win over the masses .
Among the most famous of long speeches is that made by the Athenian politician Pericles at a public funeral for those who had first fallen in the Peloponnesian War .
He took the opportunity not only to praise the dead , but Athens itself .
More recently , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the founder of modern Turkey , delivered an epic oratory in 1927 .
Not for him a speech measured in mere minutes - he spoke for 36 hours and 31 minutes over six days .

I watched Jay - Z's video Death of Autotune , in which he disparages guys like T - Pain for using autotune ( electronic modulation of voice ) and generally for being pop " z100 " music , and not authentic " hot 97 " black rap music .
Ok , calling someone less authentic than you is a standard combat maneuver .
Nothing new there .
So if Jay - Z wants to depict his authenticity , to show how and raw , honest , legitimate he is in comparison to the other " niggas " he would do this by placing himself in authentic , legitimate , true to his roots situations and settings .
Here 's where it got interesting .
Based on the video , Jay - Z is , deep down , a guy who dines alone in Italian restaurants .
who pays his respects to the chef -- or the other way around - - etc , for more pics see any episode of My first reaction was that maybe Jay - Z had had a stroke .
Is he aware that he is not actually Italian ?
After this meal , he goes to the back of the restaurant with other legitimate Italians like Harvey Keitel and , believe it or not :
Yes this is an all night poker game , yes it is played in the stockroom of the restaurant , yes they are sharing a bottle of wine and some pasta , yes that 's an olive oil sign , yes those are hundred dollar bills ( " this ai n't a strip club " ) , yes they are all in suits , and no he 's not kidding .
In a video about getting back to basics and authenticity , he chooses an entire persona that could n't be less authentic .
What 's crazy about this is that music today tries to be more urban , more street , more -- things that he authentically is already , he 's technically won his argument just by waking up in the morning -- and yet he instead picks a character that is utterly unrealistic , waves it in our face and and says , " this is me , keeping it real .
"
II .
It would be easy to just say he's an idiot , but this is a man who is hypersuccessful precisely because he can manipulate imagery to connect to his audience .
He may be Italian , but he 's no dummy .
The problem Jay - Z faces is that because all anyone knows about him is images , he has no way of signaling authenticity .
If he 's shows himself in the projects or on a yacht or behind bars or on the moon , no one can know if it 's really him or if it 's hype .
Maybe he owns a spaceship , who knows ?
So Jay - Z chooses to signal his authenticity not with authenticity , but with an already establishedof authenticity : because otherwise , how would we know he was being authentic ?
Italian= authentic , traditional ; black = masculine , strong .
He already has the black part .
And it does n't matter if the other actors are real Italians either , as long as they symbolize " Italian " which symbolizes " authentic " .
Hence Harvey Keitel .
There 's another major benefit from choosing a completely unrealistic symbol of authenticity .
Note that his audience is n't Italian mobsters or " kids in the hustle ; " there are n't enough of them .
His audience is regular people , black and white , for whom authentic is n't " being yourself " or " true to where you came from " because for those regular people , that would be unbearably boring .
For them , authentic has to mean .
This video is n't about Jay - Z's authenticity , it 's about letting you choose your own authenticity .
He does this not byItalian -- obviously no one believes he plays back room poker at Rao's ; but by reducing " Italian " to a symbol or commodity that can be acquired or put on , like an outfit , in order to convey information to others .
In other words , he 's using Italian as a brand .
He is morebranded as a TV Italian than if he was actually just himself .
Read that last sentence again .
That 's how you build the Matrix .
III .
That may be true ; and that may convey the impression that his music / this song is elite , not for everyone , it has some reserved status and / or artistic integrity , but it is not in reality any more difficult to get it from the free radio station
Hot 97 than from the other free station Z100 .
In other words , it 's not really elite , it 's just branded as elite .
Of course it is : here 's a ring tone , here it is on itunes , here 's an MP3 on Amazon , and I fully expect to see lots of guys performing it terribly through open car windows ... but that 's the draw .
That 's the business smarts of Jay - Z .
Brand it , make it seem elite , make it anproduct -- but make it easily available , everywhere .
I 'm surprised he has n't thought of selling scratchy , barely audible free underground bootleg copies of the song for $ 24.99 .
That 's Trading Up again ( and I should tell you that book does n't describe it as a social critique but in all earnestness ) .
That 's the two parts of profiting from effective branding .
You have to make it seem elite and hidden , but make it easy / affordable to access it .
Then -- and this is the key -- the consumer has to be able to show others that they 've accessed it : that 's the only way other people are going to know who they are pretending to be .
IV .
This is how kids operate , but it is also how adults -- who do n't realize they are adults but still think they 're kids -- act as well .
I hardly need to tell you what this phenomenon is called .
Here 's a random coincidence for you : there 's a book called From Jay - Z To Jesus , and it has this sentence on the back : I 'm shaking my head because they 're right .
V. Guess what this picture is all about :
This past July there was a panel called " Raising Him Alone , " part of the larger conference " Saving Our Sons .
"
It 's in the Bronx , feel free to guess at the audience .
This will include a There 's two ways to make this work .
One way is to find women who have raisedblack men , e.g. doctors , teachers , etc , to offer advice about how to keep your son focused on boring academics .
But no , it features the mothers of rappers .
Well , ok .
The other way to go about it is to find mothers who , like the audience , had to raise their kids in the same adverse circumstances , e.g . Drugs , guns -- all of the stuff Jay - Z used to talk about before he bought a restaurant .
However , there 's a bit of a problem with their panelists , see if you can guess what it is :
Do these women have anything in common with their audience ?
Dr. Hines is nominally a " single black mother " -- the words are accurate -- but she 's also a woman with a Ph.D. who sent her kid to private school .of Kweli 's parents are college professors .
But since their sons areto be inner city youth forced to choose between rapping or dealing , they are therefore mothers of inner city youth almost gone bad , even though they 're not .
But no sane person is going to question the 'hood cred of the mother of Common .
The tragedy of this conference is that Dr. Hines et al have a real and valuable contribution to make : how they managed , as black single mothers , to continue theireducation and professions -- but that 's a conference no one would attend .
But shoud n't the conference organizers have pushed for it anyway , for them to be role models inway ?
Instead of letting the women be who they are , they turned them into symbols of something that they aren 't
And if this is a conference about educating black kids , then is n't Ph.D. mother raising a rapper son the exact opposite of what you want ?
Oh , is that wrong to say ?
Imagine Eminem 's mom coming to speak to white parents about the importance of educating children .
The unfortunate message of this program is the importance of raising sons to be famous ( i.e. how they reflect on you ) is more important than the example you set for your kids ( how you reflect on them . ) VI . " What 's with white kids today ?
Why are they pretending to be black ?
" They 're not , they 're pretending to be masculine .
You may not believe this , but white boys / men have no symbol of masculinity or toughness -- or of sexual power -- that they can brand themselves with .
The fictional white tough guys are either " black " or are flawed : strong in one way but weak in some other ( broken men , depressed , drinkers , etc . )
They have toto be tough .
And white tough guy / heroes cry a lot .
What 's up with that ?
If a white kid wants to project masculine energy , he better figure out a way to be black and make it look legitimate .
Fortunately , Eminem and others have done the hard work of branding blackness , reducing it from something you are to something you adopt , turning it into apparel to wear when you need to convey information .
Now it 's credible that white guys can be black without actually having to be black .
Thanks .
The odd problem that this presents is that though black kids in the inner citylegitimately need to project toughness , the white kids '-- and many black kids '-- accumulation of toughness brands is actually useless .
However , if you brand yourself long enough you begin to believe it .
At the expense of applying to graduate school and possibly your life .
They 're going to find themselves one day , full of anger and resentment and rage at absolutely nothing at all -- and middle aged .
How are the 40 year olds who got caught up in the east coast / west coast battles faring today ?
Was it worth it ?
It was for rappers , I guess .
VII .
Back to Jay - Z .
He 's probably in no danger of being deported to Sicily .
But he 's definitely " drawn a line in the sand " ( his words ) about Autotune and rap in general .
Well , maybe .
Or maybe he realized , after making an album 's worth of songs that did use autotune , that it was becoming overused and hack , and so he dumped those songs , made an anti-autone song , and prepared to pretend to be the one who caused the demise that was coming anyway .
Or maybe he 's creating a fake controversy that he himself does n't believe in , but that his audience can use to communicate to other people who they want to be : " I 'm against autotune , I 'm street and authentic ; " " I 'm for autotune , I 'm artistic and fun . "
Fake divisions that can be used as brands .
In that way , both he and the Autotune guys can benefit .
Here 's a picture of Jay - Z performingthis summer :
See that guy next to him ?
That 's T - Pain .
And he looks authentically pissed .----Clarification on masculinity here .
And then the VMAs ----
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged in an interview broadcast on Sunday that it would be difficult to meet the Obama administration ’s January 22 deadline for closing the Guantanamo detention camp .

Asked directly whether that deadline would be met , Gates told ABC ’s “ This Week ” program , “ It ’s going to be tough . ”
Recent reports have suggested the administration may not meet the deadline because of legal , political and diplomatic issues involving the detainees at the controversial prison at a U.S. naval base in Cuba .
There are still some 223 detainees at the facility set up by the Bush administration in 2002 to hold foreign terrorism suspects captured after U.S. - led forces invaded Afghanistan .
Some detainees are expected to be transferred abroad while others could face charges in U.S. military tribunals or in American courtrooms .
The Justice Department said on Saturday three detainees had been sent to Ireland and Yemen .
Gates said , “ I actually was one of those who said we should ( set a deadline ) because I know enough from being around this town that if you do n’t put a deadline on something , you ’ll never move the bureaucracy .
“ But I also said and then if we find we ca n’t get it done by that time but we have a good plan , then you ’re in a position to say it ’s going to take us a little longer but we are moving in the direction of implementing the policy that the president set , ” he said .
An administration official said on Saturday the White House was close to selecting a location on U.S. soil to house some detainees .
“ We are doing everything we can to close it by the ( January ) date , ” the official said , adding , “ We are in the final stages of locating a secure facility in the U.S. where detainees can be held .
Democrats have mostly backed closing Guantanamo , pointing to international criticism of the detention camp and concerns the prison provides a rallying cry to groups like al Qaeda .
Most Republicans have criticized Obama for wanting to close the camp since it is already set up for detention and trials .
But Senator John McCain , Obama ’s Republican opponent in the 2008 presidential election , disagreed .
“ We should continue to work toward the closure of Guantanamo Bay because of the image it has in the world of brutality , ” he told ABC .
“ It harms our image very badly . ”
There 's a TF2 " Team Update " doing the rounds at the moment , which has people thinking a new class - guard dog - is being added to the game .
It 's not .
But Valve have still given the concept the thumbs up !

The US is following the footsteps of Japan .
It is now undeniable .
Please consider the following chart .
Japanese GDE from the 1989 peak to Present
US GDP 1999 peak to Present
Offset is 10 Years
The above chart is from my friend " BC " who writes :
The rate shown is the trend rate of growth of GDP at any point from the secular peak rate .
For example , for the US , the real GDP trend rate in the '90s was 3 - 4 % , whereas since the ' 99 - '00 peak the trend rate has fallen to the 1.5 - 2.5 % range for the '00s ( 1.6 % today ) .
For Japan , the real GDE trend rate in the ' 80s was 4 - 6 % , with the trend rate since the ' 89 - '90 secular peak falling to 1 - 1.5 % to 2 % ( 0.91 % today ) .
A chart of the trend rate since ' 97 or '00 in Japan would show an even slower trend rate of real GDP at 0.4 - 0.5 % .
Similarly for the US , the trend real GDP rate since ' 04 and '05 is barely 1 % to 0.6 % respectively .
I suspect we will see a further deceleration of the trend real GDP rate hereafter from ~ 1.5 % to 1 % or less through the late ' 10s , including 2 - 3 more recessions , i.e. , " multiple dips " , along the way .
It is repeatedly said that we 're not Japan ; however , in some respects we might be worse this time around , i.e. , the depth of our recession today vs. that of Japan in ' 97 - '98 ( Asian Crisis ) .
To get back to a trend of 3.3 % real growth from ' 00 , the US would have to grow at an average real rate of 5.5 % through ' 14 - '15 .
For a 2.5 % trend rate from '00 ( the current average trend rate since ' 80 ) , average real growth would have to be 3.5 - 4 % for the next 5 - 6 years .
Japan 's real GDE grew at just 0.4 - 0.6 % from ' 97 to ' 01 - '03 , with ~ 1 % price deflation , QE , and ongoing bailouts and government spending .
So , in the context of the likely secular trend , double dips and " recovery " will tend to be moot issues .
We are more likely to have multiple dips , little or no growth , and the only recovery will have been from 10 % real GDP contractions along the way .
We will have recovered from nearly having falling off the ledge into the abyss ; but our climb from the ledge will be steep , long , and yield little progress .
Psychology of Deflation Revisited
Deflation Japanese Style
Is Bernanke a Wizard ?
The only way to justify this claim is to assume that all hospitals are purely charitable institutions , charging as little as they possibly can .
Now , some hospitals may fit this description .
But all of them ?
What ’s more , this argument stands the usual logic of markets on its head : if you believe AHIP ’s story , competition raises prices instead of reducing them .
And it does n’t matter where the competition comes from : anyone who gets a better deal , whether it ’s Medicare or a private insurer , makes life worse for everyone else .
I do n’t believe that , and neither should you .
Of course , the report does n’t mention these implications .
The only bad competition it talks about is competition from the government .
Specifically , it claims that a public insurance option would be a bad thing  not because it would be inefficient , but because the public plan would negotiate better prices .
Is n’t that an argument for , not against , such a plan ?
Which brings us to the ways in which AHIP may have done health reform a favor .
As I said , the individual mandate probably should be stronger than it is in the Finance Committee ’s bill .
But there ’s a reason the mandate was weakened : fear that too many people would balk at the cost of insurance , even with the subsidies provided to lower - income individuals and families .
So why not address that cost ?
Aside from making the subsidies larger , which they should be , there are at least two changes to the legislation that would help limit costs .
First , health exchanges  special , regulated markets in which individuals and small businesses can buy insurance  can be made stronger , in effect giving small buyers a better bargaining position .
Second , the public option  missing from the Finance Committee ’s bill  can be brought back in , giving private insurers some real competition .
The insurance industry wo n’t like these changes , but that matters less than it did a week ago .
There ’s also another point , which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stressed .
Part of the opposition to a strong individual mandate comes from the sense that Americans will be forced to buy policies from a greedy insurance industry .
Giving people , literally , another option  the right to buy into a public plan instead  would defuse that opposition .
Even with stronger exchanges and a public option , health reform would probably increase , not reduce , insurance industry profits .
But the insurers wanted it all .
The good news is that by overreaching , they may have ensured that they wo n’t get it .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - A Canadian truck driver has been fined for smoking in his vehicle because it is considered his workplace , a police spokeswoman said on Friday .
A police officer saw the 48 - year - old trucker driving on a highway in southwestern Ontario with a cigarette in his mouth on Wednesday , and gave him a C$ 305 ( $ 290 ) ticket .
The Smoke - Free Ontario Act , adopted in 2006 , prohibits smoking in an enclosed workplace or enclosed public area , and that extends to work vehicles , said Constable Shawna Coulter of the Ontario Provincial Police in Essex County .
“ We enforce the legislation and this truck driver was in violation of that , ” she said .
NEW YORK -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will encounter a turning point in his regime 's relationship with the Iranian diaspora when he arrives here next week for the United Nations General Assembly .
Thousands of Iranians in exile are traveling to New York from cities across the U.S. and Canada to take part in demonstrations from Sept. 22 - 24 against the Iranian government and to protest its alleged human - rights abuses following disputed presidential elections in June .

Propylene glycol is used in antifreeze , and also to create artificial smoke or fog in theatrical productions .
The F.D.A. has classified it as an additive that is “ generally recognized as safe ” for use in food .
But when asked whether inhaling it was safe , Dr. Richard D. Hurt , director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic , said , “ I do n’t think so , but I ’m not sure anyone knows for sure . ”

Of the e-cigarettes themselves , Dr. Hurt added : “ We basically do n’t know anything about them .
They ’ve never been tested for safety or efficacy to help people stop smoking . ”
Public health officials also worry that the devices ’ fruit flavors , novelty and ease of access may entice children .
“ It looks like a cigarette and is marketed as a cigarette , ” said Jonathan P. Winickoff , an associate professor at the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium .
“ There ’s nothing that prevents youth from getting addicted to nicotine . ”
Sales and use of electronic cigarettes are already illegal on safety grounds in Australia and Hong Kong , and some other countries regulate them as medicinal devices or forbid their advertising .
So far the United States has focused only on stopping them at the border , although Senator Frank R. Lautenberg , Democrat of New Jersey , has asked the drug agency to take them off the market until they can be tested .
Distributors of electronic cigarettes fear that a bill making its way through Congress that would give the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco could be used to put them out of business as well .
The bill has passed the House and could be taken up by the Senate this week .
" It 's getting out there and people are starting to experiment with it .
We probably do an average of about five a week , if not more than that .
There have been times recently when we 've done 11 in three days . "
Officials said the pollution levels seemed to be dropping
The deadly chemical cyanide and a quantity of sewage have leaked into a 30 - mile stretch of the River Trent in Staffordshire .
Thousands of fish have died and people have been warned to stay away from the river while the incident is controlled .
The Environment Agency said pollution levels on the stretch between Stoke - on - Trent and Yoxall were starting to drop .
A spokeswoman said she could not give more information on where the cyanide had come from for legal reasons .
She warned the public , farmers , anglers , boaters and pets to stay away from the water as a precaution .
Severn Trent Water said the cyanide had been released by someone into the sewers upstream from the company 's Strongford sewage treatment works in Stoke .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
That had caused problems at the works , which meant partially - treated sewage was also released into the river .
Simon Cocks , waste water services director , said Severn Trent was not linked in any way to the chemical but said it was working with the Environment Agency to find out what had happened .
A spokeswoman said the company did not get its water from the Trent and the water supply had not been affected " at all " .
Alan Walters , from the Environment Agency , told BBC News the incident had had " a huge impact " .
However , the agency said it had not received any reports of humans or pets being affected by the contaminated water .
Officers from the agency spent the night pumping oxygen into the river to offset the worst effects of the spillage .
The Environment Agency said the pollution was expected to reach Burton - upon - Trent by late afternoon .
A spokeswoman said that officials were tracking the pollution as it moved downstream and would keep taking water samples to monitor the situation .
A spokeswoman for the RSPCA urged members of the public not to go near any animals in distress but instead to report any sightings to the charity .
She said : " For those people with livestock we would remind them to get them away from the area as safely as possible . "

Another player in Tom Petters ' alleged $ 2.62 billion electronics re-sale Ponzi scheme has plead guilty , making Petters ' upcoming defense all the more tricky .
Gregory Bell , a former Chicago - area hedge fund manager , admitted to one count of wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison , the sixth accomplice to plead guilty .
Bell covered for Petters ( pictured here ) by making it seem that the Minnesota Ponzi schemer was repaying investments made by his fund , Lancelot Investment Management .
SEC : The Commission 's Complaint alleges that Bell in turn invested almost all of these assets in notes sold by Petters , falsely assuring investors that he was taking steps to protect their money and to verify the underlying transactions .
The Complaint alleges that when Petters 's scheme began to unravel , Bell participated in a series of sham transactions to conceal that Petters owed more than $ 130 million in investor payments on the notes .
Bell and Lancelot Management also withdrew more than $ 40 million in fees from the hedge funds during the final months before Petters 's scheme collapsed .
That cover helped Petters attract massive investments from hedge funds and other institutions , ostensibly to buy consumer electronic goods and re-sell them to nationwide big - box stores .
According to the government , there was no such buying and selling .
Instead , Petters funded a luxurious lifestyle , including a multi-million dollar mansions in Minnesota , Florida and Costa Rica .

Some guy on eBay recently sold the last jar of unicorn semen in the United States for $ 31 plus $ 3 flat rate shipping .
If you were the buyer please contact me , as I must have some .
* ahem *
For science , for science ( if I repeat things it makes them real ) .
This is possibly the only jar of Unicorn semen left in the united states .
Unicorns were bred for their magic and keen night hunting skills to protect lepreachauns that had been injured in battle during the civil war .
Unicorns were only found in two places on the planet , the northern and southern hemispheres .
Anyone in possession of this rare and magical fluid will be able to swim with the wolves and fly with the dolphins as its powers are still being found .
I opened the jar while i was on my computer and my computer flickered for a minute and i realized the semen had helped me kill Yogg - Saron on my World of Warcraft account and i recieved the Shawl of Haunted memories and the Mantle of the Wayward Conqueror .
i have already been blessed and recieved my gift ... so i'm going to pass the power onto someone else .
Do not drink the unicorn semen as the power is too much for the human digestive system and could change your DNA and give you the shits .
Bid , but Bid Wisely .
Do not drink , my ass .
I have an iron stomach ( and lung ) and am gonna guzzle that whole jar like I 'm shotgunning a beer .

Thanks Chris , but if I found out you bought it and are n't sharing , well , that 's just cruel .

Fascism ’s new face in Europe , parliamentarian in the Netherlands Geert Wilders , proposes taxing Muslim women who wear hijab ( head covering ) 1000 Euros .
He is a close friend of Robert Spencer who has proclaimed that “ everyone should support Geert Wilders . ”
Wilders has also called for the banning of the Quran which he equates to Hitler ’s Mein Kampf , has stated that Muslims are colonizing the Netherlands and has advocated the denial of religious freedom to Muslims .
Wilders Wants Headscarf Tax
Geert Wilders has done it again .
The leader of the far - right Freedom Party managed to make the Dutch headlines during the annual general political debate .
Wilders ’s newest proposal is to tax the Muslim headscarf .
Any Muslim woman who wants to wear a headscarf – which he described as a ‘ head - rag ’ – would have to apply for a licence , and pay one thousand euros for the privilege .
Wilders says the money raised would go toward women ’s emancipation programmes .
Alexander Pechtold from the liberal D66 Party gives his reaction :
The rest of the Dutch parliament reacted to the proposal with disbelief .
One after another , they asked Mr Wilders if this was a serious proposal .
For instance , would he include other types of head covering in the tax ?
And how about orthodox Christian women who wear a headscarf quite similar to the Muslim version ?
In reaction , Mr Wilders said he would actually prefer to ban the headscarf altogether , but that appeared to be legally impossible .
He would not tax the Christian form of the headscarf , but he did not say how policy would make that distinction .
Mr Wilders has acquired a reputation for making shocking statements during general debates .
Two years ago , he called for the banning the Muslim holy book , the Quran .
Last year , he warned that Muslims were colonising the Netherlands .
Last spring , he and his entire fraction walked out at the beginning of a debate .
The government still has to defend its new budget as part of the general debates .
But in an unusual move , Mr Wilders has already announced that he plans to submit another motion of no-confidence in the entire cabinet .
That will be the Freedom Party ’s eighth motion of no-confidence .

LOS ANGELES : Californian laws legalising medical marijuana and permitting collectives to cultivate the plant have had some unexpected consequences : one is the challenge local growers are posing to the profits of Mexican drug barons ; another is an explosion in the number of marijuana stores , or dispensaries , in Southern California .
Law enforcement is arguing that most are for - profit enterprises that violate the 1996 Compassionate Use Act and the 2003 collective cultivation law .
Dispensations ... a man holds a placard at a clinic at Venice Beach , Los Angeles .

The Los Angeles County District Attorney , Steve Cooley , has announced he will prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries for over - the - counter sales .
'' The vast , vast , vast majority - about 100 per cent - of dispensaries in Los Angeles County and the city are operating illegally ; they are dealing marijuana illegally , '' he said .
'' The time is right to deal with this problem . ''
The United States accounted for more than two - thirds of foreign weapons sales in 2008 , The New York Times reports .
Citing a congressional study released on Friday , the Times said the United States was involved in 68.4 per cent of the global sales of arms .
US weapons sales jumped nearly 50 per cent in 2008 despite the global economic recession to $ US37.8 billion ( $ 44.4 billion ) from $ US25.4 billion the year before .
The jump defied worldwide trends , as global arms sales fell 7.6 per cent to $ US55.2 billion in 2008 , the report said .
Global weapons agreements were at their lowest level since 2005 .
Italy , the second ranked country , amassed only $ US3.7 billion in arms sales , while Russia ranked third with sales falling to $ US3.5 billion in 2008 , down from $ US10.8 billion in 2007 .
The report attributed the increase in US sales to " major new orders from clients in the Near East and in Asia " as well as to continued contracts for equipment and support services with globally based US clients , the Times said .

On Tuesday Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich submitted to Los Angeles City Council a 4th revision of the cities draft ordinance regulating the medical marijuana collectives in the city .
This is a draconian piece of legislation that would ban the sale of medical marijuana for cash , ban the sale of medibles ( medicinal edibles ) , ban the production of concentrates and also prohibits any on site consumption of medical marijuana .
Los Angeles : Fourth Revised Draft Ordinance Regarding Medical Marijuana Collectives IssuedBy Brett StoneOctober 21 , 2009
On Tuesday Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich submitted to Los Angeles City Council a 4th revision of the cities draft ordinance regulating the medical marijuana collectives in the city .
This is a draconian piece of legislation that would ban the sale of medical marijuana for cash , ban the sale of medibles ( medicinal edibles ) , ban the production of concentrates and also prohibits any on site consumption of medical marijuana .
Advocates in Los Angeles were shocked when this was presented and plans are in the works for major protests and several attorney 's that I contacted yesterday and this morning have stated they intend to hash this out in the courtroom .
In Los Angeles we have a City Attorney Carmen Trutanich and a County DA Steve Cooley that are out of control as well as out of touch with the wishes of the voters of Los Angeles , city and county .
A vote on this is expected shortly , possibly within the week .
Calls in to folks at city hall for more details have not been returned at this time .
A copy of the proposed ordinance is attached .--------------------Brett

Yes , this is true : Right - wingers in America and Israel do n't want peace with Iran , nor do they want anyone to get the impression that President Obama 's efforts at engagement with Iran might actually work , nor do they give a damn about the Iranian people .
Mad Mahmoud is the man neocons love to hate , and they 're as happy as clams that their guy found a way to steal the election .
Had Mousavi won the Iranian election as many in Iran and around the world hoped , it would likely have signalled a new and more positive direction for U.S. - Iranian relations as well as providing support for the " Obama Doctrine " of engagement with Iran and others in the Muslim world with which America 's relations have been troubled .
Such a development would at the same time have undercut the neocon attitude of hostility and suspicion toward Iran , as well as undercutting the right - wing Israeli government 's aggressive stance toward Iran .
As we know , neocons can tolerate peace only when it is imposed with an iron fist or the heel of a jackboot , and the prospect of peace through diplomacy in the Greater Middle East must surely have given them nightmares the rest of us could scarcely imagine .
In the run-up to the Iranian election last week , Daniel Pipes of the right - wing Middle East Forum came right out and admitted in a speech at the right - wing Heritage Foundation that he would actually vote for Ahmadinejad if he were allowed to vote in Iran ( video ) .
This speech was followed by a June 12 blog post by Pipes in which he reiterated that he was " rooting for Ahmadinejad " based on the twisted logic that the fundamentalist clerics who really rule Iran will always be our enemies and it's better to have an Iranian president we can really hate than " a sweet - talking Mousavi " who lulls us into thinking we can be friends .
Never mind the aspirations or even basic human rights of the Iranian people ; never mind anyone 's desire for peace in the Greater Middle East .
I 've long had a pretty strong distaste for Daniel Pipes , but following this admission I 'm more convinced of his utter vileness than ever .
This is , after all , a man who has publicly advocated for the profiling and internment of Muslims in America and who considers Israeli and Palestinian existence mutually exclusive ( see Sourcewatch ) .
As we leave the age of the neocons behind , I look forward to watching Pipes and others like him slide into the bitter , drooling irrelevance and oblivion they deserve .
The American Enterprise Institute 's equally malignant Michael Rubin likewise told Kathryn Jean Lopez at the National Review that it might be better for Ahmadinejad to win , because a Mousavi win might give Obama and the rest of us the impression that diplomacy was actually working .
Painting Iran as inherently and hopelessly evil , Rubin said of the Iranian election that should Mousavi win " it would be easier for Obama to believe that Iran really was figuratively unclenching a fist when , in fact , it had its other hand hidden under its cloak , grasping a dagger . "
James Taranto strikes a similar tone in the Wall Street Journal , warning against the " eagerness to see Obama 's feel - good foreign - policy approach succeed . "
Now that the Iranian election appears to be over , right - wingers will be tripping over themselves in the rush to use Ahmadinejad 's victory against Obama .
In fact , once and future Republican U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney has already piped up , saying that Ahmadinejad 's win is proof that Obama 's " policy of going around the world and apologizing for America is not working . "
These losers obviously have nothing left but the hope that Obama will fail , or can at least be said to have failed .
I look forward to watching Romney and his party lose again in 2012 .
Right - wingers in Israel , meanwhile , have been making noises very similar to their American bedfellows , and appear to see nothing good for themselves in any warming of relations between the U.S. and Iran , as observed by M.J. Rosenberg at TPM .
From Israel in the run-up to the Iranian election Yaakov Katz wrote in the Jerusalem Post that members of the Israeli defense establishment were " silently praying " for an Ahmadinejad victory , fearing that a Mousavi win would result in decreased pressure on Iran and its nuclear program .
Now that Ahmadinejad appears to have successfully stolen the election , Israeli officials and their allies in America are calling for renewed pressure on Iran .
Meanwhile , Amos Harel and Avi Issacharoff write in Haaretz that an Ahmadinejad victory is actually preferable for Israel because a Mousavi win would only " paste an attractive mask on the face of Iranian nuclear ambitions . "
I suspect we 'll hear more of this in days to come from eager neocons on both sides of the Atlantic .
Obama 's policy of engagement will work , however , and is working , as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reaction to his Cairo speech , by the Lebanese election results , by the reform movement in Iran , and by the likelihood that Ahmadinejad kept his office only through vote - rigging , suppression , and intimidation .
Obama will succeed , and once he has neocons like Daniel Pipes can take up residence in the dustbin of history where they belong .

Just as many of us are getting used to augmented reality applications for cellphones and digital cameras , Babak Amir Parviz and his University of Washington students are taking it one step further .
The group is working on a human machine interface where LEDs are embedded into contact lenses in order to display information to the wearer .
You heard right , in a few years your cyborg eye will talk to you .
In an article with the IEEE Spectrum , Parviz relays the challenges of custom - building semi- transparent circuitry into a polymer lens roughly 1.2 millimeters in diameter .
Says Parviz , " We 're starting with a simple product , a contact lens with a single light source , and we aim to work up to more sophisticated lenses that can superimpose computer - generated high - resolution color graphics on a user 's real field of vision . "
For now , Parviz mentions that single pixel visual cues for gamers and the hearing impaired are already quite possible with the lens prototypes .
The group has also experimented with non-invasive biomonitoring including checking glucose levels for diabetics .
Some of the obvious challenges of building an augmented reality contact lens include :
1. The Need for Custom Parts : Regular circuitry and LEDs are incompatible with regular contact lenses .
Every piece of this project must be fabricated from scratch .
2. Physical Constraints :
The group must attempt to fit transistors , radio chips , antennas , diffusion resistors , LEDs and photodetectors onto a miniscule polymer disc .
Additionally , the team is required to control lens position and light intensity relative to the pupil .
And finally , because the lens is so close to the corneal surface , the group must project images away from the cornea using either micro-lenses or lasers .
3. User Safety :
In addition to protecting the eye against chemicals , heat and toxins , the lens components must be semi- transparent in order for the wearer to view their surroundings .
" We already see a future in which the humble contact lens becomes a real platform , like the iPhone is today , with lots of developers contributing their ideas and inventions .
As far as we 're concerned , the possibilities extend as far as the eye can see . "
And you thought the iPhone SDK was a tough nut to crack .

Apologies for the radio silence – I ’m traveling this week and net time has been limited .
For now , take a look at the video below made by a social psychology student at Mississippi State University for an experiment on conformity to gender roles .
What ’s amazing is n’t just that person after person does exactly what the signs tell them , but some of them actually stop and go through the other door when they see that they ’re about to violate the rule .
Below that is a video updating the famous Asch conformity test .

ArtPrize has launched an Apple iPhone application to help visitors and locals navigate the sprawling event .
The application features a searchable list of the more than 1,200 artists involved , tools for voting on favorite ( or not - so - favorite ) pieces of art , a venue map and social media utilities .
The free application became available for iPhone owners about 5 p.m. Tuesday .
The app is a collaboration between Pomegranate Studios , a Grand Rapids agency that is the force behind ArtPrize , and Atomic Object , a software developer .
The most useful tool : Users can tap on an artist 's name , get a sample of their artwork , see the name and address of the venue where they 're showing and a map to the venue .
Karlin Fox and Micah Alles , software " craftsmen " at Atomic Object , mostly develop iPhone apps for clients who want to sell them .
Making a free app was a first for them , Fox said .
It took about six weeks , which is pretty fast , he said ..
" And making an iPhone app for a community event is a pretty unique thing , " Fox said .
A first - time event spearheaded by Rick DeVos , ArtPrize will turn Grand Rapids into an experiment in interactive art .
Participating artists from across the world will showcase their work to the voting public for a shot at about $ 500,000 in prize money .
The event begins Sept. 23 and runs through Oct. 10 at venues across the city .
Voter pre-registration starts Sept. 14 .
‘ camper kart ’ concept by kevin cyr all images courtesy kevin cyr
we recently featured the work of kevin cyr , here is another project of his titled ‘ camper kart ’ .
the pop up camper is affixed to a shopping cart which can be pushed to a chosen location and opened to serve as a functioning habitat for an urban camper .
the project investigates habitats and housing , recycling and ecology ; exploration and mobility .
‘ camper kart ’ concept

the project is supported by FEAST ( funding emerging art with sustainable tactics )
I am a heterosexual man of a certain age , which obviously means one thing : I do not frequent shopping centres or shopping malls .
The single exception I allow , because it is both open air and near to my home , is my annual trip to the Kildare Village .
I spent a happy hour there a year ago , most of it in the women 's underwear shop , Wolford , watching a video of German models on a catwalk , sporting not very much .
And the really lovely thing about these models was the antediluvian amplitude of their bodies : breasts you would have ordered by the truckloads , large helpings of bottoms that would cause healthy men to yodel with joy , and jolly bellies that you would have happily commissioned a seamstress to make them into a very large mattress , and taken home .
That was 2008 .
2009 , and in my most recent visit to Wolford -- my last -- the buxom Teutonic mannequins were gone , and in their stead was a video of the usual gaunt skeletons tottering down the catwalk .
A healthy and joyous celebration of female sexual carnality had been replaced by a death walk .
Meanwhile , outside the shop , waddling down paths and gorging in the restaurants , were the new generation of Irish women : prosperous , upper middle - class and , for fully one quarter of them , massively obese .
Not fat .
Not overweight .
Not corpulent .
But massively obese .
From their arms swing great folds of fat , like huge water - filled balloons .
Their bellies are so vast that their owners could not have seen even their toes in years .
And their bottoms constitute such an orotund object , with such a colossal circumference , that an entire school of carpentry is going to have to be invented to cope with their seating requirements .
Now , three forces arrived roughly simultaneously in western society .
They were , one , feminism ; two obesity ; and three , anorexia .
I note the coincidence : I do not say two and three are necessarily attributable to one .
I am also aware of the predictable response of feminist columnists ( and God , I can name them now ) on this subject is to sneer : Ha !
Kevin Myers wants us back at the sink , children at our knees , in the bad old days when foreplay merely meant : " Brace yourself Bridget . "
Of course , dismissing questions that are inconvenient , by a stereotyping and an ad hominem caricature of the questioner , is the standard rhetorical ploy of feminists .
Yet not even the most sneering feminist can deny that when men created the cultural female iconic imagery of western civilisation ( that is , through the middle ages up to the mid-1970s ) , from Botticelli to Rubens and to Hefner , women generally did not suffer from eating disorders .
In that visual universe , women were clearly sex objects and the female form was worshipped .
During this era , women might sometimes have been overweight or malnourished , but there were not the chronic conditions we now know as obesity and anorexia .
Since the political and cultural victory of feminism brought women a virtual monopoly over female image creation , by women of women for women , through American Vogue , Harper 's Bazaar , and Vanity Fair , the twin plagues of death by starvation and death by over - eating have swept through the female sex .
So : is there a causal relationship between the attainment of untrammelled editorial authority by a handful of powerful women , and the semi-voluntary victimhood by others ?
Certainly , women 's editors have dogmatically used stick - insects as models .
Their companions in this project are either other women , or homosexual men .
Heterosexual men are almost entirely outside this power loop .
Yet feminists still blame the traditional male " patriarchy " for the obesity / anorexia pandemic that is destroying both the bodies and lives of so many women .
This is in such conflict with both logic , and all available evidence , that it simply proves how human unreason can triumph , enabling self - pitying feminists to blame their women 's woes on some mythic , still all - powerful , male chauvinist juju .
Okay .
But why are one quarter of middle - class , middle aged Irishwomen obese to the point of immobility ?
Does the fascistic image - making of the obergruppenfuhrers of women 's magazines cause ordinary women to despair of looking like a woman at all ?
Do they indulge instead in the endorphin - releasing pleasures of gorging themselves ?
Meanwhile , their daughters are possibly immured in either of the twin purgatories of anorexia or obesity , from which a healthy , lifelong escape is almost as likely as it is from Devil 's Island .
Anorexia and obesity arrived at around the same time as feminism , and possibly on the same train .
So is the unadulterated image - making power of influential women over the perception of women 's bodies a primary reason why so many dislike themselves physically ?
Women editors clearly prefer the unattainably epicene , the gaunt , and the chic , deathbed look , to the triumphantly alive .
Which begs the larger questions : do such powerful women actually hate real women ?
And is unconscious misogyny amongst female fashionistas the real reason that so many relatively low - ranking women , even middle - class ones , are so profoundly and so desperately and , most of all , so fatly unhappy ?
Galaxies speeding through clusters of their neighbors were imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope being stripped of their gas .
NGC 4522 , the galaxy pictured above , is traveling at 6.2 million miles per hour , astronomers estimate .
It 's about 60 million light - years away in the Virgo cluster .
The bright blue areas to the right and left are star - forming regions .
Unlike our own Milky
Way galaxy with its delicate spiral arms , fast - moving galaxies like NGC 4522 get deformed by the strong winds generated by their movement .
The process is known as " ram pressure stripping " and it's analogous to what would happen were you to hold a dandelion parachute ball out a car window .
The lighter parts get stripped away .
Galaxy NGC 4402 , pictured below , shows off the convex gas and dust disc that is characteristic of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping .
The hot gas between galaxies in a cluster ( known as the intra-cluster medium ) actually sweeps the gas away , creating the odd shape in the process .
The images were taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument before it suffered a power failure in 2007 .
The images were recovered when astronauts restored the unit in May of this year on the last Hubble Servicing Mission .
Both are deep enough to show distant background galaxies .

I ’m still in the stage wherein every time I embark upon a new project , I ’m teaching myself something about the technical process of writing and also about the human experience .
I think the greatest gift a writer can give is in illuminating the human experience in a fresh or unique way , and in the experience of connecting with that story , we the audience are learning something new about life and our experience of what it means to be human .
I suppose , as writers , we ’re fueled by an inexhaustible curiosity about life and the specific nature of the human experience that drives us to do what we do .
I ’m a story / plot writer .
I love brainstorming ideas , breaking story , coming up with story ideas .
Story for me always starts with the big “ what if ” and explodes from there .
It ’s generally situationally based , and specific to circumstances .
I think you can have many “ what if ” situations and place different personalities in those situations – such is life .
To me , the specific uniqueness of story comes less from the individual ’s experience of the situation than the situation and how an individual experiences it ( if that makes any sense ) .
That ’s why I do n’t write from character .
A single character could experience any million - fold variety of situations – that ’s too confusing for me .
Too many possibilities .
Story always starts with the situation , and then I consider how various personalities would experience that situation .
The more interesting story comes then from a juxtaposition of a particular personality within a specific situation , and that ’s where the screenplay begins for me .
What I ’ve realized specifically with my latest project is that even though I know all of my story beats before I hit the page , I discover my characters more intimately once I ’m on the page and give them voice .
Many writers who are character writers write in the reverse : they intimately know their characters and then discover the story / plot as it unfolds before them .
It really does n’t matter in the end what our process is because we all have to rewrite .
I think it ’s really only once we get the story on the page that we can see exactly where our characters are taking our story , and in this , we must craft .
It ’s the crafting part that ’s the real work , but that ’s where the gold is mined .
Every writer has a natural voice .
We have strengths and gifts that flow effortlessly onto the page .
We carry a mood , a tone , a pace , a theme that is intrinsically unique to our writing and the kinds of stories we want to tell .
However , the craft of writing insists that we hone our work and we ’re constantly struggling to balance our strengths with our weaknesses .
Just as prose writers must craft an organic balance of the narrative modes ( description , action , dialogue and exposition ) , so we screenwriters must find balance in the plotted story ( action ) and the emotional journey of the characters .
As screenplay is written primarily in action and dialogue with almost no exposition and very little description , our focus thus rests with finding the balance between the action and dialogue , or plotting and character .
The strengths of my own stories lay in the story / plot component , but then I have to work twice as hard with the emotional component of the character arc to make it viable and emotionally resonant for the reader .
It ’s not to say I ca n’t do it , but it does n’t come as intuitively for me as for some character - driven writers I know .
It ’s work for me .
It ’s hard .
Sometimes , it ’s pulling teeth .
But , then , I know my character - driven writer friends struggle just as much with plotting .
We ’re all working to create that thoroughly complete story world , and it only comes through balance and believability .
This post was updated Monday evening .
When it comes to greenhouse - gas emissions , Energy Secretary Steven Chu sees Americans as unruly teenagers and the Administration as the parent that will have to teach them a few lessons .
Speaking on the sidelines of a smart grid conference in Washington , Dr. Chu said he did n't think average folks had ...
Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40 % over the next half century because of global warming , jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world , a new study published today has found .
The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20 % by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions .
Fishermen operating in US coastal waters ( excluding Alaska and Hawaii ) could also face large declines in fish stocks , as would those working off Chile and China .
" Fish are very sensitive to temperatures , and when the temperatures warm because of climate change , the fish will move away .
And some of the species - those that can't swim that far - may locally go extinct , " said William Cheung , lead author of the study .
The study , conducted by the Sea Around Us project at the University of British Columbia , is the first to look at how climate change will affect food supplies offshore .
It is published in the journal , Global Change Biology .
But not all regions would be losers .
Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30 % and 70 % by 2055 , with Norway , Greenland , Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases .
This is because fish will migrate northwards as the oceans warm to seek out suitable cooler waters .
But while the overall productivity of the world 's oceans will remain roughly the same , the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia , the Caribbean , and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world .
Sub - saharan Africa and south Asia are already threatened with food shortages because of climate change .
A study last week by the International Food Policy Research Institute projected sharp declines in rice and wheat crops by mid-century because of global warming , which could see more than 25 million malnourished children around the world .
In many parts of Africa and south - east Asia , people depend on fish and seafood for half of their animal protein .
" It is devastating , " said Daniel Pauly , a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who worked on the study .
" Basically you have lots of people living at the edge of the sea .
They depend on fisheries , not in the way we do in northern countries .
So income - wise and consumption - wise they are affected directly by the decline in catch . "
The study used computer modelling to gauge the effects of climate change on more than 1,000 species of fish , from krill to shark , across the 20 largest fishing zones .
It did not take into account the effects of ocean acidification - caused by more carbon dioxide dissolving in seawater and which scientists expect will reinforce the effects of warming on the oceans .
" We think that our estimates should be considered conservative because adding ocean acidification into the equation would further decrease future fishery potential , " said Cheung .
He said a follow - up study would look at the effects of acidification .
The scientists found that the warming seas were driving fish from their current habitats , with for example , tropical mainstays like snapper moving north .
Some will successfully migrate to colder waters - reflected in the projected increase in fish populations in more northern waters .
But others will not survive the changes .
" Not all of them will make it .
They can handle it only by shifting more energy to resisting the higher temperatures , which means less growth and less potential for harvesting , " said Pauly .
The study did not focus on individual species .
However , scientists said the changes brought by warming seas would see the decline and possible disappearance of familiar fish even in colder waters , like those off Britain .
Cod stocks will flee British waters for Iceland , Norway and Greenland .

MSC takes drydock on 13,000 mile commute A A A
By Trish Hoffman
World War II - era floating drydock Resolute was deactivated at a ceremony in November 2003 ( pictured above ) after more than 50 years of service .
Resolute was an invaluable resource to the U.S. military .
To keep up with changes in technology , the drydock was modified and modernized in 1982 .
Resolute spent the next 20 years docking more than 130 submarines .
The drydock will continue to maintain the ships of her nation 's fleet as she heads back to work in Seattle .
In the more than 200 years since the U.S. Navy was founded , the Navy has operated dozens of different types of ships - all with a unique purpose .
Some of the ships were combatants , some deliver supplies and others were built to provide fleet maintenance .
One such vessel is the floating drydock .
The Navy built several floating drydocks during the early 1940s to assist during World War II .
These floating garages could be taken near enemy lines to repair crippled ships and keep them battle ready .
To work on a damaged ship , the floating drydock would fill her internal ballast tanks with water to semi-submerge .
The damaged ship was then floated over the drydock 's deck .
The floating drydock 's internal ballasts were emptied once the damaged ship was secure , and both rose out of the water .
In 1945 , one of the last floating drydocks to be built for the war was placed into service .
Built by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company , medium auxiliary floating drydock Resolute proved herself an invaluable asset to the war effort .
Following World War II , Resolute continued to support her country in the Korean and Vietnam Wars .
In 1983 , Resolute underwent an extensive overhaul and was taken to Norfolk , Va. , to provide repair services to attack submarines .
Twenty years later - after successfully drydocking more than 130 submarines - Resolute was deactivated after 58 years of service .
In the early morning hours of July 7 , Military Sealift Command - chartered heavy lift ship MV Mighty Servant I flooded her ballast tanks in order to submerge her deck so Resolute , a 522 - foot - long drydock , could be floated aboard .
After Resolute was in place over the deck , Mighty Servant I emptied her ballast tanks and rose to the water 's surface .
Mighty Servant I is transporting the drydock from Norfolk , Va. , to the Pacific Northwest .

It was not long , however , until the 522 - foot long Resolute was called upon again .
A Navy study identified the need for additional drydock capacity in the Seattle area where several commercial shipyards routinely repair and overhaul West Coast Navy , U.S. Coast Guard and commercial ships .
Resolute could fill that capacity , and she was offered for lease .
The five - year lease was awarded to Todd Pacific Shipyards of Seattle .
To make the journey from Norfolk , Va. , to Seattle , Resolute would have to be towed or transported on a heavy lift ship - she has no propulsion system of her own .
Because of the long distance - more than 13,000 nautical miles - a heavy lift ship was the only reasonable option .
Military Sealift Command chartered heavy lift ship MV Mighty Servant I to carry Resolute .
After three days of preparation , the two ships began the journey on July 10 and should arrive in Seattle by the end of August .
Heavy lift ships are designed specifically to carry large , unwieldy cargo like drydocks , damaged vessels and oil rigs .
To load their cargo , ships like the 623 - foot long Mighty Servant I semi- submerge while cargo is floated on board .
Once the cargo is in place , the heavy lift ship rises back to the surface - just like Resolute .
Although the process sounds simple , it takes hours for the internal ballast tanks to fill and then empty .
Securing the cargo to the ship is a very exact process that can also take a long time to complete .
" The drydock is secured to Mighty Servant I by a series of landing blocks and sea fastenings , each designed to keep the drydock stable , " said Jay Standring , MSC marine transportation specialist .
" Such exact measurements require months of planning . "
Mighty Servant I will travel from Norfolk , Va. , to Seattle by going down around South America and through the Straits of Magellan .
Mighty Servant I is too wide to fit through the Panama Canal .
Once Resolute arrives , she will lift a variety of ships including Washington state ferries and commercial customers .
MSC has chartered heavy lift ships in the past , most notably to move the bomb - damaged , guided missile destroyer USS Cole from Yemen to the United States aboard MV Blue Marlin .
SEPTEMBER 8--Meet John Hudson .
Two days after celebrating his 18th birthday , the Louisiana man was arrested last Thursday night on obscenity and trespassing charges .
Hudson was nabbed at the Hixson Autoplex in Monroe , where cops discovered him wearing women 's lingerie and fishnet stockings .
Hudson explained that he was " masturbating in the parking lot and that he had a fetish . "
A further description of that fetish is not contained in a Monroe Police Department report .
However , the document does note that Officer Rodrick Candley observed pornographic magazines , women 's clothing , lotion , and a " pink dildo with pubic hairs on it " between two cars on the Hixson lot .
Hudson , pictured in the mug shots at left , was booked into the Ouachita Correctional Center .
He was released after spending about five hours in custody .

Crocodile crazy :
The man who enjoys giving his dangerous ' companion ' kisses and cuddles
Known as the ' Crocodile Man ' , Costa Rican animal lover ' Chito ' swims , plays and even feeds ' Pocho ' the giant crocodile in what is one of the world 's most unlikely friendships .
Wading chest - deep through the green water in a 100 sq / m lake in Siquirres , this bizarre and dangerous spectacle draws tourists from around the world .
Calling quietly for his five metre long ' companion ' before thrashing around , lifting his tail and head above the water .
Unlikely friendship : Chito rests on top of buddy Pocho , who he rescued after the crocodile was shot in the eye
' This is a very dangerous routine but Pocho is my friend and we have a good relationship , ' says 52 - year - old Chito .
' He will look me in the eye and he does not attack me .
' It is too dangerous for anyone else to come in the water .
It is only ever the two of us . '
The bizarre friendship began nearly 20 years ago when Chito rescued the 980 - pound crocodile after finding him close to death on the shore of the Parismina River , in the Caribbean province of Limsn .
Crazy : Chito plays with Pocho the crocodile , who seems to enjoy the attention
Shot in the left eye by a cattle farmer after preying on a herd of cows , Chito enlisted the help of several friends to load the massive reptile into his boat , Naming him ' Pocho ' ( meaning strength ) , the fisherman says he healed the reptile with medicine , food , and , more importantly , lots of care and attention .
' When I found him in the river after he was dying so I put him in my boat and I brought him into my house , ' recalls Chito .
' He was very skinny , weighing only around 150 pounds , so I gave him chicken and fish and medicine for six months to help him recover . '
Rolling around : Chito says that if anyone else entered the water it would be deadly
During the recovery process , Chito stayed by Pocho 's side , even sleeping with him at night .
' I just wanted him to feel that someone loved him , that not all humans are bad , ' Chito says .
' I love all animals , especially ones that have suffered .
It meant a lot of sacrifice .
I had to be there every day . '
After Chito felt that Pocho had bonded with him , he started to get closer and closer to the animal .
Tourist attraction :
It took Chito many years to build his relationship with Pocho to this level
' After 10 years I started to work with him , ' he says .
' At first it was slow , slow and I started to play with him a little , touching him a little bit and then slowly doing more .
Then I found that when I called his name he would come over to me . '
Today tourists travel from all over the world to see the unusual spectacle .
' I am happy because I rescued him and he is happy with me because he has everything he needs , " says Chito .
This is what great parents do when they want to take good care of their son , giving him all he needs to grow into a cultured , social , healthy young man : A 98 - inch TV mounted flush inside his bedroom 's ceiling .

The job was not easy : Admirable mom Patti Deni wanted the 98 - inch StarGlas60 screen to be aligned straight with the ceiling of her kid's bedroom .
Above the bedroom , Stereo Advantage — an audio / video specialty company in Williamsville , NY — had to place a NEC video projector and projection mirrors .
In total , the whole solution weighted more than 300 pounds , so they had to make a new reinforced ceiling frame to support it .

Ibrahim Hooper is the communications director for CAIR , a nonprofit group accused of trying to infiltrate Capitol Hill with interns and staffers .
| Courtesy Islam group ridicules ' spies ' claim
Four Republican lawmakers have accused the most prominent Islamic advocacy group in Washington of trying to plant " spies " as interns on Capitol Hill .
The claim was quickly denounced as " racist " and " insidious " by the Council on American Islamic Relations , and the effort appears to have little support from GOP leaders .

In an unusual announcement this morning , four conservative Republicans — Reps. John Shadegg ( Ariz . ) , Paul Broun ( Ga. ) , Trent Franks ( Ariz . ) and Sue Myrick ( N.C. ) — formally asked the House Sergeant at Arms to launch an investigation of the Center for American - Islamic Relations .
They accused CAIR , a non profit group , of trying to infiltrate Capitol Hill with interns and staffers .
Shadegg said Wednesday that CAIR is an organization that “ members of Congress should be aware of and that should be investigated by the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service . ”
And the response from CAIR ?
" We would love to help people find jobs on Capitol Hill , " said Ibrahim Hooper , the communications director for CAIR .
" There 's a Muslim Staffer Association .
Should they be investigated ? "
The proclamation from the four Republicans came in advance of a book , entitled " Muslim Mafia : Inside the Secret Underworld that 's Conspiring to Islamize America , " which includes a forward by Myrick .
The author of the book , Dave Gaubatz , an anti-Islam activist who wrote last year that “ a vote for Hussein Obama is a vote for Sharia Law . ”
The lawmakers also released a one page " strategy " document they said they obtained from CAIR .
But the document basically lays out a fairly straight forward public relations and lobbying strategy and indeed , one of the goals is " placing Muslim interns in congressional offices " and registering people to vote .
Hooper ridiculed the claims .
" All they can come up with is that we are political active ? "
Hooper asked .
" The terror threat is that Muslims are politically active ? "
Democrats were n’t amused by the accusations , and Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D - Calif . ) said she was “ appalled ” by the situation .
“ I urge the rest of my colleagues to join me in denouncing this witch hunt , which is clearly intended to create fear and distrust in our Capitol Hill community , ” Sanchez said in a statement .
There was some confusion on Capitol Hill on Tuesday , when the public schedule on televisions in the complex noted that the lawmakers would make " public a national security threat on Capitol Hill . "
Staffers from the four Republican offices would not reveal in advance what this national security threat was .
It 's not clear yet if the sergeant at arms will investigate whether there are Muslim spies on staff in the House .
A spokeswoman for Shadegg says the lawmakers also want a Department of Justice investigation to find out " if CAIR was successful in placing interns " with key congressional committees , including the Intelligence and Homeland Security panels
Hooper pointed out that there are indeed many Muslim staffers on Capitol Hill , CAIR is a lobbying organization , and its executive director is on Capitol Hill today — speaking at an interfaith forum on health care with other religious groups in the Rayburn building .
Rupert Murdoch is reported to be building a newspaper pay cartel that will see free newspaper sites disappear along with News Corp sites in the next 12 months .
According to the LA Times , News Corp ’s Jonathan Miller mas met with major news publishers including New York Times Co. , Washington Post Co. , Hearst Corp. and Tribune Co .
The report did not note the success or otherwise of the talks
The move by News Corp makes sense form their perspective : they ca n’t put up the pay wall and succeed if the competition continues to offer their content for nothing .
In theory , most major newspapers doing pay at the same time would maximize sales opportunities for the pay sites ; well , that ’s the play book News Corp is running by .
The move though raises serious anti-trust issues ; the four companies named account for around 80 - 90 % of the US newspaper market , and collusion would lessen competition .
On a bright note , the market in 12 months time for new media startups is going to be even better now all the newspapers are signing up to commit ritual suicide .

Presenter , BBC Radio 4
Sister Isobel Luz , 83 , witnessed the shooting of Oscar Romero
A BBC Radio 4 documentary returns to the scene of the crime to assess the evidence and consider the legacy of Central America 's most celebrated modern martyr .
Oscar Arnulfo Romero's assassination focused the attention of the world on the scale of repression in the small Central American republic .
And at his funeral a few days later , people around the globe saw on their own television screens the kind of political terror that had been unleashed to stop growing demands for change in one of the most unequal societies in Latin America .
Tens of thousands of mourners who had gathered for Romero 's funeral Mass in front of the cathedral in San Salvador were filmed fleeing in terror as army gunners on the rooftops around the square opened fire .
REQUIEM FOR ROMERO Thursday 24 March 2005
Radio 4 , 2000 GMT
The roots of the violence lay in El Salvador 's history .
For the 50 years before Romero 's death , the country had been run by an alliance between wealthy coffee planters and the military : politics was left to the officers , business to the oligarchy .
The arrangement lasted until the 1970s when the pressure of population and a growing middle class produced a coherent challenge - not least from activists within the Catholic Church .
' Bloodless coup '
Leaflets were circulated by one of the first right - wing death squads urging " Be a patriot - kill a priest . "
Archbishop Romero was 62 when he was shot dead
Romero refused to recognise the government and publicised the human rights abuses on his trips abroad .
As the situation worsened in El Salvador and left - wing guerrillas gathered strength , junior military officers decided that they would have to act quickly to prevent all - out war .
In October 1979 , they staged a bloodless coup , invited civilians from the opposition to join the government and promised free elections , an end to human rights abuses and land reforms .
National broadcasts
In Washington , President Jimmy Carter - fearful of being accused of " losing " El Salvador to communism - hoped that this new junta would prevent a left - wing takeover .
Initially , even Romero hoped the junta might bring progress .
But over the next few months the reformist officers were outmanoeuvred by hardliners .
Instead of easing , military repression worsened .
In February 1980 , Romero wrote to President Carter to ask him to reconsider his offer of aid to the junta .
Carter refused .
In his sermon on Sunday , March 23rd , Romero spoke directly to Salvadoran soldiers saying they were killing their own people .
" No soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to the law of God " , Romero declared , before pleading for an end to repression .
The next day he was killed .
Moral courage
During our visit to El Salvador we secured a rare interview with the judge who tried to investigate Romero 's assassination before he was attacked by a death squad and had to go into exile .
A UN Truth Commission - established under the peace agreement which ended the civil war in El Salvador in 1992 - concluded that the death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson had ordered Archbishop Romero 's killing .
None of D'Aubuisson 's associates has ever been brought to justice for the crime .
Today , the party that Mr D'Aubuisson founded , ARENA , has ruled El Salvador for sixteen years after winning four presidential elections in a row .
President Tony Saca told us he revered Archbishop Romero 's memory - but ARENA refuses to accept that D'Aubuisson killed the Archbishop .
For many Romero is a martyr , a beacon of moral courage .
Exploring his life and death , this programme revisits a particularly murky chapter in the US role in Latin America and a crime which remains unresolved in El Salvador .

Winning is for losers .
Many of life 's more interesting stories focus on those who did n't quite make it ; who did n't get the girl or the job or the epiphany or even the Jules Rimet trophy .
Johan Cruyff said his Holland side of the 70s were immortalised by their failure to win the World Cup and , when World Soccer invited a group of experts to select the greatest teams of all time a couple of years ago , three of the top five sides won nothing : Hungary 1953 , Holland 1974 and Brazil 1982 .
Lying 16th on the list – above any side from Argentina , Spain , Germany , Liverpool , Manchester United or Internazionale – was the Danish team of the mid-80s .
That may seem odd , given that all they achieved was reaching the semi-finals of Euro 84 and the second round at Mexico 86 , when , having laughed in the face of the Group of Death , they lost 5 - 1 to their Spanish nemeses in football 's saddest , maddest thrashing , but it shows the extent to which this all - action , ultra - attacking side captured the imagination from the moment they qualified ahead of England for Euro 84 .
As the Danish supporters ' song went : they were red , they were white , they were Danish Dynamite .
They had world - class players such as Preben Elkjær , Michael Laudrup , Søren Lerby , Frank Arnesen and Morten Olsen , as well as a visionary German manager in Sepp Piontek .
While Laudrup called them " Europe 's answer to Brazil " , most went for what was probably an even more flattering comparison : they are the only side to have been widely compared to the Dutch team of the 70s .
In that respect , Denmark were both derivative and thrillingly futuristic .
Although they had the Total Football hallmarks – spatial awareness , ceaseless movement and imagination of passing – they were like a fast - forwarded version of that Holland side .
No team has ever had such a collection of jet - heeled dribblers .
As with that Dutch collective , the appeal of the Danes went beyond the field of play .
They were unique , refreshing and life - affirming .
And even though time has not been kind to their array of tomboy mops , matted thatches and cock - rock mullets , they were seriously cool in a languorous , quintessentially Scandinavian way .
Yet unlike the Dutch they were not ostentatious .
Self - deprecation was the norm , and they revelled in their role as underdogs .
This was the beauty and the beast of Danish Dynamite : it was a love affair with chain - smoking , beer - drinking everymen who were actually top professionals at some of Europe 's biggest clubs , but the considerable joy was tinged with the subconscious fear that the folksy , light - hearted Danish attitude was always going to stop them getting right to the top .
There are so many what ifs .
What if the wonderful Allan Simonsen had not broken his leg against France in the first game of Euro 84 ?
What if Denmark had not hit the post twice in the semi-final defeat to Spain ?
What if Elkjær , of all people , had not fired his penalty over the bar in that shoot - out ?
What if Denmark had rested players for their final group game against West Germany at Mexico 86 ?
What if Arnesen 's wife had not fallen ill before that game ?
And , most of all , what if Jesper Olsen had not played one of the most infamous backpasses in football history against Spain a few days later ?
ALEMANO BRUTO
That Denmark were in a position to ponder such things was a miracle .
A tiny country with a population of just five million had never previously produced anything resembling a decent team .
The main exports had been bacon and beer , porn and cheese .
Danish football did not even turn professional until 1978 .
They had reached Euro 1964 , but only because qualification was an unseeded knockout : the teams they beat were Malta , Albania and Luxembourg .
They took bronze at the 1948 Olympics and silver in 1960 ; apart from that , nothing .
In the documentary Og Det Var Danmark , Piontek 's predecessor , a likeable mutton - chopped dreamer called Kurt Nielsen , is asked before a game whether he has any tactical plans .
" No , " he says .
" Tactically it 's still about scoring goals . "
Simonsen was European Football of the Year in 1977 , but despite that and the fact Nielsen 's team contained a number of players who would star in the 1980s – Morten Olsen , Simonsen , Arnesen , Elkjær , Lerby and Jens - Jørn Bertelsen – they did not take international football particularly seriously .
They hung out at a Copenhagen nightclub that became known as " the clubhouse " .
Denmark were an international team in name , and a pub team in nature .
It was richly ironic that it would take booze money to turn such an attitude around .
In 1978 Carlsberg said it would give the Danish Football Association ( DBU ) a million - kroner sponsorship on the proviso that professional standards were set .
That process was accelerated by the fact that so many of the national team were playing abroad , and values learned there were slowly seeping in .
A particular influence , unsurprisingly given the way the team evolved , came from Holland : Arnesen , Lerby , Jesper Olsen and Jan Molby were all talked at by Johan Cruyff in the twilight of his career .
" He was like a king holding court , " said Molby in his autobiography , Jan The Man .
" He knew everything and you could n't help but listen .
At times you 'd want him to shut up , but he would n't . "
It was worth it : Cruyff broadened their horizons as only he could .
Arnesen and Lerby left the Copenhagen club Fremad Amager to move to Ajax in 1975 at the age of 19 and 17 respectively .
Denmark got a headstart on football globalisation , benefiting from the enlightenment and experience that comes with playing abroad .
At Euro 84 , their 20 - man squad contained 14 overseas - based players ; the other seven teams had only five between them .
At Mexico 86 , their squad included players from the champions of Italy , West Germany , England , Holland and Belgium , but not Denmark .
Yet the most important component was travelled in the opposite direction .
Piontek , who would later be responsible for the emergence of Turkish football around the turn of the century , took over in 1979 ; he was only 39 , but had already managed Werder Bremen , Fortuna Dusseldorf , Haiti and St Pauli .
Though ostensibly dour – he was christened Alemano Bruto , the tough German , during his time in Haiti – he was witty , as comfortable in his own skin as it is possible to be , and he'd been around a lot more than the block .
" I was the national manager in Haiti under the dictator Baby Doc – son of Papa Doc , who murdered 11,000 people , " he says in Og Det Var Danmark .
" I 've met Idi Amin from Uganda .
He was a former boxer and had a flat nose .
I met him in Saudi Arabia and he said : ' Good discipline , good coach . '
I 've met [ Nicolae ] Ceausescu 's son , the manager of Steaua Bucharest .
Saddam Hussein's son Uday Hussein .
Yes , I 've met a few . "
He had met nothing like the Danes when he took over in 1979 .
" ' I ca n't do anything with this team ' , I thought , " he said .
" I only saw them six times , three days a year .
There were limits to what I could achieve .
How could I get them to work as a team ? "
Piontek was not an overnight success , because he was fighting against an entire culture .
He dumped the No1 goalkeeper Birger Jensen , a symbolic sacrifice , but it took a long time for his doctrine to be accepted .
" Danes do n't like the word ' discipline ' , " he said .
" ' Nobody bosses us around .
We 're no good anyway . '
I had to change that . "
The first signs came when Denmark won eight out of nine in 1981 , including a rollicking 3 - 1 win in a World Cup qualifier against the eventual champions Italy , the Azzurri 's only defeat en route to lifting the trophy .
The tipping point arguably came when Piontek moved the training camp to the headquarters of the Danish Confederation of Sport , a bleak concrete dump called Idraettens Hus , with barbed - wire fencing and no TV or phone in the players ' rooms .
This , the players quickly realised , was serious business .
By the standards of the day , Piontek was incredibly demanding and meticulous .
He would have three - hour tactical meetings before games ; and at his boot camp before Mexico 86 , players were pushed to breaking point , with altitude training in oxygen masks as part of a daily programme that began at 8 am and ended at 11.30 pm .
If Piontek was fortunate to be blessed with an exceptionally talented group of players spanning two generations – in the Tyler Barker age , Morten Olsen ( 60 ) is easily old enough to be the father of Michael Laudrup ( 45 ) – it took an even rarer managerial talent to harness that group .
Make no mistake : we are , or at least we should be , talking about one of the all - time greats here .
Another of his strengths was tactical enlightenment .
The presence of the remarkable Morten Olsen as libero allowed his team to switch seamlessly between 1 - 2 - 5 - 2 and 1 - 3 - 4 - 2 formations , often within games .
This was Jackson Pollock football : players would go wherever instinct took them as part of a system that many respected judges feel was even more fluid than the 70s Dutch side .
Piontek called it the " contra system " , and it was perhaps best exemplified by the right - back John Sivebæk 's extraordinary goal against Ireland in 1985 .
Denmark treated the ball with the utmost care ; their goalkeeper , for example , never , ever kicked from the hand .
This led to a number of goals that came from what were almost relay runs straight down the centre of the pitch , most notably against Scotland at Mexico 86 .
John Eriksen 's goal against West Germany in the same tournament , a creation of delicious simplicity , even came from a chipped goal - kick .
A chipped goal - kick !
Both goals were notable for the way the attacks crescendoed .
Denmark were full of mouthwatering dribblers : Arnesen , Laudrup , Elkjær and the two Olsens .
All were quick but all , more importantly , had a devastating change of pace .
Positivity was ingrained in the side – in the Mexico 86 match against West Germany , Lerby ran 30 yards to deliver a ferocious bollocking to Sivebæk just for passing the ball back to the keeper – but not to the point of naivety .
The first name on Piontek 's team sheet was the underrated defensive - midfield whippet Bertelsen , while he instructed Klaus Bergreen to man-mark Michel Platini in the first game of Euro 84 .
( Platini scored a deflected winner , but Bergreen did a decent job and lamented Platini's " lousy shot " on live TV after the game . )
The defenders are often criticised , but this is more than a little harsh .
Denmark did not have a glass jaw , only an exposed one .
Piontek was also stubborn , but not intractable : when Morten Olsen and Søren Busk approached him suggesting the sort of pressing game and cavalry - charge offside trap that would later become familiar at Arrigo Sacchi's Milan , Piontek assessed its merit and soon implemented it .
Nor was he averse to displays of sentiment : he included Simonsen , who at the age of 33 had not played for Denmark since breaking his leg at Euro 84 and had never fully recovered , in the World Cup squad .
He then gave him 20 minutes as substitute in the dead rubber against West Germany , a gesture of the richest humanity .
And though Piontek was a strict disciplinarian , he rarely pushed it too far .
" He came with a lot of German discipline but also knew he had Danish players – they also need some of their own responsibility and he found a good balance between discipline and freedom , " said Morten Olsen , who has been Denmark 's manager since 2000 .
" We could n't play as a German team , we had to play as Danes .
He knew that and that was very , very clever . "
Similarly , even though Piontek had clamped down on the side 's booze culture , he remained aware of the team - bonding capabilities of alcohol .
When Denmark reached the semi-finals of Euro 84 , he allowed the players a night out with a curfew time of 5 am .
( Most arrived back just in time for breakfast , and lunch had to be put back to 5 pm . )
The fact that such a night out was now a novelty was testament to the extraordinary change in attitude that Piontek had engendered .
WHAT IF JESUS COMES BACK ?
THEN WE'LL MOVE ELKJAER OUT WIDE
Piontek and his team took the whole of the country on a vicarious voyage of discovery : as Denmark 's first great side , they were subject to the peculiar kind of goodwill , gratitude and unconditional love that only occurs when you are exploring virgin territory .
There was none of the wearying cynicism , complacency and expectation that accompanies modern football .
This was an intoxicating red-and - white fairytale .
The commentator Svend Gehrs , Denmark 's answer to John Motson in the 80s , hit the nail on the head when , seconds after Denmark had qualified for the semi-finals of Euro 84 , he described them as " this unconquerable team of optimists " .
Throughout that period , Gehrs had a happy habit of capturing a nation 's voice :
This was not just blind partisanship .
Neutral observers were similarly moved .
When Laudrup scored a peach in the 6 - 1 win over Uruguay at Mexico 86 , ITV's John Helm announced : " The boy 's a genius ! " .
After that same game , a Mexican TV commentator said : " Senors , Senores , you have just witnessed a public fiesta of football . "
There was a fiesta among the public , too .
Inextricably linked to the Danish Dynamite experience were the Roligans , the Denmark fans renowned for their peaceful good cheer .
( Rolig is the Danish word for calm and mild - mannered ) .
Almost all clad in red and white , they were shiny , happy people , described as the " nicest drunks in the world " ( you can see some in this marvellous gallery ) , and even won the Unesco Fair Play Trophy in 84 .
Around 16,000 Danes went to Euro 84 in France ; among their number for the semi-final was a young Peter Schmeichel , who did the 38 - hour round - trip even though he was playing for Hvidovre against Brondby the next day ( they lost 8 - 1 ) .
At Mexico 86 , their group included the Scotland pair of Steve Nicol and Charlie Nicholas , who joined in the merriment after the match between the sides .
The Roligans had the same infectious sense of fun as their team and complete love for the players .
One day , in Copenhagen , somebody graffitied " What if Jesus comes back ? " on a wall .
The next day , the answer came : " Then we 'll move Elkjær out wide . "
It 's no surprise the players were so popular .
It 's not just that they were so obviously talented , but they were normal blokes who seemed as boyishly excited about what they were achieving as everyone else .
And they happily laughed at themselves .
All of them , and even Piontek , hammed it up in the video for one of the great World Cup songs , the gloriously kitsch Re-Sepp - Ten ( " We are red , we are white , we stand side by side " ) .
Simonsen was happy to be killed off in the 1977 film , Skytten .
And when his career was all but killed off after he broke his leg at Euro 84 , the players asked to sing a comic folky song for him on live TV ( it is the fifth video down on this page ) : " Allan you 're our friend … we think of you again and again … this is a song for you … Hope to see you in Paris . "
Theirs was a genuine brotherhood .
" They were willing to make fools of themselves to show Allan he was in our thoughts , " said Piontek .
" They worried about their friend whose career , in reality , ended here .
That proved to me they were a team . "
There is so much to say about each individual player , but as this piece is already ridiculously long we 've put those player profiles here .
' ENGLAND'S SHAME '
The Danish Dynamite story began as it would effectively end : at the feet of Jesper Olsen .
His backpass against Spain in 1986 provided a neat bookend to a dream that began with his stunning last - minute equaliser in the first Euro 84 qualifier against England .
It was Bobby Robson 's first game in charge , in September 1982 , and England had not conceded in over seven hours of international football .
Yet in a tumultuous atmosphere that had the feel of an uprising they were run absolutely ragged , with Elkjær giving Osman one of the great chasings , and would have been well beaten were it not for Shilton .
In the end , they almost grabbed a scandalous victory .
But Olsen , aided by a routine off - the - ball run from Lerby that caused all manner of chaos , swerved irresistibly through the heart of England 's defence before passing the ball coolly under Shilton .
" Denmark were brilliant , " enthused Robson , who could n't let his own concerns override the sheer joy at seeing such a thrilling emergent force .
That did not stop the tabloids printing headlines such as " RUBBISH " and " ENGLAND'S SHAME " .
The risible ignorance of such a response would soon become clear .
In the 12 months before the return fixture , Denmark established themselves as one of the world 's best sides .
When they hammered the future European champions France 3 - 1 in a friendly two weeks before meeting England again , the watching Robson described their performance as " chilling " and said they were " a formidable team , one of the best I have seen for 10 to 15 years " .
If anything , Robson 's comments served to numb his own players into subservience .
Denmark had such an air of calm that nobody realised they were equally terrified going into the match at Wembley , which they only realistically needed to draw to maintain an iron grip on qualification .
It was a two - card poker game in which both parties had a two and a seven of different suits .
" We entered the pitch bluffing , " said Morten Olsen .
" They knew we were good but we made us out to be even better . "
Against a meek England , Denmark 's 1 - 0 victory was almost too easy : even though they did n't have many chances either side of Simonsen 's 38th - minute penalty , they kept the ball with a comfort that sent English football into one of its occasional bouts of soul - searching .
In The Times , Stuart Jones said there was a " numbing inevitability " to the result .
The victory , watched by over 80 % of the Danish population , was crucial to the emergence of the team .
" It signalled to a great group of players how much they could achieve , " said Piontek , " for England were still considered one of the top teams . "
So , now , were Denmark .
Victory in Greece took them to the European Championship and at the end of 1983 they were voted World Soccer 's National Team of the Year , with Piontek named Manager of the Year .
NAKED DISAPPOINTMENT
Denmark went to Euro 84 as one of the fancied teams , despite an appalling build - up : their seven warm - up matches brought a 6 - 0 defeat , a 4 - 0 defeat and only three goals .
Their group contained the hosts and clear favourites France along with Yugoslavia and Belgium .
They lost a cagey opening match to France 1 - 0 , a game best remembered for the hideous crack when Simonsen 's leg broke after a challenge from Yvon La Roux , and for Manuel Amoros headbutting Jesper Olsen .
Four days later they thrashed Yugoslavia 5 - 0 , although the official Uefa site says " there has never been a more misleading scoreline " .
World Soccer partly agreed , suggesting the match could have ended 10 - 6 or 12 - 7 to Denmark ; either way , it meant Piontek 's team required only a draw against Belgium , who themselves needed a win , to reach the semi-finals .
It was a bona fide classic , end - to - end and staggeringly ill - tempered in view of the fact that many of the Denmark side played in Belgium .
There were nine Anderlecht players on the pitch at one stage and , when Rene Vandereycken banjoed his club - mate Arnesen , another club - mate Morten Olsen shoved him over .
" If I had a gun , " said the usually calm Olsen , " I 'd have shot him . "
It was all so heated that , at one stage , the referee pushed Bergreen over .
Belgium went 2 - 0 up shortly before half - time , but a penalty from Arnesen and a header from Brylle put Denmark level and then , with six minutes to go , Elkjær scored his famous solo goal .
Denmark had discovered yet more uncharted territory : a European Championship semi-final against Spain .
Impossibly , this was an even better game .
Lerby gave Denmark an early lead , and , in an incredible , you - attack - we - attack second half , Arnesen and Elkjær hit the post either side of Antonio Maceda 's equaliser .
Spain had plenty of chances too .
Bergreen was sent off in extra time for a second bookable offence by the English referee George Courtney , but Denmark held on for penalties .
The first to miss was Laudrup , with the score 2 - 2 , but Courtney booked the Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada for encroachment and ordered a retake .
On it went to 4 - 4 when Elkjær , the man you 'd have put your house on , walked coolly up to the spot .
" I was n't nervous at all , " he said in Og Det Var Danmark .
" I 'd taken six penalties for my club that year and scored on all six , so I was sure I could do it . "
He passed it high over the bar .
Qvist ran across to hug Elkjær and promise he would save the next penalty , but Manuel Sarabia put Spain through to the final .
Elkjær trudged off , his backside visible because of a huge rip that had resulted from some earlier mistreatment by a Spanish defender .
Seeing another man's bare backside will never again be infused with such poetic sadness .
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE 'THE GAME '
While the world is reasonably familiar with Denmark 's very public exploits at Euro 84 and Mexico 86 , their apogee was a private party that occurred between the two tournaments : an extraordinary 4 - 2 victory over a very good USSR side in the 1986 qualifiers .
The date was 5 June 1985 , Danish constitution day , and it was when Danish Dynamite became cultural history .
Not until then did the Danes truly believe that the fairytale of Wembley and France was more than just that .
Not until then could the fans finally stick it to the chattering classes who had rejected football as an oafish pastime .
The game itself , played on a Wednesday afternoon in an astonishing atmosphere , could easily have ended 6 - 6 .
Elkjær and Laudrup – at that stage the world 's best strike partnership , followed by a lot of daylight – each scored two , and it swung from end to end at a pace that looks fast even by today 's standards ( watch most 80s games and you 'll see how much this has changed ) .
It was a relentless , pulsating contest of audacious finishing , goal - line clearances and breathtaking midfield charges that split open defences like a Japanese steel blade to the belly of a bloated tuna .
Piontek described it as the most beautiful game during his reign .
" What you saw from Laudrup and Elkjær against the Soviet Union really was not normal , " he said in the book Tynd Luft ( Thin Air ) .
" [ The Soviet players ] were so strong .
They could have won 5 - 4 or 6 - 5 .
There were no breaks .
It went boom - boom . "
" For me this will always be the game , " adds Laudrup .
" A lovely sunny afternoon , a packed national stadium and then the game itself : six goals – which could easily have been 10 – one amazing opponent and a match where nothing was decided even when at 4 - 1 after 67 minutes .
I 've have n't had that feeling before or after . "
It is the only football match that Molby owns on video .
" I was on the bench , " he said , " and it 's the best match I 've ever seen . "
MEXICO -BOUND
That USSR game was part of a topsy - turvy 1985 that summed up the Danes ' thrilling unpredictability .
They played eight games that year ; in four they failed to score , in the other four they scored 17 .
Five of those came in their penultimate World Cup qualifier , away at Norway .
Denmark went in at half - time 1 - 0 down and in serious danger of missing out on the World Cup .
They hammered five unanswered goals in the second half and then eviscerated Ireland 4 - 1 at Lansdowne Road in their final qualifier .
Perhaps it was simply a case of them finally getting their just deserts : in two scoreless qualifiers against Switzerland , they hit the post five times and missed a penalty .
Yet that is not the only year in which they had peculiar results .
In 1984 they lost 6 - 0 and 4 - 0 in friendlies against Holland and East Germany before excelling at Euro 84 .
They could be erratic within games , too : in their Mexico 86 match against Scotland , Denmark were kept at arms ' length for 75 minutes of the match .
But in the other 15 , leading up to Elkjær 's only goal , their rhythmic , incessant pressure made you feel that a goal was not so much in the post as sent by recorded delivery .
This was a team who could win 6 - 1 one week and lose 5 - 1 the next – as they did at Mexico 86 , when they became the only team since the 50s to score and concede at least five at the same World Cup .
' BUT JESPER , JESPER , JESPER …'
" In Mexico we shall attack , like we always do , " promised Piontek .
And even though they went out in the second round – the same as entirely forgettable sides from Italy , Morocco , Paraguay , Bulgaria , Poland and Uruguay – they were undeniably one of the teams of the tournament .
It is easy to look back with a revisionist gaze and assert that they never had a realistic chance of actually winning it , but that simply is not the case .
After the first week of the tournament , The Guardian 's David Lacey wrote that they were " at the head of a distinguished list of European candidates " to win the tournament .
When the ITV co-commentator Billy McNeill was asked during the Uruguay game whether they could win it , he said : " It would be difficult to back against them . "
In the ITV studio , Brian Clough raved about them .
They were the real deal .
Even after the tournament , Fifa 's technical report noted that they " played the most spectacular football during the tournament … their readiness to risk something , linked to a full physical commitment , provided the Danish game with an exceptional dynamism . "
It was not just their futuristic football that caught the eye .
Their kit was groundbreaking and breathtakingly cool : red -and - white halves were nothing that had n't been seen before , but the white and red pinstripes on them were , like the team , entirely new .
The kit was premiered at a fashion show that was live on the evening news of the sole Danish TV channel at the time , with Morten Olsen , Per Frimann and , of course , Arnesen modelling it on stage .
It was quickly called " the carnival suit " .
In a sense Denmark were lucky : Fifa banned similar halved shorts , which would have been too much of a good thing , and insisted that they could be only one colour for TV purposes .
So Denmark were left with basic red or white shorts to go with their red or white halved shirts , and used each permutation in their four games .
Denmark were placed in the very first Group of Death with West Germany , the South American champions Uruguay and Scotland .
Denmark were bottom seeds because it was their first World Cup .
Despite that , and the truly appalling pitch in Nezahualcoyotl ( staggeringly , it is described as " very good " by ITV's Helm ; in those days if it was green it was great , even if it was in reality a bobbling beast ) , they breezed through with three wins out of three .
First came a tight 1 - 0 win over Scotland , thanks to a typical through - the - brick - wall goal from Elkjær , and four days later they wowed the world by trouncing Uruguay 6 - 1 .
It ca n't be ignored that Uruguay were reduced to 10 men at 1 - 0 , but by then Denmark were already all over them .
It was unforgettable stuff .
Laudrup scored a solo goal of such smooth , bewitching brilliance that it almost overshadowed the fact that Elkjær scored three and made two in one of the World Cup 's great individual performances .
That left Denmark top of the group and with a conundrum going into the final match against West Germany : draw or win and they would face Spain in the second round , lose and they would have an easier match against Morocco .
Any potential inclination to throw the game was washed away by the opposition : Denmark had never beaten West Germany , except for a friendly in 1971 when Germany fielded an amateur side , and had not played them for 14 years because of German indifference towards an opponent they believed to be beneath them .
And Piontek , never given a real chance in his homeland , was desperate to win .
Having beaten Italy , France , England , the USSR and Uruguay in Piontek 's time , this was an irresistible chance to bloody the nose of another supposed superior .
Even though their second - round game was just five days away , Piontek rested only the players on a yellow card , Nielsen and Bergreen .
" We had a team meeting and decided to go for the win , " said Molby .
" The truth is we felt we could take them all . "
They took Germany , 2 - 0 in another staggeringly open game , with Jesper Olsen scoring a gloriously arrogant , gently caressed penalty that brought this superb commentary from Barry Davies : " ' Where am I going to put it ?
You 've gone the wrong way , have n't you . ' "
Unbeknownst to Denmark , their campaign was going the wrong way .
This should have been one of their finest hours , but when you watch the game now you can almost hear the Jaws music .
The genesis of the defeat to Spain lay here , with the frustratingly avoidable sending - off , and consequent suspension , of their playmaker Arnesen .
" I had been irritated throughout he game , " he said in a radio interview in 1989 .
" My wife had fallen ill .
She was lying there and one guy said it was meningitis and the other said it was a virus .
I think that was why I was incredibly aggressive .
She was n't on her death bed .
I think all the excitement that came with this had an indirect effect on what happened . "
Arnesen was ticking throughout the game .
First he was booked for dissent in the first half when he should have been given a penalty .
Then , after a breathtaking , high - speed dummy on the counter - attack that would have put him through on goal , he was butchered by Ditmar Jakobs .
In hindsight , it is obvious that Piontek should have taken him off .
But this was Germany , this was payback .
And with a couple of minutes left in the game , Denmark paid for it .
" I get the ball in the halfway line and it is as if I 'm trying to goad [ Lothar ] Matthaus , " says Arnesen .
" A little bit too much .
I could have just played the ball to Morten Olsen , but I keep the ball demonstratively a bit too long and then he comes gliding from behind and kicks me but does n't hit me , and then kicks again .
Just as I get up , I make a reflex move , where I just kick out behind me and just as I kick and see the ref , who is standing 20 metres from me , I knew that I was going to get sent off . "
By the standards of the day , it was n't a red - card offence – it was Beckham on Simeone , basically – but back then referees showed a straight red even when it was for two yellows , so we can perhaps assume that was the case here .
Arnesen put his hands to his knees , trying to work out what he had done , before his body relaxed itself and did a backwards cartwheel .
He then sat with his head on his knee for 10 seconds before walking over to shake Matthaus 's hand and apologise .
" And then you walk .
All the way to the other side of the pitch .
Damn , it was as if something was humming ...
Humming in my head .
I did n't hear anything .
I walked past [ the West German squad member ] Dieter Hoeness , who said : ' Why do you do something like that ? '. "
Denmark missed Arnesen terribly in the second - round match against Spain , although that was not apparent at first .
They took the lead through another magnificently lazy penalty from Olsen .
But Spain would not break .
Unlike almost every other team in the world , they were not afraid of Denmark .
This was n't a great Spain team , far from it , but something about Denmark rubbed them up the wrong way and made them find an extra level of determination .
They would also beat Denmark at Euro 88 and then , on the darkest of nights for Danish football , in qualification for the 1994 World Cup .
If Denmark were marginally the better side in the first half eight years earlier , they were far from their best .
And then the entire game changed on the stroke of half - time .
Hogh threw the ball out to Olsen , and he dummied Julio Salinas before playing an inexplicable , blind pass across the face of his own box .
Hogh was n't there , but Emilio Butragueno was , and he tapped it into the net .
" But Jesper , Jesper , Jesper , that 's lethal " said Gehrs with the most heartfelt resignation and national melancholy .
" I should n't have played that pass , " said Olsen 10 years later .
" It 's just one of those things you can't change .
If it had happened in the group stages , we would have played another game , and it could all have been forgotten .
Of course , it 's unfair that I will be remembered for such a thing , but that 's how it is .
It 's mainly in Denmark people still talk about it so maybe it 's good that I do n't live there . "
So they do .
To this day , a serious faux pas is described as a " rigtig Jesper Olsen " ( a real Jesper Olsen ) , whether by the general public or even in parliament .
It was traumatic stuff , for sure , yet the received wisdom that Denmark simply collapsed after that does n't ring true .
They started the second half strongly , with Elkjær nearly scoring after an outrageous angled run from the halfway line .
He then missed a decent chance before , against the run of play , Butragueno headed Spain in front in the 56th minute .
Piontek immediately brought on Eriksen , a forward , for Andersen , a defender , and that left Denmark exposed to ruthless Spanish counterattacks .
Some will say that Piontek went for it too soon – there was still half an hour to go when Eriksen came on – but Denmark were used to playing with three at the back , and an almost identical substitution at an identical stage of the Euro 84 match against Belgium had been rewarded when the substitute Brylle scored within three minutes .
The problem was not the change but the fact that , for whatever reason , Denmark completely lost their discipline .
A nominal 3 - 5 - 2 formation was more like 3 - 1 - 6 .
For the third goal , Busk was left one - on - one against Butragueno , with no other player within 30 yards ; for the fourth , Spain had four attackers on three defenders .
It unravelled quickly and disastrously , and Denmark were spanked .
This was truly shocking stuff : those who woke up the following morning ( it was an 11 pm kick - off in England ) to be told the score were not at all surprised .
Then they were told who had won .
With such a staggering defeat , there was an inevitable need to look for reasons .
A frequent refrain in the British broadsheets was that Denmark 's lung - busting power game could not cope with the squeezed itinerary of a major tournament , particularly in Mexican heat , while Piontek blamed the psyche that he had fought so hard to change .
" This Danish attitude started creeping in ( after the group stages in Mexico ) where players thought , ' Oh well , we 've made it this far , we 've done brilliantly and nobody can blame us ' , " he said in Tynd Luft .
" At the end , there was something missing in their frame of mind .
This transition to : ' We can and we must ! '
Perhaps it had n't succeeded as well as I thought . "
THE NEXT GENERATION
That , pretty much , was that .
By Euro 88 the team was past it , and lost all three games to Spain , Italy and West Germany .
They failed to reach Italia 90 .
One generation morphed into the next and , astonishingly , an inferior Denmark side won Euro 92 .
By now Piontek had gone : he was tipped over the edge in the summer of 1990 when a tabloid made dark claims about a bank account in Liechtenstein .
He resigned and took over as manager of Turkey .
Some said it was a smokescreen ; Piontek was open about the fact he wanted to take advantage of Turkey 's lenient tax laws , yet says he would have stayed but for that story .
Either way , it was a sad end .
He was not around to preside over Denmark 's most successful team , but he had certainly presided over their most memorable one .

At the end of the day , you have to judge a film on its merits .
You look at the movie before you , and then you consider the film that it was attempting to be .
If it were aiming to be a classic B - grade horror / comedy , did it succeed in striking that delicate balance of tone ?
If it were trying to capture the spirit of some nostalgic comic book , where does it rank relative to the source material ?
If it were trying to move you , were you moved ?
If it told a joke , did you laugh ?
There 's a four or five - star movie out there for every genre under the sun -- a near - perfect horror film , a drama , a comedy …
High marks are n't exclusive to high - brow art films , but they do have to be earned .
If you walk away from broader genre fare flummoxed by the inevitable onslaught of mediocre reviews , it 's important to remember that entertainment value alone does not equal quality .
With that in mind , I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell is the Godfather of raucous , twenty - something comedies .
It 's absolutely among the smartest , most well - written , disgusting , hilarious , endearing , offensive and downright best comedies within its genre to date .
It takes all the shocking audacity and infinite charm of sophomoric caricatures like Van Wilder or Harold and Kumar and turns them into actual characters -- real human beings whose reprehensible behavior masks actual vulnerability and fear .
It works , almost despite itself , on a number of comedic levels , proving that even the basest , most low - brow humor can be elevated by intelligent writing and real , dramatic performances .
The story itself , loosely adapted from Tucker Max 's book of the same name , is relatively simple …
Tucker , a hugely personable , adventure - chasing , narcissist , takes his newly - single , woman - hating companion , Drew , and his soon - to - be- married friend , Dan , on the search for a strip club called Avarice in far - off Salem .
Of the three , Dan is certainly the most grounded – a regular guy looking for one last blast before tying the knot .
Tucker , capable of charming women with this overwrought confidence and ironic sexism , is made to seem all the more palatable by Drew , who one assumes , at heart , is probably a decent guy , but who is tonight , post break - up , murderously loathing of all womankind .
Needless to say , much of the dialogue or behavior in this movie is n't particularly kind toward women , and it is to the film 's tremendous credit that the real - life Tucker Max and his co-writer Nils Parker populate the film with strong , independent females who counter , deflate – and sometimes mend -- our heroes at almost every turn .
This behavior , which lesser films tend to glorify and even reward , is never without its judgment , whether from each other or from the women they encounter along the way .
And that I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell is even the slightest bit interested in digging past the sex and sexism to the core of what these characters are emotionally guarding makes it the most mature possible telling of such an immature story .
And make no mistake , there 's plenty of raunchy hilarity to go around .
The film sports some incredibly off - color dialogue which manages to sound both intellectual and clever while being , at the same time , hilariously crass .
There 's nudity and sex , midgets and deaf chicks , vomit and uncontrollable sh*tting , and for every notion that appears , at first , to cross the line into actual offense , there 's a pay - off that either turns it back around on the trio or reveals some dramatic truth about themselves .
Actor Matt Czuchry manages to make Tucker likeable even at his most despicable and Jess Bradford deserves equal credit for making Drew so utterly un-likeable so that another character can come along and fix him …
And lastly director Bob Gosse manages to strike an incredible balance here , never ascending too far into the heights of drama nor wallowing in the gutters of tastelessness .
It 's a subtle , skillful turn for the director .
Opening in limited release and expanding further depending upon its buzz , one imagines that this film will ultimately find some cult success amongst the college crowd and twenty - somethings regardless of whatever star rating we award it .
But critically speaking , this is probably one of best versions of this kind of film you 're likely to see for awhile …in Hell , Heaven or wherever else they might serve beer .
Mother who killed disabled daughter and herself in car fire ' suffered years of abuse from gang '
A mother died alongside her mentally disabled daughter in a blazing car after suffering nearly ten years of abuse from yobs , an inquest heard yesterday .
Fiona Pilkington , 38 , made 21 calls to police in a bid to stop the gang abusing her daughter Francecca Hardwick , but they failed to act .
She had even written to her local MP .
On the day of her death she called police to complain of children trampling her garden hedge but was told to ignore them .
Constant abuse : Fiona Pilkington , 38 , ( R ) who was full - time carer to Francecca , 18 , was driven to despair by a gang of youths
Pam Cassell , Miss Pilkington 's mother , told the inquest the same youths were responsible for all the abuse .
They would also urinate in the garden and throw stones and eggs at the house , the inquest heard .
Mrs Cassell said : ' It was Halloween and firework night coming up and Fiona was dreading them because she knew that the children would start throwing things at the house and start putting fireworks through the letter box .
' They would start on Fiona and throw things and then go round the back and do things in the garden .
It was always the same group of youths .
' Sometimes they would go round the side of the house and urinate .
' They used to ring on the doorbell and say that she had been hitting her kids .
They were petty things like that .
' They used to throw stones at the house and then they threw acorns and flour and eggs .
Blaze : Ms Pilkington and her daughter had to be identified by matching DNA from their relatives
' Frankie was frustrated because she could n't go out in the garden without being tormented or teased .
We used to take her to the park and take her out in the rain because she used to love jumping in puddles .
' Frankie could be genuinely loveable but when she was frustrated she used to pull hair and bite and punch because she could n't do what she wanted to do . '
Mrs Cassell added that the gang , which often numbered 16 , would torment Francecca and her brother before they went to bed .
They would throw stones at the window and try and get her to lift up her nightdress . '
The abuse began when Miss Pilkington 's dyslexic son Anthony , 19 , fell out with a child who lived on the same street in Barwell , Leicestershire , when he was just eight .
In one incident , Anthony was marched at knifepoint into a shed .
Miss Pilkington and 18 - year - old Francecca died in October 2007 .
Their burnt - out car was found in a lay - by in Earl Shilton , Leicestershire .
Reports at the time suggested the mother poured petrol on clothes on the back seat and lit them .
The inquest was told that the resulting explosion and fire burnt both bodies beyond recognition .
The blazing car was found in a lay - by on the A47 near Earl Shilton , Leicestershire on October 23 , 2007 , an inquest at Loughborough Town Hall heard today .
Mrs Cassell added that at one point the council imposed a 300 - yard exclusion zone for the youths around the family 's house but that had failed to enforce it .
She said her daughter contacted the council four or five times and phoned police at least 10 times a year demanding help .
She said the school holidays and the weekends were the worst and her daughter constantly had the curtains in her front room closed .
Mrs Cassell said : ' She was in despair really , nobody did anything and she was just frustrated .
She wanted them just to do something .
' Nobody was doing anything to help her , not the police , the council or the Neighbourhood Watch were doing anything . '
Ms Pilkington 's mother added that the family had never taken a holiday together and her daughter did not receive respite care because she did not know how to get it .
She also said that the support from Frankie 's special school , the Dorothy Goodman School in Hinckley , had failed to take on board the family situation .
As Mrs Cassell gave evidence , her grandson Anthony cried .
He was described as being close to his sister , who was getting stronger as she grew older .
The court also heard Ms Pilkington , who had a boyfriend , had attempted to kill herself and her two children before but changed her mind after she failed to find a spot to park and set light to her car .
Asked by the coroner why her daughter took Frankie on the fateful trip , Mrs Cassell said : ' She did n't think anybody would be able to cope with Frankie , she was getting a lot stronger . '
The court also heard that when the family made friends with the paperboy , the gang started abusing him so he stopped being friendly .
The inquest heard that families in Barden Road were still being abused , despite the deaths of Ms Pilkington and her daughter .
The hearing continues .
This groundbreaking result was the work of several complexity theorists - Sanjeev Arora , Boaz Barak , Markus Brunnermeier , and Rong Ge in their new paper Computational Complexity and Information Asymmetry in Financial Products .
So what do they prove ?
They prove that even for very simple CDOs ( collateralized debt obligations ) , which is debt turned into securities , that there is no computer or set of computers powerful enough in the world to determine whether the CDOs contain a high proportion of lemons - bad asset classes that are worthless .
This is a strong result : these sorts of computational intractability results are what we rest modern cryptography upon .
Freedom to Tinker has a summary :
Trading in derivatives brought down Lehman Brothers , AIG , and many other buyers , based on mistaken assumptions about the independence of the underlying asset prices ; they underestimated the danger that many mortgages would all default at the same time .
But the new paper shows that in addition to that kind of danger , risks can arise because a seller can deliberately construct a derivative with a booby trap hiding in plain sight .
The paper shows the example of a high - volume seller who builds 1000 CDOs from 1000 asset - classes of home mortages .
Suppose the seller knows that a few of those asset classes are " lemons " that wo n't pay off .
The seller is supposed to randomly distribute the asset classes into the CDOs ; this minimizes the risk for the buyer , because there 's only a small chance that any one CDO has more than a few lemons .
But the seller can " tamper " with the CDOs by putting most of the lemons in just a few of the CDOs .
This has an enormous effect on the senior tranches of those tampered CDOs .
In principle , an alert buyer can detect tampering even if he does n't know which asset classes are the lemons : he simply examines all 1000 CDOs and looks for a suspicious overrepresentation of some of the asset classes in some of the CDOs .
What Arora et al. show is that is an NP - complete problem ( " densest subgraph " ) .
This problem is believed to be computationally intractable ; thus , even the most alert buyer can't have enough computational power to do the analysis .
The paper itself contains a great introduction to the study of the topic .
To quote them :
One of our main results suggests that it may be computationally intractable to price derivatives even when buyers know almost all of the relevant information , and furthermore this is true even in very simple models of asset yields .
The primary focus is on how the asymmetry of information between the buyer and the seller - the fact that the seller knows what among the debts being sold is bad and what 's good , whereas the buyer may not - that is known .
The paper proves that detecting the lemons among the bundles is computationally equivalent to a known hard problem ( that is , one that is essentially impossible to solve ) .
In other words , let 's say you 're a buyer and you devise a way to detect lemons in the CDO bundles you 're sold - this paper proves that your solution also can be used to solve a problem that no computer scientist today can solve .
So ...it's unlikely you 'll be able to detect the lemons .
As they say :
It is well - recognized that since a seller is more knowledgeable about the assets he is selling , he may design the derivative advantageously for himself by suitable cherry - picking .
However since securitization with derivatives usually involves tranching , and the seller retains the junior tranche which takes the first losses , it was felt that this is sufficient deterrence against cherry - picking ( ignoring for now the issue of how the seller can be restrained from later selling the junior tranche ) .
We will show below that this assumption is incorrect in our setting , and even tranching is no safeguard against cherry - picking .
It gets even worse , though , and this is the bad news for those who want to tinker around the edges with reform :
Would a lemons law for derivatives ( or an equivalent in terms of a standard clauses in CDO contracts ) remove the problems identified in this paper ?
The paper suggests a surprising answer : in many models , even the problem of detecting the tampering ex post may be intractable .
That is , even after losing your shirt , you can't prove that you were sold junk .
Which means an agency tasked with regulating the securitized garbage would n't be able to prove it either .
So , what are we going to do about it ?
Update : I wanted to point out this interesting observation made by NCrissieB ( emphasis mine ) :
Students are increasingly using brain - boosting drugs – and they 're virtually impossible to ban , an expert warned today .
Drugs normally used for conditions such as Alzheimer 's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are being used by students around the world to improve their academic performance .
In some US universities , a quarter of students are reportedly using " smart drugs " , and there is anecdotal evidence of increasing use on British campuses .
The Academy of Medical Sciences said last year that the use of medicines " off label " is likely to rise .
" The expectation that ' off - label ' use will increase is borne out by existing advertising of cognition enhancers and smart drugs on the internet , " it said .
The use of the drugs in UK schools and workplaces raised " many of the same issues as the use of performance - enhancing drugs in sport " .
Vince Cakic , from the department of psychology at the University of Sydney , writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics , said today that smart drugs , or " nootropics " , were highly attractive to students and nearly impossible to ban .
" High school and university are the primary competitive spheres of many people 's lives , and ones that have significant bearing upon their lives , in terms of both career opportunities and future earning capacity .
" The pressure to succeed academically is very real , and in a climate in which high - stakes public examinations have increased demand for private tuition , it is likely that all avenues for performance enhancement will be exhausted . "
He said the failures and inconsistencies in the anti-drugs policy in sport could be mirrored when it comes to the use of smart drugs in the academic world .
" If the current situation in competitive sport is anything to go by , any attempt to prohibit the use of nootropics will probably be difficult or inordinately expensive to police effectively . "
Cakic said that although smart drugs had been shown to improve brain power by only a modest amount , " it appears likely that more effective compounds will be developed in the future and that their off - label use will increase " .
He said : " It is thought that future nootropics will encompass a wide array of drugs that enhance memory , attention , alertness , motivation , executive function , creativity or the need for sleep .
He added : " The possibility of purchasing ' smartness in a bottle ' is likely to have broad appeal to students . "
The drugs are available in the UK but are prescribed for a range of medical conditions .
They include donepezil ( Aricept ) , galantamine ( Reminyl ) and rivastigmine ( Exelon ) for use in Alzheimer 's , methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) for use in ADHD , the stimulant modafinil for narcolepsy and the amphetamine Dexedrine .
A previous report has identified 27 major agents currently available in the UK that boost brain performance , including 10 dietary supplements and 17 pharmaceutical drugs .
Cakic said the argument that these drugs should be banned for non-medical use because they offer some students an unfair advantage is like suggesting private tuition be banned .
The drugs might even level the playing field for those who have been disadvantaged , he said .
A spokeswoman for Universities UK said : " Currently , much of the evidence available on the use of drugs such as Ritalin among students is largely anecdotal .
" However , universities take the issue of drug abuse very seriously , and would have grave concerns about students taking drugs not prescribed to them .
Not only is this illegal but it also poses health risks to those students .
" All universities would advise students under pressure to seek advice from university counselling services , welfare officers or their GP . "

Dubai prices have dropped 32 percent in the last year and 40 percent in the last quarter , according to the latest edition of the Knight Frank Global House Price Index , released today .
Along with Dubai , Latvia ( 36 percent ) and Singapore ( 23.8 percent ) saw the largest declines since the first quarter of 2008 , the property firm reports .
Israel posted the largest gain in the last year , a 10.9 increase from the first quarter of 2008 , followed by the Czech Republic with a 9.9 percent increase , Jersey ( an island off the coast of Normandy that is part of the British commonwealth ) with a 6.9 percent jump and Switzerland , which recorded a 5.6 percent increase .
But Knight Frank saw little good news in the numbers , predicting the slump in property prices is likely to continue through the remainder of 2009 .
“ The world ’s housing markets remain under intense pressure with little real evidence of any of the hoped for ‘ green shoots , ’ ” head of international research Nick Barnes said in a press release .
“ The inescapable trend is that the worst and most widespread economic recession since the 1930s continues to batter housing markets across the globe . ”
No matter how you slice or dice it , the housing market is bad and keeps on being bad .
As reported today by RealtyTrac , foreclosure activity in the third quarter saw " one in every 136 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing during the quarter : the highest quarterly foreclosure rate since Realty Trac began issuing its report in the first quarter of 2005 . "
" Housing rebound " - meet facts .
RealtyTrac® ( www.realtytrac.com), the leading online marketplace for foreclosure properties , today released its U.S. Foreclosure Market Report™ for Q3 2009 , which shows that foreclosure filings — default notices , scheduled auctions and bank repossessions — were reported on 937,840 properties in the third quarter , a 5 percent increase from the previous quarter and an increase of nearly 23 percent from Q3 2008 .
One in every 136 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing during the quarter — the highest quarterly foreclosure rate since Realty Trac began issuing its report in the first quarter of 2005 .
Foreclosure filings were reported on 343,638 properties in September , a 4 percent decrease from the previous month but a 29 percent increase from September 2008 .
Despite the monthly decrease , September ’s total was still the third highest monthly total since the RealtyTrac report began in January 2005 , behind only July and August of this year .
“ Bank repossessions , or REOs , jumped 21 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter , corresponding to jumps in defaults and scheduled auctions in the previous two quarters , ” said James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac .
“ REO activity increased from the previous quarter in all but two states and the District of Columbia , indicating that lenders may be starting to work through some of the pent - up foreclosure inventory caused by legislative delays , loan modification efforts and high volumes of distressed properties . ”
If indeed the limitation on REO activity is coming to an end , look for foreclosed inventory to start hitting the market in earnest , thus keeping the onus on the Fed to preserve mortgage rates as low as possible ( read a QE extension is virtually guaranteed ) as every sub 5 % new and refi loan will be milked to the maximum by all those who believe it is their sworn duty to reflate the housing bubble .
As for where the pain continues to be greatest : no surprise as the usual suspects rear their post - last bubble head : California , Florida , Arizona , Nevada , Illinois and Michigan .
Since its announcement , the new Independent Safeguarding Authority has been causing controversy and provoked something of a backlash against the Home Office and minister for children Ed Balls .
Its vetting and barring system will come into force next month although the government has yet to provide enough information about the scheme to say exactly how it will work .
Nonetheless , it 's clear already that the new system is designed to feed upon parents ' irrational fears about the security of their children .
Of course there 's a threat to children 's safety , but to subject potentially millions of people to intrusive and discriminatory bureaucracy because a very very small minority of those concerned may be sex offenders is irrational paranoia .
Everyone is being labelled a ‘ paedophile until proven otherwise ' - this is just barmy !
Instead of spending so much energy protecting children from exaggerated threats to their safety we ought to be protecting them from the unpleasant atmosphere of suspicion that the Home Office seems so keen to promote .
We should be asking ourselves , do we want to undermine children 's trust in their carers ?
There are still many unanswered questions regarding the ISA and the new system .
Anne Fairweather , from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation , has welcomed the scheme although expressed doubts as to whether it 's too much too soon .
She stated that :
We have serious concerns about the way the scheme is being introduced .
We are less than a month away and it is still not clear what information recruitment agencies should refer to the Independent Safeguarding Authority and when this should take place .
The Home Office is trying to push the scheme through before the public , employment bodies and those in childcare have time to properly consider it .
I suppose they reckon that if they announce the scheme shortly before it is to come into effect , there wo n't be much time for organised opposition - exactly the kind of anti-democratic ploy we 've come to expect from this government .
There are , however , positive signs that the tide may be turning against Home Office bullying .
As Tom Ash blogged this week , 54 % of respondents to a PoliticsHome poll were of the view that " vetting anyone that has frequent contact with children " is a bad idea .
Politicians will need to hear this opposition if it is to be effective .
Blogger Matthew Taylor has drafted a brilliant template for a letter against the ISA to send to your local MP .
Matthew 's letter should certainly help people in getting their complaint across .
As he points out , it 's best to try and personalise the letter a little as this will be more effective .
Using WriteToThem.com you can send a letter to your MP without all the hassles of paper and envelopes .
You 've even got a template to start you off , so there 's no excuse not to make your complaint !
The ISA and its vetting scheme stands to affect potentially 11 million people - around one in every six people .
Whether or not you work in childcare , you may still become a victim of these unnecessary and intrusive procedures .
HONG KONG — Australia on Tuesday became the first major economy to raise interest rates in the wake of the global financial crisis , as policy makers around the globe debated how to withdraw their huge stimulus programs without upsetting a fragile economic recovery .
The Reserve Bank of Australia , in a move that came earlier than many economists had expected and reflected the relative strength of the nation ’s economy , raised its main cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point , to 3.25 percent .
The action reverses some of the series of rapid - fire cuts that the bank had made to the cost of borrowing in a bid to shelter the economy since September 2008 , when Lehman Brothers ’ collapse set off the global credit crisis .
Those aggressive cuts , by a combined 4.25 percentage points to a level last seen in 1960 , plus a set of government stimulus measures , were widely credited with helping Australia become one of the few industrialized countries to avoid a major slump over the past year .
The bank ’s decision Tuesday to start raising rates again was made amid mounting signs that the global economy was on the path to at least a modest recovery .
That broad improvement has fueled a debate among policy makers around the world about whether the time is ripe to start unwinding some of the extraordinary economic stimulus measures they took after Lehman ’s demise — or whether a precipitous withdrawal of those support measures could risk nipping the recovery in the bud .

Exclusive : Trailer for NBC's DAY ONE is like War of the Worlds meets LOST !
Christopher Webster [ Cathode Ray Mission 07.07.09 ] post apocalyptic scifi
Tweet
[ Editor 's note : Does anyone else get the feeling this is like Thomas M. Disch 's THE GENOCIDES ? ]
With some in - your - face genre blending and amazing action set pieces , it would seem as though NBC 's upcoming post - apocalyptic show , Day One , is primed to lay waste to the competition come 2010 .
Think we 're exaggerating ?
Think again people .
This show looks far more interesting and way weirder than we ever imagined .
We got our hands one the first extended trailer for the show , and it looks like its got it all : a global disaster , some kind of invasion and a group of survivors chosen by a higher being .
Yes , all the characters are young and pretty , but with an intense and mysterious scifi concept rivaling anything you 'll find in the cinemas this summer , this show could be pretty awesome .
Synopsis :
Day
One chronicles a global catastrophe from the perspective of the residents of a southern California apartment complex .
In the wake of a mysterious event that has shattered lines of communication and ( literally ) changed the shape of the world , the survivors must work together to both rebuild and save the Earth from a menace that might have already consumed countless other worlds ...
Also note that the trailer is n't of the highest quality so I would expect some of the CGI to look a lot sharper when the show airs in HD .
Check out the very first trailer for Day One after the break !

On the surface , it DOES seem to bear a BIG striking resemblance to THE GENOCIDES .
Getting a hold of the pilot script to see JUST how close it is would be rather interesting .
And it would be frakkin ' hilarious if the people behind this thing had read THE GENOCIDES ... they then decided they could just rip off elements of it , since the book is 40 years old and no suits at NBC would know about the book anyway ... and now that the show has been made , NBC could find itself faced with a lawsuit for creative property theft .
It would crack me up if that 's what happened , and with this thing in the can if NBC had to suddenly pony up big money to make a lawsuit go away .

I know I am no longer interested in TV these days as they never let them really settle in .

It was my return to network programming .
Just like always networks continue to make bad decisions .
Why bother to waste my valueable time on something that they have already shown time after time no commitment .
I have been watching NCIS Reruns and wondering how it past the 1st two season it did not get good until the character Ziva and the others had time to develop .
Guess that is what happens when you allow TV to build and audience I heard NCIS during American Idol pulled the same viewer numbers as Jericho did it 's 1st season .
Truly ashame that networks do not show any commitment to us the loyal viewer .

The world is in pieces , but omg are we lucky the cellphones still work ... tsss
Edit 22 septembre 2009 : Comme beaucoup me l’ont fait remarquer en commentaires , le cycle du CO2 humain est très différent du cycle du CO2 fossile et si le calcul ci-dessous reste intéressant , il n’en demeure pas moins que le cycliste pollue beaucoup moins que les transports en commun ou quoi que ce soit qui utilise un moteur ( cf commentaires de Mathieu et Quentin ) …
Cette semaine , j’ai décidé d’essayer de venir au travail à vélo .
Cela me fait un trajet de 15 kilomètres , en trois quarts d’heures , et j’ai trouvé un chemin sympa .
C’est donc très agréable ( on verra quand il pleuvra si c’est toujours aussi agréable … ) , et deuxième avantage , on se sent écolo :-)
Mais l’est - on vraiment ?
Je me demandais dans quelle mesure un cycliste rejette du CO 2 ; j’ai donc cherché pour faire les calculs et en avoir le coeur net , et ai cherché combien un être humain rejette de CO 2 pendant l’effort .
J’ai trouvé sur Wikipedia ( évidemment ) ainsi que sur Volodalen.com , un site de coureurs .
Selon ces deux sites , au repos , la VCO 2 ( production instantanée de dioxyde carbone rapportée à l’unité de temps ) est d’environ 0,8 litre / minute .
Lorsque l’effort s’intensifie , la VCO 2 monte ( en même temps que la VO 2 , la consommation d’oxygène ) jusqu’à environ 5 l/min .
Ceci pour un sportif « moyen à bon » de 80 kilos .
Ce n’est pas tout à fait moi , mais on va supposer que oui car je n’ai pas l’intention d’aller faire les mêmes graphiques dans une clinique ;-)
Voici le graphique en question :
Selon les mêmes pages , on trouve entre ces deux extrêmes le « seuil ventilatoire » qui représente un niveau d’effort conséquent mais « tenable » longtemps ( plus d’une demi- heure d’après « Le sport après 50 ans » ) .
Je vais donc considérer qu’à vélo , je me mets d’instinct à ce niveau d’effort .
À ce seuil ventilatoire , nos deux graphiques nous donnent une VCO 2 de 3,5 l/ minute au seuil ventilatoire .
C’est parti pour les calculs !
Considérons le CO 2 comme un gaz parfait étant donné que la pression est basse ; on utilise donc
p.V = n.R.T
avec :
p : pression en Pa ( pascals ) .
Nous avons p = 101325 au niveau de la mer
V : volume en m3 .
Nous avons ici 3,5 litres de CO 2 , soit 0.0035m3
n : en mol , que nous cherchons
R : constante = 8,314472 J.mol-1.K-1
T : température en Kelvin .
Nous avons 293.15 °K pour 20°C .
Cela nous donne n = ( P.V ) /( R.T ) , soit n = ( 101325*0,0035 ) /( 8,314472*293,15 ) : n = 0.1454 mol de CO 2 .
La masse molaire du CO 2 est de 44 g/ mol ( 2* M O + M C avec M O = 16 et M C = 12 ) .
J’expire donc 6.40g / minute de CO 2 .
( Ces calculs rappellent la terminale … )
Sachant que ma vitesse moyenne est d’environ 20 km/h , il me faut 3 minutes pour parcourir un kilomètre et je rejette donc ( roulement de tambour ) 19,20 g/ km de CO 2 à vélo .
Au repos , à 0,8 l/m de CO 2 expiré ( calcul identique ) , je rejette donc 1.46 g/ minute .
Dans ma voiture il me faut 1 minute par kilomètre ( en moyenne sur ses 30000 km , on est à 62 km / h ) , soit 1.46g / km auxquels on ajoute les 149g / km provenant du moteur : 150,46 g/ km en voiture .
En train , en comptant 90 km / h , ça donne 0.97 g/ km ( car je me repose aussi ) .
On ne comptera pas la pollution du gros diesel du train qui doit faire peur , vu que de toutes façons , il roule aussi si je ne suis pas dedans ( suite au commentaire de Carsten : d’après eco-malin.com , un train diesel rejette environ 90 à 110 g / km de CO 2 par passager .
Si l’on compte qu’il y a 100 passagers dedans , cela fait 10 kilos par kilomètre – yay !
Si la SNCF se décidait à électrifier la ligne Toulouse - Auch , ça changerait pas mal : un train électrique c’est 5g / km / passager ) .
En conséquence , on peut considérer que je pollue vingt fois plus en venant au travail à vélo plutôt qu’en train ( en ignorant la pollution du moteur du train qui est « inévitable » ; si on la compte , c’est cinq fois moins à vélo ) , et seulement sept fois moins en venant à vélo plutôt qu’en voiture .
Bon , bien sûr , ce calcul cède à la mode du CO 2 / kilomètre , sans tenir compte de tout le reste des saletés rejetées par un moteur et que je ne rejette pas …
D’autre part , Guillaume me fait remarquer que le cycle de vie du CO 2 « humain » est très court ( l ’O 2 est transformé en CO 2 par notre corps qui se nourrit de ( entre autres ) végétaux , qui le captent pour pousser ) , tandis que le cycle de vie du CO 2 des moteurs à explosion est très long ( ils se « nourrissent » d’énergie fossile qui met des millions d’années à se reconstituer ) .
Dernier détail : plus tu es sportif , plus tes VO 2 max et VCO 2 max sont élevées , et plus tu rejettes …
Si ça se trouve , Lance Armstrong rejette autant qu’une Smart ? :-)
Below the jump , text , translation , and commentary on Genesis 1:1 - 3 .
My thesis : the traditional view of God the Creator is as tenable as ever .
Scholars are known to succumb to the temptation of suggesting that their findings are of revolutionary significance even if they are not .
It ’s an issue of framing .
If the desire of your heart is to be a revolutionary , you will frame your findings in opposition to all previous interpretation .
This appears to be the path that Ellen Van Wolde has chosen ( note this press report ; for a first reaction , see Doug Chaplin here ) .
Based on her recent findings – most of which do not seem unusual – she asserts : “ The traditional view of God the Creator is untenable now . ”
At the very least , saying something like that is a surefire way to attract attention .

It ’s complicated syntax – similar to that at the beginning of the creation accounts of Enuma Elish , the Atrahasis Epic , and Gen 2:4 b - 7 ( compare 5:1 ) .
Long before EE and AE were discovered , Rashi and Ibn Ezra understood the syntax of Gen 1:1 - 3 along the above lines .
That is , they understood Gen 1:1 to be a temporal clause which introduces that which follows , not an independent main clause .
Those who read the text thus differ with respect to the identification of the main clause , with most , as above , taking “ God said ” as the main clause , rather than “ the land was welter and waste . ”
A short list of eminent Hebraists who read the syntax along the above lines : Rashi , Ibn Ezra ( misidentifying however the matrix clause ) , Ewald , Dillmann , Humbert ( misidentifying however the matrix clause ) , Speiser , and Francis Andersen ; recently , Robert Holmstedt ( who offers an analysis in terms of a type of relative clause : [ UPDATE : go here and here ] ) .
NJPSV and Robert Alter translate accordingly .
“ Welter and waste ” is Alter ’s translation of תהו ובהו .
The New English Bible ( NEB ) reads something like a compromise :
In the beginning of creation ,
when God made heaven and earth ,
the earth was without form and void ,
with darkness over the face of the abyss ,
and a mighty wind that swept over the surface of the waters .
God said , ‘ Let there be light ’ , and there was light .
REB wimped out and returned to the more familiar translation : “ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . ” NRSV , somewhat like NEB , tries to have it both ways :
“ In the beginning , when God created . . . , the earth was unformed and void .
. . .
Then God said . ”
On the understanding of Genesis 1 I here re-propose , something of the process of divine creation is described in Gen 1 .
God is a faber who works with pre-existing materials .
The description of water as pre-existing in 1:2 is the narrative presupposition in 1:6 .
On this understanding , the narrative presupposes the transformation of pre-existent waste and welter into land , with overt narration in 1:9 of its appearance as properly configured land , by divine decree , in the midst of pre-existent water .
The creation ex nihilo and by divine fiat of sky in the midst of pre-existent water is recounted in 1:6 .
Darkness is also pre-existent , per 1:2 .
Light is the first thing recounted to have been created ex nihilo and by divine fiat , in 1:3 .
This serves to raise “ light ” to the preeminent position in the hierarchy of creation .
It is hard not to think of this as anything other than an exceedingly forceful theological statement with echoes in countless other passages , e.g. Psalms 19 and 104 .
Later reflection on God as Creator led to a generalization of the ex nihilo principle .
The generalization is compatible with Gen 1 .
Gen 1 is concerned with ( 1 ) the sequential fashioning of the components of creation and ( 2 ) assignment of relative functions - on ( 2 ) , John Walton has written persuasively .
Genesis 1 , correctly understood , does not imply that darkness , chaotic stuff , and the abyss existed at an absolute beginning , or non-beginning , co-eternal with an eternal God .
The text does not recount an absolute beginning .
Genesis 1 - 2:4b recounts how God began and completed the creation of heaven and earth and all that is in them .
There is a nice inclusio , with 2:1 - 3 picking up in a variety of ways on the language of 1:1 .
At every step of the way , God in sovereign freedom makes his moves .
It is natural to assume that the utterly subordinate realities the text refers to in 1:2 - 3 , the darkness , the deep , and chaotic stuff , were themselves created by God. Isaiah 45:6 - 7 affirms as much with respect to darkness :
אֲנִי יְהוָה וְאֵין עוֹ ד
יוֹצֵר אוֹר וּבוֹרֵא חֹשֶׁך ְ
עֹשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם וּבוֹרֵא רָ ע
אֲנִי יְהוָה עֹשֶׂה כָל־אֵלֶּה ׃
I am יהוה , there is no other ;
the faber of light , the creator of darkness ,
the maker of weal , the creator of woe :
I , יהוה , am the maker of all of these .
Are we to assume that “ the maker of all of these ” made darkness from pre-existent materials ?
That would be an unfounded assumption .
Later theological reflection led to an insistence on creatio ex nihilo for all things , darkness , the waters of the deep , and whatever stuff may have been used to fashion earth included .
This is in tune with Gen 1 even if Gen 1 does not go there .
If the desire of your heart is to examine the evidence afresh on the basis of currently available resources , with the expectation that others have come to similar conclusions based on the resources available to them , you will frame your findings as far as is possible in continuity with previous interpretation .
This is what I have done in this post .
A final note .
I eagerly look forward to the appearance of Ellen Van Wolde ’s forthcoming monograph through Eisenbrauns ( details here ; James Spinti informs me that the proofs will be available for perusal at SBL New Orleans ) .
I have reservations about the way she frames her findings , but not about the quality of her scholarship , which is top - notch .

ESO : Media Telecon to Discuss Significant Exoplanet Finding
Press Release From : European Southern Observatory
Posted : Thursday , October 15 , 2009
On Monday 19 October 2009 , astronomers will report at the international ESO / CAUP exoplanet conference in Porto , Portugal , on a significant discovery in the field of exoplanets , obtained with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher , better known as HARPS , the spectrograph for ESO 's 3.6 - meter telescope .
ESO will host a media teleconference on Monday 19 October 2009 , at 1:45 p.m. CEST ( 7:45 a.m. EDT in the United States ) , to be streamed online .
The teleconference participants are :
- Stephane Udry , Geneva Observatory , Switzerland
- Xavier Bonfils , LAOG , Grenoble , France
- Nuno Santos , University of Porto , Portugal
To participate in the teleconference , reporters must get accredited by contacting Henri Boffin by email ( hboffin@eso.org ) .
Reporters will need to have access to a computer , with a recent version of Adobe 's Macromedia Flash Player installed and an Internet connection with a minimum bandwidth requirement of 56 kB / s. Further information will be provided to the accredited reporters .
Graphics and supporting information will be shown during the teleconference , and also be available at the start of the news conference at http://www.eso.org/
The ESO / CAUP conference " Towards Other Earths : perspectives and limitations in the ELT era " , takes place in Porto on 19 - 23 October 2009 .
This conference discusses the new generation of instruments and telescopes that is now being conceived and built by different teams around the world to allow the discovery of other Earths , especially for the European Extremely Large Telescope ( E - ELT ) .
The discoveries are simultaneously presented by Michel Mayor at the international symposium " Heirs of Galileo : Frontiers of Astronomy " in Madrid , Spain .

Santos ( Submitted on 15 Jun 2009 ) The GJ 581 planetary system was already known to harbour three planets , including two super - Earths planets which straddle its habitable zone .
We report here the detection of an additional planet - GJ 581e - with a minimum mass of 1.9 M_earth With a period of 3.15 days , it is the innermost planet of the system and has a 5 % transit probability .
We also correct our previous confusion of the orbital period of GJ 581d ( the outermost planet ) with a one - year alias , thanks to an extended time span and many more measurements .
The revised period is 66.8 days , and locates the semi-major axis inside the habitable zone of the low mass star .
The dynamical stability of the 4 - planet system imposes an upper bound on the orbital plane inclination .
The planets cannot be more massive than approximately 1.6 times their minimum mass .

( 1057 kb , D) 1 . Introduction : HARPS is a vacuum spectrograph designed to measure precise radial velocities , with the specific goal of searching for exoplanets in the Southern hemisphere Mayor et al. ( 2003 ) .
This high - resolution Echelle spectrograph ( R=115000 ) is fiber - fed by the ESO 3.6 - meter telescope at La Silla Observatory .
The consortium which built this instrument was granted 500 observing nights over five years to conduct a comprehensive search for exoplanets .
This large programme addresses several key exoplanet questions , including the characterization of very low mass exoplanets .
A significant fraction of the observing time was devoted to the study of planets orbiting stars at the bottom of the main sequence .
The M - dwarf sub - programme includes over 100 stars , which form a volume - limited sample .
Our HARPS search for southern exoplanets orbiting Mdwarfs is on - going , and has been recently expanded to a larger sample of some 300 low - mass stars .

France ’s highest constitutional authority ruled in June that Internet access is a fundamental human right , killing the three - strikes provision in the so - called Hadopi anti-piracy legislation .
Today the infamous anti-piracy bill is back and in its revamped form has just been adopted by the Senate .
" 3 Strikes " is back on the table .
Again .
After initially being adopted back in May , President Nicolas Sarkozy recently suffered an embarrassing defeat when the original version of the controversial Hadopi anti-piracy legislation was kicked out by the Constitutional Council , France ’s highest legal authority .
They had taken a similar stance to that of the European Parliament , deeming the proposed “ 3 strikes ” regime for dealing with illicit file - sharers unconstitutional .
They said that individuals must have a fair trial and striking an individual from the Internet is something only a judge can do after a hearing .
So now in modified form the bill is back .
Moving the decision to disconnect file - sharers away from the Hadopi agency to the courts , the new version of the law addresses the objections of the Constitutional Council by presenting “ 3 strikes ” cases to a judge , who will fast - track decisions in around 5 minutes per case .
The new structure is as follows .
When an individual is warned about an infringement for a third time , the Hadopi agency will report the offender to a judge .
After a hearing the judge will have the power to cut the individual off from the Internet , issue a fine of up to 300,000 euros , or even hand out a 2 year jail sentence .
ISP account holders who find themselves accused over the infringements of a 3rd party could be found guilty of “ negligence ” , risking a maximum 1,500 euro fine and a 4 week disconnection .
The revamped bill was adopted today by the French Senate and in the next few weeks will head to the National Assembly for its adoption .
Canadians are bullish on giving government officials permission to restrict personal freedoms in a flu pandemic , with half of those surveyed agreeing that violation of a quarantine order would be tantamount to manslaughter .
As well , 90 % of Canadians surveyed for a research report in pandemic ethics believe doctors and nurses have an obligation to report to work during a pandemic , provided safety precautions are in place .
Almost half -- 48 % -- say that health care workers who do not show up for work without a legitimate excuse should be fired or lose their professional licenses .
The survey , conducted for the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics , is based on a random sample of 500 Canadians surveyed by phone , and nearly 100 more via a series of town hall meetings .
The survey was taken between August 2008 to February 2009 -- just before the H1N1 outbreak began in April .
The town halls straddled the start .
Both were designed to inject the public ’s voice into debates usually left to the experts , and the results come as officials brace for an anticipated second wave of H1N1 flu .
Researchers are warning that the serious ethical challenges that could accompany a pandemic need to be thought through now , while there ’s still time to respond .
“ There ’s going to be a lot of uncertainty to decision making , even in a mild pandemic , ” says Dr. Ross Upshur , director of the UofT bioethics centre , which Wednesday released a series of research papers on pandemic ethics .
The reports draw on lessons learned from the SARS outbreak and address issues from whether health care workers have an implicit duty to treat patients , to fraught ethical questions such as : who should get the last bed and ventilator in an intensive care unit -- a cyclist who has suffered a severe , but potentially reversible brain injury , or a nurse infected with H1N1 while caring for patients who need immediate ventilation support ?
“ Even though there may be some skepticism about perhaps overreaction to H1N1 , let ’s remember the past .
We were n’t prepared for SARS , ” Upshur says .
“ There ’s still a lot of uncertainty about H1N1 .
It ’s still a new pathogen , ” he says .
“ It seems to be tracking reasonably mild .
But there are still ethical issues that require discussion . ”
Past surveys have suggested anywhere from 25 % to 85 % of health - care workers would be unwilling to show up for work in a pandemic .
“ If you think of it , that ’s a pretty stunning number , ” Dr. Upshur says .
He says professional codes of ethics and regulatory bodies have n’t set clear directives on what they expect of health care professionals in a disease crisis .
A large majority -- 85 % -- of those who responded to the UofT survey agreed governments should have the power to suspend some individual rights , such as travelling and the right to assemble , during a flu pandemic , and “ social distancing ” measures such as school closures .
But they also said governments have an obligation to provide for the basic needs of restricted individuals , such as food , shelter and social support .
More than half the people who take antidepressants for depression never get relief .
Why ?
Because the cause of depression has been oversimplified and drugs designed to treat it aim at the wrong target , according to new research from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine .
The medications are like arrows shot at the outer rings of a bull 's eye instead of the center .
A study from the laboratory of long - time depression researcher Eva Redei , presented at the Neuroscience 2009 conference in Chicago this week , appears to topple two strongly held beliefs about depression .
One is that stressful life events are a major cause of depression .
The other is that an imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain triggers depressive symptoms .
Both findings are significant because these beliefs were the basis for developing drugs currently used to treat depression .
Redei , the David Lawrence Stein Professor of Psychiatry at Northwestern 's Feinberg School , found powerful molecular evidence that quashes the long - held dogma that stress is generally a major cause of depression .
Her new research reveals that there is almost no overlap between stress - related genes and depression - related genes .
" This is a huge study and statistically powerful , " Redei said .
" This research opens up new routes to develop new antidepressants that may be more effective .
There has n't been an antidepressant based on a novel concept in 20 years . "
Her findings are based on extensive studies with a model of severely depressed rats that mirror many behavioral and physiological abnormalities found in patients with major depression .
The rats , after decades of development , are believed to be the most depressed in the world .
Little Overlap Between Stress and Depression Genes
Redei used microarray technology to isolate and identify the specific genes related to depression in these animals .
She examined the genes in the brain regions -- the hippocampus and amygdala -- commonly associated with depression in rats and humans .
Then she took four genetically different strains of rats and exposed them to chronic stress for two weeks .
Afterwards , she identified the genes that had consistently increased or decreased in response to the stress in all four strains in the same brain regions .
Redei now had one set of depression - related genes that came out of an animal model of depression and one set of stress - related genes that came our of her chronic stress study .
Next she compared the two sets of genes to see if there were any similarities .
" If the ' stress causes depression theory ' was correct , there should have been a significant overlap between these two sets of genes , " she said .
" There were n't . "
Out of a total of over 30,000 genes on the microarray , she discovered approximately 254 genes related to stress and 1275 genes related to depression , with an overlap of only five genes between the two .
" This overlap is insignificant , a very small percentage , " Redei said .
" This finding is clear evidence that at least in an animal model , chronic stress does not cause the same molecular changes as depression does . "
Antidepressants Treat Stress Not Depression
Most animal models that are used by scientists to test antidepressants are based on the hypothesis that stress causes depression .
" They stress the animals and look at their behavior , " she said .
" Then they manipulate the animals ' behavior with drugs and say , ' OK , these are going to be good anti-depressants . '
But they are not treating depression ; they are treating stress . "
That is one key reason why current antidepressants are n't doing a great job , Redei noted .
She is now looking at the genes that differ in the depressed rat to narrow down targets for drug development .
She said another reason current antidepressants are often ineffective is that they aim to boost neurotransmitters based on the popular molecular explanation of depression , which is that it's the result of decreased levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine .
But that 's wrong , Redei said .
Drugs Aim at Wrong Molecular Target
In the second part of the study , Redei found strong indications that depression actually begins further up in the chain of events in the brain .
The biochemical events that ultimately result in depression actually start in the development and functioning of neurons .
" The medications have been focusing on the effect , not the cause , " she said .
" That 's why it takes so long for them to work and why they are n't effective for so many people . "
Her animal model of depression did not show dramatic differences in the levels of genes controlling neurotransmitters functions .
" If depression was related to neurotransmitter activity , we would have seen that , " she said .
Similarities Between Human and Rodent Brains
Her findings in depressed rats , she said , are very likely applicable to humans .
" The similarities between these regions of the human and rodent brain are remarkable , " Redei explained .
" The hippocampus and amygdala are part of the so - called ancient lizard brain that controls survival and are the same in even primitive organisms . "

“ The dollar trade - weighted is clearly in a downtrend , it does have days when it rallies , but it ’s basically persisting downwards and each potential support level breaks , ” Griffiths said , while looking at a chart of the dollar index .
With US interest rates expected to stay near zero for some time , the greenback has now taken over from the yen ’s 20 - year reign as the main carry - trade currency , according to Griffiths .
“ What that tells you is that many people wanting to invest anywhere go and borrow some dollars to do it with .
Because they ’re institutionalized in the opinion that -- by the time we pay this thing back it will be worth less , ” he said .
“ That ’s extremely unhealthy and if this trend goes much further , like taking out the low of one - year ago … we ’ll have a fully fledged dollar crisis and that will knock on across all markets , ” he added .

Retail sales were flat in September , which did not help overall growth
The UK economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.4 % between July and September , according to official figures , meaning the country is still in recession .
It is the first time UK gross domestic product ( GDP ) has contracted for six consecutive quarters , since quarterly figures were first recorded in 1955 .
But the figures could still be revised up or down at a later date , because this figure is only the first estimate .
GDP measures the total amount of goods and services produced by a country .
The pound fell sharply after the figures were released , reflecting the fact that many observers had expected the UK to have grown during the quarter .
It was down 1.7 % against the dollar , at $ 1.6323 , and down 1.9 % against the euro , at 1.0859 euros .
Quarterly growth of 0.2 % had been expected in the figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , although expectations had been tempered by recent figures showing no growth in retail sales in September , and a 2.5 % decline in industrial output in August .
ANALYSIS Hugh Pym , BBC chief economics correspondent
There 's no disguising how grim these figures are .
Almost every City analyst expected there to be positive growth in the third quarter .
Instead it was negative .
That means the recession in the UK is the longest since modern records began in the 1950s .
Germany , France and Japan have all come out of recession technically and the UK has n't .
The decline has continued .
And the markets did n't really like the look of that .
The foreign exchange markets have been selling the pound .
There 's every indication that it 's going to be a long hard slog for quite some time to come as the British economy tries to turn itself round .

How to cope Special report : UK economy

The unexpected decline in the services sector was the key factor behind the drop , with the distribution , catering and hotels sector performing particularly badly .
The UK economy 's reliance on the service sector , and financial services in particular , may be the reason why it is still in recession when partners such as France and Germany exited in the second quarter of this year .
The economy contracted 5.2 % compared with the same period last year , which was marginally better than the record figure of 5.5 % in the previous three months .
It has now contracted 5.9 % from its peak before the recession began .
The worse - than - expected GDP figures are likely to make the Bank of England consider extending its policy of quantitative easing .
Quantitative easing is the central bank 's policy of printing money and using it to buy bonds from banks and other companies to help stimulate the economy .
' Awful '
The £ 175bn already announced for the quantitative easing programme will have been spent by next month , so the third quarter GDP number will be important in deciding whether to extend it .
Indeed , at the Bank 's current rate of spending , it is expected to have spent the whole £ 175bn in the next week .

As the next Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) meeting , at which quantitative easing decisions are taken , is not until 4 November , that would leave it with a week with no extra cash to pump into the economy .
The figures were " awful with no positive news " according to James Knightley at ING .
" This clearly suggests that the likelihood of an expansion in quantitative easing by £ 50bn or so over the next quarter is rising , although [ it ] is not a foregone conclusion . "
Former MPC member Professor David Blanchflower said the negative GDP figures should not have been a surprise .
" There 's been very little sign among firms that things were very much better , " he told the BBC .
" The public seems to have some more confidence - they seem to have believed the talk about green shoots , but actually the data have n't really looked that way at all . "
Intervention needed
The bottom line is that we should take this as very much a first draft of UK economic history - but clearly a disappointing one

When will recovery come ?
Analysts said it is worrying that the decline has continued despite the stimulus measures that the government and the Bank of England have introduced .
" Continued intervention - including help for businesses to access finance , and incentives to promote investment - is still needed , " said David Kern , chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce .
" Above all else , business confidence must be nurtured to ensure that recovery is not further delayed . "
' Deeply disappointing ' Chancellor Alistair Darling said he had never expected to see growth before the end of 2009 .

" Our job is to support the economy as we come through towards recovery , " he said .
" [ Growth ] will come - I 'm confident about that - and I 'm confident that businesses and people generally will begin to see a difference , but it will take time . "
Shadow chancellor George Osborne described the figures as " deeply , deeply disappointing " .
" There are many millions of people who will be deeply concerned to see that Britain is still in recession six months after France and Germany came out of recession , " he told the BBC .
" It destroys the myth that Britain was better prepared . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the figures were " a cold blast of realism " .
" We 've had a lot of talk recently based on a booming stock exchange and prices of luxury houses in London that somehow this problem was at an end , and it is n't , " he said .
One of the measures expected to be a particular help in the final quarter of the year is the change in VAT .
The rate of VAT is due to return to 17.5 % from 15 % at the beginning of January and consumers are expected to step up their purchasing ahead of that increase .

A UN - recognised government that controls only three districts of the capital , propped up by international peacekeepers .
A raging Islamic insurgency that has rallied support by denouncing its opponents as foreign stooges .
Rebel strongholds where medieval justice is meted out and teenage boys have hands and feet chopped off , while women and girls are stoned to death in public .
Suicide bombings that kill dozens .
Kidnappings and targeted killings that terrorise aid workers and journalists .
The parallels between Afghanistan and Somalia are not hard to find , but should not be exaggerated .
Somalia , for one thing , is now the worst humanitarian crisis in the world with half the population in need of assistance and 1.5 million people displaced .
Nonetheless , the Horn of Africa nation invites comparisons as a haven for global jihadists where the Islamic militias are fighting to create an " al - Qa'ida state " .
This was a country that was abandoned by much of the world after the fall of the socialist dictator Siad Barre in 1991 .
The interventionist Clinton administration had its fingers burned two years later when it lost 18 servicemen in the incident remembered in the film Black Hawk Down .
The UN pulled out two years after that , when the country became a model " failed state " as the country 's patchwork of competing clans tore itself apart .
It was only after the 11 September attacks on the US that Somalia began to reassume strategic importance for Washington .

It was after 2005 , when a section of the business community had tired of paying levies to the warlords and started backing a loose alliance of Islamic Sharia law courts , that the dynamic changed .
The Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) that emerged drew mass support and within a year had driven the warlords from the capital .
But diplomatically it was the wrong time for a new Islamic state to emerge , and Somalia was accused of channelling money to al - Qa'ida and sheltering terrorists .
A year later , the US engineered an invasion of Somalia by its traditional enemy Ethiopia and the ICU was scattered by a larger conventional army .
The Ethiopian occupation turned out to be disastrously worse .
The youth wing of the ICU , al - Shabaab , transformed itself into a fundamentalist militia ( admired by al - Qa'ida ) that drew deep public support by fighting the occupier .
And at the end of last year the Ethiopians retreated .
The international community turned to Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , the leader of the ICU , to take over the government – the same man the US helped to topple two years prior .
He promptly installed sharia , but found that he could no longer control the al - Shabaab or his former ally Sheikh Aweys who now heads another Islamic militia , Hizbul - Islam .
The government has lost much support since taking over , and militants now control most of south and central Somalia .
Open backing from Washington has bolstered support for Sheikh Ahmed 's opponents .
The question now worrying Western security experts is whether Somalia will become a training ground for jihadis from Somalia 's huge diaspora .
Certainly al - Shabaab is recruiting in the US and Europe and suicide bombers in Somalia have come from communities as far afield as Minnesota .
An alleged terror plot in Australia earlier this year involving Somalis has rung alarm bells .
However , Chatham House 's Somalia expert , Roger Middleton , cautions against premature conclusions about Somalia becoming " the new Afghanistan " .
" Shabaab and Hizbul - Islam are nationalist movements first and foremost .
The commanders are fighting to control Somalia .
Their agenda is local , not global . "
There is a danger , he says , that the Afghan template being pushed down on Somalia " becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy " .

Wow , I finally got around to watching the below video that Tom posted a few days ago .
You know how normally , if you watch a political discussion on TV the spectrum of the debate is , “ Should we steal 50 % of taxpayers ’ money , or just 48 % ? ”
Well a similar thing happened on this program , except the spectrum was more like , “ Should I be an anarchist because of bold assertions about the nature of government , or should I be an anarchist because of the study of history ? ”
I can’t believe this was on PBS .
BTW
Tom , I noticed that he called you an economist and you just nodded .
I wo n’t tell anyone , do n’t worry .
Opinion Famed politico - medical journal
The Lancet has grabbed big ink by taking the view that providing contraceptives for women in developing nations prevents five times as much CO 2 emission as the same money spent on conventional green measures such as windmill subsidies .
Famous for starting the MMR vaccine scare and for publishing papers suggesting that several per cent of the Iraqi population have died as a result of the 2003 invasion and its aftermath , The Lancet is no stranger to controversy in recent times .
Now it seems to be suggesting that western aid policy should focus on getting the world 's poor to stop breeding in order to control climate change .
The argument is put forward in an editorial published on paper tomorrow but now available online here ( free registration required ) :
Family planning is five times cheaper than conventional green technologies to combat climate change ... each US $ 7 spent on basic family planning over the next four decades would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1 tonne .
This information comes from the Optimum Population Trust , a group of medics and other concerned citizens which has suggested in the past that for a British couple - forget about poor folk in Africa - having a third baby is as evil as having a patio heater or driving a gas - guzzling car .
The Trust has told the Reg in the past that Blighty needs urgently to reduce its population by 35 million or so , on the basis of fair shares of world resources .
The Trust exhorts the UK public to " sign our stop at two pledge " .
The Lancet , however , seems primarily focused on women in developing nations .
Over 200 million women want , but currently lack , access to modern contraceptives .
As a result , 76 million unintended pregnancies occur every year .
Meeting this unmet need could slow high rates of population growth , thereby reducing demographic pressure on the environment ...
The UN Copenhagen conference on climate change provides an opportunity to draw attention to the centrality of women .
The sexual and reproductive health and rights community should challenge the global architecture of climate change , and its technology focus ...
Such a strategy would better serve the range of issues pivitol [ sic ] to improving the health of women worldwide .
Or loosely translated , technology cannot solve climate change - the only way to save the planet is to have fewer people on it .
The solution lies in more " centrality " ( and so , presumably , less babies ) for women .
There might be some trouble ahead for the approach of simply handing out contraception , however .
Various religions are strongly against the concept , as are men in some parts of the world .
Perhaps , in targeting climate cash at population control , the Copenhagen conference will be required to consider such methods as the Bill Gates funded semi-liquid stealth condom .
Then of course there 's the issue of the severe greying of the populace which could be expected during any time of population decrease .
The only plan ( other than mass immigration , which can only work locally ) so far advanced for keeping a developed civilisation running with most of its people too old to do much is the Japanese one , of having lots of robots to do all the graft and care for the burgeoning elderly .
But a massive self - replicating automated robot population and accompanying industries would seem likely to wipe out the carbon gains of having less people - barring some kind of technological solution .
It all seems perhaps a bit trickier than The Lancet and the Optimum Population Trust are making out . ®
The '60s are over , and no amount of artists ' renderings is going to bring back the Apollo days if NASA 's budget does n't get a big boost .
That 's the key message from the independent panel chartered to rethink NASA 's future .
The Review of Human Space Flight Plans group is also looking at a variety of imaginative approaches to space exploration that could make NASA 's future seem less like reheated Apollo leftovers .
Known informally as the Augustine committee after its head , former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm Augustine , the panel of scientists , astronauts and engineers is nearly ready to present its findings to the Obama administration .
It announced today that after a packed schedule in cities around the nation earlier this month , it wo n't hold any more public meetings .
The Augustine committee 's preliminary judgments , which have been trickling out over the last several months , bring a measure of reality to NASA 's agenda , which suffered from a gap between the Bush administration 's big talk and limited funding .
The truth , the panel has found , is that NASA does n't have enough money coming in to satisfy its stated goals of returning humans to the moon and eventually to Mars .
And maybe , some scientists argue , that 's exactly how it should be .
" They do n’t do anything for us anyhow .
Anything we can do , we can do it better , cheaper , and faster with robots , " said Bob Parks , a University of Maryland physicist , former executive director of the American Institute of Physics .
" And I mean cheaper by a factor of 10 to 100 .
Human beings are just not very good spacecraft . "
Backers of human spaceflight , though , tend to argue that putting a few humans up there inspires the rest of us down here .
And for them , the Augustine findings are disappointing , but not entirely unexpected .
NASA 's current budget , as Norm Augustine has pointedly said in various interviews , does n't support an ambitious program , whether its goals are to go to the moon , Mars , or just some points in between .
While the Obama administration might have to make the tough choice to end major human space endeavors beyond low - Earth orbit , space has n't really been a major federal priority for more than 30 years , as military and health have eaten up a combined 80 percent of R&D money .
And the Obama administration has n't telegraphed a major change in that stance .
" I think these investments in research and development are strongly indicative of concerns at that point in time , " said Jim Dooley , a policy analyst at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , who studies R&D spending and created the graph above for his paper " U.S. Federal Investments in Energy R&D " ( .pdf ) .
The Sputnik scare of the late ' 50s and the battle for technological supremacy with the Soviet Union made space a concern and a priority .
That sparked the ambitions and funding levels that put humans on the moon , but as other issues became ascendant , the money dried up despite the moon landings ' popularity .
It 's worth remembering that not even all the original Apollo missions were actually flown .
The funding for space has n't reached anywhere near those levels since .
" For all of its wonderful success , Apollo did n't succeed in becoming sustainable , " said David Mindell , a science and technology historian at MIT who led a team that last year offered NASA some suggestions for the future .
" You need a program that Republicans and Democrats will support .
It should be robust to the usual four - year cycle of politics . "
So , that 's the situation the Augustine commission inherited .
They looked at more than 3,000 possible plans for the human presence in space .
Everything was up for re-examination from the planned grounding of the space shuttle , to the de-orbiting of the International Space Station , to rockets used for exploring beyond low - earth orbit .
Now , they 've narrowed the options to just a handful .
All of the options that will be formally submitted to the president will substantially revise the current Constellation program .
That 's not much of a surprise , because nearly all parts of that program had come under heavy criticism , including its very existence .
The plans are still rocket - science –complicated with all kinds of contingencies for different budget levels and types of vehicles , but by looking at the scoring rubric the commission is using ( . ppt ) to compare the ideas to NASA 's goals , we can tell some things already .
First , NASA workers and contractors could be in trouble .
Not a single one of the plans got a positive score in the " NASA and Industry Workforce " category .
Second , almost all of the Augustine options received neutral or positive ratings for advancing scientific knowledge .
Third , an intriguing new set of ideas has captured the committee 's imagination .
The " Deep Space " mission plans would forgo landings on the Moon and Mars to focus on visiting nearby asteroids .
There are a host of technical details and variations on each plan , but the key questions ( . ppt ) are :
When will the shuttle be phased out ?
When will the International Space Station be de-orbited ?
Which rocket —
Ares I , Ares V , modified Ares V , shuttle - styled , or commercial launch vehicle — will be used to go beyond low - Earth orbit ?
For the next week or so , we wo n't know the specifics , but Mindell said he hopes NASA 's plans for human spaceflight will have defined rationales that create a coherent program .
" I feel , " Mindell said , " like the Augustine panel should be able to go back to the president and science adviser and say , ' If you want a mission that is 75 percent national pride and 25 percent science , here 's what it will take and how much it will cost . ' "

A lake near Da Bao Shan in the northern part of China 's Guangdong province turns reddish brown after the water was contaminated for years August 27 , 2009 .
It is highly unusual for people to contract cancer at tender ages , but not in the villages around Da Bao Shan , one of China 's largest mine that produces lead , zine , cadmium and other heavy metals .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
One needs to look no further then the river that runs through Shangba to understand the extent of the heavy metals pollution that experts say has turned the hamlets in this region of southern China into cancer villages .
The river ’s flow ranges from murky white to a bright shade of orange and the waters are so viscous that they barely ripple in the breeze .
In Shangba , the river brings death , not sustenance .
“ All the fish died , even chickens and ducks that drank from the river died .
If you put your leg in the water , you ’ll get rashes and a terrible itch , ” said He Shuncai , a 34 - year - old rice farmer who has lived in Shangba all his life .
“ Last year alone , six people in our village died from cancer and they were in their 30s and 40s . ”
Cancer casts a shadow over the villages in this region of China in southern Guangdong province , nestled among farmland contaminated by heavy metals used to make batteries , computer parts and other electronics devices .
Every year , an estimated 460,000 people die prematurely in China due to exposure to air and water pollution , according to a 2007 World Bank study .
Yun Yaoshun ’s two granddaughters died at the ages of 12 and 18 , succumbing to kidney and stomach cancer even though these types of cancers rarely affect children .
The World Health Organization has suggested that the high rate of such digestive cancers are due to the ingestion of polluted water .
“ It ’s because of Daboshan and the dirty water , ” said the 82 - year - old grandmother .
“ The girls were always playing in the river , even our well water is contaminated , ” Yun told Reuters during a visit to the village .
The river where the children played stretches from the bottom of the Daboshan mine , owned by state - owned Guangdong Dabaoshan Mining Co Ltd , past the ramshackle family home .
Its waters are contaminated by cadmium , lead , indium and zinc and other metals .
The villagers use well water in Shangba for drinking but tests published by BioMed Central in July show that it contains excessive amounts of cadmium , a heavy metal that is a known carcinogen , as well as zinc which in large quantities can damage the liver and lead to cancer .

“ China has many ‘ cancer villages ’ and it is very likely that these increased cases of cancer are due to water pollution , ” said Edward Chan , an official with Greenpeace in southern China .
But it ’s not just water , the carcinogenic heavy metals are also entering the food chain .
Mounds of tailings from mineral mining are discarded alongside paddy fields throughout the region .
“ If you test this rice , it will be toxic but we eat it too , otherwise , we will starve , ” said He , the farmer , as he shoveled freshly milled rice into a sack .
“ Yes , we sell this rice too . ”
NO HEALTH CARE
Few families in the villages downstream from the Daboshan mine have been left untouched by cancer .
The most common cancers are those of the stomach , liver , kidney and colon , accounting for about 85 percent of cancers .
Cancer incidence rates in these villages are not available , but rights groups say they are far higher than the national average .
“ In southern China , where communities depend largely from ponds or lakes for drinking water , the rates of digestive system cancer are very high , ” said a report ‘ Environment and People ’s Health in China ’ , published by the World Health Organization and United Nations Development Programme in 2001 .
Across China , there are hundreds , perhaps thousands of small , anonymous villages that are suffering the consequences of the country ’s rapid economic expansion , villages with rates and types of cancers that experts say can only be due to pollution .
This may be the fate of more and more of China ’s population as mines and factories spew out tens of millions of tonnes of pollution every year , into the water system as well as the air , to produce the fruits of China ’s economic growth .
Death rates from cancer rose 19 percent in cities and 23 percent in rural areas in 2006 , compared to 2005 , according to official Chinese media , although they did not give exact figures .
The health burden has an economic price .
The cost of cancer treatment has reached almost 100 billion yuan a year ( $ 14.6 billion ) , accounting for 20 percent of China ’s medical expenditure , according to Chinese media .
NO COMPENSATION
The lack of a national health system means that most of the victims must pay their medical bills themselves .
Healthcare costs took up 50 percent of household income in China in 2006 due to inadequate health insurance , according to a paper published in the Lancet in October 2008 .
China does not have a comprehensive state healthcare system and more than 80 percent of farmers have no medical insurance at all , although there are plans for sweeping reforms so that by 2011 , most of the population will have basic medical coverage .
The residents of so called cancer villages , meanwhile , struggle to fund their medical care , often going into debt to pay crippling pharmaceutical and doctors ’ bills .
“ An official did come to give me our compensation , 20 yuan ( $ 2.93 ) , ” said Liang Xiti , whose husband died of stomach cancer at the age of 46 .
His medicines alone cost the family 800 yuan a month , she said .
Zhang Jingjing , a lawyer who is helping the villagers , said the local mine has promised to distribute a few thousands yuan to all the villagers every year .
Even though the funds will barely cover medical expenses , Zhang says it is an encouraging first step .
“ This means the mine admits it is polluting the environment .
If it did no wrong , it wo n’t give out this money . ”
Oct. 6 , 2009 -- New research suggests a link between prenatal exposure to the chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) and increased aggression in girls , but not boys , at age 2 .
The finding is far from conclusive , but the study is the first human trial to attempt to examine whether BPA exposure in the womb influences behavior in early childhood .
BPA has been used for more than three decades to make plastic bottles and other products shatter resistant and clear .
It is also used in the lining of many canned foods and in a wide range of other commercial goods .
The chemical was found in the urine of more than 90 % of Americans in a random sample conducted by CDC researchers in 2007 .
For close to a decade , scientists have debated whether exposure to BPA through commercial products poses a health threat to humans .
Hundreds of animal studies suggest it might , but only a few human studies have been published .
Along with Windows 7 's official worldwide debut today , Microsoft launched the accompanying ad campaign under the following slogan : " I 'm a PC and Windows 7 was my idea . "
As you can see in the image , Times Square in New York is draped with huge advertisements for Windows 7 .
There are posters and banners everywhere , as Microsoft makes sure everyone knows that today is the day of Windows 7 .
The WindowsVideos channel on YouTube has the first three commercials part of the marketing push , which we 've embedded below :
Microsoft is clearly taking a much more product - oriented approach with this campaign .
This is even more evident with the 15 second ad spots that were posted online yesterday under the name " 7 second demos . "
Here 's four of them :
The first Windows 7 commercial actually aired in September 2009 , but it , and the ones that followed were simply leading up to the launch .
Now that Windows 7 is here , the actual campaign is starting to emerge , and so far we have to say we like it .
The group said Geert Wilders was treated more leniently An Arab organisation is to be put on trial in the Netherlands over its publication of a cartoon deemed offensive to Jews , prosecutors say .
The cartoon , published by the Arab European League ( AEL ) on its website , questions the Holocaust .
It said the decision to prosecute illustrated bias against Muslims .
It said the same standards were not applied to the Dutch MP Geert Wilders , who made a film including cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad .
Last month prosecutors said they would not put the far - right MP on trial for distributing the controversial Danish cartoons , which caused a storm of protest after their publication in 2005 .
Freedom of expression is only a pretext to make life bitter for Muslims
Abdoulmouthalib Bouzerda
AEL chairman
However , he is still being investigated separately for inciting hatred against Muslims by making statements comparing Islam to Nazism .
But Dutch prosecutors said the AEL cartoon was " discriminatory " and " offensive to Jews as a group ... because it offends Jews on the basis of their race and / or religion " .
The cartoon shows two men standing near a pile of bones at " Auswitch " ( sic ) .
One says " I do n't think they 're Jews " .
The other replies : " We have to get to the six million somehow . "
A spokeswoman for the prosecuting authority said the group could be fined up to 4,700 euros ( £ 4,100 ) , though in theory a prison sentence was also possible .
' Perverse ' AEL chairman Abdoulmouthalib Bouzerda said the charges proved " what Muslims have been saying for decades " .
" Freedom of expression is only a pretext to make life bitter for Muslims ... and if [ they ] try to bring this hypocrisy to light , that right is denied them . "
The AEL says it does not deny the facts of the Holocaust but posted the cartoon as an " act of civil disobedience " .
It said it had agreed to remove it from its site , but reversed that decision to protest over the failure to prosecute Geert Wilders .
" Double standards are being applied , " it said in a statement .
But Jewish groups said it was not reasonable for the group to express its opposition to alleged bias against Muslims , by attacking Jews .
Ronny Naftaniel of the Center for Documentation on Israel , said : " Imagine if Dutch Jews insulted Muslims every time they heard an anti-Semitic remark .
What kind of perverse world would we be living in ? "
Tensions over the Netherlands ' Muslim population have increased in recent years , notably since the killing of a controversial film - maker by a Muslim extremist in 2004 .

Burning Man fire victim's suit goes up in smoke CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT
Fireworks and flames marked the burning of the man as thousands watched on the playa Saturday night as the centerpiece of Burning Man 2005 , September 3 , 2005 in the Black Rock desert .

The state Supreme Court has refused to reinstate a lawsuit by a man who approached the flames at the Burning Man festival and got burned .
The justices voted unanimously Wednesday to deny review of an appeal by Anthony Beninati , who sought damages from the promoter of the annual celebration in the Nevada desert .
Beninati , a real estate manager from Los Angeles , was badly burned at the September 2005 event in Black Rock City , Nev .
He was making his third visit to the weeklong festival , which ends with the torching of a 60 - foot wood sculpture .
Once the Burning Man topples , some participants throw objects into the bonfire .
Beninati approached with the photo of a friend who had recently died in a motorcycle accident .
He walked 7 to 10 feet into the burning embers , with flames on either side of him , threw in the photo , took a few more steps forward , then tripped - over a hidden obstacle , he said - and fell into the fire .
He was badly burned on his hands and legs and was airlifted to a hospital .
Beninati's suit accused Black Rock City LLC , the San Francisco - based promoter , of negligently allowing people to approach the fire without safe pathways .
In a June 30 ruling , the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco said anyone who takes part in an event with obvious dangers - downhill skiing , mountain climbing or walking up to a bonfire - knowingly risks injury .
" The risk of falling and being burned by the flames or hot ash was inherent , obvious and necessary to the event , " the court said in a 3 - 0 decision that upheld a judge 's dismissal of the suit .
Evan Marshall , Beninati's lawyer , said Thursday that suits by people injured in risky activities have been dismissed in the past only when the plaintiff was in a dangerous profession , such as law enforcement , or took part in a hazardous sport .
Marshall said a jury should have been allowed to decide whether the promoter of a cultural event used reasonable care to protect participants from preventable injuries .
The case is Beninati vs. Black Rock , S175409 .

“ The next experiments are to get that second person to be aware of the information that is being sent to them .
For that , I need to get my thinking cap on , so to speak . ”
( CNN ) -- Lynette " Squeaky " Fromme was released from federal custody Friday , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said .
Lynnette " Squeaky " Fromme , left , appears in court in Los Angeles , California , in December 1969 .
Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then - President Gerald Ford in Sacramento , California .
She was released Friday morning from Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth , Texas , said Felicia Ponce , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in Washington .
Fromme , a follower of Charles Manson , pointed a gun at Ford a year after he became president .
Secret Service agents prevented her from firing ; the gun was later found to have ammunition in it , but no bullet in the chamber .
In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS , Fromme , then housed in West Virginia , recalled that the president " had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me .
But at the same time , I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was . "
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her , " and I said , ' I gotta go and talk to him , ' and then I thought , ' That 's foolish .
He 's not going to stop and talk to you . '
People have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they 're not , you know , they do n't think anything of it .
I said , ' Maybe I 'll take the gun , ' and I thought , ' I have to do this .
This is the time . ' "
She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison .
Asked whether she had any regrets , Fromme said , " No . No , I do n't .
I feel it was fate . "
However , she said that she thought her incarceration was " unnecessary " and that she could n't see herself repeating her offense .
" My argument to the jury was , if she wanted to kill him , she would have shot him , " John Virga , a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme , told CNN recently .
" She 'd been around guns .
And let 's be realistic :
We know the Manson family , at least some of them , are killers . "

Fromme was sentenced to life in prison , and parole was an option at the time , although the federal system later abolished it , Ponce said .
Inmates do receive " good time " -- for every year and one day they serve , Ponce said , 54 days are lopped off their sentence .

The PlayStation 3 launched on November 17 , 2006 , and the 60 GB models were sold for the scandalous price of $ 600 .
Sony had set expectations so high that a backlash was almost inevitable .
Now you can get a newly redesigned PlayStation 3 for $ 300 , half the launch price of the premiere console , but along the way features have been lost .
Ports have been removed .
Logos have changed .
What a difference a few years makes .
The 60 GB consoles have been discontinued and there is no longer any way to play PlayStation 2 games on PlayStation 3 hardware .
Even though the price has been halved , there is a small but vocal group of gamers who jealously hoard their 60 GB model , and would n't trade it in for the new and " improved " system if their lives depended on it .
I should know , I 'm one of them .
Why people love the old
The 60 GB PlayStation can play PlayStation One and PlayStation 2 games , but it does n't just play them , it upscales the image to look better on your shiny high definition screen .
Sony 's John Koller told us that backwards compatibility does n't drive sales , and he 's probably right ; for every gamer madly in love with their 60 GB system there was one who did n't care about the features it included or were ready to trade into a 120 GB model .
Those that do stick with their launch hardware , however , are adamant about their love for the system .
" I have a 60 GB after much searching long after they had been discontinued .
Finally found a used one , and I would n't give it up for anything .
I constantly replay old PS2 games , and the lack of BC is an absolute dealbreaker , " forum user Heinous told Ars .
" Leaving a PS2 hooked up would be a kludge , and I do n't have space in the A/V rack anyways .
I 'll be hanging on to this one as long as it works or until some theoretical PS4 plays PS2 games . "
We spoke to one 60 GB enthusiast via Twitter , and asked what would happen if his system broke down .
" It would kill me !
My PS2 died and I dont want to replace it .
I have lots of PS2 games that I still play or want to play .
I need BC ! "
" I 'd pay to have it repaired , " Benjamin Forrest told us , another PS3 fan who is holding onto his 60 GB model .
" And yes , it is my precious .
I still play a bunch of PS2 2D fighters along with new stuff . "
He counts off the games he still enjoys after pointing out how great they look in 720 p .
" Okami , King of Fighters XI , Garou : Mark of the Wolves , Odin Sphere , to name a few . "
Can you still find one ?
You can still track down a 60 GB system if you do n't mind buying used , but it may take some digging .
We caught up with Nick , who runs the popular rare and classic game site Racketboy , and asked what he knew about the secondhand market for the 60 GB PlayStation 3 .
" Actually , I 've had my eye on this a bit as I 've been looking into getting one , " he told us .
" I do n't know if I 'd say there is high demand for them , but you can tell there is still a bit of interest out there . "
He points out the number of people with working PS2s means that backwards compatibility wo n't be a huge issue for most people .
" However , being an individual that keeps lots of older consoles hooked up to their entertainment systems , if I can have one less machine hooked up , that would be nice . "
We pointed out that the systems are going for up to $ 600 , the original price , and more on Amazon .
" Well , I would n't go by Amazon too much — there are a lot of sellers that list stuff for outrageous prices at times .
At least on eBay you can see what they are actually selling for . "
So what are they selling for ?
" It looks like the 60 GB are going for about $ 250 to $ 270 .
Closer to retail , but nothing dramatic yet . "
You can look at that number two ways : the $ 600 systems have dropped in value dramatically , or that people are willing to pay nearly the going retail price for a three year - old system .
How much does GameStop sell them for ?
More than a new system , in fact .
Refurbished 60 GB models run $ 320 at the gaming retailer .
" You may be asking yourself , ' Self , why in the world is a refurbished 60 GB PS3 more expensive than a brand new 80 GB PS3 ? ' "
GameStop says on the official site .
" The 60 GB PS3 happens to be backwards compatible , allowing you to play many PS2 games on it .
Plus it has two additional USB ports and a spiffy chrome front .
As a result , not many people are willing to give them up , making them harder to find and thus , a little more expensive . "
What happens if your system breaks ?
You 're not going to be in warranty anymore , but Sony will fix your 60 GB system for $ 150 .
Sure it 's half the price of a new unit , but for those of us who are trying to cut down on the number of systems hooked into our TV , it 's worth the money .
I 'm currently in the process of getting my 60 GB repaired , after it finally began to die while playing Batman : Arkham Asylum .
I thought the game was glitching , but turns out it was simply my system giving up the ghost .
But are n't you missing out on things ?
Nope .
Just like the PSP
Go , the software updates mean that 60 GB models will be able to do everything the new hardware does , minus the Dolby TrueHD and DTS - HD Master Audio bitstreaming .
The 60 GB PlayStation can do damn near everything : backwards compatibility with upscaling , it can run Linux — something the Slim can't do — it supports a smorgasbord of memory cards if you want to move files over , it has the Spider - Man logo on the top ... and of course by 60 GB we mean 250 GB , since the hardcore out there have already upgraded their hard drives .
You can keep your silver logos , your lack of backwards compatibility , and your smaller systems .
We 'll be sitting over here with our silver trim , huge shell , and PS2 games .
Eight American soldiers and two Afghan troops have been killed in the deadliest attack on coalition troops for more than a year , officials say .
The battle happened in Nuristan province in the remote east of the country when military outposts were attacked , a Nato statement said .
The Taliban said it carried out the attack .
Reports say local officials including a police chief were captured .
Violence has escalated in the east as insurgents relocate from the south .
My heart goes out to the families of those we have lost and to their fellow soldiers who remained to finish the fight ...
Both the US and Afghan soldiers fought bravely together
Col Randy George
US area commander
In a statement , Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said that tribal militia launched attacks on the foreign and Afghan military outposts from a mosque and a nearby village .
The attack is thought to have taken place in the Kamdesh district of Nuristan , and lasted several hours .
About 300 militants attacked one outpost at the foot of a hill , before turning their fire on a US base on higher ground , attacking from two sides , a provincial police chief said .
ANALYSIS Martin Patience , BBC News , Kabul Prior to this deadly clash , US soldiers at the outposts that saw fierce fighting were due to be redeployed elsewhere in the country in the coming weeks .
According to officials , even after Saturday 's assault , that remains the case .
Part of the reason is that the US Gen Stanley Mc Chrystal - who heads the mission in Afghanistan - wants to focus on providing security in key towns and villages across the country .
The hope is that the Afghan government supported by the West will then be able to deliver services to the people .
That means essentially " closing " a string of smaller bases .
As this latest attack showed , these small bases are particularly vulnerable when swarmed by huge numbers of insurgents .
One Nato spokesman called it a " complex attack in a difficult area " .
US jets carried out air strikes in response .
" Coalition forces effectively repelled the attack and inflicted heavy enemy casualties while eight Isaf and two ANSF [ Afghan National Security Forces ] members were killed , " the Nato statement said .
It was the worst loss coalition troops have suffered since August 2008 , when 10 French troops were killed in an ambush in Kabul province .
A Taliban spokesman , Zabihullah Mujahid , said the movement was behind the attack .
According to AP news agency , Mr Mujahid also said some 35 Afghan police officers had been taken into Taliban custody , and their fate would be decided by a council .
Provincial governor Jamaluddin Badar confirmed that some officials including a local police chief had been captured .
Dangerous province WORST SINGLE ATTACKS ON FOREIGN FORCES Sept 2009 : Six Italian soldiers die in suicide bomb in Kabul Aug 2008 : Ten French troops killed in ambush in Sarobi , east of Kabul July 2008 : Nine US soldiers die in militant siege in Wanar , bordering Nuristan and Wanar provinces Nov 2007 : Six US soldiers and three Afghan troops killed in ambush July 2007 : Six Canadian soldiers and Afghan interpreter die when vehicle hits IED in Kandahar province May 2007 : Five US , one UK , one Canadian soldier die in hostile attack on helicopter in Helmand province June 2005 : Sixteen US soldiers die in attack on helicopter in Konar province
It is not the first time coalition forces have suffered damaging attacks in this region , says the BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul .
Nine US soldiers were killed in a single incident last year when more than 100 fighters breached a US outpost in the village of Wanat on the border of Nuristan and Kunar provinces .
The incident , which is still being investigated , was the biggest American loss of life in battle in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 , and forced US and Afghan soldiers to abandon the village .
The province 's mountainous terrain makes it easier for insurgents to sneak up and launch attacks , but more difficult for military forces to access the area , our correspondent says .
Nuristan has for decades been a crossing point for fighters entering the country from Pakistan , he adds .
US anxiety
The security situation in northern and eastern Afghanistan has deteriorated since the beginning of the year .
An unstable security situation has been exacerbated by political uncertainty
The instability has been exacerbated by political uncertainty created by August 's presidential poll , which has been marred by widespread fraud allegations .
The commander of the more than 100,000 Nato and US forces in the country , US Gen Stanley McChrystal , has described the situation as " serious " and is believed to have requested up to 40,000 additional troops .
But US President Barack Obama - who has already sent thousands of extra troops to the country - says strategy in Afghanistan must be agreed before a decision can be made on whether to bolster military forces further .

[ In this in - depth feature , Mode 7 Games ( Determinance , Frozen Synapse ) co-head Paul Taylor discusses key steps to getting your independent game known , from careful initial announcements to pre-orders , talking to bloggers , and setting up blogs yourself . ]
When Mode 7 Games was founded , I was still flailing around at university and knew precisely nothing about the games industry .
I wish someone had sidled up to me in a dark alley and given me a quick breakdown of all of the things I was going to encounter in the next few years , as well as a gentle slap to the face followed by a chocolate - chip biscuit .
This flaccid and convoluted multi-faceted metaphor is exactly what I 'm attempting to embody here .
Wish me luck .
This article is going to focus on what you can do to market an indie game pre-release , as this is an area a lot of first - time developers neglect .
The Basics
One Very Important Thought
" Obscurity is a greater threat than piracy " - Tim O'Reilly
Obscurity is literally the worst thing that can possibly happen to you and your game .
Notoriety is better .
Public hatred is arguably better .
Seriously .
At least people remember Limbo of the Lost .
Marketing anything takes a lot of time and effort .
Most small indies skew their efforts far too far towards production and away from marketing : this is one of the reasons why so few are a genuine commercial success , and why many high - quality games generate minimal revenue .
The Concept
You will have already come up with a game concept .
One vast component of marketing is having a strong concept for your product .
You should already be thinking about your audience when you start to create something .
However , you 're probably an independent creator because you 're trying to do something that other people are n't .
If you wanted to lope along with the pack , hunting for the sweet juicy buffalo of social compliance , you 'd probably already be working for a big hairy company on a big hairy property .
Scott Steinberg would advise you to aim squarely at the mass market : " Music , animals , sports , raising a family ...
Keep game premises rooted in real - world frames of reference whenever possible . "
- Scott Steinberg , Sell More Video Games
Jeff Tunnell , on the other hand , thinks you should stick to where your passion lies :
" I make games that I want to make , and find out if there is an audience later .
Trying to come up with a forecast is not an art or a science , it is an exercise in futility .
Back in the day after Dynamix was acquired by Sierra we did have to work with marketing and do the prediction dance , but it was rarely correct , and the games I believed in the most like The Incredible Machine got terrible forecasts . "
- Jeff Tunnell , What is My Game 's Sales Potential ?
Here 's my take :
There are commercially - successful indie games about gangly kung - fu fighting rabbits , abstract computer landscapes populated by tiny green squeaking things , and small , dribbly blobs of goo .
These are never going to be as big as The Sims , but they were never intended to be .
By " commercially successful " , I mean " making enough money for their creators to continue making games " .
That 's your goal , right ?
Go for a " popular " concept only if you have a passion for it : you need passion to drive you through the process of making the game .
If you 're coming up with something wackier , realize that you 're going to have to work harder to find the audience , and start figuring out how you 're going to go about doing that before you start development .
Frozen Synapse
Whatever you do , you should have a strong core concept that you can express quickly :
Uplink - " hacking game "
Democracy - " you are the Prime Minister "
Frozen Synapse - " you are a tactical commander "
Could n't resist , sorry ... but I do have a point : sometimes it 's good to go for the odd PR cheap shot in order to get your concept out there .
Do n't overdo it like Scott Steinberg and write an entire essay about how awesome your consultancy business is in the middle of your book , however .
That would be silly and some British guy bashing away an article about game PR would probably call you on it three or four years later .
One further note on concept : your concept must be married to a coherent and strong aesthetic .
Uplink was n't just a hacking game ; its depiction of hacking came straight from Hollywood .
It simply presented its core idea in the most stylish way possible .
Getting Set Up
If you 're making a game , almost everything you do is newsworthy to someone .
If you 've done some stimulating programming , scrawled some mind - warping concept art , composed some interesting music or found an original way of promoting your game , there 's a community of people out there who care about it .
If you 've eaten some soup , they probably do n't care about that , and neither does anyone following you on Twitter , so shut up .
You 'll need a website , most likely a blog .
Well , duh .
" The only way to start a blog is to pretend the audience is there , even if you think it 's zero .
The truth is , your friends will come and read it .
And then it 'll be your friends and some guy who lives in Cleveland . "
- Jonathan Coulton , indie musician , Electronic Musician Magazine 08/2009
In Seth Godin 's marketing gobbledygook language , you have to " unite a tribe . "
This means " find a bunch of people who like something , give them somewhere to gather and feed them information " .
This is what your blog is for : it 's not just a vanity project for you to vent your endless guff .
Blogging is only one way to do this though .
Here 's a good analysis on social networks by the awesome Wolfire guys .
Of course , there 's social networking sites , podcasting , videos , online tutorials , articles , talks , IRC and email mailing lists ( try http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/)
Essentially , there are scads of different ways of disseminating information about your game .
I 'm sure you can think of many more than I 've mentioned , as they 're not that hard to come up with .
The most important thing is n't that you have coverage over every communication method , however .
It 's that you use your chosen ones well .

Enlarge By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY Birth Control Pills .
LONDON ( AP ) 
Giving contraceptives to people in developing countries could help fight climate change by slowing population growth , experts said Friday .
More than 200 million women worldwide want contraceptives , but do n't have access to them , according to an editorial published in the British medical journal , Lancet .
That results in 76 million unintended pregnancies every year .
If those women had access to free condoms or other birth control methods , that could slow rates of population growth , possibly easing the pressure on the environment , the editors say .
" There is now an emerging debate and interest about the links between population dynamics , sexual and reproductive health and rights , and climate change , " the commentary says .
In countries with access to condoms and other contraceptives , average family sizes tend to fall significantly within a generation .
Until recently , many U.S. - funded health programs did not pay for or encourage condom use in poor countries , even to fight diseases such as AIDS .
The world 's population is projected to jump to 9 billion by 2050 , with more than 90 % of that growth coming from developing countries .
It 's not the first time lifestyle issues have been tied to the battle against global warming .
Climate change experts have previously recommended that people cut their meat intake to slow global warming by reducing the numbers of animals using the world 's resources .
The Lancet editorial cited a British report which says family planning is five times cheaper than usual technologies used to fight climate change .
According to the report , each $ 7 spent on basic family planning would slash global carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1 ton .
Experts believe that while normal population growth is unlikely to significantly increase global warming that overpopulation in developing countries could lead to increased demand for food and shelter , which could jeopardize the environment as it struggles with global warming .

Report warns industry will face dramatic changes over the coming decade as climate change and shifting demographics increase pressure on many resorts .
From BusinessGreen.com , part of the Guardian Environment Network
High energy costs , water scarcity , an ageing population and terrorism are likely to dramatically change the tourism landscape over the next 14 years , according to a report on the future of tourism .
Tourism 2023 , a " what - if ? " report from sustainability think tank Forum for the Future , suggests that climate change could drastically change the destinations that people are willing to visit , and that a ballooning population in Asia will lead to a dramatic shift in tourism traffic patterns that could cause congestion problems at a number of global transport hubs .
" Against this backdrop of a changing climate and increasing pressures from growing populations , we can expect the cost of key resources such as food , building materials and energy to rise in many places as demand grows and supplies fail to keep pace , " the report said .
It posits four possible scenarios for the state of the tourism market in 2023 , all of which suggest the industry will face major changes as a result of climate change impacts and emerging clean technologies .
" Boom and bust " describes a world in which new technologies make green travel easier , and where an ageing population takes medical holidays for cheap operations elsewhere .
In contrast , " divided disquiet " suggests that political instability will have made many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources .
Finally , the report warns that a " price and privilege " scenario could see rising fuel and energy costs make long - distance travel too expensive for most people , while a " carbon clampdown " where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change could similarly lead to reduced demand for international travel .
The publication of the report was accompanied by the launch of a new coalition of leading industry players , including trade association ABTA , British Airways , Carnival UK , The Co-operative Travel , The Travel Foundation , Thomas Cook and TUI Travel , which will aim to develop more sustainable tourism practices by 2023 .
" It is vital that the travel and tourism industry meets the challenges that an international industry faces if we want to have a successful and profitable future , " said Mark Tanzer , ABTA chief executive .
" By working together we can come up with practical and innovative solutions to these challenges , which make sound commercial sense . "
The group is expected to focus on measures for promoting low carbon destinations and travel options , reducing landfill waste , better returning economic benefits back to local communities , and improving resort water efficiency .

A Minor Correction
By : John Caruso
Alan Grayson 's heart is in the right place , but he got this wrong :
" If you get sick , America , the Republican health care plan is this : die quickly , " [ Grayson ] said .
" That 's right .
The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick . "
No , the Republicans do n't want you to die quickly , they want you to die profitably .
And as long as you 're doing that they 're happier if you stay alive longer , because after you shuffle off this mortal coil you stop being a human ATM for their various constituencies , like health care - denial corporations , pharmacidical firms , and residential fleecing facilities for the elderly .
And of course it 's not just Republicans .
Other than than , totally agreed .

Patrick Swayze died today after a long battle with cancer .
He was 57 .
Swayze was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January 2008 .
His publicist says he died with his family at his side .
originally investigated and reported on Friday July 31 , 2009 by Augustine Fou , with Tugce Esener @tesener
Several friends and colleagues had the same reaction when they found out about this video — that it was at such a high view count already and we were late to the party of finding out .
Then we did some more digging — digital forensics 🙂
And this is a case where a viral hit was indeed successfully manufactured .
There ’s something to be learned from all this — how to successfully manufacture a viral video sensation and make viral profits .
Chris Brown is successfully tapping into the viral halo of a funny video that coincidentally used his song .
ReadWriteWeb article on how rights owners ( Sony , Chris Brown ) can make viral profits on other people using their work instead of suing them – http://bit.ly/KA3HI
The video was real .
But p romotional activities ( possibly / likely paid ) created the initial viral effect ( led to the tipping point of the viral effect ) which then got carried a further by people thinking they were simply late to the party , including myself ( e.g. 440 k bit.ly clicks and 3 k detectable retweets out of the 13 M views ) .
The numbers do n’t jive .
The viral halo has added 1 million more views to the video from August 1 – August 2 . ( 13.1 M to 14.5 M )
Ten ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN proof points to follow , each with screen shot to illustrate .
1a. anyone notice that the “ Forever ” soundtrack is remarkably consistent throughout the video as if it were dubbed or added in after the original footage was shot .
The sound is too consistent in volume and loudness to have come from a built - in , on - camera microphone .
At the very end of the video , once it cuts back to the couple at the altar the sound quality goes back to the echo-y , tinny sound of an on -camera mic .
1b . The “ The KHeinz ” user on YouTube was registered on July 19 , 2009 , the day the video was posted .
We usually look for clues like this to detect “ plants ” by PR agencies .
This is an issue of trust — a user “ CmdrTaco ” on Slashdot has been around the forums for years , made hundreds of posts , and was rated by the community very highly .
PR agencies trying to seed stories have to create new user accounts during the PR campaign ( recent registration date ) and have made no other posts or uploads before ( no history ) .
2 . The social intensity detected in all of the top social venues like Technorai , Delicious , Reddit , Digg , etc. indicate there was not enough organic sharing to support a view count of 13 million views in 11 days ( updated : 14.6 million today August 2 , 2009 ) .
a ) Bit.ly shows only 447 k clicks on the shortened URL
“ At Fortune ’s Brainstorm : Tech conference Ashton Kutcher effectively took credit for boosting the views from – in his words – 12,500 views before he tweeted the link – to some 1.2 million views 12 hours later … ”
Well , unfortunately he used a bit.ly link which provides public analytics on how many people clicked .
Most tweets result in immediate traffic , which then tails off immediately after the tweet falls off the first page .
In his case , look at the following bit.ly stats URL and click “ past month ” to see the peak clicks on July 23 .
All he can actually claim is that his tweet drove a peak of about 100,000 clicks on that day not 1.2 million 🙁
too bad Ashton .
next time you make a BMOC claim , be sure to use a non trackable method , so analytics wo n’t “ out ” you so easily .
after only 3.5 days of retweets the twitter intensity died off to next - to - nothing ; if this were a truly viral video , carried forth by real people ( and not by paid PR support and paid media ) the retweet intensity would remain high .
As of August 21 , there are over 21 M views on the video and the 505k retweets does not show actual organic support for that number .
b ) Twitturly shows only 3 thousand retweets on the YouTube URL itself
c ) Delicious shows only 447 bookmarks of the video itself
d ) Reddit only shows 673 thumbs up for the video itself
e ) Technorati shows only 277 blog mentions of the video itself — this could be undercounting if blogs used URL shorteners .
But if you look at the blog intensity results ( below ) sorted by blogs with most authority the blogs have very little authority ( i.e. influence or size of audience ) .
— these are real indications of interest by real people .
The social intensity of the passalong for this video does not substantiate the huge number of views in 11 days .
What we are seeing now is the additional viral halo , as the momentum is sustained by large media outlets reporting on the story — even Google Blog blogged about it ( boasting about the success of YouTube advertising in driving revenues ) .
Of course TechCrunch is right that viral videos can be monetized : http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/youtube-viral-wedding-videos-are-great-for-advertising/ )
3 . Twitter shows nothing in the top “ trending topics ” related to this video – indicating few people are actually tweeting about it — if this video is SO viral ( 13 M views in 11 days ) then it has GOT to show up on a scan of social intensity .
( see screen capture below )
July 31 ( Friday ) August 2 ( Sunday )
4 . The original video was posted July 19 , 2009 .
The people from the video appeared on NBC ’s Today Show and danced around Rockerfeller Center on July 25th ( 6 calendar days after posting ) .
Today
Show staff may be great at spotting news , but to get all the wedding party from the wedding to re-enact the dance on the Today Show in 6 calendar days — too good to be true ?
Hmm …
5 . Out of all the wedding videos on YouTube , how did Chris Brown detect this particular one that used his song .
@glenngabe noted that there are song detection mechanisms – ContentID – which detect the pattern of the copyrighted song and report that to the rights owners .
We know there are hundreds , if not thousaands , or really funny wedding home videos — America ’s Funniest Videos has been running for years and years on TV showing funny wedding blooper videos that people submitted to them .
6. ALL TEN of the top viral videos on AdAge ’s Viral Video Chart took around 3 – 6 months to achieve full viral effect — not 6 days .
See all 10 videos ’ stats , as reported by YouTube at the following link .
This video has not shown up at all on the list of Adage viral videos .
7. From @RedW0rm – YouTube Declares Wedding Video a Financial Success – http://bit.ly/9ZUtu
8. also check the velocity of this http://twitter.com/#search?q=jkwedding or this http://twitter.com/#search?q=jkweddingdance notice the tweets are not seconds apart but hours apart .
Something that achieved 13 M views in the 11 days since posting would show far higher velocity or twitter intensity .
9 . For a top - trending topic on twitter , there is usually correspondingly high search volume that is detectable .
At first glance , terms related to this viral video like “ jkwedding ” or “ jk wedding dance ” all seem to spike .
But if you put it against even “ Corazon Aquino ” ( one of the top trending topics NOW on Twitter ) those JK wedding search volumes are dwarfed .
( see chart below ) .
10 .
Google only reports 366 links to the video and most of them are not even important websites ( see Alexa blue bar )
11 . The video itself has no honors and no stats ( yet ) ; YouTube stats are conveniently turned off .
Other videos have their stats graphs publicly available
12 . see the fine print in the YouTube description —
For more information or to make a donation towards violence prevention please visit our website : http://www.jkweddingdance.com/ — why would a normal wedding video ask people to make a donation towards violence prevention ?
( see screen capture below ) , the WHOIS record shows the domain jkweddingdance.com was created 29 - Jul - 09 — today is 31 - Jul-09
Updated : This was circumstantial evidence .
A source confirmed that Jill is studying patterns of violence propagation for her PhD .
Their choice of charity was their own choice .
And the site was set up to help that cause .
Conclusion ?
The video itself is real , made by those nice people in the wedding .
They may not even realize why or how their wedding video went viral ( and the tens of thousands of other wedding videos on YouTube did not ) .
On the Today Show , “ The couple told Lauer they were surprised at the video ’s popularity ” ( also see NY Daily News article – http://bit.ly/OA3iG

The KOffice team today announced the second beta of the upcoming 2.1 release .
The KOffice community has now switched from adding new features to only fix the remaining bugs , and that is obvious from this release .
The first beta of 2.1 was released without any fanfares , but it marked the transition into the bugfixing stage .
We now think it 's time to let the users start to participate in the process .
You can see the progress in the full changelog .
Karbon Karbon
Something that is not obvious from the changelog is that there has been much activity in the MS office import filters , especially for MS Word and Powerpoint .
Many new formatting features have been implemented in both these filters .
We expect KOffice 2.1 to be better at reading MS file formats than any previous KOffice version .
As was mentioned in the release notes for beta 1 , the 2.1 release will contain new features in most applications , especially KWord , KPresenter and Krita .
It also features the come back of the mathematical formula shape .
Since this release includes so many bugfixes , we encourage users that want to help with the process to try it out and report remaining bugs .
As usual we are especially interested in bugs that cause data loss or incompatibilities with other office suites such as OpenOffice.org .
For more detailed information see the announcement .
Top 10 : Cruel Things Women Do To Men
Ten Things Women Do That Drive Us A Little Crazy
Men get plenty of blame for being promiscuous and superficial when it comes to women , but let 's face it — women are guilty of their share of nasty shenanigans , too .
Here are 10 ways that women can be uniquely cruel to guys .
If your lady - friend is resorting to any of this type of behavior , you should feel free to call her out on it and refuse to put up with it .
It ’s no surprise that people email me asking what type of returns they can expect if they get a good futures , Forex or stock market education .
This is asked by those doing swing trading , day trading and long term investing alike .
It ’s asked by those trading Forex , futures and those trying to learn the stock market and doing stock market research .
It ’s a natural question to ask .
But trading is a bit different than getting a job that pays a consistent , reliable wage .
So the first thing that must be said is that most people who start a trading business do not succeed .
On the other hand that is actually true of any business , not just trading .
Of course we would n’t become traders if we did n’t think we could beat the odds and become successful .
So the next question would be : “ How much can a successful trader expect to make ? ”
I ’m not aware of any universal statistics available on that topic , but I can guide you to some resources I know that track trading results .
To the best of my knowledge they are objective and reliable .
The first resource is Barclay Hedge ( www.barclayhedge.com).
They have statistics each month on the managed futures performance of the top 10 traders managing less than $ 10 million , and also those managing more than $ 10 million .
To get the statistics you have to register at the site , but registration is free .
Also if you subscribe to Active Trader magazine , they publish the numbers every month .
The second resource is Futures Truth Magazine ( www.futurestruth.com).
They track the results of automated trading systems and publish several “ top 10 ” lists .
In observing the lists , one interesting fact is that only 1 out of the top 10 systems for the past 12 months is also on the top 10 systems list since their release date .
This is why everyone prints the disclaimer :
Past results are not necessarily indicative of future performance .
That statement if found on every ad for a very good reason .
It ’s true !
A third excellent resource is the “ Market Wizards ” series of books .
Reading even just one of these books will give you a realistic view of what successful traders have had to go through to reach their stature .
[ disclosure : this is my affiliate link to Amazon.com ]
The “ secrets ” to becoming a successful trader are not secrets at all .
They are well known and documented , but rarely followed .
I ’ve had many conversations with traders who have asked me the secrets of success , only to have the conversation end with them saying , “ I know all that stuff already , but what ’s the real secret ? ”
This supports my belief that “ knowledge is NOT power . ”
The “ power ” lies in the DOING .
Did you find any of these 3 resources helpful ?
Do you know any other good resources about the reality of trading and what it takes to achieve trading success ?

The million - acre watershed supplies 15 million people , including 9 million New Yorkers .
The Department of Environmental Conservation , which issued the preliminary guidelines , said that it found no reasonable basis for a drilling ban near the watershed , but that measures were necessary to allay concerns raised last year in public hearings .
Under the new rules , for example , drillers would be required to disclose the chemical fluids used for each well .
Buffer zones would be created around reservoirs and aqueducts in the watershed .
Wells drilled within a 1,000 - foot corridor of underground tunnels that carry drinking water to New York City would require special approval , and in some cases , state inspectors would have to be present during some phases of operations .
The proposals will be open for public comment until Nov. 30 , said Yancey Roy , a spokesman for the agency .
State regulators will release their final report sometime next year , which will open the door for drilling permits to be issued .
Some critics of drilling said that they recognized that the regulators had made an effort to address some of their concerns and that drillers would have to comply with more stringent rules in New York than in other parts of the country .
Still , they expressed some dissatisfaction .
“ We need to have a zero - risk policy here , and it is not appropriate to allow drilling in such a unique and extraordinarily valuable resource , ” said Kate Sinding , a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ The record in other states is so abysmal , and it does n’t take much to do better than other states . ”

“ Beating you ? ” , asked the road cop in surprise .

BBC News education reporter
The call for a later start has been rejected by the government Children should not start formal learning until they are six , a review of primary education in England says .
Instead the kind of play - based learning featured in nurseries and reception classes should go on for another year , the Cambridge Primary Review says .
There is no evidence that an early introduction to formal learning has any benefit , the review says , but there are suggestions it can do some harm .
Ministers say a starting age of six would be completely counter - productive .
Most children start primary school in England aged four , and a large proportion are taking advantage of free , part - time pre-school places in local schools and privately - run nurseries from the age of three .
Too much too young ?
The kind of learning that goes on there follows the government 's " Early Years Foundation Stage " , which currently runs to the age of five and is a play - based curriculum which includes some early literacy and numeracy goals .
COMPULSORY SCHOOL AGE
Five years old : England , Scotland , Wales , N. Ireland , Malta , the Netherlands Six years old : Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark ( 6 - 7 ) , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Irish Republic , Italy , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Spain , Sweden ( 6 - 7 ) Seven years old : Estonia , Finland , Latvia , Lithuania
Source : Eurydice Continuing this informal but structured learning for a year or so would bring children in England in line with many European countries , where school starts at six or even seven , and standards are often higher .
A similar step has already been taken in Wales and Northern Ireland where a play - focussed curriculum has been extended to the end of Key Stage 1 , when children are aged seven .
But Scotland follows the English model .
" This would give sufficient time for children to establish positive attitudes to learning and begin to develop the language and study skills which are essential to their later progress , " says the review , which is based on six years of academic work .
It stops short of calling for the age of compulsory schooling to be put back to age six , but does call for an open debate on the subject .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
However , it adds , that the issue is less about where children learn than what they learn .
Dame Gillian Pugh , who co-authored the review , said play - based learning was not a " wishy - washy , ' just let them get on with it ' thing " .
" It 's a balance between children - initiated and adult - initiated learning , " she said .
' Social disadvantage '
She said four and five - year - olds tended to be at a stage where they were just " tuning in " to learning and that they could be " turned off " if they were made to follow too formal a curriculum , too early on .
HAVE YOUR SAY Sometimes I think people are more interested in the childminding aspects of primary schools and nurseries than whether or not they are having any actual benefit Lee Brown , Thornhill
This would be of particular benefit to children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with speech and language delays , she added .
But she argued it would not hold back brighter children who were ready to begin basic numeracy and literacy in reception classes .
The review also notes that there are downward pressures to get children in reception year ready for the early years of school and the tests that follow .
It also calls for free part - time nursery provision to be offered to two - year - olds in areas of social disadvantage and for children with particular needs .
' Pillars of stability '
This would help them get the most out of school and hopefully close the achievement gap , it says .
The authors also call for national assessment tests , known as Sats , to be abandoned , saying their high - stakes nature , being linked to league tables , encourages a too - narrow focus on literacy and numeracy .

Instead , children should be assessed on the broad range of subjects throughout primary school and at its end , but these assessments should be used to monitor children 's progress rather than hold teachers accountable .
Welsh schoolchildren no longer sit Sats at 7 , 11 and 14 , nor are school league tables used there any more .
The review team also called for a major review of the way schools are staffed , arguing that there is a case for using more specialist teachers alongside the traditional class teacher .
But they also said primary schools were " pillars of stability " that were highly valued by parents and pivotal to communities .

Read Mark 's thoughts in full ' Counter - productive ' England 's schools minister Vernon Coaker said the government was already reforming primary education to make the curriculum less prescriptive and free it up for teachers .
He added : " A school starting age of six would be completely counter - productive - we want to make sure children are playing and learning from an early age and to give parents the choice for their child to start in the September following their fourth birthday .
" Our expert group on assessment said it would be a backward step to scrap English and maths tests at 11 and we are piloting a School Report Card , which will give parents a far broader picture of how schools are doing . "
Christine Blower , general secretary of the NUT , said : " All the evidence shows that proper , in - depth early years education provided by qualified teachers gives the best possible start to children 's schooling . "
We are asking whether children should begin formal lessons at six .
To add your opinion and read others click here .
Here are some of your experiences of education from around the world .
As a teacher I heartily agree with the findings and hope that various systems both in the UK and here in Australia will raise the enrolment age to six - particularly for boys .
However , it is precisely those who cannot afford to stay home to care for children any longer than necessary who need this advice .
The children of economically disadvantaged families would benefit most from staying home or being in a childcare environment longer to wait for school readiness .
Someone needs to act !
Ghaynes , Sydney , Australia I moved to Sweden a few years ago and am now preparing to send my child to school over here .
Formal lessons do not start here until six / seven - years - old - the early years are in government - run reception kindergartens .
These give the kids a wide choice of activities and start to introduce them to a structured learning method - but without the formal aspects that the UK introduces .
All I can say is that I am very impressed and I do n't see any areas where the later start counts against the child in the long run .
Mark , Sweden
Here in Germany , children start school at the age of six and they celebrate day one in style with family and friends coming to wish them well .
They get an Einsatztüte ( large cone full of goodies for school ) .
It is a real rite of passage .
However , many more mothers stay at home to look after the children and give up careers for longer .
Children remain " babyish " , unable to read , and lack the discipline that they are taught in the UK from age four .
Up to five years is said to be the best learning time too !!

In Cyprus the children start at age six and they have pre-school kindergarten .
They start at 0730 and finish at 1330 .
Many from our village attend universities around the world , so their education appears to be unaffected .
GJS , Paphos , Cyprus I have two children aged 17 and seven .
We moved to France four years ago , so I have had two children going through different systems for their early years learning .
The oldest had a UK early school education and has constantly struggled with reading , spelling and maths - she started at four .
My son did a term in the UK at four and was straight away being made to read and write , and was uninterested .
Since moving to France , he participated in their early school system of pen control , learning through play , and at six he started to learn to read .
Claire Lang , Pontivy , France I went through the English schooling system but my son has had the Dutch system that begins at six with formal lessons .
Between the ages of four and six it was learning through play .
The children do n't even realise they are learning .
Social skills are a lot better for children here , they learn to share and help .
His reading and writing skills at eight are the same as his cousin's in England .
G. van der Velden , Heesch , Netherlands
In Italy , formal schooling begins at six .
However , most kids go to ' scuola materna ' ( pre-school ) from the age of three , which teaches them social skills , such as playing and eating together .
This is fundamental to classroom behaviour later on .
The key issue is how much effort parents put into teaching their kids to read .
It 's no good plonking them in front of the TV in the forlorn hope that something will " sink in " .
Neil Probert , Cernusco Sul Naviglio , Italy
Here in Finland , the norm is for kids to start school at seven .
It is optional to go to kindergarten before that , and to pre-school at six ( one day a week at kindergarten where the child gets used to a school environment ) .
The benefits are plainly visible - Finland has one of the lowest illiteracy rates in the world .
Steve , Turku , Finland I lived in Albania from 1997 to 2005 .
There children began school at the age of seven on average .
By 15 they were ahead of our children here at that age .
They would go school from 0800 until 1300 .
Then they would have several hours homework .
They did not have the books or facilities we have here , often no electricity and no heating in the winter .
Their system let them down when they reached later high school years .
But I understand it is improving now .
So starting at six would not be a problem .
Pete Hodge , Upholland , UK
My three - year - old daughter has just started full - time school here in Spain and her books for her first year included maths , science , English ( yes the Spanish start a second language early ) and reading etc .
There is nothing wrong with teaching children at an early age .
My eldest is 11 and her class learn English and French .
Yet another example of trying to save money somewhere at the expense of a child 's education while other countries prefer to invest in their future .
James , Spain Children in India begin schooling at three !
Or even earlier .
Convent education starts early .
We have pre-nursery , nursery , KG - I and KG - II before the child is admitted to class - 1 . A British legacy !
Nayan Pani , New Delhi , India I have also experienced life from the other side .
I now live abroad , my kid started at six , though she went to many playschools .
She does ok but levels seem behind where I was at 10 .
With today 's culture I believe it 's best not to ram info down kids ' throats till they are a bit older .
I also think that , starting later , they finish later and once half an ounce of common sense is observed , students will realise they wo n't get anywhere unless they are educated and will want to continue education .
Jules Fraser , Philippines
We moved to Canada eight years ago and children here start formal schooling at the age of six .
We have to say it makes for a much happier child .
They seem to learn better social skills whilst playing in a more relaxed environment and learn to get on better with their peers especially those of the opposite gender - that is what we saw with both of our kids .
Carl Machin , Calgary , Canada
As a temporary resident of the US my six - year - old has just started kindergarten .
I desperately wish we were back home so his formal education could have begun earlier .
We paid for pre-school which was " learn by play " .
We were all frustrated by the lack of progress .
Even working with him at home there was no school reinforcement .
On the other hand , my soon - to - be eight - year - old who went to nursery school in England was reading and writing by the age of four and is considered a high flier here .

The map utility function can be used to translate all the elements contained in the array into other set of items .
You ’ll find this method useful when you need to transform a collection of items A into items .
The function expects two parameters :
an array of items that is going to be translated ;
a callback function which will be called for each item and is responsible for transforming the existing item into a new item .
Here ’s a simple example which doubles all the integers contained on an array named arr :
var arr = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ; var doubled = $. map ( arr , function ( item ) { return item * 2 ; } ) ; alert ( doubled ) ;
You might be thinking that this is so simple that you could do it by using a simple for .
Fair enough …and if I told you that I ’d like to receive only the double of elements which are n’t divisible by four ?
Here ’s how you ’d do that :
var arr = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ; var doubled = $. map ( arr , function ( item ) { if ( item % 4 === 0 ) return null ; return item * 2 ; } ) ; alert ( doubled ) ;
Returning null removes an item from the final array .
Ok , I can hear you thinking !
Yes , this is still doable with a simple for and using continue for the cases that do n’t matter …
And what if I told you that I want the first three multiples of all numbers which are n’t divisible by four ?
( and I ’m talking about a flat array , not an array of arrays ) .
Here ’s how you ’d do it with this utility method :
var arr = [ 1,2,3 , 4 ] ; var doubled = $. map ( arr , function ( item ) { var items = [ ] ; var i = 0 ; while ( i++ < 3 ) { items [ i ] = item * i ; } return items ; } ) ;
Simple and easy , right ?
For the sake of completeness , I ’d like to point out that the callback function receives two arguments : the first ( which was used in all the previous samples ) references the current item of the array that is being enumerated ; the second returns the current position within the array .
Keep tuned for more on JQuery .
Still , Mack did speak to Vikram Pandit , of Citigroup , about a possible merger , but they jointly concluded that it made no sense .
Geithner suggested that Goldman ’s Blankfein call Pandit .
Blankfein made the call , thinking that he was supposed to rescue Citi .
He was dumbfounded when he discovered that Pandit was n’t expecting to hear from him .
For his part , Pandit was taken aback that Goldman thought it might be able to buy Citi , since at the time Pandit felt that Citi was much stronger .
That afternoon , Mack , speaking to Blankfein , bemoaned the effect of short sellers , whose actions were unnerving investors .
The previous weekend , at the Fed , Mack had complained about the impact of short sellers on Lehman , and asked Blankfein if he would support an effort to get the S.E.C. to ban short selling .
Blankfein had demurred .
But now he said , “ We ’ve rethought the need for a temporary ban . ”
They agreed to press the issue with Paulson and Geithner .
At six that evening , Bernanke met with his top aides — Donald Kohn ; Kevin Warsh ; Scott G. Alvarez , the general counsel ; and Michelle Smith , the spokesperson — with Paulson and Geithner participating by speakerphone .
“ We can not do this alone anymore , ” he said .
“ We have to go to Congress and get some authority . ”
Paulson had n’t yet taken any concrete steps to enlist legislators to authorize a government rescue .
Paulson reiterated his concern about getting congressional leaders to go along .
“ I spoke to Harry and Nancy ” — Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi , the House Speaker — “ and the political advisers , ” he said .
“ If the Treasury and the Fed say it ’s an emergency and we need help , and help does n’t come , it would further destabilize the markets .
You do n’t go public until you ’re reasonably certain you ’ll get what you ’re asking for . ”
Bernanke was growing agitated .
“ Hank !
Listen to me , ” he interrupted .
“ We are done ! ”
It was the first time Fed officials had heard him raise his voice .
“ The Fed is already doing all that it can with the powers we have , ” Bernanke continued .
One participant recalled , “ Ben gave an impassioned , linear , rigorous argument explaining the limits of our authority and the history of financial crises in the U.S. and abroad . ”
That history showed that efforts to resolve such crises “ are successful only when overwhelming force from all parts of government is brought to bear , ” the participant said .
“ It was an encyclopedic tour de force . ”
It was as though Bernanke were the professor and Paulson the student .
Bernanke ’s comments lasted about fifteen minutes , and Paulson was uncharacteristically silent until near the end .
“ Got to go , ” he said , and hung up .
THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 18
You can sort it out later !
The Fed group reconvened at six - thirty that morning .
They had decided the night before that repetition would be helpful , so Bernanke started on the same lecture .
Thirty seconds into it , Paulson interrupted .
“ Ben , Ben , Ben . . . ” Bernanke stopped talking .
“ I ’ve done some thinking , ” Paulson said .
“ You and I should go see the President and then go to Congress tonight and ask for more authority . ”
At 10:15 A.M. , President Bush delivered a two - minute televised statement outside the Oval Office , his first public pronouncement since the crisis began , which concluded :
Our financial markets continue to deal with serious challenges .
As our recent actions demonstrate , my Administration is focussed on meeting these challenges .
The American people can be sure we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence .
When staffers again huddled in Paulson ’s office , Paulson wanted to know what ideas they had come up with .
Asian and European markets were continuing to plunge , with banks and insurers bearing the brunt of the losses .
Britain announced a month - long ban on short selling in an effort to prevent the kind of “ bear raids ” that some blamed for the fall in Lehman ’s stock .
Russia had suspended trading for the previous two days .
Morgan Stanley shares had plunged twenty - four per cent the previous day .
Paulson had just heard that Bank of America was temporarily pulling back on credit lines to some McDonald ’s franchisees , slowing a McDonald ’s expansion into upscale coffee drinks to compete with Starbucks .
( Bank of America disputes this account , but McDonald ’s did issue a memo urging franchisees to find other sources of credit , according to Bloomberg . )
Dan Jester , a Goldman vice - president whom Paulson had brought to the Treasury Department that summer , reported that one approach would be for the government to inject capital directly into financial institutions .
The standard way to raise capital is to sell stock .
There were now no private buyers .
But , as one participant put it , was the government going “ to A.I.G. them ” ?
If the government bought common stock , it would have the power to vote , appoint management and the board of directors , and , if the stake was big enough , control the company .
Might this end up being “ nationalization ” ?
The politics looked awful .
Even so , Jester and most of his team argued that the approach was simple , efficient , and effective , and would protect taxpayers .
Bernanke had long been saying that the government needed many tools to respond to the unforeseeable , including the ability to buy “ bad companies ” as well as “ bad assets . ”
But Paulson told Bernanke he feared that direct investments would destabilize markets and drive out private investors .
Another option was to remove the bad assets from balance sheets .
The Resolution Trust Corporation , created by Congress in 1989 , had used taxpayer money to buy and then auction off distressed real estate from failing savings - and - loans .
Though some people criticized the agency for dumping assets on the market too quickly and selling at fire - sale prices , the approach established a floor for real - estate prices .
This approach not only had worked in the past but would avoid the charged issue of government ownership .
Several people , however , noted that there were major differences between tangible real estate and the esoteric mortgage - backed securities and other structured assets now on balance sheets .
Houses and land could be auctioned and find buyers , as they have been for centuries .
But , without any functioning market for mortgage - backed debt , how would you value it and what would the government pay ?
If the amount was too small , bank balance sheets would be devastated by the sales and subsequent write - downs , making the crisis worse .
If too big , it was simply a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to banks and other financial institutions .
Neel Kashkari , an assistant Treasury secretary and an ex-Goldman investment banker , who was the biggest proponent of removing bad assets from balance sheets , argued that the mechanics could always be worked out once Congress had given the Treasury and the Fed the authority to act .
Steven Shafran and others who had focussed on liquidity issues proposed allowing money - market funds to borrow from the Fed , using their commercial paper and other assets as collateral .
But Paulson thought that this was too technical for the average money - market - fund investor and would n’t be enough to stop a run .
“ What would you do if you want to address all the issues ? ”
“ We could always just guarantee the money - market funds , ” Shafran said .
Paulson looked up .
“ Could we ? ”
“ I think so , ” Shafran said .
Paulson slammed his hand down on his desk .
“ Then that ’s what we ’re going to do . ”
A few participants were aghast .
The risks seemed enormous : it was a four - trillion - dollar guarantee !
Even the F.D.I.C. insured bank accounts only up to a hundred thousand dollars .
Moreover , money - market funds were n’t bank deposits but investment products with higher risks and therefore higher returns .
By eliminating that risk , another cornerstone of moral hazard was being removed .
But others argued that the risk of not doing anything , or of doing too little , was far worse .
Paulson embraced the boldness and simplicity of the notion .
As someone said , it “ passed the USA Today test . ”
Paulson and Bernanke returned to the Roosevelt Room , joined this time by Chris Cox , of the S.E.C. Vice - President Dick Cheney was also there , along with Bush .
Paulson outlined the decision of the Treasury , backed by the Fed , to seek legislation authorizing the purchase of billions of dollars in troubled mortgage - backed assets .
“ It would be wise to go to Congress , ” Bernanke said , arguing that capital should be approved by Congress and dispensed by the appropriate authority , the Treasury , rather than by the Fed , an institution already doing all it could with the powers it had .
“ You ’re the experts , and I ’ll support you , ” Bush said .
Paulson launched into a discussion of the political issues , and the need to win over conservative Republicans as well as the Democratic leadership .
The President interrupted .
“ Hank , let me worry about the politics .
You do what is right . ”
As word spread that a more comprehensive approach to the crisis might be under way , stocks soared in near - frenzied trading .
The Dow closed up four hundred and ten points , with the biggest surge in six years .
At 7 P.M. , Bernanke , Paulson , and Cox met with congressional leaders in Speaker Pelosi ’s conference room , overlooking the Mall .
After photographers and press representatives were asked to leave , Paulson addressed the group .
“ We are in danger of a broad systemic collapse , and action needs to be taken urgently to head it off , ” he said .
“ We need the authority to spend several hundred billion . ”
Cox invoked his former colleagues ’ memories of September 11th .
“ We did extraordinary things then for the good of the country , ” he said .
“ This is what has to happen again , even if it is just weeks before an election . ”
“ Damn it , honey , I hate it when you give me that fish - eye look . ”

Bernanke pointed out that he was a historian and a student of the Great Depression .
“ The kind of financial collapse that we ’re now on the brink of is always followed by a deep , long recession , ” he said .
“ If we are n’t able to head this off , the next generation of economists will be writing not about the thirties but about this . ”
Someone asked what the scenario looked like .
Bernanke was cautious .
He did n’t want to be accused of exaggerating the danger .
“ You could see a twenty - per - cent decline in the stock market , unemployment at nine to ten per cent , the failure of G.M. , certainly , and other large corporate failures .
It would be very bad . ”
The tone of the two most powerful men in the financial world was as frightening as their words .
Questions shifted to Paulson .
What are you going to do with the money ?
Paulson stressed the need to buy toxic assets , but resisted questions about how that would work .
Spencer Bachus , the ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services , asked about injecting capital directly into banks .
Paulson said that he would consider it .
The legislators pressed on how much money would be needed .
Paulson finally said , “ Several hundred billion means several hundred billion . ”
“ You ’ve got to understand , Mr. Secretary , ” Barney Frank said .
“ This can not be seen as just a Wall Street bailout . ”
He said that executive compensation and foreclosures needed to be addressed .
“ There ’s too much anger out there , ” he added .
Paulson did n’t want to get sidetracked by issues that he considered extraneous to the immediate crisis .
He knew that if the government tried to cap pay then no one on Wall Street would participate — a state of affairs that Frank later said he found “ terribly depressing . ”
“ Without a functioning banking system , things will get much worse on Main Street , ” Paulson countered .
He also stressed that congressional action had to be taken before the markets opened on Monday , or more major institutions might collapse .
And what would happen if such legislation failed in Congress ?
Paulson paused for a moment .
“ In that case , God help us all . ”
Barney Frank and Chris Dodd indicated that Congress would coöperate , but with some conditions .
According to the Times , Majority Leader Reid added , “ You have no idea what you ’re asking me to do .
It takes me forty - eight hours to get the Republicans to flush the toilet . ”
The meeting lasted ninety minutes .
Reid , Pelosi , and Paulson agreed to speak at a press conference .
Someone suggested that a Republican also speak , but Richard Shelby , of Alabama , a conservative and the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , interjected , “ Y’all do n’t want me to speak . ”
The laughter helped lighten the mood .
The group agreed to make only brief , general comments about what was discussed at the meeting .
Once Paulson had decided on insuring money - market funds in their entirety , it fell to staff members at the Treasury to figure out how to make it happen .
They had less than twenty - four hours to implement a program that ordinarily would have taken weeks of study .
David Nason , another assistant Treasury secretary , called leading money - market funds to gauge their reaction .
Several members of the executive committee of the Investment Company Institute , a national association of U.S. investment companies , including Vanguard , Invesco , T. Rowe Price , and Fidelity , opposed a federal insurance program .
All they wanted was a Fed facility that would address their liquidity issues .
They feared that insuring money - market funds could be destabilizing .
Nason told them , “ You ’re getting this whether you want it or not . ”
“ But it ’s a liquidity issue , ” John Brennan , the head of Vanguard , persisted .
“ That ’s not where the Secretary is , ” Nason replied .
“ This is about confidence , investors feeling safe .
Each time we ’ve hoped for a break , we did n’t get it .
We ’re using overwhelming force . ”
Most funds eventually agreed to participate .
They had little choice .
Once Treasury announced such a plan , and even one fund participated in the guarantee program , investors might abandon funds without the guarantee .
Early Friday morning , the Treasury announced a temporary guarantee program for money - market funds in order to protect “ the integrity and stability of the global financial system . ”
Chris Cox convened an emergency meeting of the S.E.C. that evening to consider a ban on short selling , which Blankfein and Mack felt was necessary to save Goldman and Morgan Stanley .
Cox was probably the most free - market - oriented of the group , and a ban on short selling went deeply against the grain .
The ability to sell short — to profit on a stock ’s decline — has long been seen as critical to market integrity , enhancing liquidity and the flow of information .
In fact , before that day none of the five commission members supported such a ban .
During calls that day and the previous day , however , government officials came out in favor of a ban .
And in one such call , when Cox said that he was worried about unintended consequences , Paulson grew impatient .
“ You can sort it out later ! ” he said .
“ You have to save them now or they ’ll be gone while you ’re still thinking about it . ”
At the meeting that night , the S.E.C. commissioners were informed that the Treasury and the Fed supported urgent action .
In light of this , and the fact that the U.K. had taken a similar step earlier that day , the commission voted unanimously to temporarily ban short selling in seven hundred and ninety - nine financial stocks .
FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 19
Big enough to make a difference .
Just before the U.S. markets opened , Paulson issued a statement reporting on the previous night ’s meeting and launching a campaign for a “ comprehensive approach ” to resolve the crisis .
He outlined a “ troubled - asset relief program ” — TARP — which would remove “ illiquid assets that are weighing down our financial institutions and threatening our economy . ”
News of an insurance program for money - market funds and a comprehensive approach to the root causes of the crisis — no matter how ill defined — ignited a euphoric rally on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones average rose four hundred points .
At ten -forty - five , President Bush , flanked by Paulson , Bernanke , and Cox , addressed the country from the Rose Garden .
“ This is a pivotal moment for America ’s economy , ” he began , and went on :
Our system of free enterprise rests on the conviction that the federal government should interfere in the marketplace only when necessary .
Given the precarious state of today ’s financial markets — and their vital importance to the daily lives of the American people — government intervention is not only warranted ; it is essential .
“ There were plenty of people around the President who just wanted the free market to work , ” Paulson told me .
“ He freed me from all of that .
He wanted there to be a free market left for all of us to work with .
People do n’t want to hear this .
They do n’t like him .
They want to see him as disengaged .
But he was very focussed on what was best for the country . ”
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs got a brief reprieve as speculators began to buy back shares and cover the short positions , but the situation of the two firms remained desperate .
Soon Goldman ’s Blankfein called Mack again .
“ What do you think of this bank - holding - company idea ? ” Blankfein asked .
Geithner was saying that they could complete the paperwork and become bank holding companies that weekend .
“ I do n’t know — what do you think ? ”
Mack asked .
Neither acknowledged to the other that he was going to pursue it .
But both knew that the survival of their firms was at stake .
“ You ’ve got to hang in there , ” Blankfein told Mack .
“ We ’re very supportive of you , but if you go under there will be immediate pressure on us . ”
On Friday afternoon , Paulson , in a teleconference with Geithner and other Fed and S.E.C. officials , said that it was time for President Bush to call the Chinese government in an effort to reassure it that , if it came to the aid of Morgan Stanley , it could count on U.S. government support .
The Chinese were understandably cool to the prospect , since the China Investment Corporation , an arm of the government , had already made a $ 5.6 - billion investment in Morgan Stanley in 2007 , and had watched the value of its stake plunge in the ensuing financial turmoil .
Chinese attempts to invest in some American companies ( such as the oil producer Unocal ) had caused a political uproar , and the idea of the Chinese increasing their stake in Morgan Stanley worried some people .
But Geithner was n’t especially concerned about which country invested in Morgan Stanley , as long as it complied with applicable laws .
On Friday evening , Morgan Stanley ’s chief financial officer got a call from the head of the firm ’s Tokyo office , reporting that Mitsubishi U.F.J. , the large Japanese bank , was interested in negotiating a stake .
John Mack was wary , given what he perceived as the glacial pace of Japanese dealmaking .
Nonetheless , he said , “ Send them over . ”
The following morning , a Chinese delegation , led by Gao Xiqing , the vice - chairman of the C.I.C. , arrived in New York to meet with Morgan Stanley executives .
Later , Paulson spoke to his Chinese counterpart , Wang Qishan , the vice - premier for economic affairs .
President Bush also spoke to President Hu Jintao .
According to one person briefed on that conversation , Bush reassured Hu that the U.S. was addressing the crisis and explained the policy steps it was taking .
( A spokesperson for Bush declined to comment . )
Paulson ’s legislative team , drafting the TARP legislation , consulted with Fed officials but stuck to Paulson ’s view that the bill had to focus on buying assets rather than on making direct capital investments — buying “ bad assets ” rather than “ bad companies . ”
The final draft was only a few pages long .
In Section 6 , it stated :
The Secretary ’s authority to purchase mortgage - related assets under this Act shall be limited to $ 700,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time .
At last , the bill had a price tag , designated by Paulson on impulse : the worldwide market for mortgage - backed securities was about $ 1.4 trillion ; seven hundred billion was half that .
“ It was big enough to make a difference , ” Paulson says .
EPILOGUE
Late on Sunday , September 21st , the Federal Reserve announced that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had become bank holding companies , bringing to an end the tradition of independent investment banks on Wall Street .
Despite the arrival of the Chinese delegation , Morgan Stanley ultimately sold twenty - one per cent of the company to the Japanese bank , Mitsubishi , for $ 9 billion .
“ The Chinese left in a huff , ” a Morgan Stanley executive recalls .
( The Chinese government declined to comment . )
On Tuesday , Goldman Sachs announced that Warren Buffett was buying five billion dollars ’ worth of preferred stock .
On Wednesday , Goldman raised another five billion in a public offering of common stock .
The moves staved off what had seemed the imminent collapse of the firms .
Although Barclays did not buy all of Lehman Brothers , it bought what it really wanted — Lehman ’s North American investment - banking operations and its presence on Wall Street — for just $ 250 million .
It paid $ 1.5 billion for Lehman ’s Manhattan headquarters and other real estate .
Bob Diamond called the deal a “ once- in - a - lifetime opportunity , ” and just a few months later Barclays showed a gain of $ 3.5 billion on the transaction .
The initial bipartisan support for emergency legislative action turned to hostility once the $ 700 - billion number was attached to the bill .
Senators and representatives from both parties reported that calls from constituents were overwhelmingly against the proposal .
On September 29th , the House voted down the legislation .
Global markets went into convulsions , the Dow dropped seven hundred and seventy - eight points , and credit markets stayed frozen .
Barney Frank , comparing Congress to a wayward child , counselled a nearly distraught Paulson , “ Sometimes you have to let the kid run away from home .
He gets hungry , he comes back . ”
Thanks to fierce lobbying , the legislation , much modified and expanded to four hundred pages , passed , on October 3rd .
“ Troubled assets ” were redefined to include not just mortgage - related assets but “ any other financial instrument ” deemed necessary to stabilize the financial system .
In the end , the Treasury did n’t buy the troubled assets .
Instead , it chose to inject capital directly into the banks , as Bernanke , Geithner , and some at Treasury had suggested all along .
On October 13th , Paulson summoned the heads of the country ’s nine most systemically important banks ( including the newest bank holding companies , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ) and explained the terms on which the government would extend to them and others a total of $ 250 billion in capital .
( To avoid the taint of “ nationalization , ” the government took preferred stock , which carried no voting rights . )
“ Someday when you have a kid of your own and you feel the urge to arbitrarily say no just because you can , you ’ll understand . ”

During the next year , the recession that , in Bernanke ’s words , inevitably follows a financial panic drove unemployment to 9.7 per cent .
The economic crisis , the worst since the Depression , destroyed household and retirement savings , pensions , insurance funds , and endowments .
Eighty - nine banks have failed this year .
Bank of America and Citigroup together got $ 90 billion in TARP funds and $ 420 billion in guarantees .
Stabilizing A.I.G. cost taxpayers $ 180 billion .
To combat the crisis , the size of the Fed ’s balance sheet — $ 850 billion before the Lehman collapse — grew to $ 2 trillion .
General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection , along with nearly a hundred and fifty other public companies — an increase of more than a hundred per cent from the previous year .
By March of 2009 , nearly nineteen hundred hedge funds had gone out of business .
Bernanke and Paulson both told me that the effects of Lehman ’s collapse were worse than they anticipated , and they had expected them to be bad .
The question persists : Could Lehman ’s collapse have been avoided ?
Paulson and Bernanke have argued that it could n’t .
The Fed has statutory emergency powers to lend to non-banks , but only against what it deems adequate collateral .
Lehman , unlike A.I.G. , with its healthy insurance businesses , did n’t have such collateral .
This argument seems to have first surfaced on October 15th , in a speech by Bernanke and in a statement attributed to Paulson by the wire service Market News International .
“ There ’s no law that any of us could have used , ” Paulson reiterated to me .
But Lehman clearly had some solid collateral , even if not enough for a government takeover of a collapsing firm .
The very day Lehman failed , the assets from its broker - dealer operations were deemed acceptable as collateral for a series of short - term multibillion - dollar loans from the Fed .
In order to insure an orderly winding down , the Fed loaned the broker - dealer unit $ 62.8 billion on Monday , September 15th , $ 47.7 billion on Tuesday , and $ 48.9 billion on Wednesday .
( When Barclays bought the unit , it repaid the outstanding Fed loans . )
In testimony this summer , Paulson said , “ The Fed was able to loan against Lehman collateral and did loan to help facilitate liquidation and bankruptcy . ”
( He did stipulate that a Fed loan would not have saved Lehman Brothers . )
It seems likely that such collateral might also have been adequate to support a rescue on the Bear Stearns model .

Scientists from around the world will soon gather to discuss how satellites could be used to address the world 's energy needs by relaying solar power to Earth .
But the U.S. government 's decision to abandon research in 2001 could prevent the alternative energy source from ever seeing the light of day .
Solar panels on Earth are inherently limited in their ability to collect energy by two things – the lack of direct sun at night and atmospheric interference from weather .
NASA 's now - abandoned Space Solar Power program would avoid these terrestrial impediments by launching satellites that would collect solar radiation and beam the energy to Earth .
These satellite systems could each provide gigawatts of electricity , enough power for tens of thousands of homes .
Interest in solar space power peaked in 2000 , when NASA officials testified before the House Committee on Science that by 2006 test satellites could be wirelessly transmitting energy from space .
After three years of studying the challenges and a favorable report from the National Research Council , in 2001 NASA requested and received new funding for the space solar power program .
But later that year , NASA canceled the program ( the website was last updated in August 2001 ) and withdrew the funding .
When asked about the decision to pull the plug on the program , former NASA Director Dan Goldin , who resigned his post in November 2001 , said in an e-mail that he does not comment on NASA policy issues .
" It was a done deal , the money was there , " said Henry Brandhorst , director of space research at Auburn University .
Brandhorst said that NASA decided to use the money for the space shuttle and International Space Station programs instead .
" It was a policy change . "
Without NASA 's resources and funding , the technology will never be sufficiently evaluated to determine its true potential , said Brandhorst , who has studied the technology for nearly 30 years .
" It must be studied until there are proven to be better options , " he said .
Despite this setback , scientists from around the world will gather later this month in Spain to discuss the technology 's potential as an energy source on Earth and for space exploration .
The Solar Power from Space conference runs from June 30 to July 2 , and will include scientists from NASA , the European Space Agency , or ESA , and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency , or JAXA .
JAXA and ESA have been spending several million dollars each year researching satellite solar power , but in the United States , scientists volunteer their spare time because there is no public - or private - sector funding .
" These are not wild - eyed environmentalists , " Brandhorst said .
" This is a dedicated community that wants to see something happen . "
Brandhorst said satellites in geosynchronous orbits – and always in sunlight – could continuously collect solar radiation and safely beam the energy to Earth as microwaves or through lasers .
He said the satellites could be repositioned to deliver energy to receiving stations in multiple locations .
Because there is energy loss during the process of beaming the energy to Earth and converting it back to electricity , it may not be more cost - effective than placing solar panels in places with ample sunlight .
However , Brandhorst said the satellites would be most beneficial in providing energy to places that are not easily accessible , do not receive extensive sunlight or do not have sufficient energy - distribution infrastructure .
Brandhorst said that beaming solar power from space is essential for space exploration , which according to President Bush is now NASA 's priority .
Brandhorst said that it is not feasible to carry enough fuel into space to develop settlements on the moon , so solar energy is the best alternative .
Bush has repeatedly said that the United States must become less reliant on foreign sources of energy as a matter of national security , but his administration has given solar power from space the cold shoulder .
While his administration has allocated millions of dollars for research into alternative fuel sources such as nuclear fusion and hydrogen , according to John Mankins , assistant associate administrator of advanced systems at NASA , there has been no funding for space solar power since 2001 .
Mankins said that because the technology blurs the lines between governmental agencies , it does not have a true champion .
" To NASA , it 's not fish , nor fowl , nor red herring – it's not our mission , " Mankins said .
NASA does not explore terrestrial energy sources , and the Department of Energy does not research satellites , according to Mankins .
" It has fallen neatly through the cracks , as it has for decades , " Mankins said .
He said that NASA 's development of space solar power would likely determine whether or not satellites ever send energy to Earth .
" Given how critical NASA is to all the space and related technologies required , it 's hard for me to see how it could happen " without NASA .
Arthur P. Smith , a physicist who has written about solar power from space for the American Physical Society ( PDF ) , said that interest in beaming solar power from satellites has waxed and waned since it was first proposed more than 30 years ago .
Smith said that research funding was highest during the oil crisis in the Carter administration , but after gas prices retreated the program was shelved for almost 20 years .
Pursuing solar power from space " should be part of our plan for energy independence , " Smith said .
He said that if NASA invested $ 10 billion in research over the next 10 years , the technology would likely become cost - effective enough to begin launching satellites .
Neville Marzwell , advanced concepts innovation technology manager at NASA , spent five years researching methods of improving a satellite 's ability to collect solar energy before his program was cut .
Marzwell claims that politics played a part in the decision to kill the space solar power program .
The United States " does n't have the political will to fund the research " because of pressure from fossil - fuel lobbyists , Marzwell said .
" We could have become the Saudi Arabia of the world electricity market , " Marzwell said .
But because the coal and oil industries do n't want threats to their profits , they applied political pressure , causing the program to be scrapped , according to Marzwell .
Auburn 's Brandhorst hopes that NASA 's emphasis on sending astronauts to Mars will lead to renewed interest in space solar power .
" For a time , exploration was a bad word at NASA .
Now it 's a mandate , " Brandhorst said , and the program should receive money because it " has clear repercussions for exploration . "
Finally , my street artist friend Posterchild is in NYC , and while he 's been there he 's been doing some guerilla gardening : planting trees in abandoned phone boxes and , similarly to the flowers he planted in Toronto , he 's been planting Canadian trees in abandoned NYC newspaper boxes .
What 's crazy is that he planted one tree in a box for a paper called The National , a box that rustily accepted his 75 cents twice : once to open it to measure the box , and once when he returned with the tree and the planter .
Post did some quick research and discovered that the reason
The National only cost 75 cents while most other papers cost more : this paper folded in 1992 .
This empty box , this garbage , has been taking up space on the street for sixteen years before he came along and did something with it .
Sixteen years , you guys !
There are people reading this comic who were n't even born when this newspaper box was dumped on the streets of NYC , left there by a company that did n't care to clean up after itself .
Most city governments do n't care about enforcing their bylaws about this sort of thing either , and nobody else noticed because these newspaper boxes are something we 've all grown to accept ( company trash on the sidewalk is the price of living in a major city , right ? ) and something we 've all learnt to ignore .
For sixteen years .
Anyway my point is trees and flowers planted in these here newspaper boxes are pretty cool
One year ago today : cut dialogue had t- rex being all , " ' prejudice ' is a boring word used by guidance counsellers and human resources managers .

I just found this this morning , en route to finding my old post , which I am simply reposting below .
Note the date on this new tag .
This is the most recent outgrowth of the Powell Memo , a hardline ultra-conservative memo from which the bulk of what we call the Culture War has sprung .
The Right does have intentions to harm liberals .
It 's inarguable .
It is only a matter of time .
If I and others are wrong about this then GOOD !
But I think not .
Forces are in motion .
The sort of people who WOULD put something like this on their vehicle are the talk radio / freeper sorts and they are being driven into a hate - filled frenzy by talk radio , the Sean Hannity 's , the O'Reillys , the Savages and other rightwing talk radio propagandists .
Their job is to magnify and perpetuate the bitter divisions in America .
Part of it is clearly hate - mongering , the other part is what I will call the " massaging on self - righteousness " , a huge part of what makes Bush supporters so impervious to reality .
They are constantly being told that God favors them and the US , that " we " - meaning " muricans " are doing God 's work ( as if somehow puny little humans could actually do such work ) .
They are d-e - l - us - i - o - n - a-l .
Although ostensibly a " parody " the sticker is both referring to an official " license " as well as being designed to " look official " , like a hunting or fishing license .
The stab at authenticity magnifies the delusional quality .
That said , it is a bit too much of a leap to suggest that wingnuts who put this sticker on their vehicles ( usually american - made fullsize trucks and SUV's ) think it actually allows them to kill people .
But it is one more " brick in the wall , one more bit of delusion - reinforcing paraphernalia that says " gays , unions , democrats , hangun controllers , news media , and hollywod types are bad , are against " murica " and show , beyong any doubt they buy the " Powell memo and GOP / Corporate propaganda " ( for it is all the same exact thing ) hook , line , and sinker .
The " May be used under the influence of alcohol " adds to the " targeting of a particular demographic " for the sales of such quaint little items .
I remember seeing a version of these deep in red-state Georgia ... on a big ol '
Ford pickup truck , dirty and beat - up , with a gun rack in it .
I think this is called " an accurate stereotype " .
It is a stereotype but it has it 's basis in reality .
Not all people with such pickup trucks and gunracks are dangerous , mean - spirited folk - that 's a nutty assertion , but there are a lot who are .
I have met them , had bad interactions with them .
The scariest and most irresponsible part of this is the unrelenting intention and effort to equate " liberals " with " terrorists " and to , as the NAZI 's did with the Jews " make this equation so unquestionable that people accept that killing them really is OK .
The purpose of this - and most rightwing propaganda - is to " turn of " thinking and reasoning , to make it comfortable for people to simply accept such thinking , and for it to make them feel good about themselves .
Bush 's speech at Fort Bragg was , in part , about this effect .
It is reassuring that it fell so flat , ( in technical vernacular , it produced no " bounce " ) but we know there are still an unpleasant number of people fist - pumping and saying " hell yeah ! " because they no longer question what they hear on the TV or from their precious talk radio .
For all the GOP blather about " the liberal media " it is they who have by far the lion 's share of media access and control and this has been the case since at least Reagan 's day .
The basic game is to complain about " liberal bias " and use this as a way to elbow into more repetition of the same conservative message inherently found in said liberal media .
Just try telling that to people who still support Team Bush .
They believe tv and bumperstickers over verifiable reality .
And that is what is so scary .
JP Morgan staff in line for bumper bonuses after investment bank posts ' blowaway ' profits of £ 2.25 bn
U.S investment bank JP Morgan is set to reward its staff with huge bonuses after it announced ' blowaway ' profits for the last quarter of the year .
The bank posted profits of $ 3.6 billion ( £ 2.25 billion ) , putting its employees on course for pay and bonus packages averaging around £ 300,000 this year .
The profits were much stronger than expected with the bank 's 4,000 London - based employees leading its recovery from the depths of the financial crisis .
So far this year JP Morgan 's investment banking staff have generated profits of almost $ 5 billion ( £ 2.1 billion ) .
The generous payouts will come as a shock to those who thought that the credit crunch had put paid to the era of bumper City bonuses .
Payout : Employees at JP Morgan will receive an average £ 300,00 after the bank posted bumper profits
City bank Goldman Sachs is expected to confirm tomorrow that bonuses will smash all records in 2009 , just a year after the Government rescued the financial system from oblivion .
The Wall Street giant is on course to lavish £ 14 billion on pay and bonuses on staff this year following a surge in profits between July and September , experts said .
The expected payouts , far bigger than estimated earlier this year , have been fuelled by a record rise in the stock market and a revival in huge mergers and takeover bids .
Goldman 's 5,500 UK workers are now set to pocket an average of almost £ 500,000 each for this year - the highest rewards in the firm 's 140 - year history .
High - flyers , such as UK boss Michael Sherwood , could earn bonuses stretching into eight figures .
The return to business as usual for the so - called ' Masters of the Universe ' of the Square Mile will anger the millions of families whose finances have been devastated by the financial crisis .
' Tens of thousands of traders and dealmakers at other City banks are also set to receive life - changing windfalls at the end of the year '
It will also embarrass Chancellor Alistair Darling , who has vowed to eradicate the culture of greed and recklessness that spawned the financial crisis .
Vince Cable , the Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrat , said : ' The Government has pontificated at great length but has done very little to curb excessive risk taking in the banking industry . '
Goldman will not pay out bonuses to staff until the end of the year after calculating how much money it has made during 2009 .
The bulk is expected to be paid in shares and could be staggered over a number of years .
To comply with new rules on pay , Goldman may also introduce provisions to reclaim payments that turn out to have been unwarranted .
Tens of thousands of traders and dealmakers at other City banks are also set to receive life - changing windfalls at the end of the year .
Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers last autumn , banks such as Barclays and America 's J P Morgan are earning much bigger profits from arranging financing for companies .
They are also earning vast amounts for helping recession - torn governments around the world borrow the money they need to stay afloat .
The renaissance in bumper bank pay was underlined by news that eight out of ten City bankers expect to receive a bonus at least on a par with last year .
In a survey to be published this morning , recruitment firm Morgan McKinley found that a mere 20 per cent of City workers are braced for a drop in their bonus this year .
Today 's results from Goldman are expected to underline how the survivors of last autumn's ' great panic ' are now pocketing extravagant profits .
Experts expect the U.S. giant will set aside as much as £ 4 billion extra for its pay and bonus pool after a jump in profits .
Goldman is expected to deliver earnings of £ 1.5 billion between July and September thanks to a boom on global stock markets .
The bank is also profiting from a wave of blockbuster cash calls by debt - laden companies .
Having advised clients to increase their borrowings during the boom years , Goldman is now banking hefty commissions for helping firms reduce their debt mountains .
Goldman is one of the Govern - ment 's favoured investment banks .
It earned millions from advising the Treasury during the ill - fated search for a private sector buyer for stricken Northern Rock , which eventually had to be nationalised in early 2008 .
At the current pace , Goldman is on course to pay out more than £ 14 billion in pay and bonuses to its 29,000 staff worldwide - double last year 's level .
That equates to more than £ 480,000 for every one of its 5,500 London - based staff .
Goldman declined to comment last night ahead of its results .
Mr Darling will today ask around ten leading foreign banks operating in the City to sign up voluntarily to a new framework for pay and perks .
Lockheed Martin ’s Skunk Works , famed for the U - 2 and Blackbird spy planes that flew higher than anything else in the world in their day , is trying for a different altitude record : an airplane that starts and ends its mission 150 feet underwater .
The Cormorant , a stealthy , jet - powered , autonomous aircraft that could be outfitted with either short - range weapons or surveillance equipment , is designed to launch out of the Trident missile tubes in some of the U.S. Navy ’s gigantic Cold War–era Ohio - class submarines .
These formerly nuke - toting subs have become less useful in a military climate evolved to favor surgical strikes over nuclear stalemates , but the Cormorant could use their now - vacant tubes to provide another unmanned option for spying on or destroying targets near the coast .
This is no easy task .
The tubes are as long as a semi trailer but about seven feet wide — not exactly airplane - shaped .
The Cormorant has to be strong enough to withstand the pressure 150 feet underwater — enough to cave in hatches on a normal aircraft — but light enough to fly .
Another challenge : Subs survive by stealth , and an airplane flying back to the boat could give its position away .
The Skunk Works ’s answer is a four - ton airplane with gull wings that hinge around its body to fit inside the missile tube .
The craft is made of titanium to resist corrosion , and any empty spaces are filled with plastic foam to resist crushing .
The rest of the body is pressurized with inert gas .
Inflatable seals keep the weapon - bay doors , engine inlet and exhaust covers watertight .
The Cormorant does not shoot out of its tube like a missile .
Instead an arm - like docking “ saddle ” guides the craft out , sending it floating to the surface while the sub slips away .
As the drone pops out of the water , the rocket boosters fire and the Cormorant takes off .
After completing its mission , the plane flies to the rendezvous coordinates it receives from the sub and lands in the sea .
The sub then launches a robotic underwater vehicle to fetch the floating drone .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) is funding tests of some of the Cormorant ’s unique systems , including a splashdown model and an underwater - recovery vehicle .
The tests should be completed by September , after which Darpa will decide whether it will fund a flying prototype .
