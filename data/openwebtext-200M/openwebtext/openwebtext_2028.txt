A Texas woman has been indicted on charges she allegedly sold her 15 - year - old daughter for $ US3000 ( $ 3600 ) to a man accused of child sex crimes .
Tina Valdez , 37 , reported her daughter missing to authorities in August , claiming the girl had run away and was searching for her father , Archer County Sheriff Ed Daniels said .
But last month , after US authorities had located and spoken to the teenager - who was in Mexico - Valdez told investigators she sold the girl , Daniels said .
The alleged admission came while police were interviewing Valdez about filing a false report about her daughter being a runaway , he said .
Kevin Egler is a teacher in Kent , Ohio .
To say the least , he is displeased with George W. Bush and the President 's performance in office .
So much so that Egler has placed more than 400 " Impeach Bush " signs around town , often on public property .
On July 25 , he got a ticket for placing one of them in a public garden .
He was cited for " unlawful advertising . "
Egler asked the police officer why he did n't have a right to place his sign there , but realtors can place their " For Sale " signs on public medians any time they want , the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported .
According to Egler , the officer said , " You do n't know the difference ? "
The officer did n't answer his own question .
But as Egler 's attorney , Bob Fitrakis , points out , the answer seems obvious : Commercial speech is permitted ; political speech is verboten , even though political speech is the most protected kind of speech under our Constitution .
This is discrimination on the basis of the content of speech , which is supposed to be against the law .
Egler had a court date on August 9 , and he brought with him " two dozen photos of other posters that appear to have gone unchallenged by the city , including announcements of poker tournaments , garage sales , and military recruiting drives , " the Plain Dealer reported .
In court , the city of Kent moved to dismiss the " unlawful advertising " charge against Egler .
But it did n't give up on its prosecution of Egler .
" I was offered a deal by the city today : Plead guilty to disorderly conduct and pay a $ 25 fine , or else they would file a littering charge against me , " Egler reported back to friends via e-mail .
" I feel I 'm not guilty of anything so we took the ‘ or else part ' of the deal . "
Now instead of facing a $ 100 fine , Egler could have to fork over $ 500 .
Egler appreciated the fact that fifteen free - speech and pro-impeachment activists showed up to support him .
" I had to chuckle to myself when we all filed out of the courtroom , " he wrote .
" The place was pretty empty after we all left . "

Welcome to a flame war with real bullets .
When computers are seized because they contain allegedly stolen intellectual property , or the security of anonymous remailers is pierced by police , alt.scientology .
war the days of the Internet as a cozy , private , intellectual cocktail party are over .
Welcome to mortal combat between two alien cultures - a flame war with real bullets .
Saturday , August 12 , 1995 .
The word goes out over the Net : a raid is in progress at the Arlington , Virginia , home of Arnaldo Lerma , Usenet poster and former Scientologist .
The raiding party is said to consist of ten people : two federal marshals ; two computer technicians , one of whom is former FBI agent and computer - security expert James Settle ; and several attorneys from the Church of Scientology .
One attorney is Helena Kobrin , known to many on the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion .
scientology through her postings demanding the deletion of files which she claims contain copyrighted material .
Another is Earle Cooley , a church lawyer who also chairs the board of Boston University .
They are taking Lerma 's computer , backups , disks , modem , and scanner .
Although persistent and passionate about his anti-Scientology crusade , Lerma is distraught over the intrusion .
Like many of us , Lerma keeps all his files , both business and personal , on his home computer .
The raiding party says he 'll have his equipment back by Monday .
Weeks later , he 's still waiting .
Lerma is not the first .
In February , similar raids were staged on Dennis Erlich in Glendale , California , and on anon.penet.fi , an anonymous remailer run by Johan Helsingius in Finland .
Then more - on Tuesday , August 22 , 1995 .
This time it 's two raids .
The target is FactNet , an anticult electronic library and archive based in Golden , Colorado .
One raid is on FactNet chair - and former Scientologist - Lawrence Wollersheim , the unpaid winner of a multimillion - dollar suit against the church .
The other is on FactNet director Bob Penny .
FactNet has been expecting a raid since early spring , and it long ago told Internet users to download as much of its archives as possible .
There are now FactNet anti-Scientology kits on websites all over the world .
With netters everywhere able to cut and paste them , transmit and download them , they become more and more difficult to track down .
It would take a lot of international cooperation and a lot of police power to get them all .
On the Usenet newsgroup at the heart of all this , alt.religion .scientology , posters who 've been critical of the religion are still worried .
The church has filed suit against The Washington Post for quoting material the church considers proprietary ; police have paid a visit to XS4ALL , a Dutch Internet service provider , to file for seizure of equipment ( at issue is the service 's anonymous remailer and the home page of a user who has posted Scientology materials ) ; and rumor has it there 'll be a raid on another netter any day now .
The popular bet for the next round is critic Grady Ward in Arcata , California , who has told the group his 74 - year - old mother was visited by a Scientology investigator .
The masses on alt.religion .scientology have started a pool to guess how many people will hit Ward .
Other users have reported mysterious incidents : investigators visiting their neighbors , strangers attempting to get into their telephone records , e-mail sent to their sysadmins asking that their accounts be closed down .
How did we get to this , in a free country ?
It turns out that a belief in free speech and an interest in Scientology may involve you in the bitterest battle fought across the Internet to date .
The story of Scientology versus the Net is not a tale of friendly nethead - to - nethead hostilities like 1993 's kittens - in - the - microwave flame war between alt .
tasteless and rec.pets.cats .
This is mortal combat between two alien cultures - two worlds whose common language masks the gulf between them .
A flame war with real guns .
A fight that has burst the banks of the Net and into the real world of police , lawyers , and armed search and seizure .
Ultimately , however , the drama does n't matter : the real issues here are the boundaries of free speech and the future of copyright and intellectual property in the face of a technology that can scatter copies across the world in seconds .
The Church of Scientology will not be the last organization , controversial or otherwise , that seeks to protect its interests against the Net .
Technology does n't care about the motives of its users .
In this story , everyone 's motives sound the same : all the participants believe they are benefiting humanity .
Scientologists genuinely believe their secrets can save the world , but that they must be doled out only to those who have proven ready to receive them .
Followers hold fiercely to the notion that their revered , secret texts must never be disseminated , save to the rigorously initiated , who pay tens of thousands of dollars to study them .
Critics insist the religion is a scam that seeks to take over the minds of its adherents and bilk them of huge sums of money by selling utter nonsense ; they feel that exposing these truths - and the secret texts - to the eyes of the Usenet - reading public is protecting that public from exploitation .
Whatever the motives , when computers are seized because they contain allegedly purloined intellectual property , messages are intercepted as they traverse the network , or the security of anonymous remailers is pierced by police , the days of the Internet as a cozy , private , intellectual cocktail party are over .
Welcome to real politics .
We hold these truths
Alt.religion.scientology was never a quiet newsgroup .
It was created on July 17 , 1991 , by Scott Goehring , who says he started the newsgroup half as a joke and half " because I felt Usenet needed a place to disseminate the truth about this half - assed religion . "
He forged the signature miscaviage@flag.sea.org onto the message used to create the group - a misspelling for church leader David Miscavige ( flag and sea refer to Scientology branches , known as orgs ) .
From the start , the group attracted both skeptics and believers .
While never coming close to agreement , the rivals managed to co-exist in the sort of tense balance the Net seems to specialize in .
They even hammered out a more or less stable agreement to have multiple FAQs - rather than the standard single list of frequently asked questions - to introduce newcomers to both sides .
While each side has criticized the other 's writings , there have been no serious attempts to interfere with the dual FAQs .
There has even been a certain tolerance for a particularly vehement Dutch poster who has declared most of the newsgroup 's participants to be Suppressive Persons ( SPs ) , the Scientology equivalent of excommunicates .
He calls himself Ron's Inspector and believes he 's telepathically in touch with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , who died in 1986 .
Hubbard was a pulp - fiction writer by trade .
His published books , monographs , internal - policy documents , and taped lectures form what the church calls its sacred scriptures .
The more advanced materials are closely guarded : Hubbard claimed that exposure to the secrets of an Operating Thetan , as the church refers to its acolytes , could harm , even kill , the partially initiated .
The church 's Net - related legal actions have all focussed on protecting the scriptures from disclosure .
These recent raids and suits have come after a long period of increasing verbal violence .
One of the first steps toward open warfare was the emergence , in about 1990 , of a group that wanted to separate the church and its scriptures .
Calling itself the Free Zone , this group consists of people who have left the church but still want to practice its teachings - use the tech , as Free Zoners say .
Ex Scientologist Homer Smith is one of these ( ex meaning " expanded , " not " former " Scientologist , says Smith ) .
Wanting to encourage serious discussion of the tech away from the noisy brawl next door in alt.religion .
scientology , Smith set up a second newsgroup , alt.clearing.technology , for this purpose .
Even then , a church critic nearly got there first .
Chris Schafmeister , a graduate student in biophysics at the University of California , San Francisco , perpetrated a Usenet prank : in some older Internet guides , you 'll read that alt.
clearing .
technology is for discussing acne cures .
Schafmeister was one of the first strident critics to join the discussion of Scientology on the Net , inspired by fliers on the walls of the UC San Francisco medical school .
He was , he says , " really , really upset " at the way these posters targeted the sick , the sad , and the bereaved to get them into US$ 60 Scientology courses .
Accordingly , he took to spending his study breaks arguing against the organization on Usenet .
Schafmeister was the first to find in 1994 that the church had more than a passing interest in the discussions taking place in alt.religion .scientology .
It was a Scientologist he'd befriended on the Net , he says , who gave him a copy of a letter from a church staffer named Elaine Siegel .
Appalled by its content , he promptly posted it on alt.religion .scientology .
Siegel identified herself as writing from the Office of Special Affairs International , which former insiders say is the church 's security branch .
Addressed to Scientologists on the Net , the letter suggested flooding the Net with positive messages about Scientology as a counter to criticism posted .
It said , in part , " If you imagine 40 to 50 Scientologists posting on the Internet every few days , we 'll just run the SPs right off the system .
It will be quite simple . "
She ended with , " I would like to hear from you on your ideas to make the Internet a safe space for Scientology to expand into . "
Church lawyer Helena Kobrin , asked later about the letter by e-mail , said , " Ms. Siegel 's letter was not an official church policy . "
Things might be different now if the church had said so at the time .
Through the summer of 1994 , the letter was copied , and its widespread circulation heated the debate to yet another degree , bringing a new constituency into the newsgroup : people who wanted to defend the Net against what they saw as a threat to their freedom .
Many of them knew nothing about Scientology except for that letter , and they were incensed .
Other arrivals knew a lot about Scientology , and were incensed for different reasons .
Chief among them was Dennis Erlich , who calls himself a minister and who provides " information and support to people who have been subjected to high - demand groups . "
He was a Scientologist for 15 years .
Erlich left the church in 1982 after what he describes as a failed attempt to reform it from within .
" That made me persona non grata , and they could n't work with me because I would n't follow orders anymore . "
He was declared an SP and has since devoted himself to debunking the church at every opportunity .
Several of the newsgroup 's old - timers say the tone changed when Erlich showed up in ' 94 .
He agrees - and he 's proud of it .
" People were discussing this stuff like it was some sort of tea party , " he says disdainfully .
His own views against the church are so vehement it's hard to imagine he could reach any sort of amicable agreement with Scientologists - or they with him .
His critical posts , with quotations from the church literature , turned alt.religion .scientology from debating club to battlefield .
Duelling cancelbots
Shortly before Christmas 1994 , messages started to mysteriously vanish from alt.religion.scientology .
The contents of the missing messages are not known today .
Many people believed they knew who was responsible , but gathering evidence and understanding what was happening were different tasks altogether .
Most Usenet newsreader software has built - in cancellation facilities .
These are simple enough : the poster sends out a cancel - command message , often containing a brief explanation for the cancellation , which propagates around Usenet from server to server .
The cancel command instructs the system to ignore the user 's previously sent post , identified by a unique code assigned to every Usenet post when written .
While the feature allows users to cancel their own posts , canceling somebody else 's message is a little more complicated : the would - be censor has to forge the message to make it look as though it came from the original poster .
It 's not that hard to do if you know how .
There are legitimate - or at least Net - approved - reasons for forging cancellations .
A loose collection of individuals known as the Cancelmoose , for example , removes spams , those mass mailings inappropriately posted all over the Net , usually for commercial purposes .
When spurred by complaints in alt.current - events.net - abuse , the Cancelmoose typically culls messages posted to more than 25 newsgroups of widely varying content .
Those who compose the Cancelmoose take open responsibility for their actions - in fact , they advertise them as a public service .
The cancellations on alt.religion .scientology , however , were different .
The messages that disappeared were sent to a single newsgroup , and no one ever claimed responsibility .
So , this being the Net , a program was developed to get a look at what was being canceled .
The program was called Lazarus .
Lazarus was another of Chris Schafmeister 's ideas .
It takes advantage of the fact that the header of every Usenet post - with the date , subject , sender , and a mess of other information packed in at the top of each file - is recorded in a general header log on a Usenet server and that every cancel command lands in a newsgroup called Control .
Schafmeister 's notion was that a program could scan the thousands of cancel commands posted in Control each day and compare them to the megalog of headers , specifically those that are routed to alt.religion .
scientology .
If Lazarus came up with a match , it would mean that a message headed for alt.religion .
scientology had been canceled .
Lazarus would automatically put up a note saying the message had been canceled , which would then propagate to all the Usenet servers , thereby alerting alt.religion.scientology readers everywhere .
It would be up to the original poster to reinstate the message if he or she wanted to .
Homer Smith took the idea and implemented it as a Perl script that is available to anyone on the Net , although it takes some skill to use .
" At least we can see when messages have been canceled , " says Schafmeister .
But Lazarus is limited : it cannot identify the CancelBunny , as the unidentified flying cancelers were disparagingly called .
When Lazarus began reporting that messages had been " CANCELLED BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT , " most on the newsgroup felt their instincts had been right - that the CancelBunny was one or more church representatives .
When asked in April about the cancellations , Helena Kobrin replied in an e-mail message : " In an effort to protect its rights , the Church has contacted several computer bulletin board operators in recent months who , when apprised of the illegal and offensive nature of the postings , agreed to remove the infringing materials from the Net . "
However , there has been no proof to support Kobrin 's claim that sysadmins have cooperated with the church by deleting postings from their boards .
" Just about everybody got hit , " wrote William Barwell , who signs himself Pope Charles .
" I had two posts canceled . "
It was Barwell who discovered a bit of law , United States Code Title 18 , section 2701 concerning " unlawful access to stored communications . "
The law includes provisions prohibiting unauthorized access to and malicious destruction of an electronic message ; it also prevents unauthorized access to or alteration of electronic communications .
Barwell felt all three of these applied to the forged cancellations .
At the beginning of March , Barwell wrote a letter to the FBI asking the agency to enforce the code , and he sent copies to Netcom , where most of the cancel commands were originating , as well as his own service provider , NeoSoft .
Later , Netcom closed the accounts of those canceling from its system , on the grounds that , having forged the cancellations , they were violating Netcom 's terms of service .
When a new spate of cancellations started coming from DeltaNet , a Southern California Internet service provider , accounts there were rapidly shut down as well .
Recently , the forgeries have become more adept .
The many postings this spring that appeared to come from London 's Demon Internet service were eventually traced to a site in Dublin .
When the cancellations continued through July and August , a team calling itself the Rabbit Hunters , or , more formally , the Ad- Hoc Committee Against Internet Censorship , which includes representatives from the US , Canada , and Germany , began some fancy technical investigating .
By comparing logs and monitoring news servers , the group believes it has finally traced the CancelBunny to the account of a Scientologist who posted prolifically early this spring .
Asked to comment on their claims , Kobrin did not reply .
You can't say that here
At the same time , the church was pursuing other options .
On January 3 , 1995 , about a week after the cancellations started , Johan Helsingius , the operator of the world 's best known anonymous remailer , anon.penet.fi , posted to alt.religion .
scientology a copy of a letter he had received from Helena Kobrin on behalf of Thomas Small , counsel for the Religious Technology Center and Bridge Publications Inc. ( copyright holder and publisher , respectively , of Hubbard 's work ) .
Kobrin wanted him to block access from his remailer to alt.religion .
scientology and alt.clearing.technology on the grounds that the remailer was being used as a conduit for copyrighted materials .
Four other anonymous remailers received the same letter .
On January 9 , Helsingius replied that monitoring postings is impossible , and that he did n't believe blocking newsgroups was appropriate .
On January 11 , Helena Kobrin posted a message in alt.config , the newsgroup in which users propose the creation of new groups in the alt .
hierarchy , and the deletion of old ones .
" We request that you remove the alt.religion . scientology newsgroup from your site , " she wrote , adding a list of reasons for her demand : ( 1 ) the group was started with a forged message ; ( 2 ) it was not introduced through the usual channels ; ( 3 ) its use of the name " Scientology " violates a trademark ; and ( 4 ) it " has been and continues to be heavily abused with copyright and trade - secret violations and serves no purpose other than condoning these illegal practices . "
The responses of the systems administrators were unanimous : forget it .
Enter the police
Meanwhile , back at the newsgroup , the name calling was growing vicious .
Bashers posted affidavits from former Scientologists alleging corruption ; Scientologists countered with affidavits alleging that the authors were known criminals .
One such response was signed by Erlich 's wife , Rosa , and alleged he had abused their daughter .
Erlich , not deterred , denied the allegations and went on posting quotations from church materials and his critiques of them .
Erlich 's Usenet feed comes from a small BBS in the LA area called support.com , which in turn gets its Usenet feed from Netcom , one of the largest Internet providers in the US .
The sysop of support.com , Tom Klemesrud , says that in early January , Helena Kobrin requested he delete Erlich 's Internet account , which he refused to do because the church could not provide him with specific proof of copyright infringement .
What follows sounds like a rerun of The Outer Limits .
In mid-January , Klemesrud reported a truly bizarre incident : he claimed his apartment was smeared with blood by a woman he'd met in a bar .
In Klemesrud 's version , this attack was meant to frighten him into closing Erlich 's account .
Klemesrud 's version of events did n't go unchallenged for long , however .
On January 23 , a poster signing himself - AB - from the address an144108@anon.penet.fi , an account on Johan Helsingius ' anonymous remailer , put up an opposing account , allegedly an interview with the woman in question , that claimed that Klemesrud was the attacker rather than the victim .
No one heard the ominous chords at the time , but in hindsight , netters believe this was the posting that precipitated the raid on anon.penet.
fi .
Nine days later , on February 2 , Helsingius was contacted by an American Scientology representative , who said that information from a closed , private church system had been made public through anon.penet.fi , and that the church had reported a burglary to the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI .
The representative wanted the identity of an144108 @anon . penet.fi , who had posted that material .
Helsingius refused , and was then told a request was on its way to the Finnish police .
The police arrived on February 8 , with a warrant .
Helsingius managed to give up only the single ID that the church wanted instead of his entire database of 200,000 .
He says that within an hour , he was told the information had been passed on to the church .
It 's unclear why the Church of Scientology was so anxious to track down this poster , who seems to have been defending the church against Klemesrud 's allegations .
From the church 's point of view , however , the posing seems to have constituted a grave security leak .
In an e-mail message , Helena Kobrin said of the anon. penet . fi raid : " The material that was stolen happened to relate to an investigation being conducted by the Church 's lawyers into false allegations about the Church that had been posted on the Internet by Mr. Erlich and Mr. Klemesrud .
These allegations centered on an incident involving a woman whom Mr. Klemesrud had met in a bar , which the investigation proved were completely unfounded . "
Asked if further action was being taken against the anon-poster whose identification was handed over , Kobrin said , " The matter is under investigation .
I cannot comment . "
The church , when asked who was undertaking the investigation , did not reply .
Drop that disk
On the day the Finnish police visited Helsingius , the Religious Technology Center and Bridge Publications filed a complaint in San Jose , California , against Dennis Erlich and his Internet service providers , Tom Klemesrud and Netcom .
The complaint states that Erlich had been posting church materials in violation of copyright and , in the case of the upper - level texts the church calls Advanced Technology , posting materials that were unpublished and confidential .
The church calls those " trade secrets , " and says that the issue is one of theft , not of free speech .
On February 10 , US District Court Judge Ronald
Whyte in San Jose issued a temporary restraining order against all three - Erlich , Klemesrud , and Netcom - commanding them to stop .
Erlich was outraged , arguing that all his postings are merely fair use .
" The most effective way I can discredit the cult is to use its own documents to show what they 're about , " he argues .
On February 13 , Erlich 's residence was raided .
Erlich claims his constitutional rights were violated by the raid , in which , he says , floppies , books , and papers were seized , files deleted from his hard drive , and his house comprehensively searched and photographed .
Afterward , two of his computers would not boot properly , and he was left with no backups from which to restore his system ; he was not given an inventory of the materials taken .
Thanks to the lobby efforts of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Erlich is being defended by the high - profile California law firm of Morrison & Foerster on a pro bono basis .
The temporary restraining order against Klemesrud and Netcom was quickly dissolved .
As both Klemesrud and Netcom explained , they cannot police the flow of information across their computers .
Even if Erlich has committed a crime , they say , to hold them responsible would be like charging the post office for complicity in mail fraud .
It would also bring to an end the Net as we know it .
In March , the church filed a motion to hold Erlich in contempt of court for reposting to alt.religion .
scientology one of the articles the church objected to in the first place - and it promises to pursue its action against Erlich vigorously , although by mid-August , the parties were still waiting for a ruling from Judge Whyte .
In a prepared statement about the Erlich case , Leisa Goodman , media relations director for the Church of Scientology International , wrote , " Numerous attempts had been made by the Church 's lawyers to persuade Erlich to halt his unauthorized , wholesale postings of the Church 's religious scriptures , which went way beyond the concept of ' fair use ' and constituted violation of copyright law . "
Later in the same statement , she wrote , " Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to steal .
Erlich 's attempts to misdirect and misinform the media are intended solely to divert attention from his own unlawful actions .
He has spread polemic and sometimes obscene messages about the Church over the Internet - also a smoke screen to divert attention away from his illegal activities . "
Like Erlich , Arnaldo Lerma , whose three - hour raid in Virginia this August left him profoundly shaken , has been described by the church as a copyright terrorist .
As of September 1 , Lerma is still awaiting the return of his equipment .
His service provider , Digital Gateway Systems , is also included in the suit .
In Lerma 's case , the bone of contention is a set of August 2 , 1995 , postings which contained the complete set of court documents from the LA case , Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz .
The gist of the documents - available from the LA federal courthouse - are portions of the Operating Thetan materials read into the record .
The church maintains the materials are still protected by copyright , even if they 're in the public record ; skeptics say there are no legal precedents to support this .
Either way , by now there are thousands of copies of these documents around the world .
On September 12 , Colorado Judge John Kane ordered the return of materials seized from FactNet directors Wollersheim and Penny while enjoining them from making further copies of Scientology materials .
On September 15 , Virginia Judge Leonie Brinkema followed suit .
The church is appealing both decisions .
Meanwhile , there is one poster , still untouched , the church would surely love to close down : Scamizdat .
Scamizdat 's postings - 11 to date - contain large chunks of the Scientology secret materials , up to 21 documents at a time .
Scamizdat posts anonymously through a chain of remailers ; when , in April , Helena Kobrin asked Homer Smith to identify the source of a Scamizdat posting sent through his remailer , Smith refused .
An alert sent around the Net that Scamizdat 's comments were wanted for this article elicited this message : " I am just a netizen fighting a litigious cult in the age of information .
While the Net has its own perpetual struggles among its orthodoxy and revisionists , it strobes into immobility lawyers and money that darken the battles in the ordinary world .
Once a representative portion of the Scientologist cartoon mythology is posted into undeniable digital immortality I will snow crash back into oblivion .
SCAMIZDAT . "
The talk goes on
Controversy creates popularity .
By late March , alt.religion.scientology was averaging 2,500 postings a week .
By August , it had crept up to 2,700 , with something to offend everyone .
Some of the fallout landed in alt .
journalism , news.admin.misc , comp .org.eff.talk , alt.current -events.net -abuse , and even , with the Scamizdat postings , hackers newsgroup alt .2600 - which was n't too thrilled at the newcomers , even though the group had to admit there 's something like hacking involved in anonymously posting secret scriptures .
By almost any measure - messages , volume , readership - the newsgroup is now one of the 40 most popular on the Internet .
Although messages still continue to disappear , some might think that attempts to censor the newsgroup as a whole have backfired - spectacularly .
Not Stu Sjouwerman , a Scientologist and part owner of a computer company who runs a closed mailing list for Scientologists .
Sjouwerman dismisses the newsgroup as " less than 0.002 percent of the whole Net.
Couple of dogs barking , that 's all . "
But former Scientologist Robert Vaughn
Young takes a darker view .
He does n't post to the newsgroup , but seems to be constantly aware of what 's going on .
Once a national spokesman for the church , he says frankly , " I am thankful I 'm not having to face the Net .
It 's going to be to Scientology what Vietnam was to the US . "
In the end , he says , " Their only choice is to withdraw .
They cannot win . "
The result , he thinks , will be " to create the first place in the world where Scientology can be freely discussed . "
If true , given that freedom of speech and freedom of religion have traditionally gone hand in hand , that would be a victory for everybody .

Scientology Texts and Information on the Web :
Ever wonder about a particular saying and where it came from ?
Have you come up empty handed ?
Are you stumped ?
Well look no further !
Some of the answers will have you saying " son of a gun ! "
I 've compiled a list of the phrases and words that I find most interesting .
Some of the sayings are hundreds of years old and their exact origins remain a mystery .
Opinions vary about the exact derivations of some , but I 've decided to include only the most interesting theories .
Check back soon for a bibliography .
raining cats and dogs -
If you 've corrected your child after he or she took this phrase literally , you may owe them a slight apology !
The origin of this saying dates back to the 1600s .
Poor drainage systems on buildings in the 17th century caused gutters to overflow , spewing out along with water , garbage and a few unexpected critters .
It is possible that animals such as rodents lived in the thatched roofs and when it rained heavily , the dead carcasses would fall undoubtedly unpleasant !
As far as large dogs falling from the sky ... well ... that one will have to remain a mystery .
to be stumped - Be stumped no more !
Being " stumped " comes from the pioneering days when the land was cleared to lay down train tracks .
When the workers came across a tree stump , it would cause a dilemma or " to be stumped . "
wrong side of the tracks - Before there were cars , trains were an important means of transportation .
Of course , pollution was n't a big concern so when a train rolled by , heavy black smoke and soot went with it .
Usually the wind blew the black smoke to one side of the tracks and only the poorest of people would endure living in that hard to breathe environment .
No one wanted to be on " the wrong side of the tracks . "
rule of thumb - No , this phrase is definitely NOT " P.C " !
Who knew ?
Some people think " Rule of thumb " is derived from the days when woman were sometimes beaten with a switch .
To be " kind " the switch could not be thicker than a thumb 's width .
This was made law in 1782 when an English judge stated that men were allowed to beat their wives but that the stick could not be thicker than one 's thumb .
There are other theories about the origin of this phrase .
Perhaps using ones thumb to measure a switch is folk lore after all ....
to propose a toast -
This often used phrase comes from an 18th century punch bowl drink made with cider , cinnamon , cloves , and other spices and garnished with pieces of toast that would float on top .
I 'm unsure of the purpose of the toast and can't imagine a burnt piece of bread being " decorative , " but next New Years Eve , do n't forget to include the toast !
Good Samaritan - comes from from the Bible ( Luke 10:30 - 33 ) , in which Jesus tells the parable of a priest who passes by a man in need of help , laying on the ground .
A Samaritan , who was part of the enemy tribe , helps the man up and back to health when the priest does not ... the message being that you should treat your enemy with the same good respect as your friend .
Other meanings can also be extracted , such as the golden rule : treat others the way you would like to be treated , and so on .
upper and lower case letters - I 've heard that the term started when letters were hand carved out of wood and were then laid out to be type set .
The letters were kept on a two shelves in the work space ... the big letters , or the upper case ones were kept on the top or " upper " shelf and the small or lower case letters were kept on the " lower " shelf to make it easy for the printer to keep things organized .
wrong end of the stick - If you imaged the most disgusting origin then you were right !
I 've heard two explanations that vary slightly .
One comes from the outhouse days when there were no flushing toilets and the other dates back much earlier , to the days of the Roman baths .
Regardless , the outcome was the same !
The person in the next stall may have asked for their neighbor to " pass the stick , " instead of toilet paper since that was yet to exist .
The stick had a sponge on one end and if the recipient grabbed the wrong end , they'd be getting the wrong end of the stick .
Most definitely unpleasant !
mad as a hatter -
This phrase comes from the days when felt hats were made using a mercury on some cheaper furs , that caused the hatter to go mad , thus the " mad hatter " in Alice In Wonderland .
Mercury poisoning caused tremors , brain damage , tooth loss , slurred speech , and more .
A " mad hatter " was one to be avoided .
I think the lesson to be learned is 1 ) do n't make your own hats and 2 ) do n't use mercury !
Everything but the kitchen sink - comes from World War
Two when everything possible was used to contribute to the war effort ... all metal was used for the U.S arsenal .
The only objects left out were porcelain kitchen sinks .
Does anyone still have a porcelain sink ?
big wig -
Picture a big puffy white haired gentleman and then you 'll be picturing a " big wig . "
This term is derived from powdered wigs worn by men in the 18th century .
The bigger the wig , the more wealthy the individual .
Who knows , perhaps someday wigs for men will go back in style !
son of a gun -
One version of this saying is that sailors traveling to the west Indies sometimes raped native woman on ships , which sometimes occurred between the cannons .
When a woman gave birth to a son , he was called " son between the guns . "
This term was used later , using the word " gun " to mean soldier .
His son would thus be called a " son of a gun . "
Other etymologists speculate that son of a gun meant an illegitimate son of a soldier , who would be nicknamed " gun . "
How " son of a gun " transformed into it 's current usage is unknown ... well I "ll be damned or " son of a gun ! "
do n't throw the baby out with the bath water - What 's one to do when they only have one basin of bath water and a litter of children to be bathed ?
Easy !
Use the same bath water and dump it out when your last child gets lost in it !
Back in the pre-running water days , the order of the household determined which family member got to take the bath first .
The man ( or head of the household ) naturally went first , followed by the children and the baby last .
The water would become so dirty that when a baby was bathed in it , he could possibly be lost or even tossed out !
Of course , one would hope that the parents would have enough common sense to check first !
cut to the chase - Remember going to watch those old black and white silent films ?
Sure you do !
Well , you 've probably heard of them , anyway .
In the black and white silent film movie era , in the 1920s , a chase scene was often the exciting part of the film .
Who really wanted to sit through that other stuff , anyway ?
Cut to the chase meant to cut the film , or edit it down to the good part , the chase scene no speaking necessary !
Twice , to my 16 - year - old thinking , her life was saved .
But when I grew up , I asked myself , saved for what ?
More misery , an increasingly bleak future with no hope for recovery ?
If I were in a similar position , would I want to be rescued ?

I can now understand the thinking of Betty Rollin ’s mother , Ida , who , at 75 , also had advanced ovarian cancer .
As Ms. Rollin told it in “ Last Wish ” ( Linden , 1985 ) , Ida was a loving , funny , delightful human being .
She was also a no - nonsense , take - charge person .
So when Ida ’s life had become a series of debilitating medical crises 
“ Every day is bad , ” she said  she asked her daughter to help her end it .
“ Mother , ” Ms. Rollin responded , “ is that really what you want  to die ? ”
“ Of course I want to die , ” Ida said .
“ Next to the happiness of my children , I want to die more than anything in the world . ”
And so Ms. Rollin embarked on a quest to find out how her mother ’s wish might be granted .
It took courage and perseverance .
But most of all , it took love , enormous love and respect for a woman who knew what she wanted “ more than anything in the world . ”
With the right prescription finally amassed , Ida died peacefully by her own hand .
When very sick patients receive symptom - relieving medical , social and emotional support now provided by palliative and hospice care , few persist in wanting to die before nature takes its course .
But even if such care had been available for Ida and my mother , it would not have restored either woman to a life she considered worth living .
Finding Dignity and Peace
Studies of dying patients who seek a hastened death have shown that their reasons often go beyond physical ones like intractable pain or emotional ones like feeling hopeless .
Often the reasons are existential  recognition that their lives have lost all meaning , concern that they have become an undue burden to their loved ones , desire to avoid a protracted death or distress about the time and money being “ wasted ” in prolonging their lives , which are destined to end soon , anyway .
Dr. Timothy E. Quill of the University of Rochester School of Medicine says he believes that there is an occasional need for an assisted death .
As he wrote in May 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine :
“ I recently helped my father to die .
He was an engineer , independent , always on the go and in charge .
He began to deteriorate rapidly from an ill - defined dementing illness , and his confusion and intermittent agitation did not respond to the standard treatments that were tried .
He had made his wishes clear about avoiding any prolongation of his dying , but now he had lost the capacity to make decisions for himself .

Campaign Mobilizes Impeachment Advocates
Sheehan pushes Democratic Party complacency
by Benjamin Terrall
Although it seems to have made little impression on the Democratic Party ’s leadership , grassroots pressure for impeachment proceedings against US Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush continues to grow in the US .
On Jan. 15 , the antiwar group Code Pink held a rally at the San Francisco Federal Building where they presented an aide to Senator Nancy Pelosi with more than 8,000 signed letters from US voters urging impeachment of Cheney and Bush .
Cindy Sheehan , whose decision to run as an independent against Pelosi in the next election was precipitated by the Democratic Congresswoman ’s refusal to support impeachment , spoke to the assembled protestors .
Sheehan , whose son Casey was killed in Iraq , said , “ I believe that when George Bush commuted Scooter Libby ’s sentence for a crime that he was complicit in , he committed treason .
A president can commute sentences , a president can pardon people but not when they are involved in the crime . ”
She continued , “ I believe that Nancy Pelosi committed treason when she took impeachment off the table .
You can not ignore our constitution .
And not only that , they have also been going against the constitution by approving torture , which goes against the Eighth Amendment , by approving spying on us without warrants , which goes against the Fourth Amendment . ”
Former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney , who is running for the Green Party ’s presidential nomination , appeared at the San Francisco demonstration and spoke in support of Sheehan ’s campaign .
McKinney said , “ People who betray the values of their constituents do not deserve to be part of the government .
The government , actually , is us ; it ’s supposed to be us .
McKinney added , “ We have an opportunity to learn from countries where people power has stepped up and through the power of the ballot they have changed things , like in Venezuela , like in Bolivia , like in Chile , like in Argentina , like in Ecuador .
They have changed things .
People power “ ¦ and so our campaign is called the power to the people committee , and we are asking people of every political persuasion to join with us in the creation of a new people power movement that can change our country , that can change the policies and the values of our country , and take our government back . ”
The day after the San Francisco rally , Representative Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) urged the House Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment hearings targeting Vice President Cheney for “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
Wexler said , “ In the history of our nation , we have never encountered a moment where the actions of a president or a vice president have more strongly demanded the use of the power of impeachment . ”
Wexler , a member of the Judiciary Committee , noted that though “ a growing chorus of American citizens are calling for this administration and this vice president to be held accountable “ ¦ the response from Congress thus far has been silence and denial . ”
Wexler ’s office set up a Web site for US voters to endorse the Florida congressman ’s call for hearings .
As of Jan. 16 , more than 189,000 people had signed on to the site ’s petition .
San Francisco Bay Area - based impeachment activist Brad Newsham , organizer of multiple “ Beach Impeach ” actions , told me , “ Wexler is the man of the moment in the impeachment movement .
Shortly after Wexler appeared on the Randi Rhodes show Thursday morning , his ‘ Impeach Cheney ’ petition cracked 200,000 signatures and has added nearly 10,000 since then . ”
Newsham emphasized , “ Pro impeachment phone calls and e-mails have been pouring in to the offices of members of Congress and Wexler has asked that we keep up the pressure ( especially on John Conyers ) . ”
At a Jan. 17 press conference , Speaker Pelosi responded to a question about her reluctance to hold Cheney ’s “ feet to the fire ” by insisting she was sticking to her long - stated view that “ an impeachment of the vice president or the president of the United States would be divisive in our country . ”
She added , “ The unity of our country is something that we all value , and that would not be in furtherance of promoting that unity . ”
I contacted Cindy Sheehan for a response to Pelosi ’s comments .
Sheehan told me , “ What George Bush and Dick Cheney have done with the cooperation of Congress is divide the country — this country is the most polarized it ’s ever been in my lifetime . ”
Sheehan said Congress needed to be focused on “ justice and a commitment to rule of law and the constitution . ”
About impeachment , she said , “ I do n’t know if it would bring unity to our country , but it would show our leaders are committed to the principles of the Founding Fathers . ”
Sheehan speculated that “ one of reasons for not digging too deep ” is the complicity of leading Democrats with much that is impeachable : “ Like in 2002 , Pelosi was briefed on torture . ”
Further , “ There ’s been a consolidation of power in one branch of government , and the Democrats know that , [ but ] think they can win and take advantage of that power when it becomes theirs . ”
Cindy Sheehan said in spring 2007 that if Pelosi agreed to support impeachment by July 23 , she would n’t continue to run against the veteran Democrat .
But now the maverick campaign is underway and Sheehan is meeting with housing rights , immigration , environmental justice and other activists throughout San Francisco , and her campaign is pulling in veteran Green Party and other progressive activist volunteers .
Sheehan told me , “ If [ Pelosi ] came out tomorrow to let articles of impeachment go forward , ” the campaign would continue .
“ We think the war and accountability are major issues , but we want and advocate for single payer universal health care , good and free or cheap education “ ¦ and want the environment cleaned up . ”
Sheehan especially stressed the need to push for environmental and economic justice in Hunter ’s Point , a traditionally African - American San Francisco neighborhood where a decommissioned naval shipyard doubles as a superfund cleanup site .
The area now faces accelerating gentrification and construction of a new 49ers stadium on toxic land .
Sheehan noted that these domestic concerns wo n’t be addressed “ when our government is spending $ 12 million an hour in Iraq “ ¦ our futures are being sucked dry . ”
She concluded , “ We need to solve the problem of militarism , especially the war in Iraq and Afghanistan , to solve pressing social issues . ”

The computing habit
Using computers becomes a habit , and after a while people forget how they , their organization , or their discipline ever did without them .
Computers are habit - forming and lead to electronic dependence .
Habit - forming is , of course , only a euphemism for addictive , and , indeed , computers are addictive in the most alarming sense of the word ; the first stage , in which it is no longer possible to function properly without them , is followed by the second stage in which the proper functioning becomes more and more threatened by the dependence .
Think , for instance , of the large organizations , totally dependent on hundreds and hundreds of ill - documented " existing programs " no one understands , dares to touch or to replace : the very fabric of which the organization has been built has become very fragile indeed .
( So much for the competence of the MBAs who have allowed this situation to develop . )
How should we react to this computer addiction ?
Should we fight it or should we exploit it ?
Fighting addiction is always a thankless task .
In this case , it would evoke opposition in the Department itself — faculty and staff feeling that their employment was in jeopardy — , it would evoke violent opposition in all other departments — which thought they did something smart by making computers an integral part of their research and their teaching — and it would not endear us to the computer industry — that these days is supposed to finance us — .
It is much less risky — and almost certain to evoke universal applause and support — if we aim at adding revolutionary new dimensions to the addiction .
We could , for instance , head for some sort of electronic LSD .
If we really wish to do a spectacular job , we should not confine our system to just a mainstream multimedia extravaganza , for our clients should see colours never seen before , should smell odours never smelled before , should hear noises never heard before , should experience orgasms of demoniac fear and spiritual power never experienced before : on order to communicate with the client 's inner self in a bandwidth truly without precedent , we should bypass the old - fashioned senses and the constraints of language in a direct interaction with the client 's nervous system .
Besides the above outstanding technical merits , this research proposal has the political advantage that , because of its obvious interdisciplinarity , it will position the CS Department at the very center of the UT Campus .
Needless to say , the project would be of enormous educational value for the Department itself : it would drive home the message that , if you really give your mind to it , anything can be considered Computer Science .

Babies born by planned Caesarean section are up to four times more likely to suffer breathing problems , researchers say .
They believe children delivered by Caesarean may miss out on vital hormonal and physiological changes occurring during labour and which are necessary for the lungs to develop .
The study is likely to raise concerns about the soaring number of Caesareans among mothers " too posh to push " , who want the convenience of a planned operation .
Scroll down for more ...
Up to one in three babies are now delivered by Caesarean section in some parts of the country - twice the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation .
Previous research has already shown that , while emergency Caesarean births can be life - saving , planned surgery is far riskier .
Mothers who elect for Caesareans are more likely to develop complications and spend twice as long in hospital as those having a natural delivery .
The study , published today online in the British Medical Journal , looked at 34,458 babies born between 37 and 41 weeks , and delivered between January 1 , 1998 , and December 31 , 2006 .
Some 2,687 of the babies were born by elective Caesarean section ( 7.8 per cent ) , 28,894 ( 83.9 per cent ) by normal delivery , and 2,877 ( 8.3 per cent ) by emergency Caesarean .
Factors which could affect the results , such as maternal smoking and alcohol intake during pregnancy , were also taken into account .
The study found 2.8 per cent of infants delivered normally at 37 weeks had respiratory problems compared to ten per cent of those delivered by elective Caesarean section .
At 38 weeks , the proportion was 1.7 per cent compared to 5.1 per cent .
At 39 weeks , it was 1.1 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent .
Dr Hansen , of the Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark - who led
the research - said it was once thought that when a baby comes down the birth canal , the lungs are " squeezed " into reflex breathing action .
She added : " We now believe when the mother starts labour , stress hormones in the baby rise , which leads to physiological changes .
" These include the disappearance of water from the lungs and production of surfactant , a substance which allows the lungs to function properly .
" Compared with infants delivered naturally , those born by elective Caesarean section had an increased risk of respiratory problems before 40 weeks .
" A nearly four - fold increased risk was found at 37 weeks and a three - fold increase in risk at 38 weeks , whereas the risk was doubled in infants delivered at 39 weeks ' gestation .
" Wherever possible , surgery should be postponed to 39 weeks in order to reduce the risk of breathing problems .
" This information should be taken into consideration by women contemplating an elective Caesarean section and by the obstetricians counselling them . "
In October , an Oxford University study found women could be four times more likely to die in childbirth if they opted for a Caesarean instead of a natural birth .
The review of more than 94,000 births showed that women who had a planned Caesarean put themselves and their babies at increased risk of complications .
Known risks to the mother include bleeding and infection , while babies are more likely to need specialist care .

Witnesses claim F - 16s chased flying saucer across Texas skies David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Dozens of eyewitnesses have reported seeing a mile - long UFO being pursued by fighter jets last week in the small town of Stephenville , Texas .
" It was very intense bright lights ... and they spanned a wide area , " said one woman .
Fox News interviewed Peter Hartinger of the Roundtown UFO Society in Ohio , who was reluctant to offer any conclusions but called the reports " interesting " and said that members of the Mutual UFO Network will be going down to check them out .
NBC News spoke with County Constable Lee Roy Gaitan , who offered a somewhat different description .
" I saw two red glows , " he said .
" They glowed and then they kind of faded and glowed again .
... I thought , boy , that 's just not right . "
Gaitan described the lights changing color , dancing around , and finally shooting away at an incredible speed .
" I never seen anything like that , never , " he concluded .
However , the Associated Press quoted Gaitan as saying , more cautiously , " I didnt see a flying saucer and I dont know what it was , but it wasnt an airplane , and Ive never seen anything like it , I think it must be some kind of military craft  at least I hope it was . "

For a few years , since I have been writing for Viewzone , I have wanted to tell a story - perhaps the most important story I have ever been a part of - but the staff here have resisted .
Viewzone is run on a shoestring budget , mostly on sweat and old fashioned journalistic zeal , but that kind of equity is vulnerable , especially when it is confronted by the most powerful forces on the planet .
But an odd thing happened today .
We had a staff meeting that was rather unusual and surprisingly sober .
The mood was kind of sad , like when the founder 's Dad suddenly died in a nursing home last year .
This time the death was not as personal , but it was more deeply felt .
Some of us here are old .
No , not quite ready for that nursing home , but old enough to remember the Beatles , Hendrix , the Vietnam War and Nixon .
Lately , a few of us have even been playing the old albums of Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young and wiping a few tears as we recalled the good days of free - loving and political indignance to a corrupt government that kept sending our classmates home in body bags .
The election of so many Republicans caused a kind of " Deja - vu " all over again , but this time there is no optimistic youth movement , no free - love and no indignance .
" Dan , do you still want to write ... you know what ? "
Owner , Vey asked me .
I was speechless .
" Because if you do , then ... well , damn go ahead !
What the hell . "
The somber mood broke , some coffee cups spilled , and tears of a different kind flickered in our eyes .
So what I am going to write about is something that happened here at Viewzone about four years ago .
We have all known about it and it has been eating away inside our guts like an digested bean burrito .
Finally , the time is pregnant to let it out , despite the danger .
So here goes .
The Winter of ' 98 Gets Even Colder
We started Viewzone in 1996 .
The internet was young and we were ignorant .
At first we published stories and articles that were based on our own interests , mainly for our friends .
In 1997 , owner Gary Vey learned how to access the statistics for the web site and shocked us all by reporting the we had a readership of about 150,000 people a month .
Hell , that could n't be right - could it ?
By the early part of 1998 we were receiving manuscripts and e-mails with story ideas and our readership had climbed to over one - million monthly readers .
That was truly amazing and it opened our eyes to the power of the internet .
At the time , the television show " X - Files , " with topics about UFO's and weird science , was at the top of the charts .
So were shows like " Sightings " and " The Unexplained . "
We rode on this popularity with a similar venue and we were all caught up in the seemingly endless unresolved phenomena that was all around us .
It was fun writing about aliens , the " face " on Mars and suppressed history .
We got literally hundreds of e-mails a day , mostly positive , and a good supply of story idea .
It was a magazine editor 's dream come true .
One evening I got a phone call .
I just happened to be in Viewzone 's Connecticut office because a cold and icy storm had made driving home impossible .
The caller asked for me by name and the connection was faint and wrought with static .
The caller asked me to please listen to him for a minute or two while he said what he had to say and asked that I not interrupt him .
He had a nervous voice and I pictured him to be in his late 20's .
I agreed and pressed the phone to my ear .
" Go ahead .
I can hear you . "
The caller said he was in Alaska .
He told me that he had read Viewzone on the internet and respected what we were doing .
He told me that he and a friend wanted to tell me something that I ought to write about - something that was both important and terrible , and that I would n't believe it unless I came to Alaska to see it for myself .
" Alaska ?... But ... "
" We are sending you a round trip ticket by FedEx .
We will meet you and take care of everything if you agree to protect us .
This is heavy stuff .
I will tell you a little about it when I send the tickets .
I hope I can trust you . "
His voice was trembling .
Suddenly there was a long pause .
" You still there , Dan ? "
" Yes .
Okay .
I agree ... but ... "
The line was dead .
Was this a prank ?
Who would do this ?
I picked up the phone to relate the incident to my best friend , thinking he would get a laugh from it , but I stopped .
There was something unusual in the man 's voice - fear - that made me decide to wait , at least for a few days to see if some tickets arrived .
Ship types for reference April 17 , 2016 by rodenbough
As in the real world , there are various types of naval and merchant ships in the civilizations in the galaxy that I deal with .
We have freighters , tankers and packets .
A packet is a passenger ship , just an old fashioned name for a liner .
Tankers haul liquids and gasses either in interplanetary or interstellar traffic .
Freighters haul cargo .
Military ships include tankerstankers , freighters and packets , ( called transports by the military ) tenders and other auxiliary vessels .
You will encounter in my writings various classes of warships .
The designations are to help the reader to understand what is going on .
The capital ships are Base Ships , Dreadnoughts and Battlecruisers .
Base Ships are armed mainly with strike and fighter aircraft which can operate in space or as conventional aircraft in the atmosphere .
Dreadnoughts are armed with the most powerful battery weapons and has the greatest shielding available .
Battlecruisers have Dreadnought firepower but has less protection than a Dreadnought .
The are , on the other hand , faster than a Dreadnought .
They are designed to run down enemy cruisers and destroy them and are ideal in commerce raiders .
As capital ships , they have true hyperdrive capabilities enabling to go star to star without using a star gate .
Cruisers come in heavy and light .
The difference being in the realm of firepower and protection .
Unlike capital ships , cruisers are Stargate dependant in interstellar travel .
An important province will harbor a cruiser squadron and less important province 's will have a flotilla of frigates and sloops with a light cruiser as a flagship .
Lighter warships are frigates , a large escort vessel and sloops which are smaller escorts .
Their task is to protect shipping in the system and escort heavier warships .
Corvettes are more lightly armed with FLAK batteries to protect against aerial bombardment of of the fleet or convoy .
The smallest escortpatrol vessels are cutters whic watch for clandestine activities such as smuggling , illegal migration and unauthorized slaving .( some civilizations permit slavery while others do not )
Siege vessels are Monitors and Ketches , light or medium vessels armed with heavier artillery than their hull types call for for the purpose of bombarding enemy emplacements and fortifications .
These ships can smash an asteroid , a moon or even a planet .
The difference between a ketch and a monitor is that a ketch is a frigate armed with a single battery of heavy cruiser armaments and a monitor is a heavy cruiser armed with a single battery of Dreadnought armaments .
Barges and pinnaces are unarmed landing craft .
A barge is large a pinnace is smaller .
Specialized ships s mercantile .

A Temple or a Tomb , Part 1 June 04 , 2014 by pokelover 218 Story I 'm working on at the moment .
I 've decided to take up a little writing beyond just system descriptions and planet descriptions .
This is told in Abbah NKD095 from an Edonian point of view , so look at the system for references I might make .
Hope you like it .

The few gems that I find fund missions like this one .
NKD095.15.45 is an Edon - like moon , with carbon - based life ..
Gravity is about 5 % lighter than my home planet .
We had made base camp on NKD095.15.45 's major continent .
That was when we found the structures .
The planetary survey had found this moon long ago , but it ’s only now that we were able to mount a real expedition to map the surface .
Our initial orbital survey , whose original goal was to find a suitable place for colonization , instead found a ton of archeological sites , so we picked the one closest to the equator and landed .
Now I ’m standing here in this canal , and I ’m looking at the most intact xeno - site I have ever seen on a planet .
OK , it ’s a large moon around a super gas giant .
It ’s smaller than Edon , and bigger than Encervis , so it is similar in size to most of the terrestrial planets in the system .
Of course , we find more intact finds on proper , vacuum scarred moons , but then that ’s to be expected .
“ Doctor Askvig , ” said Hanson , who was kneeling next to me , “ it ’s just …wow . ”
“ Yes , ” I replied , “ and that makes me worried .
Something this intact may mean that the previous inhabitants are still around … ” " Thompson , " said Hanson , directing his orders to the third member of our team , " are you recording any of this ? "
Thompson , engrossed in his DEX 's screen , only nodded .
He was as impressed as Hanson and I .
" What do you think it is , sir ? "
Hewey 's voice signaled his return from the recon mission around the canal .
" Well , Mr. Hewett , we wo n't know until we get a closer look . "
I replied , turning to face him .
" Did you locate a safe way down ?
We can't risk any injuries before the expedition has even started . "
Hewey nodded .
" I 've located an area of the canal wall that is not quite as steep .
We might be able to get some natural footholds in the cliffside . "
" Alright then , boys , we 're moving out " Hanson said , walking over to our small forward base on the cliffside .
The camp consisted of a few of my own men , but mostly consisted of soldiers .
In the jungle below , there might be lots of nasties to deal with .
Light filtered in through holes in the jungle canopy , giving the overall jungle a dim light , even though it was in the middle of the afternoon .
" Alright men , " Hanson adressed his troops , " spread out .
I want the entire area secure as we move torward our ruins .
Hewey ,
Toby , you scout on ahead .
Stay in sight . "
Various replies of " yes , Commander " were spoken , and our hired security force spread out .
" Thank goodness the Republic supports expeditions like these , eh Doctor ? "
Thompson called over to me , constantly recording our expedition on his DEX .
I grinned at his comment .
President Elise , after coming into office , took an intrest not in expansion of territory , but instead expansion of relations with our allies and the aquirement of new knowledge .
Many recent xenoarcheological expeditions had been sponsored not only by the Board , but by the government itself .
We finally arrived at the first structure .
It was the base of a huge stone arch , one of many that we saw from above .
I gave the orders to stop , and my team examined the arch .
" Doctor , I 've found something that I think might be of intrest . "
Dalton and his brother , Benett , were staring up at the arch .
" What , Dalton ? " I looked up as well , trying to follow their gaze .
" Carvings . " said Benett , pointing up to help me find it .
I saw what they were saying .
Huge carvings were etched into the stone , some covered by foliage or weathered away .
" They look like Ancient Edonian in appearence . "
I said , bringing out my DEX to call up the files I had on Ancient Edonian writing .
For all of you who do n't know , the EP002 Encyclopedia Series DEX is a handheld electronic encyclopedia device .
Its function is to provide a designated individual with information and advice regarding known locations , people , cultures , and etc. in the Galaxiki .
Almost everyone owns one , making it easy to acess information .
Sure enough , the files on my DEX were almost identical to the carvings before us .
" Graham , do you know what these mean ? " I asked .
Graham Norwell , the leading expert on ancient language in my team , pushed up his glasses and looked up at the wall .
" Let 's see ... "
His eyes were squinted in concentration .
" It looks like that one is a G...N...E..A.... Hmm , interesting . "
Graham was one of my closest collegues , and friends .
And an ' intresting ' from him was signifigantly more than just intresting .
" What is it , Graham ?
Something unexpected ? " I was excited .
Ancient Edonian meant that we had stumbled upon something from our own ancient past .
Although , how did it get here ?
As far as my knowledge went , I had no record on a Lucius gate connection to here .
" Well , Doctor , the writing seems to indicate that the letters I said out loud to you are part of a name .
And there is only one prominent ancient Edonian with that name that I can think of . "
I inhaled sharply , " You mean , Gilnea ?
One of the mortals of ancient times believed to have ascended to godly status ? "
Gilnea is mostly a mythical figure .
No one is quite sure if he was a god or not , or even if he actually lived or not .
Graham looked over at me .
" Based on the other words surrounding it , I believe this arch marks one of two possibilities - a temple to Gilnea , or , if we are lucky , his tomb . "
" If this is Gilnea 's tomb , it will be the find of the decade , if not the century ! "
Thompson exclaimed , busy snapping pictures of the arch and writing .
I grinned again , looking around at my collegues and our security team .
" Lets get ready to go then .
We have a ruin to find ! " first story science fiction Edonians 0 Comments - Read comments - Leave a comment

Kala 's Hunting pt 3 March 19 , 2013 by danansan
The curiosity shop is in the Old Quarter on Truce , and it ’s very , very old .
Dates back four thousand years , according to its owner .
How he came into possession of it is something no one can agree on .
I heard from a Riv that it had been won in a game of triangle two - hundred years ago , but Lyan told me the owner had bought it for two drinks and an imaginary spaceship three - hundred years ago .
If you asked the owner , he would just smile knowingly , and wink .
I entered to the clear ring of a bell .
The shop was cluttered , with little figurines and blinking devices covering every inch of the shelves and posters plastered all over the walls , but it seemed deserted .
Suddenly there was a nasally voice from the back of the shop , where I could n’t see .
“ Forgive me Kraz na Karan .
I ’ll be with you in a moment . ”
No one knows much about him .
Only that he ’s a Sillak , that he ’s short and fat with fur made white by age , that he ’s owned a curiosity shop for as long anyone can remember , and that he knows things .
He opened his arms in greeting .
“ Kala my dear , I have n’t seen you since that unfortunate business at Octars . ”
I did n’t embrace him , of course .
“ It ’s been too long Greenstone .
I need to find someone . ”
His face , and arms , fell .
“ No one ever seems to want to just talk , ” he said as he bustled over to close the shutters , “ Everyone is always looking for this person or that person , but it ’s never Greenstone they ’re looking for . ”
He turned the shop sign from to ‘ closed ’ .
“ Now , who do you want ? ” “ Laaros Reeowin , ” I said , before adding “ The slaver . ”
“ Would n’t want to fly in on Laaros Reeowin , the Knight from Green Groves , would we now ? ” he said as he approached a poster of some ancient politician , “ Though our good friend the former slaver is a Knight as well , these days . ”
What the fuck was this ?
“ Former slaver ?
Knight ?
How in the name of the King does that happen ? ”
Greenstone pulled the poster aside and began entering numbers to the lock of the safe behind .
“ Our man found himself good friends with the new baron of New Age , who magnanimously knighted him and gave him a letter of marque . ”
“ What did they bond over ?
Torture and murder ? ”
This changed nothing .
“ Triangle , ” he said , pulling a data chip from the rows of hundreds inside the safe , then slamming it shut .
“ Sir Laaros is now a respectable privateer , raiding shipping over Neo Zion for the profit and glory of New Age , and their benefactors in Greeosta - Leeona of course . ”
I gestured towards the data chip .
“ Flight records , right ?
How much ? ”
After some haggling , I paid him ten - thousand silear , and made to leave , data chip secured in my pocket .
“ You know , you ’re not the first person to come asking about Laaros Reeowin these two months , ” said Greenstone as I put my hand on the door knob .
I slowly pulled my arm back .
“ Who ? ” I asked , reaching for my wallet .
“ No , no , ” he said with a false bow , “ This is for our friendship .
Six weeks ago , I was visited by a Canthin who asked about Sir Laaros .
He would n’t say who he worked but … ” he grinned and tapped the side of his head , “ I have my ways . ”
The smile disappeared and he looked straight at me .
His eyes were very old and I could tell he was very serious .
“ The Silver Swords want him Kala .
They ’ve rebuilt their numbers to over four - thousand hulls , and something tells me Fury Kreeoa would take a Kraz ’s head over a deserter ’s . ” I laughed .
“ He calls himself ‘ Fury ? ’
I wonder if he really thinks it ’s intimidating .
Did you give this Mella the records ? ” Greenstone shrugged .
“ He had coin .
The Silver Swords will be flying straight for him . ”
I took a pace forwards , and looked his dead in the eye .
“ I does n’t matter .
At Octars his father had ten - thousand hulls and twice the tactical brain , and he still lost a fifth of his fleet and his own head .
“ Now Greenstone gave a low , rasping laugh .
“ Do you really think that a battle thirty years ago will help your fifty ships defeat four - thousand ? ” I stopped .
“ Kreeoa wo n’t send his entire fleet for the sake of a hundred deserter vessels . ”
“ Wo n’t he ?
My sources say that he is a very angry young man , as the name suggests .
In fact , ” Greenstone moved across to the shop counter , “ There ’s a slave I think you would be very interested in . ”
“ We do n’t do slaves , ” I snapped .
“ Of course not .
I misspoke . ”
He opened the till and put the cash in .
“ A former slave .
Quirus Lain , a Zionite , who fled from the Swords at Krees Whole about a year ago .
He was the personal slave of old Teerow Kreeoa for about thirty years before Octars , and has been the same for Fury since then . ”
He looked at me earnestly .
“ You ’ll find him with Ral of the House of N'thrak on Raw Ot Dne at the edge of the system .
Speak to Quirus , Kala .
Speak to him and go back to Kraznus .
I have no wish to see you dead . ”
“ I ’ll think about it , ” I said , then left the shop .

Kala 's Hunting pt 2 March 10 , 2013 by danansan Chapter 1
The last place we could put Reeowin was in New Age , which he had just conquered as part of the fleet of the Little King of Gretza - Leona or some such place .
He had received a large payment in gold and slaves , and pressed several free captains into his service .
Our intel had him taking the voidgate to Zeron , and presumably he Lonied from there to parts unknown .
This was about four years before we departed , so he could have been anywhere in the galaxy by then .
I decided that the best course of action was to pursue intel from a friendly port .
So we Darked out of Kraznus to the black hole Lanneret .
From there we arrived in Peace some hundred - an - twelve days later .
Of course I talked to the Commander ( of the Defence Force ) , expecting just a formalised wave through for our ships .
But … something was n’t right .
I know … knew …
Messeret Dalcoran well .
Back when I was commanding the Tar Baby under Lyan Lariz in the ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s I drunk with him dozens of times in The Golden Treaty on Ceasefire .
So I knew he was on edge .
He would n’t let our ships in .
I had to keep all forty - seven of them in formation at the edge of the system and take the White Heart in on his own .
Dalcoran would n’t even give shore leave for the rest of the ships , so I had ten thousand pissed off Kraz to deal with as well .
It was strange .
Defence ships were everywhere , and there were far fewer traders than I expected .
I was in the Peace at the height of the Bastard ’s War , and even then things were n’t as on edge .
I could n’t think what was causing it .
The only on - going conflicts since the end of that New Age business were the usual small fare between the littlest of the Little Kings .
So I radioed Dalcoran again , and asked him to meet me for a drink in The Golden Treaty , for old times ’ sake .
I do n’t know if you ’ve all been to Peace , so I guess I should tell you , for context , that the orbit of the gas giant Armistice is the busiest thoroughfare in known space .
You ca n’t land any but the smallest ships on the two moons , Truce and Ceasefire , so mostly you have to orbit your ship and shuttle back and forth .
But everyone comes to Truce , everyone from Windstari and Ganite traders to the sons of Little Kings to Riv mercs , to see the legendary sights , or do business in the only real , safe international trading post on the Grid .
Lyan once told me that during the Thirty Year Peace he saw one million vessels orbiting Armistice .
That ’s probably bullshit but even so , after the Bastard ’s War , seeing a full hundred thousand hulls was n’t particularly unusual .
When we got to orbit there were less than four thousand ships there .
That ’s lunacy .
That ’s dead .
Hell , when I took my shuttle down to Ceasefire I even got landing clearance in less than an hour .
Dalcoran was waiting for me .
He was sitting at a table in the far corner , nursing a pitcher of Ganite ale .
I went to the bar and ordered a Breekinburg .
The girl behind the bar was a Zionite , with beautiful white wings and a nice smile .
“ I did n’t know you drunk those , ” said Dalcoran as I sat down opposite him , “ They ’re a little strong for my taste . ” I sipped the cocktail .
“ I had one down in Zion space and know I ’m hooked .
And their strength is the attraction .
Gives a real kick . ” I put it down .
“ Does n’t last long , of course . ”
There was an awkward moment silence .
“ How ’s Vallara ?
And the kids ? ”
“ The kids are fine .
Tilly ’s working for the parliament now .
I sent Vallara back to Praggis . ”
He stared into his beer and swirled it slowly .
“ There ’s a war coming Kala , ” he said slowly , like he was confessing a dirty secret .
“ That ’s nothing new , Messeret .
War ’s always coming . ”
He shook his head .
“ I do n’t mean – what is it you Kraz say ?
– Little Wars for Little Kings .
I mean a big war , bigger than the Bastard or Breekinburg maybe .
I ’m not the only one who thinks it either .
You saw the system , it ’s empty . ”
He grabbed his pitcher and downed the whole thing .
“ They know it ’ll start here .
There ’s at least ten Canthin fleets in striking distance of us right now . ”
“ The Mella have attacked here before , ” I told him , “ You know , you ’ve beaten them back every time . ”
“ Aye , I know .
I ’m just afraid that soon some damn fool will be stupid enough to actually succeed . ”
He sighed , and gripped the empty pitcher .
“ Why are you here Kala ? ” he asked suddenly .
“ To start a war man , ” I said .
He laughed bitterly .
“ I ’m looking for someone , ” I told him , “ Laaros Reeowin , a slaver .
You know him ? ” Dalcoran thought for a moment .
“ I remember he fought at Octars … Flies with the Silver Swords does n’t he ? ” “ Not for seven years . ” I finished my drink and stood up .
“ It was good to see you again , Messeret . ”
We shook hands .
“ I ’ll tell Vallara hello when I visit her , ” he said .
I nodded , and left .

Sixty years ago five of the world 's best photographers set up legendary photo agency Magnum .
One of the five was Henri Cartier - Bresson , who aimed to tell a story in a single frame such as with Muslim women praying in India , 1948 .
Amazon recently announced their latest web service , SimpleDB , to a roar of buzz and hype .
I finally got a chance to sit down and read through the docs and blog posts , and like with the Facebook Data Store API , I ’ve written up my thoughts .
Amazon ’s docs do a pretty good job of describing SimpleDB , so I wo n’t try to reproduce them .
Instead , I ’ll focus on observations , and I ’ll emphasize a few important points that are buried deep in the docs .
The executive summary is : I like it .
It ’s solid , straightforward , and eminently useful .
Sure , it ’s limited .
It includes design decisions that clearly simplified the implementation at the cost of functionality and usability .
Still , as a result of those decisions , SimpleDB has the potential to be very robust , scalable , and performant .
With SimpleDB alongside S3 and EC2 , Amazon ’s web services look more and more like the Unix philosophy : small , simple tools that do one job , do it well , and fit together in ways that complement each other .
Very , very cool .
Then again , I ’m a sucker for anything based on tuplespaces …
Contents
Introduction
Tuplespaces !
Queries
Attributes and ordering
Scaling and Dynamo
Usage - based pricing
Introduction
SimpleDB is a simple , schemaless structured storage engine .
It stores items , which are bags of key / value pairs .
Keys and values are always strings ; primitive data types like integers and floats are not natively supported .
Developers choose a unique string name for each item at creation time .
The primary operations are Put , Get , and Delete – which are self explanatory – and Query , which accepts attribute predicates and boolean operators in a custom string query format and returns all matching items .
Items are partitioned into domains .
An item ’s name must only be unique within its domain .
Similarly , queries only return items from a single domain .
Tuplespaces !
One of the coolest things about SimpleDB is that its interface is pure tuplespaces , also known as Linda .
( Thanks to Nelson , who was one of the first people to point out this huge piece of SimpleDB ’s provenance . )
The tuplespaces concept never spread too far beyond of research , but I ’ve always loved it , and I ’ve had “ build tuplespaces on top of a DHT ” on my list of project ideas for years .
As long as I get to play with it , I do n’t care if Amazon beat me to the punch .
After all , they can afford a few more servers and sysadmins than I can .
There are at least a couple noticeable differences between SimpleDB and standard tuplespaces interfaces .
First , most tuplespace implementations only support equals and wildcard query operators .
SimpleDB offers inequality , prefix , and boolean operators , which it probably supports with extra secondary indices .
Second , most tuplespaces implementations offer at least limited support for transactions , in the form of an atomic “ update ” operation that can remove existing tuples and add new ones .
SimpleDB has no such operation , nor any other support for transactions .
Queries
SimpleDB uses a a minimal , string - based query language .
It ’s best described by example .
Here ’s one from the docs that will return all blue items that cost less than 14.99 :
" [' Price ' < ' 14.99 ' ] intersection [ ' Color ' = ' Blue ' ] "
It ’s interesting that Amazon went with a custom , proprietary query language , as opposed to a subset of SQL like Facebook ’s FQL .
Again , it almost certainly made it easier for them to develop , but it raises the learning curve for developers , not to mention contributing to lock - in somewhat .
Luckily , since all attribute values are strings , they avoid the issue of serializing non-string values and operands .
I ’ve used a decent number of ORMs and database libraries , and this always tends to be a wart .
It can definitely be done safely , and somewhat cleanly , but it ’s always awkward .
Apart from the query language , there ’s no support for joins , full text search , or sorting query results .
I doubt I ’d miss joins , but I ’d definitely miss full text search and sorting .
I expect that sorting alone will be one of the largest pain points for developers who try to use SimpleDB as a replacement for a standard RDBMS .
Finally , separate from the utilization - based pricing SimpleDB imposes a hard deadline on query execution time .
If a query takes longer than 5 seconds , it ’s cut off .
Tough love , but reasonable .
Attributes and ordering
Like in tuplespaces , SimpleDB attribute names and values are untyped strings , so comparison is always lexicographic .
That simplicity is endearing and attractive at first glance , and it almost certainly made SimpleDB easier for Amazon to develop .
Unfortunately , it causes problems for numbers , dates , and composite types like points , which are n’t compared lexicographically .
To their credit , Amazon does explain how to zero - pad numbers and offset negative numbers , and their libraries include code that handles these operations .
Still , no matter how you look at it , jumping through those kinds of hoops is ugly and awkward , for both data access and presentation .
Worse , developers will need to write custom code to map to / from lexicographic ordering for any non-numeric types , such as points and dates .
It does n’t help that the SimpleDB docs themselves have lots of examples of numeric comparisons that are n’t offset or zero-padded .
Apart from ordering , attribute values are limited to 1024 characters , which is way too low .
I can understand that they want to encourage developers to use S3 for binary data , but articles , comments , and other text data is often much larger than 1024 characters .
It would be infeasible for many apps to store and access that data separately from the rest of their data , which could prevent a number of applications from using SimpleDB as their only structured storage engine .
Finally , it ’s worth noting that all strings are UTF - 8 , including domains , item names , attribute names , and values .
It ’s what you ’d expect , but it took me a fairly long time to find that tidbit in the docs .
Scaling and Dynamo
SimpleDB is almost certainly originally seemed to be based on Amazon ’s Dynamo , a distributed hash table that ’s highly replicated and available in exchange for a relatively low churn tolerance .
That link is from Amazon ’s CTO Werner Vogel ’s blog , where he said :
Let me emphasize the internal technology part before it gets misunderstood : Dynamo is not directly exposed externally as a web service ; however , Dynamo and similar Amazon technologies are used to power parts of our Amazon Web Services , such as S3 .
Dynamo ’s key characteristic is that it really is just a DHT , so its only operations are put , get , and delete .
In particular , it does n’t provide secondary indices .
So , if SimpleDB was based on Dynamo , how would SimpleDB be queries executed ?
Maybe they ’d use a modified full text index … but then you ’d expect SimpleDB to offer full text search , which it does n’t .
Hmm .
One useful hint is that SimpleDB only guarantees eventual consistency .
( Thanks to Ken for pointing this out . )
Evidently , items and indices are replicated , and the replicas are updated asynchronously .
That ’s a big , big caveat for developers , but it helps us start to reverse engineer the architecture of their storage and indexing engine .
Personally , I wonder if SimpleDB ’s indexing is based on a full text conventional index that ’s augmented to support structured data , similar to Google Base or eBay ’s search engine .
if so , I ’m sure Amazon has its reasons for not ( yet ) offering full text search over SimpleDB domains .
Usage - based pricing
The pricing model for SimpleDB is very interesting .
Similar to S3 and EC2 , SimpleDB charges for bandwidth and usage .
However , SimpleDB also charges for machine utilization , measured in normalized CPU - hours .
This makes sense from a cost modeling perspective , but it ’s surprisingly hard to implement in the storage engine .
The particularly impressive part is that SimpleDB includes machine utilization in the response to every API call .
Wow .
Measuring utilization can be hard in general , but it ’s even harder in real time .
As we know , there are 2 kinds of iTunes movies : Protected and Unprotected ( Videos , movie , TV shows , etc. purchase from iTunes Store are usually protected M4V files ) .
For unprotected iTunes videos , it 's easily to burn them onto DVD discs with regular DVD burners .
However , for protected iTunes M4V movies , you can't burn them to DVD unless you remove the DRM protection first .
Note : Aimersoft Video Converter Ultimate for Windows can help you burn both protected and unprotected iTunes video to DVD while the Mac version can only create DVDs from unprotected iTunes files .
Senators want to know if waterboard authorizers are criminals Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday February 13 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Two Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting that the Justice Department 's internal watchdog investigate whether Bush Administration officials who authorized waterboarding are guilty of any crimes themselves .
Sens. Richard Durbin ( D - IL ) and Sheldon Whitehouse 's ( D - RI ) request comes as the CIA and White House finally admitted the use of waterboarding , and as Attorney General Michael Mukasey is standing with the Bush administration in refusing to open an investigation .
The senators say that Mukasey 's refusal on grounds that the Justice Department had authorized the simulated drowning technique did not answer whether the authorizations themselves were legal .
In a letter sent Tuesday to the Justice Department 's Inpsector General and Counsel for Professional Responsibility the two wrote : Waterboarding has a sordid history in the annals of torture by repressive regimes , from the Spanish Inquisition to the Khmer Rouge .
The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime .
The Judge Advocates General , the highest - ranking attorneys in each of the four military services , have stated unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Yet , despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal , certain Justice Department officials , operating behind a veil of secrecy , concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful .
We believe it is appropriate for you to investigate the conduct of these Justice Department officials .
As you know , a similar investigation is underway regarding Justice Department officials who advised the National Security Agency that its warrantless surveillance program is lawful .
The Bush administration 's long delayed admission of engaging in waterboarding comes as it works to prosecute suspected 9/11 conspirators before a military tribunal .
Although Mukasey and others in the administration insist waterboarding is not currently used by the CIA or military , the White House view is that President Bush could reauthorize the practice if he saw fit .
Congress failed last year in its attempt to force the CIA to comply with the US Army Field Manual 's standards on interrogation , which prohibits waterboarding .
In an interview with the BBC Tuesday , Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia defended the government 's right to engage in severe interrogation techniques and detain suspected terrorists indefinitely .
The White House and CIA have acknowledged waterboarding three detainees in 2003 , including alleged 9/11 matermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ; however recent developments have brought into question its legality and Mukasey has refused to make a straightforward determination of its legality or illegality , the Washington Post reports .
The government 's defense of the waterboarding episodes , laid out in congressional testimony and administration statements over the past two weeks , relies on a complex legal argument that many scholars and human rights advocates say is at odds with settled law barring conduct that amounts to torture , at any time or for any reason .
It also leaves open the possibility that , under the right conditions , the CIA could decide to use the tactic again .
[...]
In Senate testimony last month , for example , Mukasey emphasized that while waterboarding might be prohibited under some circumstances , it might be allowed if it did not " shock the conscience . "
That phrase was coined by the Supreme Court in a 1952 ruling against police brutality , which provoked criticism because it imposed an inherently subjective due- process standard .
But it was implicitly embraced in legislation approved last year .
Mukasey described the matter as " a balancing test of the value of doing something as against the cost of doing it , " and refused lawmakers ' demands that he render an absolute verdict on its legality .
Fratto , in remarks to reporters last week , amplified the point by asserting that waterboarding could be legal if the government believed it was under imminent threat .
But many legal experts say that such a " sliding scale " approach applies only to proscriptions against cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , which ranks a step below torture in U.S. and international human rights law .
Philip B. Heymann , who was a deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration and now teaches at Harvard Law School , said the Bush administration is " trying to act as if they have wiggle room even if they do n't . "
" There 's a plausible argument that there 's a sliding scale , but only if you have arrived at the position that it's not torture , " Heymann said .
" There is no sliding scale for torture . "
Sens. Durbin and Whitehouse asked the Justice Department IG to investigate :
* Did Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful perform legal work that meets applicable standards of professional responsibility and internal Justice Department policies and standards ?
For example , did these officials consider all relevant legal precedents , including those that appear to contradict directly their conclusion that waterboarding is lawful ?
Did these officials consult with government attorneys who are experts in the relevant legal standards , e.g. Judge Advocates General who are experts in the Geneva Conventions ?
Was it reasonable to rely on standards found in areas such as health care reimbursement law in evaluating interrogation techniques ?
* Were Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion ?
What role did White House and / or CIA officials play in deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding ?
The senators said they wanted the results of such an investigation to be open to the public , and they requested a response from the IG in one week .
' Half of Pakistanis suspect govt agencies for Bhutto 's death '
January 12 , 2008 23:20 IST
Nearly half of all Pakistanis suspect that government agencies and politicians allied to the administration were responsible for the assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto [ Images ] , according to a survey released on Saturday .
Fifty - three per cent of respondents in the poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan also said Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party had made the right decision by choosing her 19 - year - old son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as its new chairman .
Asked who had killed Bhutto , 23 per cent said they suspected government agencies while another 25 per cent said they suspected politicians allied to the government .
Al Qaeda [ Images ] or the Taliban were suspected by 17 per cent , while 16 per cent suspected other external forces , principally the United States ( 12 per cent ) and India ( 4 per cent ) .
In response to a question about involving foreign investigators to probe the assassination , 46 per cent said it would be right while 30 per cent said it would be wrong .
Another 24 per cent said they did not know .
Bhutto assassination : Musharraf denies involvement
Gallup said the poll was carried out in two rounds .
The first round was conducted shortly after Bhutto's assassination from December 30 - 31 .
The second round was carried out from January 6 - 8 .
The survey covered over 1,300 men and women in all four provinces of Pakistan and had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points .
Former premier Nawaz Sharif was given the highest rating of 62 per cent in a question about the handling of the assassination by political leaders .
Jamaat -e - Islami leader Qazi Hussain Ahmad was at the second place at 28 per cent , followed by president Pervez Musharraf [ Images ] in third at 24 per cent .
Gallup also said the grief at Bhutto's assassination was ' almost universal ' in Pakistan and was ' observed across provincial and linguistic boundaries as well as political and socio- economic divides ' .
The endorsement by the former president is crucial to McCain as he tries to capitalize on the potential advantages of being the nominee .
George H.W. Bush to endorse McCain
Former president George H.W. Bush will endorse Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in Houston on Monday during a media availability at 9:30 a.m.
Texas time , Republican sources say .
President Bush will be in Africa at the time .
He told “ Fox News Sunday ” last weekend that he would help make the case for McCain ’s conservative credentials as soon as there was an official nominee .

The endorsement by the former president does two things that are crucial to McCain as he tries to capitalize on the potential advantages of being the nominee when Democrats are still fighting it out :
— It begins to make former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee look like he ’s not being a team player , raising expectations that he should drop out or run a quieter campaign .
— It also undercuts Republicans who are reluctant to fully support McCain because of his past differences with the party ’s right wing .
The father 's endorsement follows former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 's decision to back McCain .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had warm relations with both men and had hoped their endorsements would ignite his candidacy , which he ended last week .
The Texas primary is March 4 .
3 . Wo n't it take forever for you to fall in ?
Wo n't it take forever for the black hole to even form ?
On my worldline as I fall into the black hole , it turns out that the Schwarzschild coordinate called t goes to infinity when I go through the event horizon .
That does n't correspond to anyone 's proper time , though ; it 's just a coordinate called t.
In fact , inside the event horizon , t is actually a * spatial * direction , and the future corresponds instead to decreasing r.
It 's only outside the black hole that t even points in a direction of increasing time .
In any case , this does n't indicate that I take forever to fall in , since the proper time involved is actually finite .
At large distances t * does * approach the proper time of someone who is at rest with respect to the black hole .
But there is n't any non-arbitrary sense in which you can call t at smaller r values " the proper time of a distant observer , " since in general relativity there is no coordinate - independent way to say that two distant events are happening " at the same time . "
The proper time of any observer is only defined locally .
A more physical sense in which it might be said that things take forever to fall in is provided by looking at the paths of emerging light rays .
The event horizon is what , in relativity parlance , is called a " lightlike surface " ; light rays can remain there .
For an ideal Schwarzschild hole ( which I am considering in this paragraph ) the horizon lasts forever , so the light can stay there without escaping .
( If you wonder how this is reconciled with the fact that light has to travel at the constant speed c-- well , the horizon * is* traveling at c !
Relative speeds in GR are also only unambiguously defined locally , and if you 're at the event horizon you are necessarily falling in ; it comes at you at the speed of light . )
Light beams aimed directly outward from just outside the horizon do n't escape to large distances until late values of t .
For someone at a large distance from the black hole and approximately at rest with respect to it , the coordinate t does correspond well to proper time .
So if you , watching from a safe distance , attempt to witness my fall into the hole , you 'll see me fall more and more slowly as the light delay increases .
You 'll never see me actually * get to * the event horizon .
My watch , to you , will tick more and more slowly , but will never reach the time that I see as I fall into the black hole .
Notice that this is really an optical effect caused by the paths of the light rays .
This is also true for the dying star itself .
If you attempt to witness the black hole 's formation , you 'll see the star collapse more and more slowly , never precisely reaching the Schwarzschild radius .
Now , this led early on to an image of a black hole as a strange sort of suspended - animation object , a " frozen star " with immobilized falling debris and gedankenexperiment astronauts hanging above it in eternally slowing precipitation .
This is , however , not what you 'd see .
The reason is that as things get closer to the event horizon , they also get * dimmer * .
Light from them is redshifted and dimmed , and if one considers that light is actually made up of discrete photons , the time of escape of * the last photon * is actually finite , and not very large .
So things would wink out as they got close , including the dying star , and the name " black hole " is justified .
As an example , take the eight - solar - mass black hole I mentioned before .
If you start timing from the moment the you see the object half a Schwarzschild radius away from the event horizon , the light will dim exponentially from that point on with a characteristic time of about 0.2 milliseconds , and the time of the last photon is about a hundredth of a second later .
The times scale proportionally to the mass of the black hole .
If I jump into a black hole , I do n't remain visible for long .
Also , if I jump in , I wo n't hit the surface of the " frozen star . "
It goes through the event horizon at another point in spacetime from where / when I do .
( Some have pointed out that I really go through the event horizon a little earlier than a naive calculation would imply .
The reason is that my addition to the black hole increases its mass , and therefore moves the event horizon out around me at finite Schwarzschild t coordinate .
This really does n't change the situation with regard to whether an external observer sees me go through , since the event horizon is still lightlike ; light emitted at the event horizon or within it will never escape to large distances , and light emitted just outside it will take a long time to get to an observer , timed , say , from when the observer saw me pass the point half a Schwarzschild radius outside the hole . )
All this is not to imply that the black hole can't also be used for temporal tricks much like the " twin paradox " mentioned elsewhere in this FAQ .
Suppose that I do n't fall into the black hole -- instead , I stop and wait at a constant r value just outside the event horizon , burning tremendous amounts of rocket fuel and somehow withstanding the huge gravitational force that would result .
If I then return home , I 'll have aged less than you .
In this case , general relativity can say something about the difference in proper time experienced by the two of us , because our ages can be compared * locally * at the start and end of the journey .
The current version compiles into MzScheme and structurally is as much a skin on MzScheme as a separate language .

That sentance originally read “ Paul ’s relentless self - promotion . ”
I wrote that as a reflection on what people perceived to be the case , but I should have been more explicit , thus my edit .
Paul challenged this .
Paul is an essayist , he distributes his ideas and , in a sense , promotes the ideas and not himself .
That is very true .
It is also true that David promotes Rails and Steve Jobs promotes iPods .
The perception of a large number of people — and this article is about those people , not about Paul specifically — is that promoting your ideas is exactly the same thing as promoting yourself .
These things are not particularly rational .
Well , you recall my mentioning how real life is a lot like high school .
The latest manifestation of this is an “ Arc backlash . ”
In case you have n’t seen it , Arc is a programming language designed by Paul Graham and ( I think ) Robert Morris .
Actually , it ’s a Lisp dialect , so in some respect , you can probably claim that it is n’t a new language at all , just Paul and Robert doing what Lisp programmers have always done .
Now technically , there is not much to Arc at the moment .
The language ’s own site admits as much :
So , what we have here is someone who promotes the language in his essays , then releases a version that fails to transmute lead into gold .
And immediately , there was much rejoicing .
Seriously , I said .
There is a distinct tone of schadenfreude to the commentary that is going around .
There is much talk of people being “ disappointed , ” but I have a felling these folks complaining would have had no interest in trying Arc no matter what form it took .
I have read the argument that expectations for Arc were high .
What does that mean , exactly ?
That there were people holding off on trying a new language because they were waiting for Arc ?
Has Paul spread FUD to prevent people from using Scala or Haskell ?
Why are n’t people shrugging their shoulders ?
Honestly , if you do n’t have any career or business capital invested in Arc , what could you possibly care about whether it is more or less than what you imagined it might be ?
The response to Arc reminds me very much of the alleged “ Ruby on Rails backlash . ”
Quite a bit of the energy behind the RoR backlash is resentment against David Heinemeier Hansson for daring to promote his web development framework .
Stepping forward and aggressively attempting to change the world is something we humans claim to admire , but we have complicated rules for how you are supposed to go about it .
We want more Steve Wozniak , less Steve Jobs .
We want people who blink in surprise at the TV cameras and the limelight of fame , not people who seek it out .
It ’s easy to understand why .
Although we seem to have complex motivations — some of us after technical mastery , some of us after money , some of us after sexual partners , some of us after land holdings — most of what we do can be traced to standing within our social group .
We are social animals , and almost everything we do is connected to the complexities of aligning ourselves with some folks and distancing ourselves from others in our tribes .
Although I dislike the show , I would offer Survivor as being a true mirror of human nature .
We spend most of our time voting each other off the island .
Live the early stages of Survivor , we play a complex game where we have to think about both our overall welfare and also about our standing within the tribe .
The shy , quiet genius who invents things we can use without promoting himself is an asset to us .
He helps our tribe in battles against other tribes without jeopardizing our own standing in the tribe .
Whereas the self - appointed hero may indeed help our tribe , but in doing so he vaults ahead of us .
That ’s why Matz is so well - regarded : he is quiet and unassuming .
His behaviour poses no threat to our own place on the ladder .
Whereas David is eager to step forward and change the world .
His technical contribution to the world of Ruby is at least as valuable as the creation of the language itself , and it is not obvious to me that the world of Ruby would benefit if David had n’t vigourously promoted Rails .
But nevertheless , we are eager to see David “ cut down to size , ” just as we criticize Steve Jobs while praising Woz .
Which brings me back round to Arc.
Paul ’s behaviour is now drawing the inevitable response .
I personally think it is almost irrelevant how much technical strength the language may have had , there has been a noticeable anti-Paul tone on many programmer forums for quite some time .
And what is at the root of it all ?
Resentment against what some people think is relentless self - promotion .
Resentment against his occupying a place above us on the nerd social ladder .
I do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with feeling that way , if you choose .
We are humans , and it is folly to pretend otherwise .
Social behaviour matters .
But if that ’s what it is , let ’s “ Call a spade a spade ” and not pretend that we are disappointed with Arc .
Let ’s be up front and say that we are angry with Paul for daring to elbow us aside on his climb up the ladder .
Let ’s admit that we want to be the admired one .
And let ’s admit that even if Arc had cured cancer , we would still resent Paul .
It ’s just that we would have been forced to bide our time , to wait for him to stumble on something else .
Just as we are still waiting for Apple ’s stock to fall and for Rails to fade into obscurity .
The anxiety and aggression that result from social isolation have been traced to altered levels of an enzyme that controls production of a brain hormone .
The study , done in mice by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine , is reported in this week 's online addition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We use this animal model for human stress because social isolation in both animals and humans can be responsible for a range of psychological effects , including anxiety , aggression and memory impairment , " said Dr. Erminio Costa , director of the UIC Psychiatric Institute , professor of biochemistry and one of the authors of the study .
Previous studies had suggested that the neural pathways that underlie aggression , anxiety and fear include activation of specific types of neural circuitry that leads into the amygdala , the region of the brain responsible for emotion .
The researchers looked in these types of neurons for changes in the levels of two enzymes that are needed for the production of allopregnanolone , a brain hormone that acts to reduce stress through regulation of GABA , an important neurotransmitter .
They found that the level of one of the enzymes , called 5 - alpha - reductase type I , was reduced nearly 50 percent in the lonesome mice .
Levels of the other enzyme did not change .
The researchers suggest that the decrease of 5 - alpha - reductase type I and the consequent reduction in the hormone may impair the function of circuits leading to the amygdala and explain the aggressive behavior , perhaps related to anxiety , in socially isolated mice .
" Humans respond to similar stress in very similar ways , " said Dr. Alessandro Guidotti , UIC scientific director and professor of biochemistry in psychiatry .
" By identifying the mechanism we may be able to identify drugs that can treat these effects of stress . "
UIC researchers Roberto Agis - Balboa , Dr. Graziano Pinna , Fabio Pibiri and Dr. Bashkim Kadriu also contributed to the study .
The work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health .
Pibiri was supported in part by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Regione Autonoma della Sardegna , Italy .
UIC ranks among the nation 's top 50 universities in federal research funding and is Chicago 's largest university with 25,000 students , 12,000 faculty and staff , 15 colleges and the state 's major public medical center .
A hallmark of the campus is the Great Cities Commitment , through which UIC faculty , students and staff engage with community , corporate , foundation and government partners in hundreds of programs to improve the quality of life in metropolitan areas around the world .

George Bush likes his sleep .
While campaigning for the presidency in 2000 his prize possession was a feather pillow .
On the night that Saddam Hussein was executed he went to bed at 9 pm with strict orders not to be woken .
When the then CIA director , George Tenet , tried to alert him to news of the first night 's bombing of Iraq he was sent away .
" He is the type of person who sleeps at 9.30 pm after watching the domestic news , " Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Abdullah told Okaz , a Saudi newspaper .
But one can't help wondering if Karl Rove 's resignation might not disturb his slumber for his remaining months in the White House .
Rove , Bush 's consigliere for the past 30 years , left last week in much the same manner as he had stayed : misleading the public .
He told the nation that he wanted to spend more time with his family .
Maybe he should have checked with his family first .
His only son leaves for college in just a few days .
Rove is leaving because there is nothing more for him to do ; Bush is letting him go because he no longer has any use for him .
His departure effectively marks the end of the Bush presidency - from hereon in Bush 's tenure is about keeping the troops in Iraq and as many of his administration out of handcuffs as possible .
Last week Fox News asked the neocon commentator Charles Krauthammer how much time Bush had to promote his agenda .
" None , " said Krauthammer .
" It 's over .
There is no agenda . "
But while the left loves to revel in Bush 's woes , it invariably revels in the wrong woes .
Bush 's problem is not that he has failed on our terms - humanism , equality , peace and democracy - but that he has failed on his own .
True , his low approval ratings reveal a president approaching Nixonian lows .
But then , unlike Nixon , Bush has never craved popularity .
He pushed through most of his most pernicious legislation after having lost the popular vote in 2000 .
This is a man who understood 51 % of the vote in 2004 as an overwhelming mandate .
" I 'll reach out to everyone who shares our goals , " Bush said .
" I earned capital in the campaign , political capital .
And now I intend to spend it .
It is my style . "
True , too , that the Iraq war is going badly .
But then it has never been going well , and that has never seemed to bother him either .
He has described himself as " the decider " , but never " the contemplator " .
This too is his style .
In any case the Bush agenda was always more far - reaching than anything that can be accounted for by mere polls , war , or the loss of human life .
The ultimate aim of his presidency was to realign American politics to cement a conservative electoral majority for a generation .
The cornerstone of his domestic agenda was to build on the Republicans ' traditional base of evangelists , southerners , white men and the wealthy , by winning over Catholics , married white women and a sizable minority of Latinos with a mixture of policies and pronouncements on immigration , homophobia , abortion and social security .
Bush did not create the partisan split in America ; he inherited it , just as Al Gore would have if he had won the supreme court case in 2000 .
But while the split was broad ( the difference was less than 5 % in 13 states from New Mexico to New Hampshire ) , it was Bush who made it deep and rancorous .
For unlike Thatcher or Reagan he sought to achieve his ends not by exploiting division in order to forge a new , more rightwing consensus but rather to exploit new divisions in order to crush a growing consensus .
The majority of the country was , for example , pro-choice and in favour of granting equal rights to gay couples in almost all areas .
So the Bush administration chose to leverage gay marriage and late - term abortion - two issues that could act as a wedge - to rally his base .
Crude in execution and majoritarian in impulse , it sought not to win over new converts but simply to mobilise dormant constituencies .
His legacy will be rightwing policies - but not a more rightwing political culture .
That his agenda should have failed so completely should come as no surprise .
The project was always , at root , a faith - based initiative .
Following the Republican congressional victory in 2002 Rove was asked to comment on the fact that the nation seemed evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats .
" Something else is going on out there , " he said .
" Something else more fundamental ...
But we will only know it retrospectively .
In two years , or four years or six years , [ we may ] look back and say the dam began to break in 2002 . "
With no discernible material basis on which to build , this new majority at home and new world order abroad had to be fashioned from whole cloth .
A Bush aide once ridiculed a New York Times reporter for belonging to " the reality - based community " , which he defined as people who " believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality " .
" That 's not the way the world really works any more , " he said .
" We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality - judiciously , as you will - we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors ... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "
So here we are studying .
The coalition crumbled .
In 2006 Catholics backed the Democrats ; white women broke even .
According to a Wall Street Journal poll , Americans would prefer the next president to be a Democrat by 52 % to 31 % .
Meanwhile , the presumptive standard bearer for this new majority is treated like a pariah .
As the Republican hopeful Mitt Romney pressed flesh in a restaurant in Manchester , New Hampshire , a few weeks ago , Muriel Allard said : " We need someone like him .
They do n't care about us over there . "
At a town hall meeting a couple of hours away in Keene , another Republican contender , John McCain , was asked last month if it was n't time to put a " warrior in chief " in the White House rather than these " draft dodgers " .
Bush 's name never came up .
" Friends who were obnoxious in their praise for him just do n't mention him any more , " says Rick Holmes from Derry .
" He 's like the embarrassing uncle you just do n't want to talk about . "
A sense of doom among Republicans is palpable .
A growing number of Republican congressmen - most recently the former house speaker Dennis Hastert - have announced they are to retire , or are considering it .
" Democrats will win the White House [ and ] hold their majority in the house and in the Senate in 2008 , " the retiring congressman Ray Lahood told the New York Times .
There is even talk that Republicans might not invite Bush to their convention .
" If they 're smart , no , " the Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio told Newsweek .
" Especially if things do n't change in Iraq , we 'll have the problem the Democrats had in 1968 with Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam .
The question becomes : where do we hide the president ? "
Bush could run , but he can't now hide .
Rove showed Bush how to win elections , but he could n't show him how to govern .
For the next year and a half he may need more than a feather pillow to get him to sleep .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Solar power will be a bright investment prospect as the appetite for green energy grows , even though the global credit crisis is making banks more wary of providing financing .
In the short term , the sector will also have to contend with a shortage of silicon , a key ingredient for solar cells that turn sunlight into electricity , and possible changes in political support as elections take place .
“ This year will be a very volatile year , ” said Sven Hansen , chief investment officer at clean technology investor Good Energies , which has about 7 billion Swiss francs ( $ 6.38 billion ) under management .
“ The industry will see fantastic growth , but it will be a bumpy ride in terms of how financial markets value photovoltaic companies . ”
The number of new large - scale solar energy plants has been growing rapidly particularly in sun-drenched countries like Spain and Italy , but also in Germany and the United States , where regulatory conditions offer incentives and stable returns for investors .
Conditions could change because of a presidential election in the United States and general elections in Spain in March .
“ Whether there are support programs in place has a strong impact on markets ’ development , ” Hansen said .
Growth is still expected to be strong , driven by increased interest from institutional investors , such as pension funds and insurers , which are seeking alternative stable and long - term opportunities .
Experts also expect the silicon shortage to ease next year as silicon makers hike up capacities and production .
“ Leverage ratios are more difficult , but we will ride out the storm .
The business is not shut , ” said Peter van Egmond Rossbach , director of investment at Impax Asset Management .
The firm provides finance for renewable energy projects around the world and has $ 2 billion under management .
Thirty percent is invested in solar , 40 percent in wind and the rest in other renewable energy projects , it said .
“ It just means that ( project financing ) is getting more expensive and we have to bridge with equity , ” he added .
RISK AVERSION
Tighter liquidity on global financial markets resulting from a crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market last year has made banks more risk - averse .
As a result , conditions have become tougher , pushing up interest payments for loans and other financing costs , which reduces the cashflow and leads to higher purchase prices for investors .
" We notice it in the purchase prices , " said Barbara Flesche , head of equity sales at Epuron , a project developer , which is fully - owned by German solar group Conergy CGYG.DE .
Epuron develops , finances , develops and operates large - scale renewable energy projects , bringing together investors , banks and equipment producers .
It has completed deals worth about 800 million euros ( $ 1.18 billion ) since 1998 , it said .
Banks were less willing to provide high gearing for such major projects , which dampened investor hopes of a higher return on equity , Flesche said .
But she added : “ The risk for purchase prices is not something that ’s hurting us dramatically -- so far . ”
Flesche said demand from institutional investors for such large - scale renewable portfolios was still strong and was now also reaching into new markets such as Turkey , Greece or Italy .
“ It will become more difficult to get bank financing , but not impossible , ” Epuron ’s Flesche said .
The European Photovoltaic Industry Association ( EPIA ) expects the global market to be five times bigger than it was in 2007 within the next five years .
It said it expected annual installations to reach a 10.9 gigawatt peak by 2012 globally , up from a peak of about 2.2 gigawatts in 2007 , adding that annual growth rates of well above 25 percent could be expected .
The European Energy Council has forecast that by 2010 about 1.6 percent of total energy generation will derive from photovoltaic sources , which compares to a share of 0.01 percent in 2003 .
By 2010 the council expects about 19 percent of generation will derive from renewables , 15 percent from nuclear and 66 percent from fossil sources .

As Bruce notes below , George Piro , an FBI agent who was Saddam ’s sole interrogator , will be on Sixty Minutes this Sunday :
Saddam Hussein initially did n’t think the U.S. would invade Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction , so he kept the fact that he had none a secret to prevent an Iranian invasion he believed could happen .
The Iraqi dictator revealed this thinking to George Piro , the FBI agent assigned to interrogate him after his capture .
Saddam still would n’t admit he had no weapons of mass destruction , even when it was obvious there would be military action against him because of the perception he did .
Because , says Piro , “ For him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant Saddam .
He thought that [ faking having the weapons ] would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq , ” he tells Pelley .
He also intended and had the wherewithal to restart the weapons program .
“ Saddam ] still had the engineers .
The folks that he needed to reconstitute his program are still there , ” says Piro .
“ He wanted to pursue all of WMD … to reconstitute his entire WMD program . ”
This included chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , Piro says .
I ’ve long believed claims about how “ Saddam was bluffing ! ” and “ Saddam was going to restart his WMD programs the second our back was turned ! ” were bogus .
( For instance , see here and here . )
I may have to reevaluate .
However , based on just the Sixty Minutes teaser , I remain skeptical .
Here ’s why :
1 . The US recorded all the interrogations of Saddam .
I have a hard time believing if there were sections that would make Bush look good , we would n’t have seen them .
2 . There ’s no evidence for any of this .
Despite what CBS says , of course , Saddam “ admitted ” over and over and over again that Iraq had no WMD .
Iraq said it in dozens of UN declarations , and Saddam personally said it on Iraqi national TV and in an interview with Dan Rather .
And there ’s no indication he took any specific action to bluff the US or Iran in some way ; on the contrary .
The CIA Duelfer report is also extremely vague about any direct statements of intent by Saddam about his future intentions .
The most it provides is this : “ During a custodial interview , Saddam , when asked whether he would reconstitute WMD programs after sanctions were lifted , implied that Iraq would have done what was necessary . ”
This interview was almost certainly conducted by Piro .
Meanwhile , the Duelfer report also provides direct statements by underlings that Saddam repeatedly told them Iraq would NOT reconstitute its WMD programs if the UN followed through on its declared intention to create a mideast “ zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery . ”
So it ’s possible is Piro is n’t being honest here .
( My antennae quiver at the fact the first journalist he spoke to is Ronald Kessler , author of embarrassing hagiographies of both George and Laura Bush . )
It ’s also possible Saddam was not honest with Piro .
You can easily imagine Saddam would want to claim he had some kind of master plan , rather than accidentally fucking up to the degree his country was invaded .
3 . It ’s also possible Piro is overstating something real .
Saddam might have acted in some minor way at different times to obstruct inspections , with the idea this would make Iran believe Iraq still had something , while trying to come clean at other times .
In any case , I ’ll definitely watch the Sixty Minutes segment .
Sadly , though , the reality behind it — whatever it is — wo n’t matter .
Given the way the America works , the Piro interview will establish for all time that Saddam was bluffing , was itching to get nukes , etc .

A phishing kit targeting the Bank of America contains an interesting insight into the intellectual hierarchy involved in Internet fraud .
At first glance , the phishing kit looks attractive to any fraudster – it is straightforward to deploy on any web server that supports PHP , and a single configuration file makes it easy to specify an electronic mail address to receive captured financial details .
In addition to requesting the credit card numbers and bank account details , a second form on the phishing site asks for the victim 's SiteKey challenge questions and answers , which can help a fraudster gain access to the victim 's Internet banking facilities .
The email address configured in the phishing kit .
However , while the phishing kit is easy to use , an encrypted component within the kit is used to send a copy of the captured details to an additional gmail address , which belongs to the author .
This will not be obvious to most fraudsters using the kit , as the relevant code is detached from the configuration file and is heavily obfuscated , requiring some effort to decode .
The obfuscated code which sends a copy of the financial details to the author .
Such deception is a useful tactic for any fraudster who wishes to maximize the number of successful attacks , as the work of deploying the phishing sites and sending the mails is then carried out free of charge by novice fraudsters on behalf of the author .
This relieves the author of the burden of having to carry out the more time consuming aspects of phishing – finding bulletproof web hosting , hacking into host web sites , and sending millions of phishing mails – whilst benefiting by receiving mails from each and every deployment of their own phishing kit .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Renzi of Arizona , a state co-chair for Sen. John McCain ’s presidential campaign , was indicted on corruption charges stemming from land deals in his state , Justice Department officials said on Friday .

A federal grand jury has indicted Renzi on 35 criminal counts including conspiracy , wire fraud , money laundering and official extortion , according to court papers unsealed on Friday .
REUTERS / Files
The 35 - count indictment stemmed from plans by Renzi and a business associate , a real estate investor , to benefit from a land - exchange deal in Arizona in return for Renzi ’s support for necessary federal legislation , according to court documents .
McCain , who faced new scrutiny about his ethics this week , reacted to Renzi ’s indictment and told reporters in Indianapolis , “ I ’m sorry .
I feel for the family .
As you know he has 12 children . ”
There was no indication McCain was connected to the case .
The indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Arizona said , “ It was an object of the conspiracy for Renzi to enrich ( his associate ) and personally benefit himself . ”
The indictment , which included charges of conspiracy , fraud , money laundering and official extortion , also accused the three - term congressman of embezzling premiums from clients of an insurance business to fund his congressional campaign .
Renzi , who has had a solid conservative voting record since first being elected to Congress in 2002 , also was accused of concealing his receipt of more than $ 733,000 from the associate in 2005 .
His office in Washington declined to comment on the indictment , referring inquiries to his lawyer , Reid Weingarten , who was not immediately available .
In August , Renzi announced he would not seek a fourth term in the House of Representatives , joining a growing list of Republicans who plan to leave after this year .
Twenty - five House Republicans are either retiring , running for other office or were defeated in a primary election .
Republicans lost control of the Congress to Democrats in the 2006 elections , largely because of a string of scandals , many of them tied to convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Last month , Republican Rep. John Doolittle of California , under investigation for ties to Abramoff , announced he would not seek re-election .
He did so , party sources said , in response to pressure from Republican leaders .
‘ MISUSED OFFICE ’
U.S. Attorney Diane Humetewa said , “ Among the allegations contained in the indictment , Congressman Renzi misused his public office by forcing a land sale that would financially benefit himself and a business associate , and in so doing , he betrayed the trust of the citizens of Arizona . ”
Renzi has cast votes against withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq while supporting a ban on same - sex marriage and developing an Alaskan wildlife reserve for oil exploration .
He has focused much of his efforts in Congress on American Indian issues .
Renzi stepped down from his seat on a House intelligence committee amid his legal problems .
The former insurance company owner and land developer was drawn into the continuing controversy over Bush administration firings of federal prosecutors .
A Renzi congressional aide contacted a U.S. attorney in Arizona shortly before that prosecutor was fired , reportedly to inquire about a possible indictment against Renzi .
Also indicted were two business associates of Renzi -- James Sandlin , a real estate investor , and Andrew Beardall .
An arraignment for the three defendants has been set for March 6 in federal court in Tucson , the Justice Department said .
" We depend upon the value of media rights associated with official international events to provide a majority of our income .
" It is therefore in the best interests of New Zealand Cricket not to support unofficial events , such as the ICL , " said chief executive Justin Vaughan .
The inaugural ICL tournament is due to be played in October and November .
And the organisers , who are bankrolled by media baron Subhash Chandra , have already signed up a number of big names like Brian Lara and Inzamam - ul - Haq , the former captains of West Indies and Pakistan .
But India 's official governing body , the BCCI , will not sanction the competition and the Pakistan Cricket Board and Sri Lanka Cricket have urged their players not to get involved .
New Zealand Cricket regard the ICL as an " unofficial rebel tournament " .
Vaughan said : " Events such as the ICL could have the potential to compete with official international events and erode their value .
" Added to this , the proposed rebel league is scheduled to directly conflict with the Black Caps tour to South Africa as well as the start of our state domestic season .
" We have considered this issue carefully and have concluded that New Zealand Cricket cannot agree to release our contracted players to participate in the ICL .
" We have entered into these contracts in good faith and stand by our players through their contract period .
We expect players to treat us in the same way . "
Former New Zealand stars Chris Cairns , Nathan Astle and Chris Harris are thought to have attracted interest from the ICL and could take part as they no longer play international cricket .
There have also been newspaper reports of a " staggering " offer to fast bowler to Shane Bond , but NZC would strongly resist any overtures to the 32 - year - old , who is the spearhead of their attack in Test , one - day and Twenty 20 cricket .

Largest study of its kind reveals that an ingredient in male body odor can smell like urine or take on a vanilla scent depending on single odorant receptor gene
To many , urine smells like urine and vanilla smells like vanilla .
But androstenone , a derivative of testosterone that is a potent ingredient in male body odor , can smell like either - depending on your genes .
While many people perceive a foul odor from androstenone , usually that of stale urine or strong sweat , others find the scent sweet and pleasant .
Still others can not smell it at all .
New research from Rockefeller University , performed in collaboration with scientists at Duke University in North Carolina , reveals for the first time that this extreme variability in people 's perception of androstenone is due in large part to genetic variations in a single odorant receptor called OR7D4 .
The research is reported September 16 as an advance online publication of the journal Nature .
Androstenone , found in higher concentrations in the urine and sweat of men than of women , is used by some mammals to convey social and sexual information , and the ability to perceive androstenone 's scent may have far - reaching behavioral implications for humans .
In the largest study ever conducted of its kind , researchers at Rockefeller University presented nearly 400 participants with 66 odors at two different concentrations and asked them to rate the pleasantness and intensity of each odor .
When scientists at Duke University identified OR7D4 as a receptor that androstenone selectively activates , Leslie Vosshall , Chemers Family Associate Professor and head of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior at Rockefeller University and Andreas Keller , a postdoc in her lab , formed a collaboration with them , and began collecting blood samples from participants and isolated their DNA .
The Duke team , led by Hiroaki Matsunami , used DNA from each participant to sequence the gene that encodes the OR7D4 receptor .
" With this large dataset , we are able to say that people who express different variants of this receptor perceive this odor differently , " says Vosshall .
Although it has long been suspected that the ability to perceive the odor of androstenone is genetically determined , this study is the first to identify variations in a single gene that account for a large part of why people perceive androstenone 's scent so differently .
With their Duke collaborators , Vosshall and Keller identified two point mutations called single nucleotide polymorphisms along the gene , which gave rise to two variants of the odorant receptor : RT and WM , which differ by two amino acids .
As a group , participants with the RT / RT genotype perceive androstenone 's odor as foul and intense .
Those with the RT / WM genotype , on the other hand , are more likely to perceive androstenone as less unpleasant .
Many cannot smell androstenone at all .
Although some participants with the RT / WM genotype can smell androstenone , they experience the smell very differently than those with two copies of the fully functional receptor :
To them , androstenone does n't smell like urine ; it has a vanilla scent .
" There are two independent things that are interesting about this odor , " says first co-author Keller .
" One is that it is a potential social signal but the other one is that so many people cannot smell it . "
Two additional point mutations in some of the participants influenced their sensitivity to androstenone , one of which may make humans hypersensitive to this odor .
Vosshall and Keller are interested in what it is about these amino acid changes that alter one 's perception of androstenone 's scent , and in whether one 's perception of this potent compound can influence behavior .
" Since some mammals clearly use androstenone to communicate sexuality and dominance within a social hierarchy , it 's intriguing to think whether the same thing may happen in humans , " Vosshall says .
" If so , what happens to humans who ca n't get the signal because they have the nonfunctional copy of the gene "
Or the hyperfunctional one "
What could be the social and sexual implications of this on one 's perception of the smell of fellow humans " "

FORT WORTH , Texas 
A federal appeals court has overturned a statute outlawing sex toy sales in Texas , one of the last states _ all in the South _ to retain such a ban .
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Texas law making it illegal to sell or promote obscene devices , punishable by as many as two years in jail , violated the right to privacy guaranteed by the 14th Amendment .
Companies that own Dreamer 's and Le Rouge Boutique , which sell the devices in its Austin stores , and the retail distributor Adam & Eve sued in federal court in Austin in 2004 over the constitutionality of the law .
They appealed after a federal judge dismissed the suit and said the Constitution did not protect their right to publicly promote such devices .
In its decision Tuesday , the appeals court cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas , the U.S. Supreme Court 's 2003 opinion that struck down bans on consensual sex between same - sex couples .
" Just as in Lawrence , the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct , " the appeals judges wrote .
" The case is not about public sex .
It is not about controlling commerce in sex .
It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct .
This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence . "
The Texas attorney general 's office , which represented the Travis County district attorney in the case , has not decided whether to appeal , said agency spokesman Tom Kelley .
Phil Harvey , president of Adam & Eve Inc. , said the 5th Circuit Court 's decision was a big step forward .
He said his business plans to expand to sell in stores and at home parties , something company consultants had been fearful of doing because of the Texas law .
" I think it 's wonderful , but it does seem to me that since Texas was one of three states in the country _ along with Mississippi and Alabama _ that continued to outlaw the sale of sex toys and vibrators , that it was probably past time , " Harvey said Wednesday .
Alabama is in the 11th Circuit .
But now it 's unlikely that the law in Mississippi , which also is in the 5th Circuit , will be prosecuted , some legal experts said .
Virginia 's law barring obscene items is a bit different from other state laws and does not appear to apply to sex toy sales , said Harvey , whose company distributes nationwide .
Louisiana , Kansas , Colorado and Georgia had laws barring obscene devices , but courts have since struck them down .
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Georgia law banning the advertising of sex toys , which can be sold under some approved circumstances .
The 5th Circuit Court 's decision is encouraging for Sherri Williams , who has been fighting the issue in Alabama for a decade .
Williams , who owns Pleasures stores in Alabama , sued in 1998 after state lawmakers banned the sale of sex toys there .
A year ago , she lost her fight again when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider a lower court decision upholding the Alabama law as constitutional .
Williams hopes that lawmakers will take notice of the recent Texas case and support a newly filed bill in the Alabama Legislature to overturn the ban on adult toy sales .
" I think the courts are finally listening to the people , " Williams said Wednesday .
" You have ' Sex and the City , ' ' Desperate Housewives ' and other shows promoting what society is doing .
I think the courts have finally opened their eyes and looked around , which is a miracle in the South . "

MR. GIBSON : All right .
Let me turn to something else .
Reversing -- you invoked the name of Al Gore a few moments ago .
Reversing or slowing global warming is going to take sacrifice .
I 'm sort of sorry Chris Dodd is n't here because he 's talked a lot about a carbon tax in this election .
Al Gore favors a carbon tax .
None of you have favored a carbon tax .
Is it a bad idea ?
Or is it just so politically unpalatable that you guys do n't want to propose it ?
GOV .
RICHARDSON : It 's -- can I answer ?
You know , I was Energy secretary .
It 's a bad idea because when you have a carbon tax , first of all , it 's not a mandate .
What you want is a mandate on polluters , on coal companies , on -- on -- on those that pollute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain target -- under my plan , 30 percent by the year 2020 , 80 percent by the year 2040 .
It takes international leadership .
The better way to do it is through a cap - and - trade system , which is a mandate .
Furthermore , a carbon tax , that 's passed on to consumers .
That 's passed on to the average person .
That 's money you take out of the economy .
So it 's a bad idea .
Cap - and - trade is mandate , but it's also going to take presidential leadership .
It 's going to take all of us here , every American , you know , to think more efficiently about how we transport ourself , what vehicles we purchase , appliances in our homes .
It 's going to take a transportation policy that does n't just build more highways .
We have to have commuter rail , light rail , open spaces .
We got to have -- we got to have land use policies where we improve people 's quality of life .
MR. SPRADLING : Senator Obama ?
SEN .
OBAMA : Well , I agree with Bill , that I think cap - and - trade system makes more sense .
That 's why I proposed it because you can be very specific in terms of how we 're going to reduce the greenhouse gases by a particular level .
Now what you have to do is you have to combine it with a hundred percent auction .
In other words , every little bit of pollution that is sent up into the atmosphere that polluter is getting charged for it .
Not only does that ensure that they do n't game the system , but you 're also generating billions of dollars that can be invested in solar and wind and biodiesel .
I do disagree with one thing , though , that Bill said , and that is that on a carbon tax the cost will be passed onto consumers and that wo n't happen with a cap - and - trade .
Under a cap - and - trade there will be a cost .
Plants are going to have to retrofit their equipment , and that 's going to cost money , and they will pass it onto consumers .
We have an obligation to use some of the money that we generate to shield low - income and fixed - income individuals from high electricity prices , but we 're also going to have to ask the American people to change how they use energy .
Everybody 's going to have to change their light bulbs .
Everybody 's going to have to insulate their homes .
And that will be a sacrifice , but it 's a sacrifice that we can meet .
Over the long term it will generate jobs and businesses and can drive our economy for many decades .
Unfortunately for professional athletes , their contracts say they have to tell the truth about why they 're not working today .
And hence we get honest accounts of wimpdom such as :
For most guys , the closest you get to a sports injury is breaking your ankle while drunkenly jumping around in a Space Walk on your 27th birthday .
The great thing about being " most guys " is that you get to revise those injuries to " coming down awkwardly after dunking on a big black guy " without getting called on your bullshit .
Ken Griffey Jr. pinches a testicle with his own cup .

Getting smacked in the balls during a game is probably the manliest injury you can sustain on the sports field short of taking a puck to the face or being mauled by a lion in the Roman Coliseum .
Sure , it makes you jump around like a five - year - old girl who has to pee , but it 's the only injury that offers definitive proof of your manhood .
But when you administer the punishment yourself , you destroy the magic , wonder and sheer hypnotic rhythm of the nut shot , and go from " wounded soldier every man feels for " to " episode of America 's Funniest Home Videos . "
Griffey is a Hall of Famer when it comes to pussified injuries .
He fell into a big slump starting in the 2000 season thanks to a list of bizarre injuries that would make the mother of a redneck backyard wrestler feel grateful .
By 2006 , he had been held out of play by eight unrelated injuries , the second most embarrassing being a broken throwing hand sustained while wrestling with his son on his yacht in the Bahamas .
For his son , who presumably started going by Bone Crusher and wearing a cape to school , this had to have been awesome .
For Griffey Jr. , who has a reputation of being overpaid and injury prone , the yacht / kid combo probably was n't so good .

But the pinched testicle injury managed to top it .
Having your balls crushed , like we said is one thing , but there 's just something inherently unmanly about the word " pinch . "
It 's something sisters do to each other , or overly dramatic people do to themselves when something good happens .
It 's not something you should be doing to your own sack .
And by doing it with the device that is supposed to protect your manhood , you 're just adding a layer of Mr. Bean - like slapstick futility that makes people want to buy you an ice cream cone and chuck your chin more than watch you play baseball .
Could it have been worse ?
He could have ripped his testicle clean out of the socket while getting it waxed .

Last month brought TV star Leah Remini 's internal Scientology recruiting email , an insane , rambling pitch to encourage Scientologists to spend more time and money on their own " church . "
Gawker asked for translations of the text ; the funniest so far just arrived from " an ex-Scientologist that grew up in the cult and used to have to listen to the psychobabble every day : "
Translations below from email tipster :
This is Leah Remini Writing you again .
Some of you may know me from
the TV show " King of Queens " , but what is more important is that I
am now OT V and at one point I was a very stalled Clear .
A lot of
people helped me to get OT , and I decided I was going to turn around
and help every Clear make it to OT .
Translation : This Is Leah Remini Capitalizing verbs .
Because when I Do something , like Clean out the hair in the shower drain , it Deserves a capital letter .
I Am famous .
A couple of months ago , you received a letter from me about an event
I was holding to help people move who were stalled on the Bridge .
Obviously you did not come and for some reason , feel you are not
indeed a " stalled Clear " .
Let me start with the definition of
" stalled " .
Not that you are - but who knows ?
STALL : To slow down or
halt the progress of .
( American Heritage Student Dictionary ) .
If you
are not aggressively moving on your next step - your next " Gradechart
Action " , you are stalled .
Look at the Gradechart , it says : Clear -
Sunshine Rundown - Solo Course Part 1 - OT
Preparations and so on up the
chart .
If you are not on your next step as per this chart , and are
not on a prerequisite for Solo , you are stalled - plain and simple .
A couple of months ago , I sent all you ungrateful fucktards a letter about a little speech I was giving to help all of you only - halfway - to - getting - superpowers people get your asses back in supergear .
No one showed up , and I ended up sitting in the church reception hall eating all the Goldfish crackers by myself while my mascara ran down my face in teary rivulets .
So now hear this , assholes : if you 're all sitting around at home thinking " Why would I to listen to a B - Grade actress tell me about the crazed ramblings of a Sci - Fi writer ?
I already think he 's god " , think again .
Because if you 're not actively maxing out your credit card to get to the next step in Scientology , which for most of you is the Rainbow Babies and Wittle Puppy Wuppy Rundown , you are NOT in supergear .
Got that ?
If your C/S has CS ed you for the PTS SP course , or some other
needed action to get you rolling up the GRADECHART faster , then do
it , and do it fast .
I have experience being a Stalled Clear .
I was
the kind of gal who went on course MAYBE a period a day , only on
weekdays , and that was ONLY if I had the time .
I felt I deserved a
special award for being there and they could n't possibly ask for
more .
I remember thinking and saying out loud , " I WILL NEVER be like
those idiots who wait 10 years to go OT ! " 10 years later , I had n't
moved .
I mean I did everything else but move on to Solo One .
If your handler has told you to pony up the cash for the Potential Trouble Source / Suppressive Person course , or the Pupppy Wuppy Rundown With Extra Cheese , or something else to get you indoctrinated as fast as possible , then L. Ron Tapdancing Hubbard , fucking do it .
I used to be like you .
I was the kind of rational person who only sacrificed 3 hours a day at my local Scientology center , refusing to give up any of my precious family time , me time , or botox time to Scientology .
I remember thinking aloud , " I 'm not so sure about all this Scientology shit , but goddamn , the prawns at the church resaurant rock my socks . "
10 years later , I still did n't have superpowers .
I even lost the part for Jane Grey in the X - Men movie .
I did
other courses , I got myself in to trouble , then needed some FPRD and
then I would finish that and it would be " my finances " ...
I would
hear people talk to me about other Clears and refer to them as
" stalled Clears " and I would be like " Yeah - they are totally stalled .
You guys should handle them . "
Never once did I think " I " was a
stalled Clear , because I was always doing something .
Once my mother
told me I was stalled and I actually thought she was an idiot .
Really , I thought " Wow , she really should handle that . "
I also
thought she just did n't know me .
My mom is OT VII and a Class VI .
She did know me and she was right .
So , it is up to you now to be
honest with yourself and look at your own progress up the Bridge .
Yeah , Okay , my mom was totally wrong about a lot of things , like when she tells me to fold my socks down neatly , I do n't listen to that shit , but when your mom's an OT8 with superpowers and ALSO an auditor with superpowers , you should listen up and listen good .
Ok , I 've never actually seen my mom bake cookies with her mind , but the ones she makes in the oven are to - fucking - die for .
And ovens are kinda magical , yeah ?
I mean , you put totally unbaked stuff in them , and you close the door , and you turn the little knobbie things , and when you open it up again , out comes dinner .
That 's the kind of miraculous shit you can get with Scientology : baked cookies .
Be honest with yourself : do n't you want cookies ?
I think you do .
Do you ever wonder why you are not moving ?
No ?
Then that 's an outpoint .
You are Clear , you are special , why have you not moved ?
Whatever the
reason , there is an answer and a solution .
I do n't care what it is :
you were not serviced right or fast enough , people do n't get you ,
you have other things going on that we do n't get , you are helping
others , you are upset , you have n't been acked , your life is actually
going well , your life is not going well , there 's no money there 's no
time , if you were a millionaire you would do it no problem , you are
waiting for your 2D to make it , there 's no urgency , you are not sure
if you have what it takes to be OT , you hated your auditor , you
do n't like the parking situation ... WHATEVER IT IS , IT IS STOPPING
YOU AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT !
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD , I HAVE A QUOTA TO MAKE HERE , AND IF I HAVEN'T RAISED 3 MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCIENTOLOGY BY 7PM TOMORROW , THEY'RE GONNA LOCK ME IN A ROOM WITH TOM CRUISE .
IT PUTS THE MONEY IN THE COFFER , OR IT GETS THE ZAP - RAY AGAIN !

Mr Bolton , who was addressing a fringe meeting organised by Lord ( Michael ) Ancram , said that the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was " pushing out " and " is not receiving adequate push - back " from the west .
" I do n't think the use of military force is an attractive option , but I would tell you I do n't know what the alternative is .
" Because life is about choices , I think we have to consider the use of military force .
I think we have to look at a limited strike against their nuclear facilities . "
He added that any strike should be followed by an attempt to remove the " source of the problem " , Mr Ahmadinejad .
" If we were to strike Iran it should be accompanied by an effort at regime change ...
The US once had the capability to engineer the clandestine overthrow of governments .
I wish we could get it back . "
The fact that intelligence about Iran 's nuclear activity was partial should not be used as an excuse not to act , Mr Bolton insisted .
" Intelligence can be wrong in more than one direction . "
He asked how the British government would respond if terrorists exploded a nuclear device at home .
" ' It 's only Manchester ? ' ...
Responding after they 're used is unacceptable . "
Mr Bolton , now a fellow at the conservative thinktank the American Enterprise Institute and the author of a forthcoming book called Surrender is Not an Option , was applauded by delegates when he described the UN as " fundamentally irrelevant " .
Defending the decision to invade Iraq , he mocked the Foreign Office 's " softly softly " approach to Iran 's imprisonment of 15 British sailors accused of straying into Iranian waters in April this year .
They were released after Mr Ahmadinejad announced he was making a " gift " to the British people .
" They [ Iran ] got no response from the UK or the US .
If you were the Iranian leader , what conclusion do you draw ? "
Mr Bolton said he did not really want " to get into the specifics of your own internal politics here " and made no comment on David Cameron 's foreign policy .
But he said that Gordon Brown 's performance under pressure had not been tested and he hoped that Britain would not withdraw from Iraq .
" There is too much of a view in Europe that you have passed beyond history , " Mr Bolton told delegates .
" That everything can be worked out by negotiation ... Democrats or Republicans , we [ Americans ] do n't see it that way . "
However , he praised the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and his forthright criticism of Iran in recent weeks .
Raising the spectre of George Bush 's " axis of evil " , Mr Bolton said that Kim Jong - il 's regime in North Korea was akin to a " prison camp " and that he would " sell anything to anyone " .
Those who thought North Korea would give up its nuclear capability voluntarily were wrong , he said .
The regime had made similar promises during the past decade .
Only reunification between North and South Korea could resolve the problem .
That could be achieved " if China were to get serious " and cut off fuel supplies to Mr Kim , but the country feared a reunited Korea .
Mr Bolton told an inquiring delegate that he was not and had never been a neoconservative : " I 'm not even a Reagan conservative .
I'm a [ Barry ] Goldwater conservative .
They [ neocons ] have somewhat - I would say excessively - Wilsonian views about the benefits of democracy . "
However , the threat to world peace did not come from neoconservatives but from the perception that " we have passed beyond history " , he said .
The meeting was organised by the Global Strategy Forum , of which Lord Ancram is chairman .
Earlier this month , the former Conservative deputy leader criticised the direction in which David Cameron was taking the party and for " trashing " its Thatcherite heritage .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain opened a narrow lead on rival Mitt Romney ahead of a critical Florida primary after picking up the endorsement of Gov. Charlie Crist , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Monday .
McCain gained 3 points overnight after winning the Florida governor ’s backing on Saturday .
The shift broke a tie at 30 percent and pushed McCain , an Arizona senator , into a 33 percent to 30 percent lead on Romney before Tuesday ’s primary .
The margin of error in the poll is 3.4 percentage points .
The backing of Crist particularly helped McCain with conservatives .
He wiped out a 6 - point lead for Romney , a former Massachusetts governor , among voters who describe themselves as conservatives .
“ You have to say the Charlie Crist endorsement clearly had an impact , ” said pollster John Zogby .
“ McCain went from losing big among conservatives to a tie . ”
Zogby said the endorsement gave McCain more credibility among hard - line Republicans and older voters in Florida ahead of the potentially critical showdown .
“ One day does n’t make a trend , but to gain 3 points in a day could be significant , ” Zogby said .
The two candidates split last week ’s three nominating contests as Republicans battle for the right to represent the party in November ’s presidential election .
McCain won in South Carolina and Romney won in Michigan and Nevada .
The winner in Florida will gain valuable momentum heading into the February 5 “ Super Tuesday ” voting , when 21 states will have Republican nominating contests in a sprawling coast - to - coast battle .
McCain , a former Vietnam prisoner of war , has stressed his foreign policy experience and his leadership on Iraq , including his backing of President George W. Bush ’s strategy to raise troop levels there .
THE ECONOMY
Romney , a wealthy former venture capitalist , has countered by emphasizing his economic credentials and criticizing McCain ’s understanding of the economy .
The poll found the economy is the top issue in Florida among likely voters , at 40 percent .
The war on terrorism ranked second at 14 percent , with the war in Iraq in third at 12 percent .

Despite a win in Iowa by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ’s long lead in national polls last year , neither candidate has been able to gain traction in Florida as McCain and Romney leave them behind .
Giuliani , who pulled out of early voting states to concentrate on Florida , was at 14 percent .
Huckabee was at 11 percent , down 3 points overnight , and Texas Rep. Ron Paul was at 2 percent .
About 8 percent of Florida voters are still undecided about their choice .

Democrats also will hold a Florida primary , but a dispute with the national party over the contest ’s date cost the state its delegates to the national convention and led presidential contenders to pledge they would not campaign there .
Hillary Clinton , a New York senator who was crushed in South Carolina on Saturday by Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , said she would go to Florida to greet supporters after voting ends -- technically honoring the pledge .
The rolling poll of 818 likely Republican voters was taken Friday through Sunday .
It will continue for one more day .
In a rolling poll , the most recent day ’s results are added while the oldest day ’s results are dropped in order to track changing momentum .

A new piece of freeware can turn a Symbian S60 handset into a Wi -Fi hotspot , removing the need to muck about with Bluetooth connections to get connected when on the move .
Just do n't tell your service provider .
JoikuSpot installs on a S60 handset with Wi-Fi and , when activated , turns that handset into a hotspot for any , and all , local devices .
This first version of the application is being distributed free in the hope of encouraging people with unlimited data plans to share their connection wherever they go .
The application works as advertised , and we were able to get a laptop and iPod Touch connected easily enough , though only HTTP and HTTPS are supported and there 's no security at all - you 'll want to be very sure your tariff really is unlimited .
With so many devices having Wi- Fi these days the ability to share a 3G connection makes sense , though whether we'd want to share that connection with all and sundry is more debatable .
Windows Mobile devices recently gained the same capability with their WMWifiRouter application ( also free ) .
Many of the data tariffs specifically exclude access from a laptop or other device , and the operators will be most annoyed if you ignore their terms and conditions by connecting your own laptop over their network , let alone the laptops of everyone within 100 metres . ®
Personal information belonging to more than 650,000 US customers of J.C. Penney and other retailers is at risk after the company hired to safeguard the data lost a backup tape .
The information , which was entrusted to a company called GE Money , included social security information for about 150,000 people .
The data was on a backup tape that was discovered missing in October from a warehouse maintained by storage company Iron Mountain .
While there is no indication the tape was stolen , company officials have been unable to locate it , either .
In a twist of irony , the revelation of the missing information coincided with the debut of a mini documentary on cyber crime in which the chairman and CEO of J.C. Penney , Mike Ullman , speaks about the growing risk posed by online thieves .
At one point in the 20 minute - film , which was produced by security provider Fortify Software , he acknowledges that criminals are actively probing server code for mistakes that will allow them to access J.C. Penney information .
He makes no mention of vulnerabilities relating to physical security or business partners .
The disclosure comes a year after TJX Cos. , owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains , suffered a server breach that exposed personal information for as many as 100 million people .
Despite it being the world 's biggest credit card heist ever and despite revelations security measures failed to meet credit card industry requirements , there 's been little measurable backlash on the company .
TJX stock has lost less than 1 percent over the past year , compared with a six per cent decline in the S&P 500 .
GE Money has offered to pay for 12 months of credit monitoring for anyone whose social security number was lost .
According to the Associated Press , a letter signed by GE Money President Brent P. Wallace reads in part that J.C. Penney " was in no way responsible for this incident . " ®
The Comeback Kid of 2008 ?
Sometimes a candidate does n’t have to win the New Hampshire primary to get a boost out if it ( ask Bill Clinton in 1992 ) .
Will the surprise of 2008 be Ron Paul and his rabid legion of online and offline fans ( dare we call them Paulettes ) ?
“ That spontaneous grassroots support is why Mr. Paul , an obstetrician from Lake Jackson , Texas , could pull off a stunner on Jan. 8 and place third in New Hampshire ’s Republican primary , ” writes Andrew Cline , the editorial page editor of the newspaper formerly known as the Manchester Union Leader , on the op - ed page of The Wall Street Journal .
“ If he does , he would embarrass Rudy Giuliani and steal media limelight from John McCain and Mitt Romney , who are battling for first place . ”
Cline continues :
Many Republican operatives in New Hampshire , even those affiliated with other campaigns , think Mr. Paul is headed for an impressive , double - digit performance .
That he has been polling in the high single digits for months is discounted , because the polls may be missing the depth of his support .
Why ?
For starters , he appears to be drawing new voters .
Polls that screen for “ likely ” voters might screen out many Paul supporters who have n’t voted often , or at all , before .
Many of Mr. Paul ’s supporters appear to be first - time voters .
They will be able to cast their ballots because New Hampshire allows them to register and vote on the day of an election .
If Paul does finish third in New Hampshire , the result may ultimately be more significant for the unfortunate candidate who finishes in fourth place behind him .
Cline suggests that the fourth - place finisher in his scenario could be Rudy Giuliani .
The “ level of enthusiasm for Mr. Paul , ” he writes , “ transcends the state ’s Libertarian base ( about 4 % of the electorate ) .
And by many accounts , Mr. Paul ’s backers here are more energized and committed than are supporters of Mr. Giuliani , who may enjoy inflated poll numbers because of his celebrity status . ”

To the Shores of Need / Past the Reefs of Greed / Through the Squalls of Hate / Sail on , sail on , sail on ... "
Thanks to Dan Koeppel , I 'll never walk through the produce aisle the same way again .
Until I read his new book , " Banana : The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World , " I had never really wondered why there were myriad varieties of apple - Royal Gala , Granny Smith , Red Delicious , Macoun , McIntosh , etc. - yet just one monolithic , curved sweet yellow fruit labeled simply " bananas . "
( Plantains do n't count ; they 're green and you have to cook them before you eat them . )
The reason , it turns out , is that the banana as we know it is a worldwide poster child for bio-nondiversity .
Known as the Cavendish , the bananas sold in my local supermarket in Watertown are virtual genetic duplicates of the ones sold at my sister 's greengrocer in Los Angeles and at food markets in Tokyo , Paris , and Rio de Janeiro .
The Cavendish is grown everywhere from Central America to New Guinea to India to the Caribbean to Southeast Asia .
In " Banana , " Koeppel , a longtime outdoors and adventure writer , weaves a multifaceted story about how the fruit 's unique nature has allowed it to become a worldwide food staple and a geopolitical force that has both shaped and toppled nations .
In the hands of a lesser writer , the book 's multiple personalities - it is at once a political and economic treatise , a scientific explication , and a cultural history - might have proved unwieldy .
Koeppel , though , weaves all of these elements together seamlessly enough that the reader really does n't notice .
While ambitious in scope ( the author takes us all the way back to the Garden of Eden to argue that the forbidden fruit of Genesis was most likely a banana , not an apple ) , " Banana " also comes in at a manageable 304 pages .
I found much of what was within both fascinating and disturbing , particularly the sections on the practices of large US banana - importing companies during the 20th century and on how the banana 's genetic uniformity makes it susceptible to plant epidemics on a worldwide scale .
Koeppel describes how , in their day , banana companies like United Fruit and Standard Fruit were as innovative , ruthless , and pervasive as any of today 's big multinationals .
While the banana 's enduring place in American culture has much to do with the fruit 's taste and nutritional qualities , it is also a testament to the banana companies ' marketing genius .
The quintessential " American " breakfast of corn flakes and bananas ?
Invented in a United Fruit test kitchen .
Bananas as the perfect baby starter food ?
When the banana marketers noticed that mothers were feeding mashed - up bananas to their infants , they quickly lined up scores of medical experts to validate the practice .
Less benign , though , was big fruit 's behavior in Central and South America , where it employed private armies , toppled governments with CIA help , and poisoned thousands of workers with toxic pesticides .
The amount of " Yanqui , go home " sentiment in that part of the world used to puzzle me .
Now I wonder why there is n't more .
Also disturbing to me was Koeppel 's explanation of how the Cavendish is now threatened by disease to the point of possible extinction .
Sound unlikely ?
Well , he explains , it has happened before .
As it turns out , the Cavendish is not our grandfather 's banana .
That variety , called the Gros Michel ( " Big Mike " ) , was wiped out by the same malady , Panama disease , that threatens the bananas on our own kitchen tables .
Only this time there is no substitute variety , no Cavendish , waiting in the wings .
It is at this point in the book that Koeppel dons an advocate 's hat , pronouncing himself in favor of genetic engineering as a way to save the banana as a modern household staple .
Personally , I could have done without the cheerleading .
But even for an organic - food enthusiast like me , his arguments - like the rest of the book - were compelling enough that they made me think .
And that alone is worth the cover price .

LIGO Sheds Light on Cosmic Event
Press Release From : California Institute of Technology
Posted : Saturday , January 12 , 2008
PASADENA , Calif .--
An analysis by the international LIGO ( Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory ) Scientific Collaboration has excluded one previously leading explanation for the origin of an intense gamma-ray burst that occurred last winter .
Gamma -ray bursts are among the most violent and energetic events in the universe , and scientists have only recently begun to understand their origins .
The LIGO project , which is funded by the National Science Foundation , was designed and is operated by the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the purpose of detecting cosmic gravitational waves and for the development of gravitational - wave observations as an astronomical tool .
Research is carried out by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration , a group of 580 scientists at universities around the United States and in 11 foreign countries .
The LIGO Scientific Collaboration interferometer network includes the GEO600 interferometer , located in Hannover , Germany , funded by the Max - Plank - Gesellschaft / Science and Technologies Facilities Council and designed and operated by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics and partners in the United Kingdom .
Each of the L - shaped LIGO interferometers ( including the 2 - km and 4 - km detectors in Hanford , Washington , and a 4 - km instrument in Livingston , Louisiana ) uses a laser split into two beams that travel back and forth down long arms , each of which is a beam tube from which the air has been evacuated .
The beams are used to monitor the distance between precisely configured mirrors .
According to Albert Einstein's 1916 general theory of relativity , the relative distance between the mirrors will change very slightly when a gravitational wave -- a distortion in space - time , produced by massive accelerating objects , that propagates outward through the universe -- passes by .
The interferometer is constructed in such a way that it can detect a change of less than a thousandth the diameter of an atomic nucleus in the lengths of the arms relative to each other .
On February 1 , 2007 , the Konus - Wind , Integral , Messenger , and Swift gamma-ray satellites measured a short but intense outburst of energetic gamma rays originating in the direction of M31 , the Andromeda galaxy , located 2.5 million light - years away .
The majority of such short ( less than two seconds in duration ) gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) are thought to emanate from the merger and coalescence of two massive but compact objects , such as neutron stars or black - hole systems .
They can also come from astronomical objects known as soft gamma-ray repeaters , which are less common than binary coalescence events and emit less energetic gamma rays .
During the intense blast of gamma rays , known as GRB070201 , the 4 - km and 2 - km gravitational - wave interferometers at the Hanford facility were in science mode and collecting data .
They did not , however , measure any gravitational waves in the aftermath of the burst .
That non-detection was itself significant .
The burst had occurred along a line of sight that was consistent with it originating from one of Andromeda 's spiral arms , and a binary coalescence event -- the merger of two neutron stars or black holes , for example - - was considered among the most likely explanations .
Such a monumental cosmic event occurring in a nearby galaxy should have generated gravitational waves that would be easily measured by the ultrasensitive LIGO detectors .
The absence of a gravitational - wave signal meant GRB070201 could not have originated in this way in Andromeda .
Other causes for the event , such as a soft gamma-ray repeater or a binary merger from a much further distance , are now the most likely contenders .
LIGO 's contribution to the study of GRB070201 marks a milestone for the project , says Caltech 's Jay Marx , LIGO 's executive director : " Having achieved its design goals two years ago , LIGO is now producing significant scientific results .
The nondetection of a signal from GRB070201 is an important step toward a very productive synergy between gravitational - wave and other astronomical communities that will contribute to our understanding of the most energetic events in the cosmos . "
" This is the first time that the field of gravitational - wave physics has made a significant contribution to the gamma-ray astronomical community , by searching for GRBs in a way that electromagnetic observations cannot , " adds David Reitze , a professor of physics at the University of Florida and spokesperson for the LIGO Collaboration .
Up until now , Reitze says , astronomers studying GRBs relied solely on data obtained from telescopes conducting visible , infrared , radio , X -ray , and gamma-ray observations .
Gravitational waves offer a new window into the nature of these events .
" We are still baffled by short GRBs .
The LIGO observation gives a tantalizing hint that some short GRBs are caused by soft gamma repeaters .
It is an important step forward , " says Neil Gehrels , the lead scientist of the Swift mission at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center .
" This result is not only a breakthrough in connecting observations in the electromagnetic spectrum to gravitational - wave searches , but also in the constructive integration of teams of complementary expertise .
Our findings imply that multimessenger astronomy will become a reality within the next decade , opening a wonderful opportunity to gain insight on some of the most elusive phenomena of the universe , " says Szabolcs Marka , an assistant professor of physics at Columbia University .
The next major construction milestone for LIGO will be the Advanced LIGO Project , which is expected to start in 2008 .
But Advanced LIGO , which will utilize the infrastructure of LIGO , will be 10 times more sensitive .
Advanced LIGO will incorporate advanced designs and technologies for mirrors and lasers that have been developed by the GEO project and have allowed the GEO detector to achieve enough sensitivity to participate in this discovery despite its smaller size .
The increased sensitivity will be important because it will allow scientists to detect cataclysmic events such as black - hole and neutron - star collisions at 10 - times - greater distances .

A man has been convicted of murdering five women in Ipswich .
He is the latest in a long line of killers who have targeted prostitutes .
Could the police be doing more to protect prostitutes and catch their killers ?
PROSTITUTE KILLERS
1888 : Jack
The Ripper killed five women in Whitechapel , east London .
Unsolved 1964 - 65 : Six women killed and dumped in Hammersmith and Acton , west London .
Unsolved 1975 - 81 : Peter Sutcliffe , the Yorkshire Ripper , kills 13 women - most of them prostitutes - and is jailed for life 1993 - 94 : Lorry driver Alun Kyte kills two women , whose bodies are discovered in Leicestershire 1999 : David Smith gets life for murdering Amanda Walker , six years after being acquitted of killing Sarah Crump 2008 : Steve Wright convicted of five murders in Ipswich
Marina Monti , Karen McGregor , Gail Whitehouse , Lynne Trenholme , Natalie Pearman , Julie Finlay , Vicky Glass , Tracy Wylde , Emma Caldwell .
The list goes on and on .
Women , often in the grip of drug addiction , who sell their bodies and die at the hands of strangers .
In the past 20 years scores of prostitutes have been murdered in Britain and hundreds have been beaten , robbed or raped .
Most of these cases remain unsolved .
The victims often have the same sad biographies , marked by drug addiction , which lead them to sell their bodies to fund their habit .
Every now and again - the Yorkshire Ripper , who killed 13 women , most of them prostitutes ; and the Ipswich murders - their deaths make the headlines .
But more often than not these killings fail to register with the general public .
In 1996 a nationwide police project , Operation Enigma , identified 210 unsolved murders of women - many of them prostitutes - which had happened in the previous decade .
Two years later they identified 21 " potential clusters " and said they were reopening 70 of the cases .
' Human tragedy '
Wayne Murdock has experienced the frustration of an unsolved murder inquiry .
He was the detective in charge of the investigation into the murder of Carol Clark , a Bristol prostitute whose body was found in Sharpness Docks , Gloucestershire , in March 1993 .
Mr Murdock , now retired , said : " Sometimes members of the public say , ' Oh it 's only a prostitute , good riddance , ' but if you started thinking like that , society might as well give up .
She was a human being first and foremost - she was not born to be a prostitute
Alice Wilson
" In Carol Clark 's case I met her parents and they were very decent people and they had no idea what she was doing and it's just a human tragedy . "
Often , if there are no strong leads in the first few weeks , the murder inquiry will be scaled down leaving just a detective , or a small team , who have met the victim 's family and know their grief , to carry on working to obtain justice .
Mr Murdock said : " It 's not like you see on television .
It 's not easy .
" It takes a heck of a long time , but we have got DNA now , which is a huge weapon , and I 'm very confident that some of these cases will be detected and hopefully the Carol Clark case may be solved in the not too distant future . "
Alice Wilson 's daughter Jacqueline Gallagher was killed in Glasgow in 1996 and she said the police who investigated her murder were very good .
She told the BBC News website : " They appreciated that she was a human being first and foremost .
She was not born to be a prostitute , but she developed a drug habit .
" But she did not deserve what happened to her .
She had suffered 146 blows to her head and then been strangled . "
Lorry driver Alun Kyte was jailed for life in 2002 for killing two prostitutes
The police eventually identified one of Jacqueline 's customers as their prime suspect but the case was " not proven " in 2004 .
Ms Wilson said a conviction would have given her closure , but as it is she remains in a state of emotional " limbo " .
The English Collective of Prostitutes said most working girls did not report attacks by punters because they did not believe they would be treated seriously by police .
A spokeswoman also claimed sometimes officers could be " brutal " in their approach .
" Police often have the attitude , ' Oh well what do you expect , it 's part of the job is n't it ? ' if a prostitute is raped or attacked . "
She said she believed the police had put huge resources into investigating the five Suffolk murders only because the case had gained much media coverage .
" And the police and the council have since got together to crack down on clients and drive the women out of the red - light district , but they are still working in less safe areas , " she added .
' Hatred of women '
She said it was not clear why men attacked prostitutes .
Some , like Peter Sutcliffe , claimed they were " cleaning up the streets " , which the spokeswoman said echoed police rhetoric .
Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women
Others were probably just misogynists who found prostitutes to be easy targets , she added .
Mrs Wilson agrees : " These people are sick .
Maybe it 's a hatred of women .
Maybe something has happened in their own lives .
Working girls are just the easiest targets because many are on heroin and they will carry on even when there is a killer on the loose because they have to feed their habit . "
She said she knew the pain the parents of the Ipswich girls had suffered and added : " I am glad this man has been convicted and I pray for their mothers . "
One of Denmark 's largest ISPs is considering fighting a court order to shut off its subscribers ' access to The Pirate Bay , the embattled file - sharing search engine .
Tele2 was ordered to shut off access last week after the court concluded The Pirate Bay facilitates the trading of copyright material without the permission of rights holders , according to a translation by the Danish Pirate Party , a digital rights activist group .
Tele2 complied , but plans to meet on Monday with other telecommunications companies on whether it should challenge the ruling , said Nicholai Pfeiffer , chief of regulations for Tele2 , on Wednesday .
So far , other Danish ISPs ( Internet service providers ) have not shut off access .
" In this case , we think it is needed to have a clarification of the legal grounds , and that is why we are discussing this with the other companies , " Pfeiffer said .
Background
The court 's ruling was hailed by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , which along with other industry groups , are lobbying governments to force ISPs to undertake stronger measures against piracy , such as content filtering .
This latest legal move in Denmark has a precedent .
Last year , a Danish court order ISPs within the country to block AllofMP3.com , the Russia - based Web site that sold albums for download well below market prices .
The ISPs complied .
Record industry groups charged the site was a fraud and was not paying royalties for the music it sold .
But concerns abound over whether ISPs should be forced to take responsibility for content that goes across their networks .
In a statement released Wednesday , Tele2 said that discussions over copyright issues should take place between those who have the rights to the content and those who are hosting it , not network operators .
The situation in Denmark is just the latest fracas involving The Pirate Bay , which is based in Sweden .
Last week , Swedish authorities charged four people affiliated with the BitTorrent search engine for facilitating copyright violations .
The Pirate Bay 's owners say they do not host illegal content on their servers but merely allow people to find torrents , or small information files that coordinate the download of content from computers around the world via P - to - P ( peer - to - peer ) sharing .
After a police raid , the site 's servers are now located outside of Sweden .
The Pirate Bay quickly moved this week to restore service to Tele2 subscribers by setting up a new Web site .
Tele2 subscribers who trying to visit The Pirate Bay can go to The Jesper Bay , according to the Torrent Freak blog .
The site gives instructions on how to get access to The Pirate Bay .

Experts said that the new survey provided the first clear and complete picture of sexuality in later life and that it should give older adults a sense of where they stand compared with their peers .
Researchers have done previous surveys of sexual activity among older people , but those studies were of patients or other groups who were not nationally representative .
“ There ’s a large perception out there that sex somehow does not occur in the later years , and this study demonstrates authoritatively that for many people sexual activity does not diminish much at all , ” said Dr. Robert N. Butler , president of the International Longevity Center in New York and co-author with his late wife , Myrna I. Lewis , of “ Love and Sex After Sixty . ”
“ Human relationships are important to the very end , ” said Dr. Butler , who was not involved in the study .
The researchers , at the University of Chicago and the University of Toronto , contacted by letter a representative group of 3,005 older adults across the country .
Trained interviewers then conducted a two - hour face - to - face session with each of these men and women , asking about their sexual activities as well as their physical and social health and other aspects of their lives .
The study , financed partly by the National Institutes of Health , found that 84 percent of men from 57 to 64 reported having had some sexual contact with another person in the last year , compared with 62 percent of women in the same age group .
Those figures dwindled to 38 percent and 17 percent , respectively , in people 75 and older .
A civil but tense tone prevailed at today 's Federal Communications Commission 's hearing on how to address concerns that Comcast and other ISPs degrade P2P traffic .
Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen was the star of the show , and he knew it .
" It 's a pleasure to be here as a participant and hopefully not the main course for your meal , " Cohen told all five Commissioners and a lively audience during the event 's first panel discussion , held at Harvard Law School in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Comcast makes its case
" Now it 's true , " Cohen explained in his opening remarks , " that to maximize our customer 's Internet experience we do manage our network .
But do n't let the rhetoric of some of the critics scare you .
There 's nothing wrong with network management .
In fact , every broadband network is managed . "
Of course that 's not how other panelists and the events ' many net neutrality supporters at Harvard Law's Ames Courtroom saw it , particularly Cohen 's fellow panelist Marvin Ammori , general counsel for Free Press .
" This hearing is not about some technical details of managing networks , " Ammori began , " it 's about the future of online television and about the future of the Internet .
The facts are n't even disputed .
Comcast is deliberately targeting and interfering with legal peer - to - peer technology , like BitTorrent and others . "
After both Ammori , Cohen , and five other panelists finished their presentations , FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein pressed Cohen for an outline of the cable giants ' network policies .
Is Comcast delaying or blocking P2P use ?
Adelstein asked .
" I 'm going to say again , " Cohen asserted , " on the record in front of this Commission , Comcast does not block any Web site , application , or Web protocol , including peer to peer services .
Period .
Does n't happen . "
Austin Hall at Harvard Law School , the site of the hearing
But , Cohen continued : " What we are doing is a limited form of network management , objectively based upon an excessive bandwidth consumptive protocol during limit periods of network congestion . "
The VP listed six limitations to " what it is that we are doing , " as he put it again .
First , the company only applies this management during heavy periods of network traffic .
" Number two :
We only apply the technique in a limited geographic area , where that congestion exists . "
Three : Comcast only manages uploads , not downloads .
" Number four :
We only manage the uploads when there is not a simultaneous download occurring at the same time . "
Five : Comcast delays the request for an upload , it does not block it .
" And number six , " Cohen concluded .
" If and when we delay a P2P upload , we only delay it until such time as the congestion alleviates , in which case it is honored . "
Unapologetic and even defiant in tone , Cohen dismissed last year 's Associated Press report that the news agency experienced degradation when it tried to P2P the St. James Bible .
He called it an " artificial experiment , " rather than a test .
The net effect of Comcast 's network management policies , Cohen added , when BitTorrent other P2P technologies are used " as designed to be used ... is almost imperceptible on the customer experience . "
Using the Internet the " right way "
Another panelist sitting next to Cohen , Columbia University telecommunications law professor Timothy Wu , replied to these claims .
He sounded a bit exasperated .
" There a single fact here that they cannot deny , " Wu explained , " which is that the Associated Press and EFF [ the Electronic Frontier Foundation ] which are users of the Internet , sought to use an application a certain way , and they were blocked ...
Now he 's saying that they were n't using the Internet in the ' right way . '
They were n't using these applications in the ' right way . '
Well the whole problem is that Comcast should n't be telling people how they 're supposed to use applications . "
Wu referred to " principle number two " of the FCC 's 2005 statement on the Internet , which says that consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice .
" The whole point of principle number two is that you get to use the Internet the way you want to use it , " Wu continued .
" Let me translate what he [ Cohen ] just said : Comcast is blocking BitTorrent and that 's the end of the story ! "
The audience applauded , but this was only the beginning of a long , complex discussion that included some of the nation 's most prominent scientists , engineers , and entrepreneurs .
among them Eric Klinker of BitTorrent and David Clark of Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Clark seemed skeptical of any across - the - board prophylactic legislation on net neutrality .
" It may very well be that a sort of ex post administrative case law approach is the right way to do it , " he explained , " because we have to work it out , and I 'm actually more comfortable working it out this way than I am trying to draw the bright line in advance in some legislation . "
Throughout the day FCC Chair Kevin Martin and several other Commissioners attempted to forge some minimal agreement on the problem , suggesting that most parties concurred that Comcast and other companies should fully disclose their practices and the consequent limitations that consumers may experience with the ISP .
But even here panelists resisted any consensus .
" Clearly for this market to function properly , there has to be a certain amount of disclosure , " conceded University of Pennsylvania law professor Stephen Yoo .
" The point that 's made by network operators is that too much disclosure can give a road map to people who would like to frustrate the system . "
And right after Yoo , Free Press 's Ammori warned that disclosure is not enough .
" We 're saying that you should never be blocking .
You should never be discriminating , " he told Martin .
" There are many non-discriminatory ways to handle bandwidth beyond blocking your competitors . "
Massachusetts congressman Ed Markey also appeared at the hearing , and spoke just before the panelists began to debate .
The event concluded three days before the presumptive end of an FCC proceeding requested by Free Press and the Vuze Corporation on whether ISPs are violating the Commission 's Internet neutrality guidelines , and if so , how to correct the problem .
Last week the Progress and Freedom Foundation petitioned the FCC for a two - week extension on the comment cycle , but today Free Press , Public Knowledge , and five other groups asked that the Commission deny the request .
" Comcast has been deliberately degrading BitTorrent and other peer - to - peer protocols for at least four months , and most likely Comcast did so for many months before testing was able to prove what it had repeatedly denied , " their Opposition argues .
" Extending the filing deadline will only extend the time during which these harms accrue . "
If you want to get a taste of what went on , we 've got MP3 audio of some of the exchanges between Cohen , Wu , and Ammori .
Civil liberties groups have protested over the issue The US House of Representatives has passed a bill on anti-terrorism wiretaps that protects telecommunications companies from legal action .
This follows a long - running debate about the rights and wrongs of government eavesdropping and immunity for phone companies who help authorities do the eavesdropping .
What is this issue about ?
After the 9/11 attacks , the US government started to monitor e-mails and phone calls in which one participant was abroad .
It did so without going to a special court to ask for a warrant , arguing that there was no time .
Phone companies agreed to provide the information but were subsequently sued for breach of privacy .
Taps on communications wholly within the US still need a warrant .
A temporary law , the Protect America Act , was passed last year to allow for taps without warrants but it expired in February .
President George W Bush 's subsequent attempt to replace the temporary law triggered a fierce battle with the US House of Representatives .
What was Mr Bush 's argument ?
He said it would be dangerous if the Protect America
Act was not renewed , but that any new legislation also needed to protect the telecom companies ; otherwise they would be reluctant to co-operate for fear of being sued .
The Senate , he said , had passed a " good bill " and the House should do the same .
Why did the House of Representatives resist ?
The House did not want to give the administration or the telecom companies a blank cheque .
It argued instead that a court should decide in any legal case whether national security justified the companies giving their co-operation without a warrant .
The Senate agreed to give the companies protection .
How was the disagreement resolved ?
The two sides reached a compromise in June 2008 , whereby telephone companies would not be automatically immune , but courts would be obliged to dismiss a suit against a firm if it were able to produce written certification that the White House asked it to participate in the programme and assured the firm it was legal .
When did the issue of warrant - less eavesdropping first come to light ?
In December 2005 , the New York Times published an expose of the wiretap programme , triggering protests against the government from civil liberties organisations .
In January 2007 , the administration reacted to the revelations by giving an assurance that it would in future seek warrants from the special court set up under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
However the court was swamped with warrant requests .
In addition , it is believed that the court later ruled in secret that tapping without warrants was illegal .
So the administration decided to seek a new law allowing it greater freedom .
The Protect America Act passed into law in August 2007 .
What did the temporary new law allow ?
The Act allowed the US authorities to tap into phone calls and e-mails to or from the United States , as long as the target was abroad .
The wiretapping used the switching centres in the United States that link phone calls and the internet worldwide .
The authorities want quick access to these communications , arguing that the old procedure of seeking a warrant from a special court in advance or very quickly was too bureaucratic and cumbersome and that they could not track terrorist suspects calling from or to the US .
Has the warrantless programme been successful ?
It is not known , given the secrecy of the operation , but the New York Times has quoted officials as saying that " the eavesdropping programme had helped uncover a plot by Lyman Faris , an Ohio trucker and naturalised citizen who pleaded guilty in 2003 to supporting al - Qaeda by planning to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge with blowtorches " .
The officials also said an alleged plot involving fertiliser bomb attacks on UK targets had been exposed .
The former Speaker of the House of Representatives Dennis Hastert , a Republican , suggested that the programme had played a role in the investigation of the alleged plot to blow up airliners from Heathrow .
He said in a statement , but without elaborating : " Our terrorist surveillance programs are critical to fighting the war on terror and saved the day by foiling the London terror plot . "
How widespread is the eavesdropping ?
The New York Times estimated that at any one time about 500 people in the US were being monitored .
But as the list constantly changes , the total number wiretapped since the project started in 2002 must have risen to thousands .
The starting point was the capture of al - Qaeda operatives and their computers from which phone numbers were extracted .
In turn people in contact with these numbers were subject to eavesdropping and so on in a widening circle .
How does the US compare with European countries ?
European governments generally have fewer restrictions .
In the UK , under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , it is the government not a court that authorises a wiretap .
The power lies with the Home Secretary .
A procedure justifying the interception has to be carried out to avoid violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and a Commissioner has oversight responsibilities , but these are limited .
In France , wiretaps are authorised by judges , though the government is suspected of by - passing them sometimes .
In the Netherlands , police have powers to wiretap if the crime being investigated is serious enough .
In Greece there was a scandal recently when it was found that someone unknown was tapping into mobile phones of top government ministers and security officials during the Athens Olympics .

What are these ?

" With great power comes great responsibility " , but those with great power usually are n't that responsible .
Nevertheless , we try to be responsible as much as we can .
In the following post , ap and I are going to expose some secrets , which may make you question our values at first , will definitely make you feel worried about " Why is all this possible ? " , and may even make you hate us in your guts for what we have done .
It is important to understand the magnitude of the problem we are planning to talk about , and that we cannot go to any vendor to ask for a solution , because it is not a bug what we have to deal with , but rather a combination of design problems .
It is an issue , which needs to be resolved right now and the only way to do that is to go public with whatever we 've got on our table .
During the last week we 've tried to prepare you for this very moment by exposing bits and pieces on how UPnP works and why it is so important to keep it in mind when testing and securing networks .
We 've also talked about how the Universal Plug and Play can be combined with simple XSS attacks in order to create a powerful mechanism for remotely reconfiguring vulnerable routers without any means of authentication or authorization with the targeted device .
Today , we are going to show you that UPnP can be exploited across the Web without the need of XSS at all .
This is the next logical , evolutionary step of UPnP exploitation which by far has the highest level of severity .
We 've talked earlier that the UPnP stack consists of several technologies : SSDP ( Simple Service Discovery Protocol ) , GENA ( Generic Event Notification Architecture ) , SOAP ( Simple Object Access Protocol ) and XML .
The UPnP control process starts with the discovery stage .
Here , a multicast SSDP packet is submitted to 239.255.255.250:1900 .
Any device that listens on this multicast port will then respond with information about their service description if they are happy with the body of the discovery packet .
The UPnP control actuator will then read the description and look for available methods .
Each method is associated with a control point ( URL and a header ) and method parameters which may or may not be required .
Once the method information is obtained , the UPnP actuator will pick the method that suits best the given task that needs to be performed and submit a SOAP message to the control point in order to actualize it .
" This is how UPnP works in general ! "
When attacking UPnP from within the network where the UPnP enabled device is located , we pretty much proceed with the method described above .
If we want to attack a UPnP enabled device across the Web , then we have a few problems that needs to be solved .
First of all , from the Web , we cannot send and process SSDP .
SSDP is based on UDP and it deals with multicast packets which is something browsers and Web technologies in general will probably never learn how to work with .
The only stage that we can safely perform from the Web is the actual SOAP request , which is the very last stage of the control mechanism described in the previous paragraph .
Adrian did an amazing job explaining how someone can reconfigure your BT Home Hub router via a pre-auth XSS .
In his post , Adrian describes a mechanism where the victim visits a malicious page , which makes use of a XSS vulnerability that exists within the BT Home Hub router , in order to add a portforwarding rule within the targeted device firewall .
Once the XSSed SOAP request is actualized , the attacker will be able to get access to an internal service over the portforward .
Given the fact that the attacker can change the primary DNS server of the target router , as well , the problem seams to be more then scary and very , very concerning .
At this stage you are probably thinking that closing the XSS hole on the router pre-auth pages will definitely solve the problem for good , but I am afraid to inform you that you will be wrong .
To the point : SOAP Messages are nothing but POST requests with contentType equal to application / xml , a SOAPAction header and a request body that complies with the SOAP message format .
These three request values cannot be changed with JavaScript unless we deal with the XMLHttpRequest object .
Though , in order to successfully use this object , we need to comply with the Same Origin Policies ( SOP ) and that will mean that we need an XSS vulnerability , as Adrian proposed in his article .
However , it is less known that these values can be easily set with Flash .
The following code demonstrates the attack vector :
[ / files/2008/01/test.mxml ](/files/2008/01/test.mxml )
The Test.mxml Flash Application performs several operations .
At first , the MXML script creates an URLRequest object to the targeted UPnP control point URL .
In our case , this is http://192.168.1.254/upnp/control/igd/wanpppcInternet , which is the PPP control point of BT Home Hub .
Keep in mind that other devices can be exploited as well by changing that URL to match their setup .
Then we define the request method which has to be POST .
The next expression defines the request data .
This is the actual SOAP Message which will add the portforwarding rule .
We need to set the contentType to application / xml .
Then we push the SOAPAction header into the Array of headers .
And finally we open the URLRequest with navigateToURL .
The respond will render within _self .
Shockwave Flash 9.0 r115 ( the latest at the time of writing but not automatically deployed ) seams to incorrectly supply the request headers .
This may make the attack to fail if you use Firefox , Opera or Safari and the attacked router or UPnP device is picky about CR and CRLF line endings .
Earlier flash versions does not have this problem / bug .
Keep in mind that most devices will accept the request although the line endings are mixed up a bit .
When the victim visits the malicious SWF file , the above 6 steps will silently execute in the background .
At that moment the attacker will have control over the service the portforwarding rule was assigned for .
Keep in mind that no XSS is required , it is a matter of visiting the wrong resource at the wrong time .
Also , keep in mind that 99 % of home routers are vulnerable to this attack as all of them support UPnP to one degree or another .
I repeat myself far too much , but I guess I have another opportunity to mention that adding a portforwarding is only one of the many things someone can do to your router .
The most malicious of all malicious things is to change the primary DNS server .
That will effectively turn the router and the network it controls into a zombie which the attacker can take advantage of whenever they feel like it .
It is also possible to reset the admin credentials and create the sort of onion routing network all the bad guys want .
We hope that by exposing this information , we will drastically improve the situation for the future .
I think that this is a lot better than keeping it for ourselves or risking it all by given the criminals the opportunity to have in possession a secret which no one else is aware of .
The only way to protect yourself is to turn off UPnP .
Yes , that will make your life harder and probably your skype or msn wont work as flawlessly as before but it is a trade - off you have to learn to live with .

See more options for disposing of trash with pictures of green living .
­ You­ have just finished your meal at a fast food restaurant and you throw your uneaten food , food wrappers , drink cup , utensils and napkins into the trash can .
You do n't think about that waste again .
On trash pickup day in your neighborhood , you push your can out to the curb , and workers dump the contents into a big truck and haul it away .
You do n't have to think about that waste again , either .
But maybe you have wondered , as you watch the trash truck pull away , just where that garbage ends up .
Americans generate trash at an astonishing rate of 4.6 pounds ( 2.1 kilograms ) per day per person , which translates to 251 million tons ( 228 million metric tons ) per year [ source : EPA ] .
This is almost twice as much trash per person as most other major countries .
What happens to this trash ?
Some gets recycled or recovered and some is burned , but the majority is buried in landfills .
In this article , we will examine how a landfill is made , what happens to the trash in landfills , what problems are associated with a landfill and how these problems are solved .

Mobile operator O2 is preparing to unveil Apple 's much anticipated iPhone in the UK tomorrow .
But serious questions are being raised in the City about how much ground it has had to give away to Apple in order to clinch the deal .
The UK 's largest mobile operator came from behind at the last minute to seal an agreement with Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , to market the iPhone in the UK , but one other operator described the deal as " madly money - losing " .
O2 is understood to have agreed a margin on the retail price - to be confirmed tomorrow - but will return to Apple as much as 40 % of any revenues it makes from customers ' use of the device .
The price of the combined phone and iPod can be changed by Apple at any time , as happened recently in the US .
Out of O2's share also comes a commission and further revenue share with Carphone Warehouse , which is understood to have secured the right to be the sole independent retailer of the device on behalf of O2 .
Carphone appears to have been drafted in because of Apple 's fears that O2 did not have a big enough presence in the UK even with its sizeable store portfolio which was enlarged by last year 's acquisition of The Link stores .
The rush to secure an exclusive iPhone deal has also been called into question by the arrival of the iPod Touch device , which does everything the iPhone does except make phone calls .
This was not expected by any of the operators involved in negotiations with Apple over the phone .
The current generation iPhone cannot receive music from the iTunes store over the air and is expected to appeal mostly to existing iPod users who want to upgrade their device and have been " wowed " by the touch screen on the iPhone .
The iPod Touch , however , has that touch screen and twice the capacity of the iPhone .
It can also connect to the internet using short - range Wi-Fi technology .
Throughout discussions over marketing the iPhone in Europe , Apple has played off the UK's four main networks - O2 , Orange , T - Mobile and Vodafone - against each other .
All of them , at one stage , believed they had an exclusive deal for the British market .
As a result , many mobile phone company executives are unimpressed with the way the Californian computer group has conducted businesses this side of the Atlantic , although similar tactics were used in the US .
Vodafone is understood to have dropped out of the race relatively early as Apple pursued a " divide and conquer " strategy and decided against having just one operator stock the phone across the three initial territories of France , Germany and the UK .
The plan is believed to have switched to T - Mobile providing the device in Germany , which will be confirmed on Wednesday , and Orange in France , to be announced on Thursday .
In the UK , the idea initially was for both operators to share the device because the British market is much more fragmented than in either continental country .
Orange and T - Mobile are understood to have signed contracts and at least one had Apple employees helping to implement the device on their networks .
But at the 11th hour O2 snatched the UK deal with an offer that gave such a high proportion of revenues to Apple that none of its competitors could see any way of making any return on the phone , even over three years .
They believed that even if it was treated as purely a loss - leading marketing product , a better return could be had by spending the money elsewhere .
The iPhone contract was apparently signed after Mr Jobs received a visit from César Alierta , the boss of Telefonica , which bought O2 more than two years ago .
O2 will also have to spend a considerable amount of money installing the Edge technology which the iPhone needs to operate on its network , in the run-up to the device 's launch this year .
Neither O2 , Orange , T - Mobile nor Vodafone would comment .
During the long - running negotiations over the iPhone , all signed non-disclosure agreements .
· The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday September 26 2007 .
We said that the iPod Touch device does everything that the iPhone does except make phone calls ; it does n't take photographs either .

Hell , this is good work .
In October last year , Netflix released over 100 million movie ratings made by 500,000 subscribers to their online DVD rental service .
The company then offered a prize of $ 1 million to anyone who could better the company ’s system of DVD recommendation by 10 per cent or more .
Of course , Netflix assured everybody that the data had been anonymized by removing any personal details .
That turns out to have been a tad optimistic .
Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov at the the University of Texas at Austin have just de-anonymized it .
Here ’s how : turns out that an individual ’s set of ratings and the dates on which they were made are pretty unique , particularly if the ratings involve films outside the most popular 100 movies .
So it ’s straightforward to find a match by comparing the anonymized data against publicly available ratings on the Internet Movie Database ( IMDb ) .
That ’s exactly what Narayanan and Shmatikov have done .
And get this , once the match is made , it immediately links the user to the any private ratings on the Netflix database .
“ Given a user ’s public IMDb ratings , which the user posted voluntarily to selectively reveal some of his ( or her ; but we ’ll use the male pronoun without loss of generality ) movie likes and dislikes , we discover all the ratings that he entered privately into the Netflix system , presumably expecting that they will remain private . ”
So what , I hear ya ask .
Here ’s what the dynamic duo have to say about one person whose data they outed :
“ First , we can immediately find his political orientation based on his strong opinions about “ Power and Terror : Noam Chomsky in Our Times ” and “ Fahrenheit 9/11 . ”
Strong guesses about his religious views can be made based on his ratings on “ Jesus of Nazareth ” and “ The Gospel of John ” .
He did not like “ Super Size Me ” at all ; perhaps this implies something about his physical size ?
Both items that we found with predominantly gay themes , “ Bent ” and “ Queer as folk ” were rated one star out of five .
He is a cultish follower of “ Mystery Science Theater 3000 ” .
This is far from all we found about this one person , but having made our point , we will spare the reader further lurid details . “
So Netflix may have inadvertently revealed the political affiliation , sexual orientation , BMI and God - knows - what else of 500,00 of their subscribers .
Way to go !

Image is everything – even in the animal kingdom , where survival of the fittest has taken on a whole new meaning .
Conservation , it seems , is becoming a bit of a beauty contest .
While it 's not so difficult to interest the public in the plight of charismatic polar bears or cute pandas , plenty of , well , more homely species are also in danger of extinction but , being less photogenic , get much less media attention .
Last year on the Zoological Society of London 's Edge website , which raises funds for animals on the verge of extinction , visitors could choose to donate cash to any of 10 individual species .
Coming top in this endangered beauty pageant was the slender loris – a small , endearing primate with oversized eyes , like a character straight out of a Disney film .
Bottom of the pile was the solenodon – a scruffy , ancient mammal with the front of a shrew and the back - end of a rat .
Some animals , even ones on the brink of being wiped out , are apparently just too ugly to love .
This month the Zoological Society of London , prompted by news that 85 per cent of amphibians threatened with extinction were receiving almost no conservation , released a top 10 of cosmetically challenged salamanders and frogs .
The list aimed to raise awareness of strange but unique creatures often overlooked in favour of the cute and the cuddly .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Traditionally , species have gotten noticed because we 're innately attracted to them , like pandas , elephants and gorillas , which means we 're more likely to get involved in their conservation , " says Dr Jonathan Baillie , a scientist at ZSL .
The good news is that ugly is now set to be seriously fashionable in the animal kingdom .
" I think we 're now in an era where people want to be exposed to things that are different , new and often extreme , " Baillie says .
There 's an appetite for [ ugly ] creatures . "
The ZSL's aim is simple : to get would - be conservationists to overlook the fact that certain creatures have been tapped with the ugly stick and love them instead for their weird and wonderful attributes .
" The transformation from ugly to cute can be amazing , " says Baillie .
" The film Shrek has done that beautifully , where you start with a creature that people think is repellent and by the end of the film they 're in love .
And that 's the process we 're going through with some species – we 're Shrek - ing them . "
Solenodon
The solenodon can be traced back to more than 70 million years ago to the age of the dinosaurs .
Time , however , has done little to improve its looks .
There are two types , the Hispaniolan and the Cuban , with the latter being the uglier owing to a pronounced rat - like appearance and scruffy , patchy fur .
" The Cuban solenodon looks like a giant dishevelled shrew , " says Baillie .
" We associate animals that are symmetrical and well - groomed as beautiful .
So if something looks dishevelled we might think it has an association with disease . "
The solenodon , which feasts on insects and can inject poisonous saliva into its prey , has been considered extinct at various times in the past century and is now classified as endangered .
" In terms of ugly animals this one 's a hero , " says Baillie .
Aye - Aye
Look away now .
The aye - aye is thought so frightening that it is killed on the spot in Madagascar .
Locals there believe the primate is an evil omen .
" The aye - aye has these ominous eyes and long , bony fingers , " says Baillie .
" It really gives people a scare , plus it 's nocturnal which means the aye - aye is seen as a stereotypical witch - like creature . "
The aye - aye has an oversized middle finger , which is used to chip away bark , dig into trees and hunt for grubs .
It is the largest nocturnal primate on the planet and is losing its forest habitat to agricultural development – as well as being hunted for its looks .
" The aye - aye is so unusual and wonderful , " says Baillie .
" The ugliness could really help the creature get noticed and raise its profile in terms of conservation . "
Giant Salamander
A heavyweight amphibian which can grow up to 1.8 metres long and weigh in at 11kg , the Giant Chinese salamander 's origins go back 170 million years .
" Some have described the Giant salamander as a large , slug - like creature , " says Baillie , " owing to the beady little eyes and stubby little fingers . "
The population has dropped by 80 per cent since the 1960s and is considered critically endangered .
The Giant salamander depends on freshwater systems in the Yangtze but has been threatened by pollution and intensifying industry along the river .
There is also a lucrative industry in breeding the salamander and selling the meat .
" The Giant salamander looks like something that has come from the depths .
But to think they were around before the dinosaurs ! " says Baillie .
" These things that we call odd and ugly are really the cornerstones of biodiversity . "
Saiga Antelope
" I would put this in the unusual , almost cute category .
You 're not repulsed when you look at it .
You think more of Star Wars , " says Baillie of the saiga antelope 's distinctive swollen proboscis .
The antelope 's horns , which look like carrots , are highly prized in the medicinal trade .
Hunters chase the antelopes in vehicles and either shoot them or run them over .
" If they die when they are excited and the blood is pumping then they are worth more .
In the past , poachers collected them in thousands , " says Baillie .
Found in Kazakhstan , with a sub-population in Mongolia , the saiga antelope population has had an " extreme crash " due to poaching .
Cold winters and dry summers in Mongolia have also affected the species – it has now dropped from more than one million to just 50,000 in 10 years and considered critically endangered .
Myers ' Surinam Toad
" It 's got a sunken body and most people 's first reaction is that it looks putrefied , " says Baillie of the Myers ' Surinam toad .
The naturalist Gerald Durrell agreed , describing the toad as : " Looking ... as though [ it ] had been dead for some weeks and was already partially decomposed . "
Despite being perfectly healthy , the toad , found in Panama , has a habit of looking close to death .
It ca n't sit up , lying , instead , pancake - flat .
Its reputation is n't enhanced any further by its habitat – which is a swamp .
Numbers of the toads have been falling as deforestation threatens its habitat .
Long - beaked echidna
The echidna looks like a hedgehog , only bigger .
It also has a long , pointy snout , small , beady eyes and no teeth ; instead the tongue is covered in spikes .
Its reptilian motion further enhances its strangeness .
It is one of the few mammals to lay eggs and has a pouch to keep its young in .
" It 's one of the most evolutionary distinct animals on the planet , " says Baillie .
Found in Papua New Guinea , locals hunt down the echidna with dogs for food .
Edge is focusing on the Attenborough 's long - beaked echidna , found on one peak in the Cyclops Mountains of Papua .
It has n't been seen since 1961 .
" When we recently went to look for it in the mountains where it was thought to be extinct , we found signs that it was still in the area and people had recently eaten them , " says Baillie .
Northern hairy - nosed Wombat
A big , heavy marsupial , the Northern hairy - nosed wombat is critically endangered , with not many more than 100 left , in one fenced - off colony in Queensland , Australia .
The largest of all wombat species , it has lost its home to farming and has been threatened by introduced animals such as the dingo .
" This wombat has a really blunt head and stocky features , " says Baillie .
" It looks strange because people wo n't be familiar with seeing one before .
It 's got a great name , though . "
Phoenix Fly
" The phoenix fly is not really ugly , it 's just a rather dull - looking fly .
A big , brown one at that , " says Matt Shardlow , director of Buglife , a charity for conserving invertebrates .
" Anyone would think it was a housefly . "
The use of pesticides and fertilisers has driven the phoenix fly out of the British countryside and on to brown field sites as it prefers rough habitats , such as quarries , that are n't intensively managed and where there 's plenty of bare ground to lay eggs .
The fly is dubbed " phoenix " after rising from the ashes of scrap - filled , unkempt locations .
Now the redevelopment of brown field sites is threatening the phoenix fly again .
" There are about 40 important species that all live on brown field sites , places that we do n't think are attractive , " says Shardlow .
" They look messy but it does n't mean they are not important for conserving biodiversity . "
Mole Cricket
" It 's weird – it looks halfway between a cricket and a mole , " says Shardlow of the mole cricket .
At six centimetres long , it 's one of the biggest invertebrates in the UK , and has a velvety head and clawed feet like a mole .
The mole cricket spends most of its time underground , coming out at night .
They were usually discovered when ploughing fields but the use of fertilisers and pesticides has seen the population plummet dramatically .
Buglife reckons the UK population may now be extinct .
" It has n't been confirmed in the wild recently – there have been a few possible records .
But the UK contingent has probably gone . "
Glutinous snail
The glutinous snail is extremely rare in the UK and is in decline across Europe .
Having previously been found in lakes in Oxfordshire and Snowdonia , it is now down to just one site , at Llyn Tegid ( Bala Lake ) in Wales .
Although smaller than a garden snail , the glutinous snail gets its name for being extra slippery and slimy .
" It has a mantle which spreads out over the shell so it is encased in glutinous stuff , " says Shardlow .
" It 's supposed to be an anti-predator device . "
The snail likes clear , isolated lakes but pollution has seen the population decline in the past 50 years .
North Korea insists it is off US blacklist
North Korea claimed again today that America has agreed to remove it from a list of nations the US claims sponsor terrorism , after Pyongyang agreed to disable its main nuclear facilities by the end of the year .
Washington had " decided to take such political measures as delisting [ North Korea ] as a terrorism sponsor " , the country 's official Korean Central news agency said .
According to the agency , the US has also agreed to stop dealing with North Korea under the Trading with the Enemy Act , which restricts trade .
However , the US has yet to confirm any of the claims .
A month ago , North Korea made an equally confident assertion about exactly the same measures , only to find itself bluntly contradicted by the US a day later .
" No , they have n't been taken off the terrorism list , " the assistant secretary of state , Christopher Hill , told reporters at the time when asked about the issue .
The US did not announce any reciprocal action when , earlier this week , North Korea committed to disable its main nuclear facilities by the end of the year .
US officials have declined to publicly say that any decision has been made to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism .
The designation obliges Washington to , among other restrictions , oppose such countries getting loans from major international financial institutions .
Other countries on the list include Cuba , Iran , Sudan and Syria .
Earlier this week Mr Hill , who is the main US envoy to the North Korea nuclear talks , again refused to acknowledge any specifics about removing the country from the list .
He said Washington had a " very clear understanding " with North Korea , but refused to divulge any details .
North Korea was put on Washington 's blacklist in January 1988 after a North Korean agent confessed to the 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger jet over the Indian Ocean that killed all 115 people on board .
Japan has been pressing the US to keep North Korea on the list until the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents is resolved .
Japan is demanding information about the abductees , and their eventual return , but North Korea insists the issue has been settled after it allowed several of them to return to Japan in 2002 and 2004 .
Apple 's new MacBook
Air subnotebook raised eyebrows by using a mysterious new , ultra - compact Core 2 Duo processor .
New research , however , reveals it to be a blend of old and new technology designed to make few sacrifices .
An in - depth study of the design by AnandTech founder Anand Lal Shimpi explains that the processor is actually based on Intel 's 65 nanometer ( 65 nm )
Merom architecture with an 800MHz bus , first released in May of last year .
All of Apple 's current iMac , MacBook , and MacBook Pro models use some form of the processor at a higher clock speed .
But rather than struggle to fit the hot , standard - sized processor package into the tight confines of the Air 's chassis — a feat deemed impossible by Jobs during the computer 's introduction —
Apple appears to have called on Intel to accelerate the release of an extra - small chip package not scheduled to arrive until the launch of the Montevina notebook platform in mid-2008 .
" The MacBook Air uses the Intel Core 2 Duo Processor and Intel 965GMS chipset with integrated [ graphics ] using a new miniaturized package technology .
This new CPU and chipset allows for approximately 60 % reduction in total footprint , " Intel explains in a response to the technology site .
The mixture of current and next - generation parts creates an unusual blend of performance characteristics .
The new Core 2 Duo slots just above the Low Voltage ( LV series ) variants in terms of clock speed and power use — starting at 1.6GHz with 20 watts of thermal design power versus 1.4GHz and 17 watts — but is considerably more efficient than the regular mobile processor , which consumes 35 watts of peak power at a minimum 1.8GHz .
Apple may have been making " tradeoffs " to get the finished MacBook Air on the market in time , Lal Shimpi speculates .
As for the reason behind choosing the new variant instead of stock low or ultra- low voltage Core 2 models , the report suggests only that Apple 's main concern was to avoid the low speeds of these chips while compromising as little as possible on energy efficiency or heat .
According to Sam Stein :
At a recent meeting with the Wall Street Journal editorial board , Republican presidential candidate John McCain admitted he “ does n’t really understand economics ” and then pointed to his adviser and former Senate colleague , Phil Gramm – whom he had brought with him to the meeting – as the expert he turns to on the subject , The Huffington Post has learned .
Oh boy .
About Phil Gramm , courtesy of the late , much mourned Molly Ivins :
When he ran for president in 1996 and finished fifth in Iowa , all the profiles written of him included the line “ Even his friends do n’t like him . ”
Self - righteous and strident , Gramm demonized his opponents and used bitter , polarizing rhetoric .
During a Senate debate over Social Security , a member pointed out that the proposal under consideration would hurt 80 - year - old retirees .
“ Most people do n’t have the luxury of living to be 80 years old , ” Gramm scoffed , “ so it ’s hard for me to feel sorry for them . ”
Well , there is that .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - O.J. Simpson was questioned by Las Vegas police after a sports memorabilia dealer accused the former star athlete and murder defendant of robbing him at gunpoint , police and others said on Friday .
Simpson , who was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend in 1995 after one of the most sensational trials in U.S. history , was not charged in the robbery case at a casino hotel and was cooperating in the investigation , police said .
But detectives planned to question Simpson , 60 , again about his involvement in the Thursday night incident , which was reported by the memorabilia dealer as an armed robbery in his room at the Palace Station Hotel & Casino .
Las Vegas police were looking for at least two people who were with Simpson in the hotel room during the confrontation .
“ The victim stated that one of the suspects involved in the robbery was O.J. Simpson , ” said police Capt .
James Dillon .
“ The items taken were various sports - related products . ”
Dillon said detectives could not confirm that weapons were drawn in the room and were studying casino video surveillance tapes .
“ We have a report from the victim that there were weapons involved , ” he said .
“ We have not determined that at this time and have not recovered any weapons . ”
Dillon said Simpson , who lives in Florida , “ has not been restricted in any form .
He can leave Las Vegas . ”
‘ ROBBED AT GUNPOINT ’
An attorney for Fred Goldman , whose son , Ron , was one of two people Simpson was accused of stabbing and slashing to death on June 12 , 1994 , said he had spoken with the memorabilia dealer , Alfred Beardsley .
“ I was told by Mr. Beardsley that he was robbed at gunpoint by O.J. Simpson in a hotel room in Las Vegas , ” Goldman lawyer David Cook said .
Beardsley confirmed to Reuters that he had filed a police report about the altercation .
He said detectives had asked him not to speak to reporters during the investigation .
An attorney for Simpson could not be reached for comment .
The robbery accusations against Simpson became public on the same day his controversial ghost - written book , “ If I Did It , ” hit retail shelves .
The book offers a hypothetical account of how the celebrated U.S. football running back turned television pitch man and actor might have killed his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ron Goldman .
Simpson was acquitted of the murders in 1995 after a trial that was carried live across the country , transfixing Americans .
But a civil court jury later found him responsible for the deaths and ordered him to pay $ 33.5 million in damages to the Brown and Goldman families .
I do n't normally do this , but you have to read this article .
It is the story of Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann , who worked inside the Bush administration and tell an amazing story of arrogance , incompetence and dereliction of duty .
Iran had basically surrendered to us in 2003 -- and we refused their offer of turning in all of their terrorist allies and completely stopping their nuclear program .
If we actually cared about ending terrorism or their nuclear ambitions , we would have jumped all over this deal .
But that is not what Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld cared about .
The fake WMD threat and charges of terrorism are the same exact ruse they used in Iraq .
And unbelievably , the media is going along with it just like they did in the lead up to the Iraq War .
My God people , are you ever going to question their underlying premises ?
If they cared so much about nuclear proliferation , why did n't they focus all of their efforts against North Koreas as they built six to eight nukes ?
Why did n't they say a word about Syria as that country apparently brought in material to build a nuclear reactor ( if that is the real story of the Israeli boming there ) ?
Could it be because North Korea and Syria have no oil ?
If they actually cared about who is attacking our troops in Iraq would n't they have gone after Saudi Arabia , who was funding 90 % of the attacks against our troops according to the Iraq Study Group ?
If they cared about who was attacking our troops in Afghanistan , would n't they go after Pakistan which allows a tidalwave of fighters and weapons into Afghanistan every single day ?
If they cared about terrorism at all would n't they go after Osama bin Laden instead ?
I cannot believe the media is going along with this pathetic ruse -- again .
Stop pretending it 's about nukes and terrorism .
That 's exactly the same load of crap they fed you in Iraq .
Have you learned absolutely nothing ?

The Best of My Brain
Who are you going to believe , me or your own eyes ?
~ Groucho Marx
Only a month or so after Apple announced its MacBook Air laptop , which it calls the world ’s thinnest laptop , Lenovo is about to spring its own super - skinny machine : the ThinkPad X300 .
Here ’s a sneak peek .
My full review will appear after I have fully tested this unusual new laptop , which I expect to be of great interest to road warriors .
Like the MacBook Air , this is a rare small laptop that is built around a full 13 - inch - wide screen display and a full keyboard , rather than the little screens and cramped keyboards common in subnotebooks .
And , like the Air , it offers a fast , rugged solid - state drive instead of a hard disk .
But , unlike the Apple , Lenovo ’s new skinny ThinkPad comes with a hefty complement of ports and features , some of the very things critics complained Apple left out .
It has a built - in DVD drive , removable battery , three USB ports , and a wired Ethernet networking jack .
Inside , in addition to Wi -Fi , it can be ordered with a built - in cellphone modem and even GPS .
It comes with either Windows Vista or Windows XP .
Sporting the traditional ThinkPad black slab design , the X300 is n’t as skinny or sexy as the Apple , but it ’s still very slender and attractive , at under an inch thick .
Also , unlike the Apple , most of the ThinkPad ’s configurations are a bit heavier than the 3 - pound weight that traditionally denotes a subnotebook .
But it still feels very light to carry around , at 3.12 pounds with the standard battery and DVD drive .
The biggest downsides to the new ThinkPad X300 are price and limited storage capacity .
Unlike the Apple , which can be ordered with a higher - capacity , lower - priced hard disk , the new ThinkPad will only be available with the expensive , limited capacity solid - state drive .
So it will start at between $ 2,500 and $ 2,800 –up to $ 1,000 more than the Apple ’s base price–and will be limited to a paltry 64 gigabytes of storage .
Question : Which Pakistani leader should the U.S. government support ?
You would n’t know it from watching most of the candidates for president , but this is a trick question .
Why is it a trick question ?
Because it ’s like asking , " When did you stop beating your wife ? "
If you try to answer when you stopped , you implicitly admit that you did beat her , even if you did n’t .
Similarly , if you try to answer which Pakistani leader the U.S. government should support , you imply that the U.S. government should support some Pakistani leader .
Here are my answers to each question .
Question :
When did you stop beating your wife ?
Answer : I ’ve never beaten my wife .
Question : Which Pakistani leader should the U.S. government support ?
Answer : The U.S. government should not support any leader in Pakistan .
The U.S. government should keep its nose out of other people ’s affairs .
Just as we would object if Pakistani government officials tried to influence U.S. elections , so we should object just as vociferously to the U.S. government trying to influence who runs the Pakistani government .
My objection to the United States trying to run other countries ’ affairs is only partly a moral one .
Let ’s face it : the people contending to be the head of Pakistan are not nice people who somehow deserve free rein .
Even Benazir Bhutto , for whom many are now mourning , was pretty vicious .
And , for that matter , most officials in the U.S. government are fairly vicious , too .
Look at how easily it came to so many of the candidates for president , Barack Obama included , to say that all options for dealing with various governments of the world are " on the table . "
By saying this , these candidates were including the possible use of nuclear weapons , even if the weapons were to be used against countries whose governments had not attacked the United States .
This strikes me as vicious .
But my biggest objection to supporting a Pakistani leader is a practical one .
Even if officials in , or contending to be in , the U.S. government were not vicious ( and some of them are n’t ) , they simply do n’t have enough information to decide correctly , if there is such a thing as " correctly , " which person to back .
They have what economists call " an information problem . "
Economists have shown time and again that using information to plan an economy simply does n’t work  and attempting to plan another country ’s government will fail just as dismally .
The big breakthroughs in thinking about planned economies came from two economists from Austria , Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek .
Although it was von Mises who , in 1920 , had the original insight about information , Hayek elaborated and added to the argument .
In a series of essays in the 1930s and 1940s , Hayek drove the final intellectual nail in the coffin of socialism .
He pointed out that even if central planners had pure motives  so that we would n’t have to worry about their incentives  they simply could not have the information they would need to plan an economy well .
In any complex economy , there are at least hundreds of thousands of items , and central planners , having thrown out the free market , cannot know relative supplies and demands for these products .
This , wrote Hayek , is precisely what the market tells us .
The free market , he argued , works so well because the information that really matters in any economy exists in a decentralized form in the minds of the millions of participants in the market .
In his famous 1945 article " The Use of Knowledge in Society , " which I have my students work through in every course I teach , Hayek writes :
" Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge .
But a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules : the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place .
It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made , but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active coöperation .
We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any occupation after we have completed our theoretical training , how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs , and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people , of local conditions , and of special circumstances .
To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed , or somebody ’s skill which could be better utilized , or to be aware of a surplus stock which can be drawn upon during an interruption of supplies , is socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques .
And the shipper who earns his living from using otherwise empty or half - filled journeys of tramp - steamers , or the [ real ] estate agent whose whole knowledge is almost exclusively one of temporary opportunities , or the arbitrageur who gains from local differences of commodity prices , are all performing eminently useful functions based on special knowledge of circumstances of the fleeting moment not known to others . " [ paragraph H. 9 ]
The term that modern economists use for Hayek ’s " knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place " is " local knowledge . "
Hayek goes on to argue that this local knowledge can’t possibly be aggregated in the minds of a few central planners , no matter how brilliant .
And if the government does not leave people free to act on their own local knowledge , most of it wo n’t be acted on .
Interestingly , some of the economists who had dismissed Hayek and von Mises in the 1940s and for decades after came around to their way of thinking in the late 1980s .
Exhibit A is socialist economist Robert Heilbroner , who , in two articles in the New Yorker and one article in my Concise Encyclopedia of Economics ( then The Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics ) , said that von Mises and Hayek were right after all .
In a 1989 New Yorker article , Heilbroner wrote :
" Less than 75 years after it officially began , the contest between capitalism and socialism is over : capitalism has won .
Capitalism organizes the material affairs of humankind more satisfactorily than socialism . "
And in a 1990 article in the New Yorker , Heilbroner wrote , " It turns out , of course , that Mises was right " about how badly socialism would work .
Note his use of the term " of course . "
And in his 1993 article in my Encyclopedia , Heilbroner leads with the following :
" Socialism  defined as a centrally planned economy in which the government controls all means of production  was the tragic failure of the twentieth century . "
Heilbroner went on to write , " In fact , we now know that their [ von Mises ’ and Hayek ’s ] argument was all too prescient . "
Although Hayek himself never , as far as I know , applied this thinking to foreign policy , it applies beautifully .
Just as central planners can’t know how much , and what kinds of , steel to produce , they ca n’t know which leader in a foreign country to support .
None of them , even the most brilliant and informed of them , has enough knowledge .
The odds are , therefore , that by meddling in those countries ’ affairs , they will do more harm than good .
The analogy between centrally planning an economy and centrally deciding which official should run a foreign government is not perfect .
Analogies seldom are .
The main difference is that a government that forswears central planning and leaves individuals free to make their own decisions within a system of property rights will typically end up being the government of a prosperous country .
A government that forswears planning other countries ’ governments , by contrast , will not , by doing so , cause people in that other country to make good choices about their own governments .
But the point of the analogy is that a government that refuses to interfere with choices about another country ’s government will avoid making a bad choice , whereas a government that tries to meddle will almost inevitably make a bad choice .
None of this has stopped many of the U.S. candidates from advocating their own pet choices .
On Dec. 27 , the day Benazir Bhutto was assassinated , Democratic candidate Bill Richardson issued a press release in which he stated that Musharraf , the current head of Pakistan ’s government , " must go . "
Richardson , like most of the candidates , with the refreshing exception of Ron Paul , has what Hayek called in the central planning context a " fatal conceit . "
He somehow thinks he is informed enough to decide that Musharraf should resign .
I ’m not asserting that Musharraf should n’t resign .
I simply do n’t know enough to make that assertion  and neither does Richardson .
I wrote above that even the most brilliant and informed officials are unlikely to make good choices when choosing the heads of other countries ’ governments .
But my case is even stronger than that because there is nothing in the competition for political office that causes the most brilliant and informed to do well .
Hillary Clinton , for example , one of the two main contenders for the Democratic nomination for president , showed abysmal ignorance of the Pakistani political system recently .
In a Dec. 28 interview with CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer , Clinton stated , " If President Musharraf wishes to stand for election , then he should abide by the same rules that every other candidate will have to follow . "
But Clinton was mistaken , as anyone who has followed Pakistan ’s news closely would know .
The Jan. 8 elections to which she was referring are not to choose Pakistan ’s president , but to choose its parliament .
Clinton repeated the same mistake two days later in an ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos .
She stated of Musharraf and the Jan. 8 elections , " He could be the only person on the ballot . "
So , even with two days to learn more , Clinton was still in the dark .
And remember that this is not some underfunded fringe candidate but , rather , the best - funded candidate in the whole pack .
Which means that no one in her large staff corrected her mistake .
Indeed , the Dec. 28 transcript from which I quoted was issued by her very own staff .
And she presumes to tell people in other countries how to act ?
Give me a break .
Fortunately , there is one candidate for president who is humble enough to recognize that neither he nor anyone else can make good choices for Pakistan .
That man is Ron Paul .
One of his best moments in the whole campaign was when MSNBC ’s David Shuster asked him what he would do about Pakistan .
Candidate Paul made it clear that the U.S. government should stay out .
Paul argued that the U.S. government should neither subsidize nor bomb Pakistan .
Paul , moreover , may well be the only candidate who has read Hayek .
I believe that Hayek , had he thought about foreign policy , would have been proud .

The findings are gloomy news for President Musharraf and his allies
The survey of more than 1,400 people across Pakistan suggested support for Mr Musharraf has fallen dramatically .
Pakistanis are preparing to vote in parliamentary polls on Monday that many fear could be rigged .
Mr Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , has promised that the elections will be fair .
" Despite all rumours , insinuations and every type of apprehension , these elections will be free , fair , transparent and peaceful , " Mr Musharraf said in the capital , Islamabad , on Thursday .
The Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is holding what it says is a major campaign rally .
A party official said the pre-election gathering in the city of Faisalabad in Punjab province will be the last one addressed directly by Asif Ali Zardari , Ms Bhutto 's widower and successor as party leader .
Thousands of party supporters have been gathering for the event amid heavy security .
The PPP traditionally draws its support from the southern province of Sindh .
Punjab , home to more than half of all Pakistanis , is a key electoral battleground , where the PPP will compete for votes with its rivals - the two opposing factions of the Pakistan Muslim League , PML - Q and PML - N .
Focal point
Pakistanis polled by the BBC World Service were divided about whether the general elections scheduled for 18 February would be free and fair .
BBC World Service Poll on Pakistan [ 23 k ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here
A nationally representative sample of 1,476 Pakistani adults were polled from 27 to 28 January 2008 on behalf of BBC Urdu .
They were also asked a question relating to the judiciary and the sacked former chief justice of the Supreme Court , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
He has become one of President Musharraf 's most outspoken critics - and a focal point for opposition to the government - since the president first tried to dismiss him last year .
People were asked whether they thought the new National Assembly , which will be elected next week , should try to re-instate Mr Chaudhry .
Almost two - thirds of the people questioned said they thought it should .
Popularity
All this is gloomy news for President Musharraf and his allies , the BBC's Jill McGivering says .
BBC WORLD SERVICE POLL 64 % say stability would improve if Musharraf resigned 49 % say his re-election in November was invalid 44 % say they are confident elections will be free and fair 51 % say they are optimistic conditions will improve over next six months Source : GlobeScan
It supports the findings of another recent poll conducted by the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , which also suggested that the president 's standing was being eroded , compared with a similar IRI poll released in mid-December .
The results of the latest poll found a particularly low approval rating for his performance .
Only 15 % of people asked said they approved of the job he was doing , while 72 % disapproved .
That compared with an approval rate of 30 % at the end of last year .
Three - quarters of the people asked said they would like him to resign .
That number too has increased .
His overall popularity rating had also declined ( by 12 points ) since the last survey .
A spokesman for President Musharraf told the BBC the poll did not represent public opinion .
He dismissed the finding that almost half of those surveyed did not regard Mr Musharraf 's re-election in November as valid .
" It is something that does n't stand to reason , " Rashid Qureshi said .
Conspiracy theories
In recent months , a series of events have helped to change the political landscape .
The murder of Ms Bhutto on 27 December created a wave of sympathy for the opposition .
There has been dispute over the cause of Bhutto 's death
In contrast , there has been a backlash against President Musharraf and his government since Ms Bhutto 's death .
Although a recent investigation by UK detectives supported the government 's version of events surrounding her assassination , suspicions and conspiracy theories have persisted , especially amongst PPP supporters .
When the team carrying out the BBC - commissioned poll asked people who they thought was responsible for her death , almost 40 % said they thought the Pakistani security agencies or people linked to them were responsible .
The poll was conducted before the release of the UK police findings .
Your Hedge Fund Questions , Answered
A few days ago , we solicited your questions for hedge fund manager Neil Barsky .
As always , your questions were terrific , and so are Barsky ’s answers , below .
One thing that surprised me , however , is that nobody asked Barsky , a former Wall Street Journal reporter , what he thinks about Rupert Murdoch ‘s purchase of the Journal ( and the rest of Dow Jones ) .
This is probably a good indicator that journalists care a lot about the business of journalism — look at the thousands of column inches the Times and the Journal itself have devoted to the deal — but that nobody else really does .
Anyway , since I cared , I asked Barsky , and you ’ll find his reply at the end of this hedge - fund Q&A .
Enjoy , and thanks again to you all for the questions and to Neil for the answers .
Q : (1 ) Do you think the Senate proposal [ to raise taxes ] really could cause a flight of the industry overseas , as Ben Bernanke hinted ?
( 2 ) Do you think any reasonable objections can be raised against the proposal , considering that private equity fund managers , besides making a token co-investment whenever they put together a deal , surely do n’t face the kind of risk faced by an entrepreneur or major investor ?
A : First , let me state the obvious : there is no public policy reason for hedge fund and private equity managers to pay a lower tax rate than teachers , doctors , or lawyers .
Yes , we live in a society where the market decides how much to compensate people for their work — baseball players make more than teachers , hedge fund managers make more than doctors .
That ’s capitalism , and while our system produces more than its share of inefficiencies , it works pretty well over time and for most people .
But part of the bargain in the U.S. is our progressive tax code — the more you earn , the higher your tax rate .
This tends to have the practical effect of raising more revenue for the government , and it also has an perceived fairness component .
I suspect that this debate is the result of a quirk in the tax code : hedge and private equity funds are set up as partnerships , and partnership accounting allows incentive fees to receive “ tax treatment , ” which means the gains are taxed according to the tax basis of the underlying stocks in the portfolio .
Certain congressional bills want to tax those gains to the manager as ordinary income .
No legislator in his right mind ever said , “ We have to tax hedge fund managers this way , otherwise they ’ll have no incentive to work hard ! ”
So let ’s not kid ourselves — the tax code is a gift to the industry .
Of course , accountants and some managers will find clever ways to circumvent the new laws , so perhaps the proposed bills wo n’t generate the revenue they are meant to .
But from a fairness perspective , it is a no-brainer .
The notion that the most profitable industry in the history of mankind ( I hyperbolize , but on a per- person basis , this might in fact be true ) requires a lower tax rate to take risk and make investments , simply does not square with logic .
I know of no manager who would stop working or stop investing as a result .
Q : I ’m curious as to what degree the emergence of hedge funds has changed business strategy .
Do the large swings of capital from hedge funds , etc. , cause firms to focus so strongly on short - term performance that they compromise their sustainability in the long run ?
Does the structure of our current capital markets threaten the stability of the economy by creating companies so focused on quarterly returns that they lack the ability to adapt to a changing economic landscape ?
A : This is a great question : does the presence of short - term - oriented investors such as hedge funds alter the behavior of the companies they invest in ?
Let me throw a few more questions out there :
To what extent does widespread options issuance create an incentive for a CEO to focus on his or her stock price to the exclusion of building long - term business value ?
Does the ubiquity of earnings estimates cause companies — unconsciously or , ahem , intentionally — to distort their business practices in order to please investors ?
Does all the money sloshing around hedge fund coffers allow them to throw their weight around and often force managements to make bad business decisions ?
My answers would be : Yes .
A lot .
Yes .
Yes .
Short - term thinking infected Wall Street some time ago , and I would suggest it was performance - obsessed mutual funds that got the ball rolling back in the 1980s bull market .
Not all hedge funds are activist or short - term thinkers , of course , but the rise of “ activist ” hedge funds and private equity firms certainly have exacerbated the situation .
I believe the chickens are coming home to roost , however .
Often , companies go private when activists chase management into the arms of LBO shops willing to put a level of debt on corporate balance sheets that public investors would find imprudent .
As the economy slows or credit markets tighten , these companies will have trouble making their debt payments , and — just as the LBO boom in the 1980s burst — lenders and possibly private equity investors will be left holding the bag .
Q : Do you believe that hedge funds provide a social good ?
Predominantly ( if not exclusively ) these funds are available only to the wealthy ( notwithstanding the fact that some pension funds may invest a portion of their assets in hedge funds ) .
It seems to me that while working - class schlubs ( or even upper - middle - class schlubs like me ) could never even dream of investing in these types of funds , their function net - net is merely an extension of the old saw of helping the rich get richer while foreclosing financial windfall opportunity to the bottom 95 percent .
What are the specific benefits to society as a whole that are provided by hedge funds ?
A : I do n’t believe hedge funds necessarily provide a social good , but I also do not believe they are a social evil ( generalizations are always dangerous , but bear with me here ) .
Certainly the fact that non-wealthy folks are deprived of their right to invest in hedge funds seems to be a victimless crime , no ?
And for those eager to invest in hedge funds , but who do n’t meet hedge fund minimums , rest assured there are funds of funds and other vehicles that can give you exposure to the industry .
But let ’s deal with the larger , philosophical question :
What specific benefits to society as a whole are provided by hedge funds ?
I do believe that , starting with the 1980s bull market , we have seen a society - wide reallocation of human resources .
And it is unfortunate that the “ best and the brightest ” no longer seem to want to go into government or medicine or teaching ( I did say I ’d be generalizing here ) , and instead seem to gravitate to the best - paying professions .
In other eras , I believe that was not the case to the degree it is today .
Hedge funds did n’t make this happen — back in the 1980s and 1990s it was the investment banks that siphoned off the talent — but the industry has certainly made matters worse .
I might be stretching here , but I will offer some examples of how hedge funds — or certain hedge fund managers — help society .
The best hedge funds I know ( and they number in the dozens ) are managed by smart , ethical managers who are able to generate superior returns without taking undue risk .
Many of their investors are hospitals , university endowments , and charitable foundations .
To the extent that these investors are spared the performance of the mediocre world of mutual fund managers , then they and the people they support benefit .
To the extent that these managers earn handsome fees and are generous souls ( and many of them are ) , then society benefits when they donate portions of their wealth to charity .
In general , the compensation differential between jobs in finance and jobs in virtually every other part of society is sad .
Q : How far are we away from hedge funds being a regulated investment option ( and thus available to non-qualified investors ) ?
How different will they be compared to the type of investment pools that they are today ?
Also , once hedge funds become regulated , will they lose their ability to extract value from market inefficiencies due to transparency ?
A : I believe it is only a matter of time before hedge funds are required to register with the SEC .
I also believe it is only a matter of time ( how much time , I do n’t know ) until hedge funds are no longer deemed too “ risky ” for mom and pop , and are available to average investors .
Over time , I believe we will see a convergence of the traditional long - only mutual fund industry and the hedge fund industry .
I could make a good argument why a hedge fund with 50 % market exposure whose manager does not get paid if she loses her investors ’ money is considerably less risky than a mutual fund where the manager has no capital in his own fund , where he is paid merely to beat an index whether the market goes up or down , and where his company is 90 % focused on asset gathering .
But that would be self - serving .
Q : Jeremy Grantham recently wrote in one of his investor letters :
To conclude , I have been trying to come up with a simple statement that would capture how serious the situation is for the overstretched , overleveraged financial system , and this is it :
In 5 years I expect that at least one major “ bank ” ( broadly defined ) will have failed and that up to half the hedge funds and a substantial percentage of the private equity firms in existence today will have simply ceased to exist .
I have often been too bearish about the U.S. equity markets in the last 12 years ( although bullish on emerging equity markets ) , but I think it is fair to say that my language has almost never been this dire .
The feeling I have today is that of watching a very slow motion train wreck .
What do you think of Grantham ’s comments on the overstretched financial system and its impact for hedge funds ?
A : Mr. Grantham is looking pretty smart these days , is n’t he ?
There has been a “ repricing ” of risk these past few weeks , and leveraged players have been slaughtered .
Some hedge funds , those focused more on the credit than the equity markets , I believe , have shut their doors .
The subprime mortgage market has shut down .
Banks are on the hook for tens of billions in loan commitments to upcoming LBOs that no longer make economic sense .
I am more concerned about the overstretched financial system ’s impact on the economy than I am about hedge funds .
Overall , I would observe that the U.S. economy has historically proven very resilient in the face of the inevitable excesses that flow when money is too available , and I tend not to be an alarmist .
As for hedge funds , I ’m not concerned .
Some will fail and some will thrive .
Q . As a former Wall Street Journal reporter who now toils in the trenches of finance , how do you assess Murdoch ’s purchase of Dow Jones ?
I think Murdoch ’s purchase of Dow Jones is sad , and mostly inevitable .
Sad because I know how passionate the people at the Wall Street Journal are about hard - hitting independent journalism .
While many of us assume that virtually all journalists have deeply ingrained biases and agendas , my experience in the industry is the opposite : most reporters I know are independent thinkers who would knock down walls to get to the bottom of a story ( many would knock over one another to boot ) .
Will Murdoch change that ?
At first , I suspect he will behave well , raise salaries , hire more reporters and let the chips fall where they may .
He is nothing if not a patient and smart businessman who is willing to lose money for years , mindful that a large payoff is up the road .
The Fox television network and Fox News are examples of this .
The historical record , however , suggests Murdoch will eventually marry his political and business interests , much like the press lords of old .
My view is that Murdoch ’s properties — mainly the New York Post and Fox Television — have lowered the quality of discourse in our country .
They ’re outrageous , brass - knuckled , often hysterically funny , and clever outlets .
But they are also mean - spirited , reputation - ruining , and often truth - distorting .
Put another way , I think all journalists and news organizations have certain biases ; News Corp ’s properties seem to have agendas .
That said , it must also be understood that this takeover was allowed to happen because Dow Jones management — and its board — has been asleep at the wheel for a long time .
Before Murdoch stepped in , the stock was lower than it was in 1983 .
Think about that .
In 1983 , Dow Jones was like 19th century Britain — it ruled the seas .
It was the most dominant , well - known business brand in the world .
There was no Bloomberg , no internet , no CNBC , probably Reuters and the Financial Times were n’t much , either .
A series of management missteps — selling cable properties , buying and writing off Telerate , failing to invest in business television , and on and on — led to a punk stock price , and opened the door to Murdoch .
Unfortunately , the newspaper industry is in the throes of real technological disruption .
While big -city dailies and the nightly news once dominated , the world is now chopped up into a million little pieces .
Murdoch understands this ; the Dow Jones board and management did n’t .

Danica Patrick ’s appearance in Sport Illustrated ’s Feb 08 Swimsuit Edition is an education in how to leverage brands – albeit at the risk of compromising their integrity .
This is not meant as criticism – in fact , I applaud Danica for her work ( on the racing track as well as in front of the camera ) and the way she adjusts to both sides of the coin without much fuss .
She ’s comfortable with courting media attention and focused on succeeding on the track regardless of it – a trait that few sports personalities share .
As RideLust points out ,
Danica Patrick has risen in the sport of Indy Racing based solely on her talent and business acumen .
She is a sharp driver and pragmatic about her career choices .
Indeed she is .
However , her openness to leveraging her sexuality to her advantage will always invite criticism ( whether it ’s from women complaining about the objectification of the female body or it ’s from ‘ purists ’ who feel that sports is only about what happens on the track / field and all this modeling stuff just demeans it ) – it ’s how the public reacts when they ’re faced with a brand that is naturally marketable and geared for success from the word go , like Danica is .
Timing is everything
It ’s not as if Danica Patrick is stunningly H - H - H - H -H - OTTT ( for the record , Anna Kournikova is prettier , but do you see the similarities in the photo shoot from 4 years ago ? ) – she has a well - toned body ( she IS a professional sportswoman after all , did you expect a beer belly ? ) but is n’t exactly a perfect 10 . or 9 . or 8.5 ( despite her best efforts in this photo ) .
But she was the right person ( a white girl better than most boys at racing cars ) in the right place ( a sport overwhelmingly dominated by men – a contradiction that was bound to attract attention ) at the right time ( when the sport needed to uplift itself and its sagging support ) .
Timing matters as much as ability , temperament and business acumen and Danica has timed her rise to perfection .
Danica the race driver v Danica the model
The reaction she attracts is stinging at times and often has nothing to do with her abilities as a race driver .
To quote Formula One driver Jenson Button who dismissed the chances of her involvement in Formula One racing :
A girl with big boobs would never be comfortable in the car .
And the mechanics would n’t concentrate .
Can you imagine strapping her in ?
Leveraging her sexuality has definitely compromised the integrity of the brand that is ‘ Danica the racer ’ ( although being a woman in a male - dominated sport meant that that integrity was always under attack ) – as AutoBlog says :
… it ’s also more difficult to take her seriously as a driver when she ’s topless .
Danica Patrick – The David Beckham of Motor Sports ?
It might be easier to understand Danica ’s status as a brand if you consider one of the most famous contemporary sports brands today – David Beckham .
As someone who has watched Beckham play over the years , there ’s no doubting his technical abilities as a soccer player , but the media cannot seem to look beyond his appeal as a brand .
You could even argue that his career has n’t turned out exactly as he planned because of his celebrity status – as a brand Beckham has few peers , but the inevitable compromise has been to face consistent criticism over his abilities as a sportsman .
American motorsports will get much needed exposure from Danica ’s photoshoot .
SI will benefit , as they always do when they put out images of barely - clothed well - toned women .
Danica will make more money ( and the exposure will give her more opportunities to leverage brand Danica in future commercial ventures ) .
But like David Beckham , Danica will face more and more criticism over her abilities as a race driver .
Then again , the speculation has done little to dampen Beckham ’s value as a soccer player ( you can debate it in the comments below ) and has done nothing to dampen his commercial value ( obviously , ads like these help ) .
when you look at the respect David Beckham has and the space he has made for himself in history ( any other soccer player with the same ability but minus the brand would not get even 1/1000th of the attention – and Beckham ’s a very talented player ) , who can fault Danica for going down the same road ?
But the company , which is expanding in the United States and in China , has taken advantage of the agency ’s help to open operations in Shanghai and New York .
“ They ’ve helped us with introductions to government officials in China , and we ’re in the office space on Park Avenue , expanding our systems in the States , ” Mr. Mooney said .
Government help for Irish entrepreneurs grew out of an overall economic policy devised in 1987 that reduced personal taxes , said Kevin Sherry , a director of Enterprise Ireland who specializes in start - up companies .
Income tax rates in Ireland today are 20 percent on the first $ 50,000 of income and 41 percent on income above that .
But there are value - added taxes of 21 percent levied on all goods and transactions , with the exception of health and medical services , children ’s clothing and food .
The tax on corporate profits , though , is 12.5 percent , which is an incentive to own a business .
And government helps out .
“ We have helped over 300 people or groups in the last dozen years or so , ” Mr. Sherry said .
Enterprise Ireland has also put up initial capital for venture investment funds and supports research and development .
“ We must support new approaches , nanotechnology , biotechnology and other sciences , ” Mr. Sherry said , “ because we cannot succeed in the future using what got us here in the past . ”
Colm O’Gorman , who teaches entrepreneurship in master of business administration courses at Dublin City University , said the government agency is at the heart of several trends .
Enterprise Ireland “ supports research and development at Irish companies and universities , ” Professor O’Gorman said , “ and it is encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs , as the role of women has changed in Irish life . ”
One reason for many changes in Ireland is its membership in the European Union , which has brought new perspectives and regulations from its governing councils in Brussels .
A rare 3 - foot - long spitting earthworm that smells like lilies is at the heart of a legal battle between conservationists and the U.S. government .
When taxonomist Frank Smith discovered the giant Palouse earthworm ( Driloleirus americanus ) in 1897 by , he described it as " very abundant . "
Nowadays , however , sightings of the worm are rare .
The only recent confirmed worm sighting was made in 2005 by a University of Idaho researcher .
Before that , the giant worm had not been spotted in 17 years , since 1988 .
It reportedly grows up to three feet long and has a peculiar flowery smell ( Driloleirus is Latin for " lily - like worm " ) .
The cream - colored or pinkish - white worm lived in permanent burrows as deep as 15 feet and spat at attackers .
" This worm is the stuff that legends and fairy tales are made of .
A pity we 're losing it , " said Steve Paulson , a board member of Friends of the Clearwater , a conservation group based in Moscow , Idaho .
Unlike the European earthworms now common across the United States , the giant Palouse earthworm is native to the Americas .
Specifically , the giant worm dwelled in the prairies of the Palouse , the area of the northwest United States .
The Palouse has been dramatically altered by farming practices , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted .
" The giant Palouse earthworm is extremely rare and faces substantial risk of extinction , " said Noah Greenwald , a conservation biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity , a conservation group based in Tucson , Ariz .
Conservation groups had petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 to protect the worm as an endangered species .
The World Conservation Union currently ranks the worm as " vulnerable " — one step away from " endangered " in terms of conservation status .
Last October , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided the worm did not warrant protection as an endangered species .
Still , " we share the petitioners ' concern for the species , " said Susan Martin , supervisor for the Upper Columbia Fish and Wildlife Office in Spokane , Washington , in a press release .
" They do seem to be rare , but rarity does n't mean endangered , " U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Tom Buckley told LiveScience .
" They may be in trouble , but we 'd need more information to know , and based on the information we received , there 's not enough scientific data out there to make a determination . "
Greenwald countered , saying , " Rarity is certainly a factor in species endangerment .
It 's possible to have a species that is rare but not endangered , that only occurred naturally in one or two places , with those places being entirely secure , but that is not at all the case here with the giant Palouse earthworm .
Its presumed habitat is almost gone — something like 3 percent of the native Palouse prairies is left . "
Now conservation groups have filed suit to overturn the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's decision with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington .
" The earthworm needs the protection of the Endangered Species Act to survive , " Paulson said .
The conservation groups note that in seeking protection for the worm , they are also hoping to defend the prairies of the Palouse .
" In order to protect endangered species , you have to protect the places in which they live , " Greenwald told LiveScience .
" In seeking to protect the earthworm , we want to protect those remnants of the Palouse prairie that still exist . "
Editorial The Internet is Self - Correcting Compared to TV , the Internet makes it extremely easy to expose oneself to a humongous variety of perspectives and opinions from across the political spectrum and around the globe .
By Ryan McGreal
Published June 27 , 2007
The various platforms that make up the Internet - the World Wide Web , email , Usenet and IRC - have collectively been a prolific source of misinformation , urban legends , hoaxes , frauds , and other falsehoods .
From a seemingly endless stream of email hoaxes and scams to outrageous , too - good - to - be - true stories that get passed around the world before anyone discovers they 're phony , the ease , power and reach of the Internet has proven to be a godsend for perpetuating misleading memes .
It gets more serious than mis-identified sheep and airport hijinx .
The hard - to - kill fiction that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wants to " wipe Israel off the map , " for a frightening example , has hardened many a North American resolve to escalate the war of words between Iran and the USA .
Self - Correcting Over Time
It 's easy to dismiss the Internet as a vast , writhing grapevine of nonsense and rubbish , and many traditional journalists do just that .
At the same time , the Internet has some advantages over other media that give it a real edge in correcting its own errors .
In short , despite the proliferation of humbug , the Internet tends to be self - correcting over time .
The very power that makes it easy to spread nonsense also makes it much easier to fact - check , chase leads , study in - depth , and debunk falsehoods .
Every time I get an email that looks the tiniest bit suspicious ( say , Bill Gates wants to pay me to test a new type of email message ) , the first thing I do is check Snopes , an urban legends clearinghouse , to see if it has already been investigated .
Similarly , when I read a newspaper report that sounds hard to believe or makes reference to a third party study , I run a quick google search to see if I can find the source of the claim .
In the traditional press , by contrast , corrections rarely get anything like the coverage that original incorrect reports get .
If they 're published at all , they appear days later in small format in a different part of the paper , with no easy way to reference back to the original report .
This is a limitation of the medium itself , though various news agencies do a better or worse job at openness , transparency and accountability within the means available to them .
TV Makes You Dumber
Compared to TV news , of course , the Internet is a teasure trove of information , discourse , debate , argument and error - checking .
TV News has the dubious distinction of actually making people who rely on it for information dumber .
The issue has been studied exhaustively by the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) in a large number of polls conducted since early 2003 .
Here 's one of their studies on the correlation between the way a person gets their news and the number of misconceptions they have about Iraq .
You can find plenty more on the PIPA website .
A very recent poll by Pew Research Centre found that people who read newspapers and watch The Daily Show are the most knowledgeable about political affairs , while people who get their , er , information from FOX News were the least knowledgeable .
An older study from Leeds University on knowledgeability about the first Gulf War found :
TV news seems to confuse more than it clarifies .
Even after controlling for all other variables , we discovered that the correlation between TV watching and knowledge was actually quite often a negative one .
... [ O ] verall , the more TV people watched , the less they knew .
A September 2003 study of CNN found that a given hour of broadcasting contained less than minutes of actual news reporting .
The rest of the time was taken with repeating headlines , informercials , commercials , tabloid stories , talk show content , and so on .
Varieties of Faux News
Another problem is the documented rise in fake news , government and / or corporate propaganda that is delivered to TV networks and broadcast as if they produced it themselves .
As traditional news providers are under more competition from new technology news providers , they are increasingly turning , according to the latest annual study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism , to business models , niche marketing , and so on to compete .
As a result , the news they provide is gradually becoming less straight and more entertaining , which risks making it less useful .
The consequences of this narrowing of focus involve more risk than we sense the business has considered .
Concepts like hyper localism , pursued in the most literal sense , can be marketing speak for simply doing less .
Branding can also be a mask for bias .
This is also evident in the vast increase in so - called " celebrity news " , which consumes a remarkable share of " news " reporting with entertaining fluff that distracts attention and crowds out reporting on events that can actually affect people 's lives .
More TV = Less Knowledge
The negative corelation between TV viewing and accurate knowledge seems to apply more generally .
Here are just a few examples :
A study by the American Journal of Managed Care found that TV news , and especially local TV news , does a poor job of reporting health news .
From their conclusion :
Local television news devotes significant airtime to health stories , yet few newscasts provide useful information , and some stories with factually incorrect information and potentially dangerous advice were aired .
Another study , this time from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , found that the more TV children and adolescents watch , the more confused they are about what foods are healthy to eat .
Single - Source Bias
It 's not too hard to conclude that when you get most of your news from a single source - a single newspaper or a single TV station - you 're going to miss a lot .
If you get your news from a constellation of sources , which is most easily achieved via the Internet , it 's a lot easier to get the variety , cross-checking , back - and - forth dialogue , reader responses , and so on , that are required to catch and debunk errors .
I 'm not aware of any controlled studies on the superiority of the Internet as a broad - spectrum news source , but consider the following data points :
Much of the content of news websites is produced by conventional newsmedia ( newspaper , magazines , and TV ) as an online projection of their traditional news gathering and reporting business .
Most of the content of blogs / social websites cites its sources .
In other words , you can check if an article really said what a commentator claims it said with a click of a button .
When you get your news online , it 's a lot easier to get news from a very wide variety of sources .
Social networking sites like Reddit , news aggregators like Google News and Yahoo !
News , and RSS readers make this very easy .
To be sure , it 's possible to spend all of your time in a single online news " ghetto " ; but if you decide you want to diversify , it 's a lot easier than with print newspapers or TV networks .
Multiple Sources Reduce Error
I can read the Globe and Mail , the Guardian , the Economist , the Independent , the Asia Times , the Sydney Morning Herald , the New York Times , the LA Times , the Toronto Star , Le Monde , Der Spiegel , Ha'aretz , the Washington Post , the Christian Science Monitor , the BBC , the CBC , CNN , FOX News , MSNBC , ABC , CBS , and so on , all from the comfort of my desk .
I can also read Snopes , Slate , Alternet , Common Dreams ( in which human editors aggregate articles from other sources ) , Talking Points Memo , Andrew Sullivan 's blog , Editor & Publisher , and a whole host of other sites that are operated and edited by writers , journalists , columnists , and so on .
The range of professionalism , accuracy , accountability and so on is an awful lot larger on the internet than it is on TV ; but while the latter is fairly standardized and uniform , it 's also uniformly bad .
The former , by contrast , ranges from appallingly bad to excellent with everything in between .
Talk Back
The real strength of the online media is that they are interactive and dynamic .
Media entities endlessly cross-reference each other through hyperlinks , RSS aggregators , technorati - style tags , trackbacks , and , of course , journalists , columnists , and bloggers with unprecedented power to search , collate , challenge , and so on .
Finally , readers themselves can and enthusiastically do perform all of these activities as well , generating yet another layer of research , fact - checking and accountability .
In turn , readers also argue and fact - check each other 's contributions and the writers get in on the act as well .
Do n't underestimate the importanc of this point : as the editor of a volunteer - based online civic affairs magazine , I can state unequivocally that we learn at least as much from our readers as from our own investigations .
They 've more than doubled our capacity to report events , analyze issues , and debate policies .
Escaping Partisan Ghettoes
The result is that it 's comparatively difficult for a demonstrably false claim to survive for very long on the internet .
Whole websites exist for the singular purpose of debunking false claims , from Snopes to the rabid fact - checkers on Wikipedia ( e.g. in the past few months , I 've learned from Wikipedia that " May you live in interesting times " is not a real Chinese curse , in an article that cites its sources ) .
Of course , some people still manage it , mostly by staying inside the warm cocoon of , say , Free Republic , Little Green Footballs and the like ( I mention them not because they 're right - wing but because they so proudly hold the truth in contempt ) , but it takes an especially virulent strain of confirmation bias to block out the blizzard of inconvenient countervailing data points and plausible systems of connections among them .
It is extremely easy to expose oneself to a humongous variety of perspectives and opinions from across the political spectrum and around the globe via the internet , through social networking sites , RSS feeds , news aggregators , keyword searches , and so on ; whereas it is difficult and requires a sustained act of will not to do so .

How Things Work
This post is written by digby .
For unknown technical reasons , I 've been unable to log on to my own name this morning ... d
My house was burglarized over the holidays , and after the first few days of feeling nothing , I am now full of fear and anxiety , and can't stop talking about it .
I 've told the entire story to the guy repairing a street lamp across from my house , the city employee pruning bushes down the road and every single solitary person I know , even if I know them only in passing .
I am in über - vent mode , and woe be the person who comes up to me these days and says , " How are you ? " because they get trapped for 30 minutes listening to every detail of the break - in , the reaction of everyone in the household and the list of things we might or might not do to become safe again — Alarm system ?
Move ?
Get a dog ?
As I cornered the first 10 or 20 people and told them my story , I figured they 'd soon get sick of the sound of my high - pitched , anxiety - toned voice and back away , but interestingly enough , no one did .
Instead , they listened .
Everyone really listened .
And to my shock , each person responded with a similarly upsetting story of robbery , theft , mugging , or in one case , a house fire .
Some horror stories happened recently , and the speaker was still reeling , but others happened long ago .
Nevertheless , unearthing that bit of ugly personal history once again made those people reel too .
Their eyes grew wild and they looked about in fear , as if the robber were right behind me .
At first , I thought people were trying to steal my thunder , moving the spotlight from my trauma to theirs , but it happened so often and with so many different people that I finally realized sharing the tale of some scary event is the dark side of human fellowship .
And that 's empathy .
The human capacity for empathy — feeling what others feel — is , in fact , not really designed to share happiness .
That would be too easy .
And sharing good news often produces jealousy in others rather than congratulations , and jealous is n’t exactly a foundation for connection .
But with bad events , no one is jealous ; hearing something awful about one 's worst enemy even brings no joy , only fear that it might happen to you as well .
Empathy , in all its negative glory , is about feeling badly when others feel badly , feeling it in the gut and then giving a look that says , " I know just how you feel . "
And maybe that 's why I have been telling the store of our burglary over and over — it 's just been a very human way to hold on to others when I feel like I am slipping away .
Supposing that you ’re less than omnivorous , you may not always be in the mood to eat insects .
You might be vegetarian , or your religion tells you that you should n’t eat insects , or maybe you ’re just on a strict non -bug - eating diet .
Here are a couple of simple hints to help you identify foods that contain bugs , illustrated with a few common supermarket candy items .
( Note : This article has been moved here from Instructables , where it was previously published .
It has also been slightly updated . )
Prologue :
This a moth .
Do n’t eat it .
It seems that some people will eat just about anything .
If you are of the highly omnivorous persuasion , congratulations .
This story wo n’t be any help at all , so please run along and eat some cute animals of some sort .
Let ’s be perfectly clear about this : this article is titled “ How to eat fewer insects . ”
It is meant to help you eat fewer ( not zero ) insects IF that is your choice .
We do not make any judgements or claims about whether , when , or how many insects you should eat .
Yes , lots of people like to eat insects , and lots of people do n’t like to eat insects .
However , please keep in mind that it is not the topic under discussion here and do n’t leave a comment about how much you love to eat insects .
( We get it already , okay ? )
If you ’re still interested , let ’s look at a box of candy next :
The big secret : Look at the ingredients .
Just about every kid raised in the US in the last thirty years has eaten these .
And yet , just look at what ’s in the list of ingredients : Carmine .
Carmineis a pigment produced by cochineal insects , which are ground up and purified to produce the pigment .
A less purified form of the pigment , called cochineal extract , is also sometimes found in foods .
Carmine , also called carminic acid , is a powerful red pigment that is found in a wide assortment of places where crushed insects ( presumably ) do not belong : Yoplait strawberry yogurt , Tropicana grapefruit juice , maraschino cherries , and it might make you question just why pink lemonade needs to be pink .
[ Update : Campari used to be on that list , but we have received confirmation
that “ Campari ceased using carmine in the vast majority of its worldwide
production ( including the US ) in 2006 . ” ]
Because carmine is a “ natural ” ( not synthetic ) additive , government regulations on its labeling are lax , which is quite surprising since some people may suffer severe anaphylactic shock upon eating these or other insects .
Not all products containing carmine label it at all , some merely say “ added color , ” “ natural color ” or ( also surprisingly ) “ artificial color . ”
Another lovely euphemism
Confectioner ’s glaze , food glaze , resinous glaze , and pharmaceutical glaze are pretty names for shellac , the excretion of a certain type of beetle .
While perhaps that ’s not so very different from honey , the difference is that shellac is harvested beetles - and - all . ( Yum ! ) ( Confusing the issue is that a corn protein , zein , may also be labeled as “ Confectioner ’s glaze . ”
While I ’ve seen a great many companies that make and use shellac - based confectioner ’s glaze , I have yet to see any that use a zein base .
If you know of any examples of zein - based confectioner ’s glaze , please leave it as a comment ! )

The best of both worlds
I have fond memories of eating Good & Plenty as a kid ; however , those were somewhat colored ( pink ? ) by recently noticing what ’s on the label : carmine and shellac , this time disguised as “ RESINOUS GLAZE .
” Here ’s what really gets me :
That little “ kosher ” indicator below the ingredient list .
According to the Wikipedia article on kosher diets , “ The consumption of insects involves five violations of Torah law , so according to Jewish Law it is a greater sin than the consumption of pork . ”
Religion and religious law aside , many people would agree that eating insects is worse than eating pork .
Exactly what are these Hershey folks trying to pull here ?
( And as long as we ’re kicking The Hershey Company while they ’re down , what ’s with that grainy texture in Special Dark ? )
Notes Added : ( 1. )
No , wikipedia is not the final authority on jewish law– nor is anything else ( that is n’t subject to interpretation ) .
( 2. ) Even grasshoppers are n’t necessarily an exception .
( 3. ) We do n’t eat a kosher diet and are n’t experts .
This kosher thing on the boxes just strikes us as weird , that ’s all .
End of story .
( 4 . ) Dude , END OF STORY , okay ?
What ’s in jelly beans ?
Jelly Bean is my cat .
She eats the bugs that she sometimes catches .
Likewise , the jelly beans pictured here contain insects .
Look at the last line of the list of ingredients : Confectioner ’s glaze .
The list of ingredients is extremely long , but cut the guys some slack ; that ’s a comprehensive list for the ingredients of a lot of different flavors of beans .
Interestingly , these are also labeled kosher .
Even more interesting , they are certified by the very same folks that certified the Good & Plenty .
( I see a pattern here .
Look for certified kosher bacon next year ! )
What ’s in other confections ?
The degree to which ingredients like carmine and confectioner ’s glaze are integrated into things that we eat is quite surprising .
Once you know what to look for , you ’ll start noticing them all the time .
Hopefully , you ’re now armed just a little bit better to protect yourself against unwittingly eating insects .

Well , no one wants to say it but you will be reading this shortly : The Golden Globes and the Academy Awards will be cancelled .
On Monday December 17th , the WGA turned down requests for waivers by the Oscars and the Golden Globes to put those telecasts on air without the Guild ’s writers .
With the rejection of the waivers for the Academy Awards ( ABC ) , set for Sunday February 24th , and the much faster approaching Golden Globes ( NBC ) , set for January 13th , the WGA has essentially cancelled both awards shows by its actions .
The SAG Awards did receive a waiver and are scheduled for Jan. 27th .
But the other two awards shows will be cancelled and no one or should I say everyone in the industry is avoiding the mention of this 600 pound LaMotta because a ) they are holding out the now near impossible hope for a settlement and b ) no one wants to interrupt the cash flow from the media promotions of the potential nominees .
That is unless they want to go the route of the People ’s Choice Awards which announced it will air its show Jan 8th ( CBS ) in a 2 hour “ magazine ” format of prerecorded videos and no audience yet featuring Queen Latifah as the prerecorded " host . "
The Oscars and the Golden Globes will not play that game .
Leslie Unger , spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said , “ It ’s very difficult for me to envision that we would follow the model . ”
But the folks who put on the Oscars and the Globes still feel they will somehow put those shows up despite their failure to receive the requested Guild waiver .
It will never happen .
Here ’s why .
No publicist is gonna send their client to run the gauntlet of Writer ’s Guild ’s strikers who will be on hand to make things extremely impossible for any stars who have the nerve to cross the picket lines into the event .
No stars .
No Oscars .
No Globes .
Nerves are already frayed .
Last week a WGA member wrote an angry letter to Peter Bart , editor of Variety , the entertainment industry bible , demanding he cancel her subscription due to what she perceived as pro-studio editorial bias .
Variety makes the bulk of their ad revenue during the annual awards season .
I find the reply amusing .
Peter Bart replied :
Dear Nicole Yorkin ,
I respectfully think you 've drunk the Kool - Aid -- Variety 's coverage has been objective .
What motivation would we have to invoke a bias ?
Must every Guild ( or every company ) be validated for their every demand ?
Peter Bart
The reason I find that amusing is that “ drinking the Kool - aid ” has become such a common refrain in our vernacular .
We use it for all sorts of arguments and jokes .
But mostly the phrase is used on the Left to describe right wing nuts that goose step in unison to their own weird ideology .
Well , as most people know , the saying dates back to the 1978 Jonestown Massacre and the poison laced Kool - aid ( actually a product called Flavor - aid which was laced with Valium , chloral hydrate and cyanide ) distributed by Rev. Jim Jones to his willful followers .
900 of them committed suicide .
In 1980 , CBS made a great Movie of the Week called Guyana Tragedy : The Story of Jim Jones .
So what the hell does this have to do with the award shows being cancelled due to the WGA strike ?
In Guyana Tragedy the lead was brilliantly played by none other than Powers Boothe , who after being nominated for an Emmy for the role was one of the only nominees to show up to get the award during the then - ongoing Screen Actors Guild strike .
His immortal quote , “ This may be either the bravest moment of my career or the dumbest , ” will live in infamy .
It was the dumbest .
Insiders now admit that crossing the picket line destroyed his career .
Kind of an interesting choice of words on Mr. Bart ’s part , do n’t you think ?
No publicist , manager or agent wants their client to be the next Powers Boothe and that in its essence is why the Oscars and the Golden Globes will be cancelled .
If you ’ve ever overclocked a processor , or been around people who have , odds are you ’ve heard people talk about ' upping the core- voltage ' before .
In fact , nowadays it ’s pretty much a no - brainer .
Just about anyone who overclocks anything knows that , often , an extra bit of voltage will help a component run at speeds it would n’t before , be it a CPU , video card , or even memory .
But do you know why ?
It ’s one of those things we tend to take for granted .
We do n’t know why it works , all we know is that it does work , and that ’s good enough for us .
And that ’s just fine , because in most cases , it really does n’t matter why it works , just that it does ( that ’s engineering in a nutshell ) .
Unless , of course , you ’re curious , in which case , we ’ve got an answer for you !
A common misconception is that increasing the voltage gives the CPU the added ‘ power ’ it needs to run at higher speeds .
While it 's true that power varies with voltage , it ’s actually the current demands of the processor that increase with speed , not voltage demands ( when you overclock a CPU , it requires more current at the same voltage , not more voltage with the same current ) .
It does n't need more power , it needs more current , so feeding it more voltage in an effort to increase power wo n't help .
So why , then , does increasing the voltage a bit often help the CPU run faster , and with more stability ?
Read on , and we ’ll explain .
Many parents want to know the sex of their unborn child
The kit , sold by DNA Worldwide for £ 189 , is controversial .
Critics claim it may prompt parents to abort if they are unhappy with the test result .
The company rejected these claims , saying the early results , obtained from a finger - prick of blood , allow parents more time to plan for their baby .
It says the test is 99 % accurate and offers a refund for wrong predictions .
The concept of an early pregnancy sex test is not new - last year the UK's Institute of Child Health successfully trialled a similar " seven week " test .
But this was used for women at risk of having babies affected by disorders that usually only affect boys , such as Duchene muscular dystrophy .
This test is very dangerous .
It would inevitably lead to babies being aborted simply for not being the ' required ' sex
Michaela Aston of the pro-life charity LIFE
Currently , some hospitals will tell a couple the sex of their child , if they want , at their 20 week ultrasound scan .
But David Nicholson , director of DNA Worldwide , said parents are excited by the pregnancy and do n't want to have wait until their 20 - week scan to find out .
Once a woman has taken the test , she sends her sample directly to the company 's laboratory for analysis and will receive the result in the post or can access it online using a protected password .
The test looks for DNA from the baby in the mother 's blood .
If it picks up a Y - chromosome , that means a baby boy can be " confidently " predicted .
If there is no Y - chromosome DNA , the company can state " with equal confidence " that the baby will be a girl , the company says .
Ethical concerns
Campaigners were worried about the possible ramifications .
Julia Millington of the Prolife Alliance said : " There is a real risk that some people would choose to abort babies of a certain gender . "
Michaela Aston of the pro-life charity LIFE said : " This test is very dangerous .
It would inevitably lead to babies being aborted simply for not being the ' required ' sex . "
She rejected the notion that the test would allow parents more time to plan for their baby 's arrival , arguing that the needs of baby boys and girls were identical .
She was also concerned it would lead to some women in some countries being coerced into having abortions .
Mr Nicholson said surveys of the company 's US customers , who have been able to buy the test since 2006 , suggested these concerns were unfounded .
But he said he welcomed an open and wider debate on this topic .
He stressed that any couple wanting to find out the sex of their child for medical or genetic reasons should seek the help of a medical practitioner who could provide counselling - something not provided alongside the company 's test .
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists believes sex selection for non-medical purposes is inappropriate .
A spokesman added : " Focus should remain firmly on the health and care of the mother and developing baby , rather than gender . "
230 + Attend Olympia ’s Impeachment Party
by Mollie | www.portlandimc.org
It was party time in Olympia on Friday , December 28th .
Over 230 people kindred spirits who believe in our Constitution gathered to enjoy great food and music .
It was also a time to recognize the courageous work of Washington State Senators Karen Fraser and Eric Oemig in supporting impeachment .
But the best news : they will put impeachment of Dick Cheney on the Washington Legislature ’s table in 2008 !
“ There are times in history that a President and Vice President so abuse their powers ” ” and sadly , this is such a time ” ” that we have to remove them from office , ” said Washington Senator Eric Oemig .
He had sponsored a resolution ( SJN 8016 ) calling for the impeachment of Bush / Cheney in the last legislative session .
While a hearing was held , it proved impossible to bring to the floor for a vote because of a technicality .
Oemig pointed out that the challenge of impeachment is that there are so many violations of law that is overwhelming .
That list continued to grow over the past year as more information has come out over the last year about torture , the extent of the illegal spying and even lying about outing a CIA operative .
What is worse is that the President and Vice President continue to run the same plays .
For example , the President and Vice President ignore the NIE reports that state Iran has no nuclear weapons program and go around scaring the American people with the terror of mushroom clouds .
The President and the Vice President threaten war , with all options on the table , despite the fact there is no evidence that Iran poses a menace .
Oemig dismissed the idea that it is too late for impeachment .
“ It is never to late to do the right thing , ” he stated .
He took aim at Democratic Presidential hopeful Joe Biden , who says that there is n’t time to impeach Bush and Cheney right now .
However , if the attack Iran , well then , says Biden , they have to be impeached .
Oemig stated that this position makes no sense .
“ It is like telling my 2 - year old , ‘ if you do that one more time … ‘”
“ The Constitution is under attack and it is bleeding , ” said Oemig .
But Congress has not done its job .
It has not acted to stop the bleeding .
He suggested that it was like taking a bleeding person to the emergency room and having them refuse treatment because they had so much other stuff to do .
No one should be surprised , he said , that he would once again introduce an impeachment resolution in the legislature this session .
In some ways , the reason for fighting to preserve the Constitution is quite simple .
Oemig does not want to have to tell his child that when the Constitution was being dismantled ” ” when our country was engaged in an illegal war , torture , warrantless spying ” ” he did not stand up and fight to preserve the Constitution .
As a pragmatic realist , he said , it makes sense focus on Cheney first and that is what he will do from day 1 on the legislative session .
The crowd gave a deafening roar of approval .
This was the gift they wanted this holiday season .
Senator Karen Fraser spoke briefly .
She told the audience that she co-sponsored the impeachment bill ( SJM 8016 ) last session because she was concerned about the dramatic changes to the Constitution under this administration .
Her support for that bill reflected her own assessment of the dangerous path we are now on but also to give voice to her constituents who have contacted her with their concerns .
“ Many people came to her quietly that they were afraid of the federal government , ” she stated .
“ This fear of government is disturbing . ”
She encouraged the people in the audience to continue to educate others on the issues surrounding impeachment and to remember that the elected officials do pay attention .
They need to know the facts , such as which laws have been broken and they need to get a sense of public sentiment .
A professional poll on impeachment among Washington voters would be very persuasive .
Senator Fraser handled some tough questions from the crowd , who were still angry over U.S. Senator Patty Murray ’s and Representative Jay Inslee ’s role in stopping an impeachment resolution in the Washington House last session .
Others voiced frustration with U.S. Representatives Baird and Smith , who dismiss impeachment .
Fraser did not comment on the action or inactions of her fellow Democrats .
Instead , she reiterated the need for people to continue to educate the public and elected officials and to use the ballot box .
“ Voting is more powerful than most people think , ” she stated .
Linda Boyd , who heads up Washington for Impeachment out of Bellevue , said that impeachment is a grassroots movement and there are groups like this all across the country .
Like the people at tonight ’s party , they are doing whatever they can to protect the Constitution .
She encouraged people to get both Democratic and Republican parties in the legislative districts to pass impeachment resolutions .
She also was looking forward to the impeachment work in the state legislature and asked people to be prepared to do what they can .
“ You are here in Olympia and have access that most people around the state do not have , ” she said .
“ Your actions can speak for many of us who cannot travel to Olympia . ”
Linda spoke about the need to get the attention of those who represent us in Washington , DC .
The people are angry that their voices are not being heard .
“ I am pleased to tell you that Cheryl Crist is seriously considering running against Brian Baird in the Democratic primary , ” she told the audience .
Cheryl rose to a standing ovation .
It was another gift this holiday season for those who have begun to lose faith in the political system .
But this was mostly a party .
It brought together people that had not previously been involved in any of the impeachment efforts over the past year .
They gathered is small groups to talk and enjoy great food and drinks .
The balloons and holiday flowers created a festive ambience and credit goes to Jennifer Griffis who created this magic .
Great food was donated by many local businesses ( Old School Pizzeria , Shellfish Growers for Impeachment , Olympia Coffee Roasting Company , and Fist Tale Ales ) .
The bands ( Citizens Band , Street Karaoke Project , Bevy and the Peace Bandits ) had people rocking .
“ Who knew impeaching Bush and Cheney could be so much fun , ” said Glen Anderson , member of Olympia ’s Citizens ’ Movement to Impeach Bush / Cheney .
The planning committee did an amazing job of pulling the event together and creating a joyful experience in what has been a bleak 7 years .
Kudos to Becky Liebman , Charlie Stephens , Glen Aderson , Jerry Smith , Kerri Girffis , Lila Muller and Mark Muller .
Thanks also to the many anonymous volunteers who pitched in to make this a successful party !
Everyone emphasized that there is much that can be done .
“ We can stop the reign , ” said emcee Jerry Smith , playing after a Credence Clearwater song played by the band .
The organizers provided a list of things people can do .
“ We must resist the disempowering rhetoric that there is nothing we can do , ” reminded Linda Boyd .
For those of you inclined to add “ Impeachment ” to your New Year ’s Resolutions , here are some actions you can take :
Â· The Citizens ’ Movement to Impeach Bush / Cheney is gearing up for the 2008 legislative session as well as working on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee to begin the investigation of Dick Cheney ( H Res 799 ) . .
They will meet on Monday , January 14th at 7:00 p.m. at the Olympia Center , 222 Columbian NW , downtown Olympia .
If you want to get involved , now is the time .
Members of the group are also available to speak about impeachment to your neighbors and groups , so please contact them .
There are also dvds available that have been very effective in laying out the case for impeachment and you can order them from Glen Anderson at 360 491-9093 .
Â· The Thurston County Democrats will be voting on an impeachment resolution at their January 28th meeting , 7 p.m. at the Thurston County Court House .
If you are a member , please come to vote .
Â· Write letters to the editor .
Keep them short ( check limits .
The Olympian is 250 words ) .
Â· Sign on - line petition that Congressman Robert Wexler ( member of the House Judiciary Committee who is gathering support to begin investigating Cheney ) at : www.wexlerwantshearings.com
Â· Let you elected officials know that you are concerned about the dismantling of the Constitution by the President and Vice President .
They have amassed far too much power at the expense of our rights ” ” no president and vice president should get away with lying about the need for war , illegally spying on citizens , arresting anyone they say is an “ enemy combatant ” and holding them without due process and without their right to habeas corpus , and allowing the use of torture .
If that is not enough , their efforts to dismantle our system of divided power ( the 3 co-equal branches of government ) to create a “ unitary executive ” form of government ( think dictator here ) should be of concern to every American .
At the national level : call , write , email and tell them you want them to support the House Resolution calling for an impeachment investigation of Dick Cheney : .
Toll free number : 800 828-0498 :
Chair of the House Judiciary Committee : John Conyers 202 255-5162
Congressman Brian Baird : 360 352-9768 email : [ email protected ]
Congressman Adam Smith , toll - free : 888 764-8409 email : [ email protected ]
Congressman Norm Dicks 253 593-6536 [ email protected ]
Â· Contact you legislative representatives and ask them to support the impeachment resolution .
Unlike other “ memorials ” , when a state passes a resolution calling for an impeachment investigation , it is treated as if a U.S. Representative introduced it .
It is treated seriously an sent to the House Judiciary Committee .
Yes , there is no guarentee that they will act on it but we believe that they must continue to feel the pressure .
At the end of the day , most incumbents want to be re-elected and impeachment will be a key issue in how many people will vote in the 2008 election .
o Last year , they legislators received more emails and calls about impeachment than any other issue .
It was enough to get their attention .
This year , the people need to get them to act .
Â· Be ready to come to the Washington State legislature to attend rally and hearing on impeachment as well as talk to elected officials and their staff about impeachment .
Â· Get cities and organizations to support an impeachment resolution .
( check websites for model resolutions : www.citizensimpeach.org and www.washingtonforimpeachment.org
Â· Hand an impeachment sign in your window , wear an impeachment pin around town , and / or put an impeachment bumper sticker on your car .

For the first time , human embryonic stem cells have been obtained without having to destroy the embryos they came from .
The breakthrough sidesteps the primary ethical objection to human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) research – that embryos must perish to yield up hESCs .
The new technique generates stem cells by extracting and culturing a single embryonic cell , leaving the remaining embryo to develop normally .
The US researchers involved demonstrated that the procedure worked a year ago , but without proving that embryos could survive the process .
Now , they have shown unequivocally that the embryos survive and could develop to full term .
Advertisement
“ These are the first hESCs created without destroying embryos , ” says Robert Lanza , chief scientific officer at Advanced Cell Technology , the company that pioneered the breakthrough in Worcester , Massachusetts .
Ethical approval
The hope now is that President George W Bush will now lift heavy restrictions on federally funded hESC research that he imposed in 2001 because of his own objections to embryo research .
“ It ’s here and now , and could increase massively the number of stem cells available , ” says Lanza , who wants Bush to give immediate ethical approval for new cell lines to be produced using the ACT approach .
“ We could triple the number of hESC lines available within a few months , ” says Lanza .
Since Bush ’s clampdown in 2001 , only 22 cell lines have been available for use by US government - funded researchers , but most are of such poor quality they are useless , so fresh supplies are desperately needed .
“ Hopefully the president will do the right thing , ” says Lanza .
“ We ’ve been in dialogue with the White House , and it ’s our understanding that they would wait until a peer - reviewed paper appeared before approving our approach . ”
That paper has now appeared , in the journal Cell Stem Cell ( DOI : 10.1016/j.xtem.2007.12013 ) .
In it , Lanza and his colleagues describe how they produced four new lines of hESCs from blastomeres – single undifferentiated cells that make up very early embryos .
Efficient process
By nourishing each blastomere with special blends of nutrients or growth factors , ACT produced new colonies of embryonic stem cells and demonstrated that these could be converted into all tissues of the body .
By introducing a new nutrient , a protein called laminin found in the base layer of skin tissue , they massively improved the efficiency with which they converted blastomeres stably into hESCs .
Importantly , a fifth line has been produced using ACT ’s method by Olga Genbacev ’s team at the University of California at San Francisco , proving the procedure is replicable .
Despite praising the breakthrough , some researchers claim that it panders to people whose objections to current methods of extracting hESCs are morally groundless .
“ It ’s designed to appease people who oppose embryo research despite the fact that thousands of IVF embryos are discarded each year , ” says Stephen Minger , director of the Stem Cell Biology Laboratory at King ’s College London , UK .
Limited lines
Lanza accepts this to an extent , but says the objections have to be overcome to kick - start US stem cell research .
“ The clock is ticking , and it keeps getting held up and held up , ” he says .
Evan Snyder of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla , California , applauds the breakthrough , but says that moral opponents might still not be satisfied .
“ Can one prove that the biopsied embryos , if implanted , would yield normal individuals ? ” he asks .
“ Opponents might claim even sillier arguments : that the embryos are donating cells without ‘ informed consent ’ , ” Snyder adds .
The other shortcoming of the technique is that it cannot provide stem cells matched to each individual patient , whereas two other technologies have the potential to do using the patient ’s own skin or other cells – although each has its own limitations .
Lanza accepts that ACT ’s procedure cannot be tailored to each patient , but estimates that around 100 different lines grown in stem cell banks would be enough to tissue - match and treat most individuals .

Focus , America !
Do not lose track of the goal .
The goal is to expose the elite traitors in our " elected " government for the terrorists that they are and to drag the bums out of office , not to dive headfirst into an elections game that only serves to keep we the people distracted while the thugs in office use our Constitution for toilet paper .
Would I like to see someone get elected that represents the people , makes good on his / her promises , and tells the corporatist leaches that are sucking the world dry to take a hike ?
Sure , I would .
Do I think that a person like that has a rat 's hind end chance of succeeding in our present system ?
No .
Maybe if we the people start ignoring this charade of elitist - controlled elections and come together as a shadow government comprised of Americans who give a rat 's hind end about Americans , we might make a dent in the elite corporate structure .
I do n't know .
Is it possible ?
Maybe .
The Banker 's Manifesto is a document that changed the way I think forever :
The Bankers Manifesto of 1892
Revealed by US Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh , SR from Minnesota before the US Congress sometime during his term of office between the years of 1907 and 1917 to warn the citizens .
" We ( the bankers ) must proceed with caution and guard every move made , for the lower order of people are already showing signs of restless commotion .
Prudence will therefore show a policy of apparently yielding to the popular will until our plans are so far consummated that we can declare our designs without fear of any organized resistance .
The Farmers Alliance and Knights of Labor organizations in the United States should be carefully watched by our trusted men , and we must take immediate steps to control these organizations in our interest or disrupt them .
At the coming Omaha Convention to be held July 4th ( 1892 ) , our men must attend and direct its movement , or else there will be set on foot such antagonism to our designs as may require force to overcome .
This at the present time would be premature .
We are not yet ready for such a crisis .
Capital must protect itself in every possible manner through combination ( conspiracy ) and legislation .
The courts must be called to our aid , debts must be collected , bonds and mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible .
When through the process of the law , the common people have lost their homes , they will be more tractable and easily governed through the influence of the strong arm of the government applied to a central power of imperial wealth under the control of the leading financiers .
People without homes will not quarrel with their leaders .
History repeats itself in regular cycles .
This truth is well known among our principal men who are engaged in forming an imperialism of the world .
While they are doing this , the people must be kept in a state of political antagonism .
The question of tariff reform must be urged through the organization known as the Democratic Party , and the question of protection with the reciprocity must be forced to view through the Republican Party .
By thus dividing voters , we can get them to expand their energies in fighting over questions of no importance to us , except as teachers to the common herd .
Thus , by discrete action , we can secure all that has been so generously planned and successfully accomplished . "
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Powerful Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr is expected to extend a six - month ceasefire by his Mehdi Army militia , two senior officials in his movement confirmed for the first time on Thursday .
Supporters of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr display his poster during a rally in Baghdad , November 26 , 2007 .
Sadr is expected to extend a six - month ceasefire by his Mehdi Army militia , two senior officials in his movement confirmed for the first time on Thursday .
REUTERS / Ahmed Malik
They said Sadr had issued a declaration to preachers to be read during midday prayers on Friday at mosques affiliated with the cleric , whose militia was blamed for fuelling sectarian violence with minority Sunni Muslims in 2006 and 2007 .
U.S. officials say the ceasefire has helped to sharply reduce violence in Iraq , and an extension of the truce would be widely welcomed .
“ The general idea is that there will be an extension , ” said one senior official in Sadr ’s movement in Baghdad who declined to be identified or go into detail on the declaration .
“ Sayed ( Sadr ) has distributed sealed envelopes to the imams of the mosques to be read tomorrow .
They can not be opened before tomorrow . ”
Another senior official in Sadr ’s movement , speaking from the holy Shi’ite city of Najaf where Sadr has offices , said the cleric would likely extend the truce for another six months .
Sadr ’s spokesman , Salah al - Ubaidi , has previously said the cleric would issue a statement around February 23 if he was renewing the truce , while silence would mean it was over .
Distribution of Sadr ’s statement to religious leaders seems to indicate the anti-American cleric will renew the truce .
TRUCE DISPUTE
Besides involvement in bitter tit - for - tat sectarian attacks , the Mehdi Army has battled U.S. and Iraqi forces and clashed with rival Shi’ite factions .
The militia launched two uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004 .
Many Mehdi Army members and Sadrist political leaders want the truce scrapped , accusing Iraqi security forces of exploiting it to detain Sadrists , especially in Shi’ite southern Iraq , where rival Shi’ite factions are locked in a struggle for power .
U.S. military commanders say violence in Iraq has dropped 60 percent since June 2007 .
They have attributed that to Sadr ’s ceasefire , the deployment of 30,000 extra U.S. soldiers , and Sunni Arab tribal leaders turning against al Qaeda .
U.S. officials have said they want the government to take advantage of the lull in fighting to continue making progress on laws to reconcile majority Shi’ite and minority Sunni Muslims .
Sadr called the truce after deadly clashes between his militia , Iraqi security forces and the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , a rival Shi’ite faction , in the holy city of Kerbala .
Analysts say he sought to impose order on the unrulier elements of his militia , some of whom have degenerated into gangsterism and organized crime .
It is a powerful force in Baghdad and the southern oil hub of Basra .
The U.S. military has praised Sadr for the truce but pursued what it calls “ rogue ” elements of the Mehdi Army .
It has accused Iran of arming , training and funding these groups .
The International Crisis Group this month warned U.S. forces not to provoke al Sadr into revoking the ceasefire , which it said would be a major setback for Iraq ’s security gains .
The son of a Shi’ite cleric killed under Saddam Hussein , Sadr led two uprisings against the U.S. occupation in 2004 .
He quit the ruling Shi’ite coalition in 2007 after the government failed to set a timetable for a U.S. troop withdrawal .

Especially that part where the Senate has to confirm his appointments .
Remember when he wanted coal industry executive Richard Stickler to head the Mine Safety agency ?
Stickler was turned down by the Senate twice .
So in late 2006 Bush did what he does and gave Stickler a recess appointment .
Now that the recess appointment has expired , Bush has found that by putting " acting " at the beginning of a job title , he can appoint people whenever he likes ?
AFL - CIO Blog :
The recess appointment expired at the end of 2007 .
In a somewhat bizarre chain of events , MSHA removed Stickler ’s bio from the agency ’s website and announced Jan. 3 that Stickler ’s assistant was the acting assistant secretary .
But his tenure was brief : On Jan.
4 , Bush named Stickler the new acting assistant secretary , a move that does not require congressional approval and is likely to last until the end of Bush ’s term .
After press reports that Stickler ’s bio had been removed , it ’s now back online .
Mine Workers ( UMWA ) President Cecil Roberts says : " The appointment of Richard Stickler to be acting assistant secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health , just days after his term in that position expired because he could n’t be confirmed by the U.S. Senate , demonstrates the deep level of contempt the Bush administration holds for the Senate and the constitutional role that body holds . "
Duh .
The study found the more equal couples were the better the sex
A study of 27,000 people aged 40 to 80 in 29 countries also found couples with greater equality in western Europe were more likely to enjoy their sex lives .
Highest satisfaction levels were reported in Austria and Spain and the lowest in the more male - dominated societies of the Middle East and Asia .
The study is due to appear in journal the Archives of Sexual Behaviour .
Women are very sensitive to the quality of a relationship
Professor Laumann
Study author
Study author and professor of sociology at the University of Chicago Professor Edward Laumann said people aged 40 to 80 actually " engaged in a significant amount of sex " .
He suggested this may well be a surprise to their children .
Bristol - based urologist Clive Gingell , who worked on the study , told the Guardian : " The majority of men and women are having an active sexual life past the age of 40 and up to their 80s .
" It 's surprisingly high in all countries , with between 70 % and 80 % of people saying they have had sex in the previous 12 months . "
The researchers looked at the experiences of men and women in countries including China , Japan , Indonesia , Thailand , South Africa , Turkey , Egypt , Morocco , Israel , the United States and most of western Europe .
But the research , which analysed the results of questionnaires carried out by urologists , psychologists , epidemiologists and sexologists , also revealed significantly different rates of satisfaction between men and women .
Foreplay
In every country , except Algeria and Malaysia , men were more likely to report they were happy with their sex lives .
Professor Laumann said : " Women are very sensitive to the quality of a relationship and when those things are n't in good order they 're not interested .
" It 's a way of regulating ( pregnancy ) and protecting the children . "
The lack of foreplay was also a reason for lower levels of satisfaction between men and women , the research suggested .
This was particularly problematic in some male - dominated cultures in Asia and the Middle East , Professor Laumann said .
Men needed a shorter time to reach a sexual climax than women , this was why foreplay was so important , he added .
Male dominance
" In 75 % of the cases the men report always having an orgasm .
With women only 26 % say they always have one , although 45 % of men believe their partners always have an orgasm . "
However , where the two sexes experienced greater equality - essentially in western countries - 60 to 80 % of subjects said they had good sex .
Couples in Austria topped the good sex league with 80 % of men and 63 % of women saying they were enjoying extremely or very satisfying sex .
In second place came Spain , where 73 % of men and 68 % of women reported high satisfaction rates , the study suggested .
But in " male - centred sexual regimes " like the Middle East , Brazil , Italy and parts of Asia the study suggested satisfaction rates fell to the 40 - 50 % range .
There 's so much hype about multiple orgasms and how many times a week people have sex
Liz Hadland
British Association for Sex and Relationship Therapy
Languishing at the bottom of the league was Japan , with just 18 % of men and one in 10 women telling researchers they had good sex .
Liz Hadland , a psychosexual therapist and spokeswoman for the British Association for Sex and Relationship Therapy , said it was interesting that there was a realisation that older people do enjoy a sex life .
She said younger people may feel less satisfied because they were often under a great deal of pressure from magazines , films and the media to achieve a perfect sexual experiences .
" There 's so much hype about multiple orgasms and how many times a week people have sex and young people can be very body conscious . "
She also suggested women in more male - dominated countries may not have ownership of their own sexuality in the same way that women in western countries do .
Last week , I delivered an hour - long speech on copyright to the Canadian Federation of Students ( the slides are here and posted below and a podcast is here ) .
Since the audio on the podcast version of the talk is poor , I want to reiterate my central message .
In the past , I have spoken frequently about the opportunity for Canada to make its own choices on copyright reform .
After highlighting the remarkable array of new developments for content creation , content sharing , and knowledge sharing , I have emphasized the need for copyright laws that look ahead , rather than behind .
In particular , I have pointed to the dangers associated with anti-circumvention legislation , to the need for more flexible fair dealing , to the desirability of eliminating crown copyright , and to the benefits of open access and open licensing .
I typically conclude by stating that this can be Canada ’s choice and that we must choose wisely .
This speech had a different conclusion , however .
Sometime over the next two or three weeks , Industry Minister Jim Prentice will rise in the House of Commons and introduce copyright reform legislation .
We can no longer speak of choices because those choices have already been made .
There is every indication ( see the Globe ’s latest coverage ) this legislation will be a complete sell - out to U.S. government and lobbyist demands .
The industry may be abandoning DRM , the evidence may show a correlation between file sharing and music purchasing , Statistics Canada may say that music industry profits are doing fine , Canadian musicians , filmmakers , and artists may warn against this copyright approach , and the reality may be that Canadian copyright law is stronger in some areas than U.S. law , yet none of that seems to matter .
In the current environment and with the current Ministers , politics trumps policy .
The new Canadian legislation will likely mirror the DMCA with strong anti-circumvention legislation – far beyond what is needed to comply with the WIPO Internet treaties – and address none of the issues that concern millions of Canadians .
The Conservatives promise to eliminate the private copying levy will likely be abandoned .
There will be no flexible fair dealing .
No parody exception .
No time shifting exception .
No device shifting exception .
No expanded backup provision .
Nothing .
The government will seemingly choose locks over learning , property over privacy , enforcement over education , ( law ) suits over security , lobbyists over librarians , and U.S. policy over a “ Canadian - made ” solution .
Once the bill is introduced , look for the government to put it on the fast track with limited opportunity for Canadians to appear before committees considering the bill .
With a Canadian DMCA imminent , what matters now are voices .
It will be up to those opposed to this law to make theirs heard .
Update :
Many people have asked what they can do to make their voices heard on this issue .
Last year , I posted 30 Things You Can Do about anti-circumvention legislation .
Many of those recommendations still apply , starting with a letter ( letter , not email – no stamp required ) to your Member of Parliament , the Ministers of Industry and Canadian Heritage , and the Prime Minister .
IT is probably not to his advantage that Mitt Romney ’s clean - scrubbed , youthful presence so readily reminds voters of those earnest Mormon missionaries knocking on their doors .
If it were almost any other church , a missionary past would most likely be an asset for a presidential candidate .
To have spent two years in mission work after high school is a sign of early and admirable idealism , commitment and strength of character .
But to many American Christians , those friendly Mormon missionaries embody exactly what they fear and resent about Mormonism .
And Mr. Romney , after nearly a year of graciously sidestepping invitations to a theological duel , may have engaged it despite himself last week by giving a speech on faith the likes of which has n’t been heard since John F. Kennedy took on voters ’ fears of Catholicism in 1960 .
While Mr. Romney uttered the word “ Mormon ” only once , he jump started the discussion about what makes Mormonism problematic for some Americans .
From the start of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in upstate New York 180 years ago , missionaries have been spreading the message that Christianity lost its way and Mormonism restores the Christian church to its rightful path .
The first prophet of Mormonism , Joseph Smith , essentially threw down the gauntlet to the other churches .
He was killed at the hands of a mob .

Photoshop tutorial on basic use of ' levels ' for correcting exposure on your images and also how to use levels for color correction
By WINIFRED ROBINSON

So at last the biggest secret of motherhood is out .
For every woman who gives birth then sinks back blissfully into the pillows , there are scores like me who sit bolt upright , eyes wide with fear and think : " Oh my God , what have I done ? "
Lest you assume that I just did n't bond with my baby , let me say from the outset that I loved my son
Tony from the top of his down - covered head to the tip of his tiny little toes .
I loved him before he was born , before he was even conceived .
Scroll down for more ...
I loved the idea of him , and I never lost touch with that love throughout the many miserable years of infertility and the IVF treatment that finally resulted in his birth on August 20 , 1999 , when I was 41 .
By then , as one of the doctors so tactlessly put it , I was " in the last chance saloon when it came to having kids " .
But however much he was loved and wanted , my baby 's arrival waved no magic wand of satisfaction over my life .
And as a study this week by the Institute for Social and Economic Research in Colchester attests , I am not so much the exception as the rule .
The survey questioned four thousand couples and discovered that children , until the age of five - the point where most start school - make mothers less satisfied with their lives .
I can sympathise with that .
Indeed , I sometimes look back on my son's early years as a long dark tunnel from which I emerged blinking when he reached about four .
The irony of my situation was n't lost on me : that after all those years of trying for a baby and finally achieving my goal , his arrival made me somehow unhappier than I had been before .
Because what no one can convey before your own little bundle arrives is just how hellishly hard it is to be a Mum - by far the most difficult challenge most of us face in life .
So why was n't maternal love the harbinger of happiness ?
For me the biggest problem was a surfeit of the stuff .
I was so overwhelmed with love for Tony that I was tormented with anxiety .
In my career as a BBC reporter I had the confidence to dodge pieces of flying masonry while covering riots in Northern Ireland .
But finding myself in sole charge of a tiny screaming infant , I panicked , convinced that I just was n't up to the job of looking after my baby and petrified that he would suffer as a result .
And for the first three months of his life , suffering was what Tony did .
He had colic - that mysterious belly ache which afflicts so many infants - and he screamed the place down for quite a lot of the time .
I recall a well - meaning elderly neighbour desperate to watch Coronation Street in peace , knocking on my door with the helpful suggestion that the milk I was feeding Tony could be off .
The professionals whose I advice I sought were about as helpful : the midwives suggested feeding on demand , the doctor a strictly - timed feeding regime .
Those first few months can be bewildering and utterly exhausting , when a baby sleeps for no more than about three hours at a time day and night .
Then there is the effect that the arrival of a baby has on a marriage .
My husband and I had six blissful years together before Tony was born , years of intimate dinners and holidays with lots of strolling hand - in - hand down cobbled streets soaking up the culture of some delightful foreign city .
Like many childless women I know , I had made a bit of a baby of my man .
I loved looking after my husband , Roger Wilkes , also a journalist , fussing over him even - and of course , when Tony was born , all that abruptly stopped .
" I just have n't got time " became my mantra , and so it remained for the next few years .
And if I was n't the kind of mother I expected to be , Roger was n't the kind of father I 'd imagined either .
Like many men he turned out to be hopeless with small babies , although he is wonderful with Tony now he is eight years old .
Scroll down for more ...
" He wo n't take this feed from me , " he used to say crossly , as if an infant might be expected to down a bottle of formula milk like a yard of ale .
When I returned to work Tony was three months old and a colleague asked : " Have you reached the I Hate My Husband Because He's Useless Stage Yet ? "
Casting my eyes to heaven I confided that I had reached that moment several weeks before .
I can still recall precisely the moment when I stared at my husband with murder in my eyes .
I was holding a screaming baby and Roger was holding a raw chicken .
At any moment my parents , travelling by train from Liverpool to visit us in London , would arrive .
My husband has many talents , but cooking is not among them and he was looking at the chicken and asking what he should do with it .
A murderous mist suffused my gaze and I swear if I had n't been holding the baby , I would have strangled him .
Tempers are not improved by sleepless nights , and they do n't do much for general good health and wellbeing either .
When warned about sleepless nights before Tony was born , I used glibly to reply that I would be fine because I had experienced shift work .
Motherhood in my case , though , brought thrice - nightly waking for ten whole months and regular 4 am alarm calls in the three years that followed .
And all without the chance to catch up on the sleep you have lost .
Perhaps worse than all this was the fact that as Tony got a little older and I returned to work , there was the sheer loneliness of looking after him .
Roger and I decided to organise our jobs so that we could care for Tony ourselves without outside help .
It meant working alternate days .
On the plus side , our baby was never packed off to a nursery .
On the downside , in those early years I seemed to be always entertaining Tony on my own .
The modern tendency for people to move far from their families for work exacerbates this problem .
It certainly did for us .
I had my mum , dad and no fewer than five sisters desperate for the chance to help me with my baby son .
But they were all in Liverpool , 200 miles away from where we lived in west London .
Most afternoons I would take Tony to feed the ducks in Kew Gardens across the road .
I missed my husband , I missed my mum , and I longed for adult company .
Earlier this year in another survey , 2,000 new mothers reported the year after childbirth as the loneliest time of their lives , a time when only 90 minutes a day was spent in the company of other adults .
I think this loneliness may explain the other surprise finding in the research that was published this week that mothers are significantly happier with life if they have a job , regardless of the hours involved .
Much as balancing motherhood and work is stressful , at least ( as my own mother used to put it ) work " gets you out " , out into the grown - up world , with the chance to chat to colleagues around the water cooler .
I never even considered staying home to look after Tony full - time because our whopping mortgage made two incomes essential .
At the time I envied the mothers who did n't face the wrench of leaving a small child .
But looking back , I 'm not so sure that full - time motherhood would have made me happier , probably because as an older mother I was so used to the intellectual stimulation of work and was set in my ways .
And if I am honest , it was perhaps the contrast between the worlds of work and motherhood that made the task of mothering seem so monumental in those early years of Tony 's life .
In my job as co-presenter of Radio 4's consumer programme You And Yours , effort pays off and can sometimes bring instant rewards .
If I want a particular interview to go well , I do extra research and it usually works .
By contrast , trying hard with young children can just be pointless and frustrating , and I would guess that this must be the experience of a great many mothers who have careers .
For me , closing the door on the chaos that can be kindled by a fractious child and stepping out in my suit to the office was a welcome escape .
At work I felt relaxed and in control , but at home , confronted by a toddler who clamped his jaws against all vegetables , I sometimes wanted to weep .
I felt so inadequate and frustrated .
And whereas at work my tasks tended to be quickly accomplished , with Tony I discovered that the basic lessons of life , as passed on by mothers to their children , must be endlessly repeated often over years .
I blush to confess it , but I did a great deal of goal - oriented nonsense with Tony when he was a baby .
There were trips to the infant music classes , where all the tiny pupils were invited to play primitive instruments and kiss the same toy monkey at the end .
I had expected to foster in Tony an early love of percussion - in the event , all he picked up were a few nasty viruses from the soggy cuddly toy .
Trips to the " Kinder Gym " piled the humiliation on as a teacher put parents and children through a routine called " Skipping along , Singing a Song " in which my boy did n't so much skip as dawdle .
In fact , Tony resolutely refused to respond to my efforts in a whole range of areas , starting with breastfeeding , which I hang my head in shame to admit we never mastered ( I ended up giving up within days ) , through to the pureed vegetables he spat out and the potty he wore on his head rather than use .
The terrible twos went on well into his threes because from the moment he was born he seemed to have his own tastes and opinions on just about everything .
And he could be stubborn to the point of cussedness , just like his mum .
But hand on heart , I can honestly say there was never a moment when I wished I was n't a Mum .
No matter how rosy the memories seemed of the days when I came home from work and relaxed with a large glass of wine , I would never have swopped my childless state for the life I now had with my boy .
And if all of this sounds like a lament , I do n't mean it to be , because in the long run Tony has brought me infinitely more joy than any work project or any other relationship in my life .
There were the triumphs of his first words , his first steps , the delicious softness of his little body curled up against mine .
His initial total dependence on me may have been terrifying , but it is also wonderful - to be needed so intensely , even if it is for a short time .
Which brings me on to the question of why life gradually gets more satisfying for many mothers when their children start school .
There are the obvious advantages , not least among them the 30 hours a week or so of free childcare - a big money saver if you are working , and a chance for some long - deserved ' me - time ' if you are at home .
In our case - and for many other parents I know - the start of school signalled the end of the broken nights .
School tires children out and even the poorest sleepers tend to settle as a result .
But for me , more importantly , Tony starting school coincided with the realisation that difficult times with young children are just phases in their development that pass .
By the time he was four , I had learned to stop trying so hard .
I found motherhood infinitely more rewarding as a result .
I remember in those first nightmare days with Tony , a girlfriend rang who'd had a baby a year before .
" Why did n't you tell me it was like this ? "
I asked her .
" Because you feel so foolish saying that , " came the reply .
I understood perfectly what she meant : how could I of all people , after all that effort to have a baby , admit that I was struggling to cope ?
Admitting that life as the mother of a young child is less than perfect means breaking one of the last taboos - and yet it should n't be so hard to say it .
As this week 's research proves , those of us who did n't relish every moment are the not the exception , but the rule .
Mr. Katz was matched with his advertisers by FreeCar Media , an advertising agency in Los Angeles that claims to have a database of more than a million car owners who say they are open to wrapping their cars in ads for a fee , said Drew Livingston , president of the company .
The sponsor also pays as much as $ 5,000 a car for the wrap job .
Generally , a car can qualify if it has enough surface area for a sizable ad and is no more than five years old .
“ A company like Procter & Gamble will come to us and say , ‘ We have a new and improved Tide , and our target is stay - at - home moms with two - plus children who live in these 20 markets , ’ ” Mr. Livingston said .
His company then finds drivers in that demographic .
“ We feel that when you can wrap a mom ’s car and get it to her P.T.A. meeting or Curves gym , you ’re getting the acceptance from her social circle . ”
The company either gives its brand ambassadors free cars or , more often , pays them as much as $ 800 a month .
In the last seven years , FreeCar Media has hired about 7,000 motorists , who are instructed to park outside whenever possible , refrain from smoking , littering or swearing in their vehicle , and to attend a monthly influencer event where they hand out samples or coupons .
They also have to send reports frequently with photographs to show where their cars have been .
People whose cars were wrapped with ads for two Coca - Cola products — Planet Java , a bottled coffee , and Vault , an energy drink — were cautioned against sipping Pepsi products behind the wheel .
Nor could they park at restaurant chains like KFC or Pizza Hut that serve Pepsi exclusively , Mr. Livingston said .
Another FreeCar participant , Jerome Harris , 22 , was in his junior year at Temple University last year when he had his Nissan Altima wrapped for a promotion for Trolls , the endomorphic dolls with Don King hairdos .
He earned $ 500 a month while his car was wrapped ; in addition to driving around while on his best behavior , he was required to hand out Trolls pens to fellow students during finals week .
“ We were n’t allowed to have alcohol in or around the car , or use profanity , ” said Mr. Harris , who now lives in Brooklyn and is a few credits shy of a degree in advertising .
“ When you ’re out , you ’re supposed to be representing the brand . ”
Auto - resized images are a common feature on the web now .
Automating the process of resizing images saves a lot of time — it ’s certainly quicker than manually resizing images in Photoshop — and is a good way to manage images on a site .
But when a good designer crops your images manually , they always looks better .
Article Continues Below
The problem with automatic uploads is particularly evident when several images of completely different dimensions are displayed together on a page , such as four product images that have been uploaded through a content management system ( CMS ) .
Finding an attractive way of displaying any two , three , or four images together ( regardless of shape and size ) has always been difficult without manual resizing or cropping .
This article covers a PHP - based technique for automatically resizing — and more importantly , positioning — between two and eight images in what I call a magazine - style layout ( images in a magazine are always carefully positioned — usually one image takes pride of place and several smaller images surround it ) .
Example 1 shows the final output of this technique .
The only information we need to supply to the script is the width of the container , and the file name of each image .
Amazingly , everything else can be calculated .
Different dimensions #section2
Consider the following three images of different sizes and dimensions , which could have been uploaded via a CMS …
Three user - uploaded images , all of different dimensions .
In their current shape , these images are unlikely to look attractive .
A more desireable layout is shown below
The same three images resized and positioned correctly .
Anyone with an image - editing program such as Photoshop can achieve this effect very quickly , but it needs to be done manually .
This method uses of some server - side PHP scripting and some rather complicated algebra to achieve the same effect , no manual tweaking involved .
The solution #section3
Using PHP to resize the images on the server , we are able to calculate the exact size that each image should be so they will fit together in a nice square box .
This will maintain our aspect ratios , work with almost any image proportion , and allow us to do all the dirty work on the server .
Square images are no problem either ( see Example 2 ) .
Getting started #section4
First things first , you will need a PHP web host who has the GD2.x extension enabled .
Fortunately , this is quite common these days .
You will also need a good image resizing script .
I have included a basic script here , but it ’s always a good idea to use a script that caches the output , as dynamic images can really slow down your server .
Copy the supplied class file to your web server and note its location on the server .
Create a basic script as follows … ( line wraps marked » — Ed. )
# include the class file require_once ( ' magazinelayout.class.php ' ) ;#
Define the width for the output area ( pixels ) $ width = 600 ; #
Define padding around each image - this * must * be included # in your stylesheet ( pixels ) $ padding = 3 ; #
Define your template for outputting images #
( Do n't forget to escape the & ) $ template = ' ';# create a new instance of the class $ mag = new magazinelayout ( $ width , $padding , $template ) ; #
Add the images in any order $ mag->addImage ( ' landscape1.jpg ' ) ; $ mag->addImage ( ' portrait1.jpg ' ) ; $ mag->addImage ( ' landscape2.jpg ' ) ;# display the outputecho $ mag->getHtml ( ) ;
That ’s it .
Running the script should display three images in an attractive layout ; the exact look of the layout will be determined by whether the images are landscape ( longer than tall ) or portrait ( taller than long ) .
How does it work ?
#section5
The above code is basic object - oriented PHP .
It sets up a new class , adds some images into an array , and processes them .
The getHtml ( ) method is the key .
Let ’s take a look .
Getting image ratios #section6
As images are added , we detect whether they are landscape or portrait using PHP ’s getimagesize function .
This gives us the height and width of the image , which we use to find a ratio of width : height .
This function is quite processor intensive , but it ca n’t be avoided .
We do n’t need to know the height and width , but we ’ll use the ratios later on , so we ’ll save them to an array .
At this point , we also decide whether we are dealing with landscape or portrait images , as this determines which template the script will use .
The template above is based on two landscape images and one portrait .
Calculating sizes #section7
Our goal is to get the three images to look right within an overall fixed width — the overall height will vary depending on the image dimensions .
The complicated part of all this is figuring out the right size for each image .
If we did it in Photoshop , it would involve resizing each image until it “ looks right , ” and every change will potentially upset the balance of the other images .
My first attempt at this script was n’t too different from a Photoshop trial - and - error process ; the script started a counter at 1 and tried every size up to 500 px until it found a working combination .
The sound of my processor fan kicking on convinced me there had to be a better way .
It turns out my problem can be solved using algebra — something I spent a lot of time learning at university , but never managed to find a practical application for .
Ten years on , it ’s coming into use for the first time .
Certain parts of our equation we know :
t = Total width —
The total width of all images specified when the class is called .
= Total width —
The total width of all images specified when the class is called .
r1 , r2 , r3 = Ratios
— We have already calculated the ratios of each image based on the width and height .
What we do n’t know …
w1 — The width of the left column — one required piece of information .
— The width of the left column — one required piece of information .
w2 — The width of the right portrait image , also required .
The following diagram shows the values we know and those we do n’t .
Known values have a checkmark , unknown have a question mark .
A diagram showing the relation of our equation values to the layout .
Given these widths , our image script can figure out the heights because we already know the aspect ratio of each image .
If we can use algebra to find w1 and w2 , we have all we need .
What we also know # section9
We also know that the height of the portrait image is equal to the combined height of the two landscape images , expressed as …
h1 = h2 + h3
And we know that the same height is also equal to the portrait image ’s width divided by its ratio :
h1 = w2 / r1
We also know the height of the landscape images is their width divided by their ratio .
h2 = w1 / r2 h3 = w1 / r3
After some rearranging of elements , I am starting to put everything into one equation , with the goal of finding w1 .
A trip to the Quickmath calculator gives me the result I need .
W1 = t / ( r1 * ( 1/r2 + 1/r3 + 1/r4 ) + 1 )
Some padding , please # section10
At this point , it became apparent that the first designer to look at the output would be wanting some padding between the images .
This is not as simple as adding a few pixels onto each image , because the left - hand side is going to have more padding overall than the right which will throw the formatting .
Example 3 shows the layout without any padding .
With a little help from the calculator , I arrived at the following equations :
The formula for one of the layouts .
Things are starting to look a little more complicated here , but this does work .
Enough maths , back to PHP # section11
This was never meant to be a lesson in mathematics , but we now have enough information to plug back into our PHP script .
By replacing the algebra variables with PHP variables , we create a formula for finding the information we are missing .
Given the ratios of the images and the overall container width , we can calculate the width of all images — enough for the image resizing script to do its job .
Because we do n’t use tables for positioning anymore , I had to find a way of making the layout look good using CSS .
Because we are dealing with squares , this is quite straightforward using the images in a floating div .
All was working well until I tried the version with padding between the images in IE .
Because IE handles padding differently than other browsers , it offset the images by a few pixels and ruined the effect .
One way to work around this problem is to place the image inside a container div and apply margins to the image .
This will force the container to the right size , which gives the much needed effect of padding between the images .
Default CSS is as follows :
. magazine - image { background : # fff ; border : 1 px #eee solid ; } . magazine - image img { padding : 0 px ; background : # fff ; margin : 2 px ; border : 1 px #eee solid ; }
Different layouts #section13
This script contains six different layouts based on different formulas .
The layouts accomodate from one to four images each .
If you need to display six images , the script simply uses the four - image layout followed by the two - image layout ( see Example 4 ) .
Some of the layouts are more appropriate for certain combinations of image size , such as 2 x landscape 1 x portrait ; others are more generic .
Example 5 shows how the script can be used at different widths to fit any space of your page .
Possible uses#section14
The obvious use for this script is anywhere where more than one user - submitted image needs to be presented in a HTML page .
I ’m thinking product databases , forum image uploads , random image rotations , etc , etc .
Once you have ten or so images , you are better off using an AJAX based image gallery , but this script will fill the gap nicely up until that point .
The full source code and examples are downloadable .
Thanks and credits # section16
Thanks to Alexander Burkhardt for the use of the demo images .
The images were taken on the lovely Hokianga Harbour in Northland New Zealand .
As readers of this blog might know , I have an unhealthy interest in the chemical elements .
And Mathematica .
The combination means that all my element - related projects are created using almost no tools other than Mathematica .
It ’s not that I use it because I feel like I should — I certainly use other programs when appropriate ( Photoshop , for example ) .
It ’s just that Mathematica is the best available tool for many of the things I want to do .
Really .
My latest project is the website periodictable .com .
Let me say right off the bat that this is a fabulous domain name .
It took me months of convincing and no small amount of cash to acquire it .
It really deserves to host the definitive online periodic table reference website , not just another run -of - the - mill online periodic table , of which there are thousands .
Take a quick look at it here .
OK , now that you ’re back , you probably noticed that it does not look a whole lot like it came from Mathematica ; it ’s not something you get directly from Export [ " index.html " , mydata ] , though Mathematica ’s automatic HTML export features were used in some crucial places .
For the most part , the site is created by fairly low - level string concatenation , building up HTML code one tag at a time .
The advantage of Mathematica here is just that it ’s a very nice , convenient programming language .
Another advantage of making the site in Mathematica is the handling of descriptive texts .
The site contains descriptions of countless individual element samples , and all those descriptions are written and stored in a couple of large notebook files .
The notebooks provide a convenient editing environment and , because they can be loaded into Mathematica and processed as data with absolutely no fuss , I spend a minimal amount of code to get the source material into a form that can be processed into HTML .
Basically I ’m using the notebook like a database , but one where editing the text entries is as convenient as using any word processor .
I use the same sort of technique for the back side of my periodic table placemats .
The file is created automatically by a Mathematica program , which assembles text taken from a notebook containing the samples ’ database .
That same notebook is also the source of the blurbs that you see when you move the mouse over any element on the front page of periodictable .com .
Another place Mathematica really stands out is in the technical data pages — for example , the page on the properties of titanium .
All the data on this and the 117 other pages like it comes from the ElementData and ChemicalData functions .
Without them I would have had to spend weeks or months gathering reliable data ( which is of course precisely what we did to create the functions ) .
It ’s quite wonderful to get a nice , interesting plot like this in no time :
( I should add that while these two data functions are what I need for this site , Mathematica has data functions on a wide and growing array of subjects , from geography to finance to knots : see here and here for more about them . )
On the Wolfram Demonstrations Project site I have a more elaborate variation of this example , which allows you to choose any of several dozen elemental properties and make various plots .
This “ Properties of the Elements ” Demonstration and its source code can be downloaded from the site , along with the free Wolfram Player if you do n’t have Mathematica .
Another Mathematica interface I ’ve made is this one ( and I promise we ’ll connect back to the website creation subject matter shortly ) that allows you to browse the decay chains of all the known isotopes of the elements ( you ’ll need Mathematica to open it — or you can see the snapshot below ) .
It relies on the IsotopeData paclet I discussed in a previous post , as well as the highly sophisticated LayeredGraphPlot function for the automatic layout of the decay network .
The connection with website creation is that these interfaces were written as the first steps in designing features for periodictable .com .
Mathematica is a tremendously efficient environment for prototyping and exploring .
The effort that went into creating these two examples was concentrated almost 100 % in the subject matter — not in any overhead for creating an interactive program , where to get the data from , etc .
Once the basic idea was worked out , I could then think about how to translate it into a website .
To see how isotope decay chains ended up on the site , take a look at this decay chain for U - 235 .
Navigation is by clicking on links rather than buttons , but other than that the site is quite similar to the in -product Mathematica version .
How did I go from the Mathematica version to the website , which superficially looks nothing like it ?
By taking the core content code ( the Mathematica program that generates the decay chain images ) and inserting it into the HTML - generating code for the rest of the site .
There ’s a tricky point where Mathematica ’s built - in web export features really came in handy .
In both the Mathematica and web versions you can click on any isotope in the decay - chain image and have it jump to the data and decay chain for that isotope .
In the Mathematica version this is done very simply by wrapping a Button object around each node of the decay network .
The LayeredGraphPlot function that beautifully lays out these networks is flexible enough , and the graphical display system in the Mathematica front end is sophisticated enough , that putting buttons into automatically laid - out networks is no problem .
But what about the HTML version ?
To make this work in a web browser you have to create an “ image map ” tag that associates links with certain rectangular pixel coordinates in the image .
Doing this is completely automatic using Export .
Instead of wrapping Button objects around each node I wrap them with Hyperlink objects , then export the image expression to HTML .
Export automatically recognizes the presence of Hyperlink objects in the expression and generates a corresponding imagemap with coordinates that match the JPEG image it generated .
That ’s really nice .
A highly technical website like periodictable .com requires putting together data ( text , numerical facts , pictures ) from many different sources , and managing its deployment to a complex , highly structured layout of HTML files .
I know of no other program that can handle the full spectrum of tasks required to do this , from supplying the technical data to processing the images to generating the final HTML .
Creating this website using other tools is certainly possible , but not in the amount of time I would have available for the task .
By making the process orders of magnitude faster , Mathematica can take credit for the existence of the site .
Well , Mathematica and the five years I ’ve spent compulsively photographing element samples .
A relaxed and confident Barack Obama sat down for an interview with U.S. News while campaigning in Maryland .
During the half - hour session , he sipped bottled water and , at one point — with apologies — checked his E - mail for schedule updates .
He was intent on conveying his message of change and conciliation .
Excerpts :
" Transformational " presidents do n't come along very often .
Does that word apply to you ?
First of all , I do n't presume to think of myself as a " transformational figure . "
I 'm just trying to win an election .
So that 's point number one .
I do think it 's a " transformational moment . "
And whether the individual who ends up in the White House fulfills that possibility , you know , depends on both skill and circumstance .
Your critics say you do n't understand the difficulties of changing Washington .
I taught the Constitution for 10 years , so I know that power is diffused by design .
But what I know is there are an awful lot of people who are hurting right now , who do n't have healthcare , who are sending their kids to substandard schools , who can't afford to get those kids to college , who are worried about losing their homes , who sense that there 's a slow but steady deterioration of America 's economic position in the world .
And they are ready for change .
How would things be different under a President Obama ?
I am very clear in saying we 're not going to eliminate money from politics in Washington completely .
We 're not going to suddenly have , you know , Athenian democracy in the House or Senate .
But I do n't think it 's overromanticizing to say that there was a time in our history where Democrats and Republicans could sit down and actually pass a budget on time .
That there was a time when you could propose an energy bill that was n't written by the oil and the gas companies .
Nobody , I think , is asserting that we can achieve perfection .
There 's a huge gap between perfection and where we 're at right now .
What I 'm aiming for is somewhere in between , where we 're making some progress .
Hillary Clinton says you have been too vague about the issues .
Does she have a point ?
This is an area where , I think , a certain myth has been perpetrated .
Ironically , in the beginning of this campaign , I was criticized for being too professorial and providing too much detail .
And I would say that if you actually take a look at my website and Senator Clinton 's website , I 've been far more specific on what I would do on Social Security , for example .
I 've been very explicit that I think we need to raise the cap on the payroll tax .
She suggested a commission .
I 've been very explicit on energy , climate change , healthcare .
On foreign policy , I 've repeatedly laid out how I would approach problems like Iraq and Pakistan and the fight against terrorism .
So I really think the whole issue of lacking specifics is much more of an urban myth than it is borne out by the facts .
Do you think that , in the end , race will be an impediment to your being elected ?
Look , I have no doubt that there are some people who wo n't vote for me because I 'm black .
There would also be some people who wo n't vote for me because I 'm young , because I 've got big ears ... or they do n't like my political philosophy .
Articles I and II of H.R. 799 accuse Cheney of purposely manipulating intelligence to deceive Congress and the American people about a fabricated threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda , respectively .
Article III charges Cheney with openly threatening aggression against Iran absent any real threat to the United States .
All three articles say Cheney 's actions have damaged our national security interests .
Three of the nine Judiciary Committee Democrats who advocate launching impeachment hearings against Cheney , Reps. Robert Wexler ( D. , Fla . ) , Luis Gutierrez ( D. , Ill . ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D. , Wis. ) , co-authored an op - ed that appeared on December 27 in the Philadelphia Inquirer .
They wrote , " The issues at hand are too serious to ignore , including credible allegations of abuse of power that , if proven , may well constitute high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution .
The allegations against Cheney relate to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens . "
There is also credible evidence that policies set in Cheney 's office authorized the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody , in violation of three treaties the United States has ratified , as well as the U.S. Torture Statute and War Crimes Act .
The policies on the treatment of prisoners emanating from Cheney 's office triggered the abuse and torture , according to Lawrence Wilkerson , former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's chief of staff .
" It was clear to me that there was a visible audit trail from the Vice President 's office through the Secretary of Defense down to the commanders in the field , " Wilkerson , a former colonel , said on National Public Radio's " Morning Edition . "
In November , the House of Representatives sent the impeachment resolution to the House Judiciary Committee for further proceedings .
However many Democrats oppose impeachment , citing the year and a half of testimony about Bill Clinton 's personal relations .
They think impeachment will detract from Congress 's other pressing business .
And , they argue , the hearings would " involve the possible impeachment of the vice president - not of our commander in chief - and the resulting impact on the nation 's business and attention would be significantly less than the Clinton presidential impeachment hearings . "
Seventy percent of American voters think Cheney has abused his powers and 43 percent say he should be removed from office , according to a Nov. 13 poll by the American Research Group .
Organizations , including the National Lawyers Guild , have called for the impeachment of Dick Cheney .
Impeachment hearings against Cheney would not only fulfill the Constitution 's command that high officials who commit high crimes and misdemeanors be brought to justice .
It would also deter the vice president from committing additional crimes that threaten the national security of the United States .
Any impeachment proceeding would have to start in the House Judiciary Committee .
The nine Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee who favor impeachment hearings are : Robert Wexler , Fla . ; Luis Gutierrez , Ill. ; Anthony Weiner , N.Y. ; Tammy Baldwin , Wisc. ; Sheila Jackson Lee , Texas ; Steve Cohen , Tenn. ; Keith Ellison , Minn. ; Maxine Waters , Calif . ; and Hank Johnson , Ga .
Here is a list of the entire House Judiciary Committee :
Marjorie Cohn Social Media Pages :
Marjorie Cohn is professor emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law , former president of the National Lawyers Guild , deputy secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers , and a member of the National Advisory Board of Veterans for Peace .
Her most recent book is Drones and Targeted Killing : Legal , Moral , and Geopolitical Issues .

A study by two nonprofit journalism organizations found that President Bush and top administration officials issued hundreds of false statements about the national security threat from Iraq in the two years following the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The study concluded that the statements " were part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses . "
The study was posted Tuesday on the Web site of the Center for Public Integrity , which worked with the Fund for Independence in Journalism .
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel did not comment on the merits of the study Tuesday night but reiterated the administration 's position that the world community viewed Iraq 's leader , Saddam Hussein , as a threat .
" The actions taken in 2003 were based on the collective judgment of intelligence agencies around the world , " Stanzel said .
The Center for Public Integrity , a research group that focuses on ethics in government and public policy , designed the new Web site to allow simple searches for specific phrases , such as " mushroom cloud " or " yellowcake uranium , " in transcripts and documents totaling some 380,000 words , including remarks by President Bush and most of his top advisers in the two years after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The study counted 935 false statements in the two - year period .
It found that in speeches , briefings , interviews and other venues , Bush and administration officials stated unequivocally on at least 532 occasions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction or was trying to produce or obtain them , or had links to al Qaeda , or both .
" It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to al Qaeda , " according to Charles Lewis and Mark Reading - Smith of the Fund for Independence in Journalism , writing an overview of the study .
" In short , the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19 , 2003 . "
Named in the study along with Bush were top officials of the administration during the period studied : Vice President Dick Cheney , national security adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Scott McClellan .

Bush led with 259 false statements , 231 about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 28 about Iraq 's links to al Qaeda , the study found .
That was second only to Powell 's 244 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 10 about Iraq and al Qaeda .
The center said the study was based on a database created with public statements over the two years beginning on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and information from more than 25 government reports , books , articles , speeches and interviews .
" The cumulative effect of these false statements - amplified by thousands of news stories and broadcasts - was massive , with the media coverage creating an almost impenetrable din for several critical months in the run-up to war , " the study concluded .
" Some journalists - indeed , even some entire news organizations - have since acknowledged that their coverage during those prewar months was far too deferential and uncritical .
These mea culpas notwithstanding , much of the wall - to - wall media coverage provided additional , ' independent ' validation of the Bush administration 's false statements about Iraq , " it said .
There is no startling new information in the archive , because all the documents have been published previously .
But the new computer tool is remarkable for its scope and its replay of the crescendo of statements that led to the war .
Muckrakers may find browsing the site reminiscent of what Richard Nixon used to dismissively call " wallowing in Watergate . "

「 技術情報」カテゴリの最新記事
こんにちは。ブログ担当のnabokov7です。さてみなさん、ここのところ、livedoor
Blog の新機能リリースのペースが上がっていることにお気づきでしょうか。12月だけでこれだけの
新規リリースのお知らせ を出しました。以前に比べてスピーディーなリリースが可能になった背景には、最近新しい仲間も増えてきたといった要因もあるのですが、もうひとつの大きな理由として、最近、開発を
CVS から Subversion へ移行し、を確立できた、というのがあります。いまさらサブバージョンかよ、という感はあるかと思いますが、ブログのプロジェクトは3年前からCVSベースで開発を続けてきており、14000以上のファイルがCVS管理下にあるのです。また、本番化の方式として・本番化専用のワーキングディレクトリで cvs update をかけて最新版にし、・rsync で、新しくなったファイルだけを本番サーバに同期する ( rsync -- delete -e ssh - auvzC などを使った本番化用スクリプトがあります ) という手順をとっているため、といったことが長年積み重なり、とても気軽には移行に踏み切れない状態が続いていました。しかし、開発担当者の数が増えてくると、などの問題が開発効率の足を引っ張るようになってきます。かといって、CVSでブランチを切って作業するのはなかなか面倒です。そこで思い切って
Subversion への移行を敢行したわけですが、その際のメモや、気付いた細かい点などを書き、年末の大掃除にかえたいと思います。まず、移行作業の基本コンセプトとして(あとで作業者各々が、旧ワーキングディレクトリから必要なファイルをサルベージしてきて新リポジトリへコミットしていくこと。)というルールを決め、それに基づいて、以下のように作業をすすめました。まず、現在のCVSのワーキングディレクトリを別の場所に退避し、それをディレクトリまるごとコピーしてその上で作業をすすめます。以下のようなコマンドラインを駆使して、実際の本番機にあるファイルと旧ワーキングディレクトリとの差分をとり、各ファイルの、いま現在本番稼働しているリビジョンを集めてきます。↓ローカルのファイルと本番機上のファイルのdiffをとる↓あるローカルディレクトリ以下のファイルすべてのうち、本番サーバの方が古い、あるいは本番サーバにはないファイルのリストを作る。(rsync
の -- dry - run を使うのがミソ ) 旧ワーキングディレクトリに残ったままになっている様々な一時ファイルを掃除します。↓テンポラリファイル , バックアップファイルの削除.cvsignore や CVS / ディレクトリなど、CVS専用のファイル群も同様にして削除します。(.cvsignore については後 の 「 6 . 属性を整える」も参照)私もマカーですけど・マカーの作業者がコミットしてしまいがちな " . DS_Store " などもこの機に忘れず削除しておきましょう。・MacOSはファイル名の大文字と小文字を区別しないので、" foo.GIF " と " foo.gif " が両方あると後々ローカルでの作業時にはまります。両方存在するのはたいてい間違いなので、どちらか一方にまとめておきましょう。履歴は必要になったときにCVS側を見ればいいので、心機一転、新プロジェクトとして import します。↓svn:executabe , svn:eol - style , svn:keywords ぐらいはまとめて propset しておく↓ .cvsignore を使っていた場合は、その内容を svn:ignore 属性に反映させておく(.cvsignore のあるすべてのディレクトリで以下を実行)特にうちの場合、リポジトリ配下にあたる場所に var ディレクトリがあり、開発サーバではここにログやテンポラリファイルが書き出されています。して除外するなどしておかないと、間違って var 以下のファイルをコミットしてしまったり、開発サーバ上で別ブランチにスイッチするときにコンフリクトが起きたりしてかなりややこしいことになります。移行後は、以下のような基本ルールを決めました。というのが基本。・すぐ本番に反映する手直し/緊急バグフィックス的なものは trunk で作業して もOK だが、それ以外の場合はこと。・開発サーバで switch するときは、社内IRCで一声かける。作業がおわったら trunk に戻す。※うちは開発サーバが一人一台ないので、開発サーバ上のワーキングディレクトリを自分のブランチに switch しては確認し、また trunk に戻す、という作業を日常的にすることになります。・開発サーバ上で svn を root で実行しないこと。※これもうちの開発環境独特の問題なのですが、開発者が皆 root でログインすることが多いため、そのままうっかり svn update とかされると更新されたファイルのパーミッションが全部 root になってしまって後始末が面倒です。ブログの開発サーバでは、root の . bashrc にといった alias を仕込んであります。気持ち程度の策ですが。↓自分のホームの
~/.subversion / config に以下を追加しておく。( 新規にファイルを add するときに属性が勝手にセットされます。 ) ・
~/.tcshrc にを追加しておく 。( Macの場合は / Private/etc/bashrc に↓です ) こうすると、コマンドラインで
$ blogrepos とするだけでリポジトリのURLが指定できるので楽です。以下、にリポジトリのURLがセットされているという前提で、ブランチでの開発手順を書いておきます。※なお、ブランチやタグの命名規則については、 こういった慣例 等がありますので参考に。(ブランチにswitch中のローカルディレクトリで)↑これで変更を確認し、↓これで実際に現在のワーキングディレクトリにマージする問題なければそれをブランチへ commit(開発サーバ上のワーキングディレクトリで)いまどのブランチにいるか分からなくなったときはもちろんまずローカルのワーキングディレクトリを trunk に switch しておく。そこで↑これで変更を確認し、↓これで実際にマージするコンフリクト等をすべて解消し、内容が確認できたら、trunk へ commitsvn switch が異常に重いです。スイッチ完了までにトイレに行って帰って来れる程時間がかかります。さすがにファイルが一万以上もあるプロジェクトをワーキンディレクトリ丸ごとスイッチするのは、チェックだけでそれぐらいかかってしまうのでしょうか。それとも単に開発サーバが重いだけなのか...
忙しくてそのへんを検証する時間もない年末でした。早々に、次は
Git に移行だ、とかいった事態になるのでしょうか...年末ぎりぎりにリリースされた ブログのプライベート記事機能 ですが、実はもともとの予定には
OpenID対応ははいっていませんでした。実装もだいたい終わり、構成書のまとめやらhtmlコーディングの段階に入っていたある週末にふと、、と思い立って実装し、週明けの月曜にという感じで機能追加が決まりました。他の会社ではなかなかこうはいかないと思います。素早い対応のできる
( そして svn switch が理解できる ) ディレクター他全チームメンバーに感謝致します。
WASHINGTON , Dec. 3 — Friends of Charles D. Riechers , whose Air Force career took him from the back of a B - 52 cockpit to the front of the service ’s $ 30 billion procurement office , said something was telling in the fact that his suicide note to his boss was typed .
They described it as an effort to set the record straight by a meticulous man who felt deeply misunderstood .
“ I first and foremost express my deepest regret for a situation based on my naïveté , ” Mr. Riechers ’s note read , according to a person familiar with it .
“ I ’ve created a scandal . ”
On Oct. 14 , neighbors found the body of Mr. Riechers , a 47 - year - old husband and father , in his garage in Loudoun County , Va. , just outside Washington , dead apparently from the fumes of his car .
Instead of clarity , though , Mr. Riechers ’s last act cast a cloud of suspicion over the Air Force , threatening to plunge a service still struggling to emerge from one of its worst scandals into another quagmire .
Mr. Riechers , who was the second - highest - ranking official at the Air Force procurement office , had come under scrutiny by the Senate Armed Services Committee after a news report that said the Air Force had arranged for him to be paid by a private contractor during the two months he awaited White House approval for the job .
AN INNOCENT woman mistaken for Maxine Carr and hounded out of her home in York has spoken of her ordeal .
She told how vandals repeatedly threw bricks and rocks threough her windows and left her terrified .
The woman , who has not been named , but is called " Marianne " , is one of more than a dozen women wrongly accused of being Carr and driven from their homes across Britain since the former girlfriend of Soham double murderer Ian Huntley was released from prison in May 2004 .
Angry mobs have forced the innocent victims to flee from their neighbourhoods despite many having no resemblance to the ex-teaching assistant and being able to prove who they are .
Marianne and two others have now spoken of their traumatic experiences for a hard - hitting television documentary , Being Maxine Carr , being broadcast on Channel 4 , on Friday .
Her protests fell on deaf ears and amid a modern - day witch hunt of constant vandal attacks on her home and verbal abuse , she was forced to move away for her safety .
Carr disappeared from the public eye after serving half of her 42 - month sentence for perverting the course of justice by lying to police and providing Huntley , who killed schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman , with a false alibi .
She was later granted permanent anonymity amid fears for her life , which prevents the media identifying her or reporting where she lives and works .
In summer 2006 , Marianne moved to York but gossip soon spread that she was actually Carr because of her southern accent .
She told the documentary makers : " My immediate reaction when one of the neighbours told me there was a rumour I was Maxine Carr was one of total disbelief .
" It just felt like molten lead had been poured into my stomach .
It felt awful .
" When a rock was thrown through our window , I was in complete shock .
" I spent every night watching out of the bedroom window , trying to see if there were gangs approaching the house .
" I tried staring back but that made them stare even more .
I tried ignoring them but still they stared .
" You should not have to justify your existence in your own home .
I was doing a postgraduate research degree which was why I was working at home . "
She said the vandal attacks became increasingly serious .
" Somebody put a brick through the front door .
" The sound of that was horrific , the smash was just awful .
The police really stepped up the protection for me then . "
She said she went round to the neighbours ' homes with a community support officer to try to convince them she was not Carr .
" Unfortunately , most people just did n't believe it .
They said there 's no smoke without fire . "
She said the third attack on her home was the worst .
" The window was double - glazed so they had to have had incredible determination to put the window through .
" The attacks were escalating in violence and that was when I decided I could not take it any more .
For the sake of my health , I had to leave , and that 's what I did . "
Other women accused of being Maxine Carr have included a department store worker in Coleraine , Northern Ireland , who was also interviewed for the documentary , a café waitress from South Wales , a housewife from East Kilbride , a legal secretary in Scotland , a checkout worker in a Midlands Asda and a librarian on the Isle of Wight .
* First Cut : Being Maxine Carr , is on Channel 4 , at 7.35 pm , on Friday .
Last year , the United States woke up to the reality of hundreds of thousands of soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan  and began to grapple with what to do about it .
On Feb. 18 , 2007 , the headline " Soldiers Face Neglect , Frustration at Army ’s Top Medical Facility " splashed across the front page of one of the nation ’s premier newspapers , the Washington Post .
The article , which described unsafe conditions and substandard care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , began with the story of Army Specialist Jeremy Duncan , who was airlifted out of Iraq in February 2006 with a broken neck and a shredded left ear , " nearly dead from blood loss . "
" Behind the door of Army Spec. Jeremy Duncan ’s room , part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air , weighted down with black mold , " the article read .
" When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up , he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole .
The entire building , constructed between the world wars , often smells like greasy carry - out .
Signs of neglect are everywhere : mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , cheap mattresses . "
The Post reported that patients inside Walter Reed , which lies just five miles from the White House , found it difficult to receive the care they were promised and felt they deserved .
When the story broke , politicians from both parties expressed outrage and promised solutions .
Walter Reed ’s commander , Maj. Gen. George Weightman , was fired almost immediately .
Following him out the door was the secretary of the Army , Frances Harvey .
On March 6 , President George W. Bush announced the formation of a bipartisan independent commission lead by former Republican senator Bob Dole and Donna Shalala , the secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bill Clinton administration .
" It ’s unacceptable to me , it ’s unacceptable to you , it ’s unacceptable to our country , and it ’s not going to continue , " Bush told the American Legion in a speech announcing the commission ’s formation .
" My decisions have put our kids in harm ’s way .
And I ’m concerned about the fact that when they come back they do n’t get the full treatment they deserve . "
Three weeks later , Bush paid a visit to Walter Reed and apologized again : " I was disturbed by their accounts of what went wrong , " Bush told Walter Reed ’s staff after a tour of the facility .
" It is not right to have someone volunteer to wear our uniform and not get the best possible care .
I apologize for what they went through , and we ’re going to fix the problem . "
But the allegations raised in the Washington Post were not actually new .
In February 2005 , the exact same conditions had been raised in a damning series in the online magazine Salon.com .
Wounded soldiers at Walter Reed , reporter Mark Benjamin wrote , are " overmedicated , forced to talk about their mothers instead of Iraq , and have to fight for disability pay .
Traumatized combat vets say the Army is failing them , and after a year following more than a dozen soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital , I believe them . "
Top Bush administration officials knew about Walter Reed ’s problems , but they had other priorities .
Indeed , before the Washington Post put the facility ’s substandard conditions on its front page , President Bush ’s appointees at the Pentagon had strenuously lobbied Congress against funding military pensions , health insurance , and benefits for widows of retirees .
Their argument : that money spent caring for wounded soldiers and their families could be better spent on state - of - the - art military hardware or enticing new recruits to join the force .
In January 2005 , Bush ’s Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness David Chu , the official in charge of such things , went so far as to tell the Wall Street Journal veterans ’ medical care and disability benefits " are hurtful " and " are taking away from the nation ’s ability to defend itself . "
Before the scandal at Walter Reed broke in the Washington Post , the Bush administration ran programs for injured soldiers in much the same way it did the rest of the war  primarily for the benefit of an elite group of private contractors .
In 2005 , with tens of thousands of casualties already reported , a Pentagon commission recommended closing Walter Reed by 2011 .
When the commission report became public , the Bush administration moved to privatize the facility for as long as it would remain open , turning management of the hospital over to IAP World Services , a politically well - connected firm with almost no experience in military medicine .
In January 2006 , the military awarded a five - year , $ 120 million contract to Florida - based IAP , which had already faced scrutiny from Congress for unseemly profiteering after Hurricane Katrina .
After the levees broke , FEMA ordered the company to deliver 211 million pounds of ice intended to cool food , medicine , and sweltering victims of the storm .
Instead , IAP had the ice trucked around the country in circles at taxpayers ’ expense , with much of it ending up in storage 1,500 miles away in Maine .
The company ’s leadership had an even more extensive record of corruption .
Before going to work at IAP , company CEO Al Neffgen was a top executive at Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown & Root , where he was responsible for " all work performed by KBR for the U.S. government . "
That included being hauled before congressional committees to testify about why the company ( which had earlier been run by Vice President Dick Cheney ) had overcharged U.S. taxpayers by hundreds of millions of dollars while providing support for U.S. troops in Iraq .
Neffgren was n’t the only well - connected person at IAP .
The company ’s president , the aptly named David Swindle , is also a former executive at Halliburton .
One of its directors is Dan Quayle , Bush senior ’s vice president from 1989 - 1993 .
Employees started to leave Walter Reed before the deal was even finalized , figuring they would lose their jobs anyway .
When news of the contract first surfaced in 2005 , 300 federal employees provided facilities management services at Walter Reed .
That figure had dropped to fewer than 60 by Feb.
3 , 2007 , the day before IAP took over facilities management .
When IAP did take over , the company replaced the remaining 60 employees with 50 private workers .
Inside Walter Reed , alarm bells were sounding .
On Sept. 21 , 2006 , Garrison Commander Peter Garibaldi wrote a letter to the base ’s commanding general saying privatization had put " patient care services at risk of mission failure . "
" We face the critical issues of retaining skilled personnel for the hospital and diverse professionals for the Garrison , while confronted with increased difficulty in hiring , " he wrote .
No one took notice then , and little has been done since to improve care or lessen bureaucracy at Walter Reed or at the Pentagon and the VA ’s network of hospitals and clinics nationwide .
Military hospitals are still short - staffed .
Injured soldiers are still left alone for hours , or even days .
In September 2007 , a congressionally mandated report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found the Pentagon and VA care for service members suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury was " inadequate " with " significant shortfalls " of doctors , nurses , and other caregivers necessary to treat wounded soldiers .
According to the GAO , " 46 percent of the Army ’s returning service members who were eligible to be assigned to a [ medical ] unit had not been assigned due in part to staffing shortages . "
Over half of the military ’s special " Wounded Warrior Transition Units " had staffing shortfalls of more than 50 percent .
Key bases like Fort Lewis in Washington and Fort Carson in Colorado were short massive amounts of doctors , nurses , and squad leaders .
In short , the Bush administration was simply not hiring enough doctors and nurses to care for what had become a tidal wave of injured soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In December , Congress put its solution forward  folding a Wounded Warrior Bill designed to help disabled veterans into a massive $ 700 billion defense bill .
But on Dec. 28 , President Bush surprised many observers by vetoing the measure .
Bush objected to a provision that would allow victims of Saddam Hussein ’s regime to seek compensation in court .
Congressional Democrats are now checking to see if they have the votes to override Bush ’s veto .
If they do n’t , they may send the bill back to President Bush with the offending sections removed .
Either way , Veterans for Common Sense ’s Paul Sullivan says veterans are not likely to see major progress until 2009 .
" Some of the problems may be solved in the next year if Congress fights hard but I do believe that the anti-veteran Bush administration does indeed need to go away so that real reform can be brought to the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs , " Sullivan told IPS .

With his round spectacles and unkempt beard , Sean Lennon cut a very family figure as he strolled along the streets of New York earlier this week .
He looked every inch his father 's son , and with girlfriend Kemp Muhl by his side in an oversized black felt hat , the pair unwittingly recreated a now iconic 1969 photograph of John Lennon and Yoko Ono .
Scroll down for more ...
Despite almost 40 years separating the images , the resemblance between the two couples was uncanny .
The 32 - year - old has more than just style in common with the late Beatle - Sean has also pursued a career as a singer - songwriter .
In October last year , he performed in the BBC Electric Proms alongside his very close friend Mark Ronson .
Sean began dating model Kemp after splitting from his long term love Bijou Phillips in 2004 - the relationship ended bitterly after she slept with his best friend Max LeRoy .

Was it lese majeste or just a good laugh ?
Scurrilous libel or a witty commentary on a topical issue for Spanish parents ?
El Jueves poked ribald fun at the royal couple
Both men received a hefty 3,000 - euro ( £ 2,100 ) fine .
Their offence was to have published a cartoon last July making ribald fun of the heir to the Spanish throne , and of the government 's scheme to encourage women to have more babies by giving mothers a special payment for each new birth .
It was a caricature of Prince Filipe having sex with his wife , Princess Letizia , and telling her : " Do you realise that if you get pregnant , it will be the closest thing to work I 've done in my life ? "
' More censorship '
The cartoon is funny , but the issue raised by its banning is serious .
The episode has worrying echoes of last year 's frenzied and violent protests against the cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad printed in European newspapers .
Spanish law gives special protection to royals
In the Spanish case , censorship of the magazine has already taken place and will not be reversed .
Within hours of the cartoon 's appearance Spanish judges ordered the seizure of all copies of that edition of the magazine .
This is only one of a growing number of recent cases of media censorship or self - censorship in Europe that have arisen thanks to restrictive laws or monopolistic patterns of media ownership .
Some , like the Spanish case , involve attempts to prosecute journalists for violating laws that give special protection to the most powerful and privileged figures in public life .
In Romania , a law has just been passed which exposes journalists to the risk of seven years in jail if they publish video footage taken secretly of politicians taking bribes .
It follows a case in which film of a government minister accepting a secret cash payment was shown on TV , leading to his resignation .
In France , a newspaper expose written during this year 's presidential election campaign , revealing that Cecilia Sarkozy - the then wife of winning candidate Nicolas Sarkozy - failed to cast her vote , was removed on orders from the newspaper 's owner , a close associate of the new President .
In Turkey , the infamous Article 301 of the criminal code makes it an offence punishable by jail terms to insult the armed forces or those in positions of high office .
Criminal prosecutions
Turkish officials insist that similar laws protecting the holders of high offices of state also exist in France and other Western countries .
But a Turkish legal expert explained the difference : " It 's like the laws in some American states that still ban oral sex between married couples " , he said .
" They exist on paper but are no longer used ! "
In Turkey , hundreds of journalists have been prosecuted under Article 301 and similar laws .
Miklos Haraszti is Europe 's chief enforcer of media freedom on the governments and courts of the 56 member states of the OSCE ( Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ) .
He says that oppressive laws against the media , intimidation and threats of dismissal , are all being used as weapons to censor the work of journalists in Eastern and Western Europe today .
The latest evidence for that harsh verdict comes from a Survey of Media Freedom in 20 European states presented to the OSCE 's Representative for Media Freedom last weekend .
The study , entitled Goodbye to Freedom ? , was published by the independent Association of European Journalists .
' Unusable ' laws
It finds that within the past year alone , journalists in 18 out of 20 European countries - including would - be models of democracy like Germany , the Netherlands and France - have faced criminal prosecution , or been jailed for breaking various laws that impede them from reporting on matters of public interest .
( The two exceptions were the Czech Republic and the UK . )
Yet each year dozens of judgements made by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg overturn the convictions of journalists on libel or secrecy charges in national courts .
So is it really time for the media in Europe to say " Goodbye to Freedom " ?
Miklos Haraszti says simply that European governments must not pass laws , like criminal libel for journalists , which are " unusable " .
The prosecution and conviction of the cartoonists who published a funny sketch of a Spanish prince to make their viewers laugh has chipped away a bit more from the fragile pillar of media freedom in Europe .
William Horsley is media freedom representative for the Association of European Journalists .
Okay , the world title for fastest text messaging is still raging in the streets .
The victor in the most recent contest was a bit of a dark horse — 93 - year - old telegraph operator Gordon Hill delivered a resounding ass - whoopin ' to his rival , 13 - year - old Brittany Devlin , using Morse Code .
Of course , Mr. Hill does have nigh on 80 years of practice under his belt , which was enough to help him triumph even despite Brittany 's liberal use of texting slang ( Mr. Hill transmitted the chosen phrase verbatim ) .
The showdown was sponsored by the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney , Australia , and the rivals had to transmit the following message : " Hey , girlfriend , you can text all your best pals to tell them where you are going and what you are wearing . "
Damn straight !
Screw the T9 , Engadget 's switching over to Morse from now on .

Evolution in the species " companies " Evolution is evident and well - known in biological species , and can be seen in artifical environments quite easily , but evolution actually applies to any environment with moderately well - defined entities that have moderately measurable properties , where these entities appear and disappear over time .
For example , companies , as a species , are subject to evolution .
They are born , they live , they die ; and they each have unique properties ( different ways that they operate ) which determine their characteristics .
Actually , the whole of the species " group of people with a common agenda " is subject to evolution , but let 's look specifically at companies that try to convince people to use their products or services in the software industry , since that 's what I 'm familiar with .
For a long time , the software industry consisted primarily of one kind of company .
First the company would be founded with an idea , and then the company would get venture capital funding , which would be used to fund software development , the fruits of which would be sold to customers , and the money raised from those sales would fund further development of more software , and the cycle continued .
These companies die when they run out of money .
Since venture capital is n't infinite ( investors will stop pouring money in when they realise that they are never going to see any of it again ) , the key is raising money from software sales .
There are several ways of ensuring that a company will get money from software sales :
If the product being sold is the only product in the market that solves the needs of the users it targets , then it is almost certain that the majority of the target audience will buy the product .
This is called a monopoly .
.
If the product being sold is by far the best product in its category , then , all other things ( especially the price ) being equal , it is likely that much of the target audience will buy the product .
Making the best product often requires disproportionally more effort than creating a mediocre product , though .
It is also difficult to maintain the honour of having the best product ; it requires constant development to keep ahead of the competition .
It is much easier to improve a mediocre product to be almost as good as the best product than it is to take a product that is already the best product and make it significantly better .
If the product being sold is the cheapest product in its category , then it is likely that much of the target audience will buy the product , so long as the product is good enough .
How good the product has to be to be " good enough " is a function of how much cheaper the product is relative to the other products .
If the product is being sold to users of existing products in the same product category , then the target audience is more likely to buy the product if the total cost of switching to the new product is lower than the cost of switching to another product .
When the users are using an older version of the new product , then this is called vendor lock - in .
When the user are using an older version of another product , then this is called migration .
Each of these strategies has a counter - strategy .
For example , to counter an incumbent with a monopoly position , a company " just " has to provide a product of equal value .
To counter a competitor with the best product , a company " just " has to provide a product that is better .
To counter a competitor with a cheaper product , a company " just " has to lower its prices .
To counter a competitor whose users would find it more expensive to switch to the company 's new product than they would to upgrade to the newer version of the competition 's product , the company " just " has to provide a transition path ( if the cost of switching vendor would come from having to convert all existing data , for instance , a company could " just " support the competition 's file formats ) .
Of course , that 's often easier said than done .
A company can't lower its prices to below its operating costs , as doing so would cause the company to eventually run out of money and die .
Similarly , making the best product is significantly more difficult than making a mediocre product , and a company can run out of funds while trying .
It turns out , though , that the rules change when the competiting companies are unequal .
If a company has a lot of money , there are a number of tricks it can play to compete with companies with less money :
The big company can sell its products for significantly less than its smaller competition ( and at a loss for the big company , using its large cash reserves to survive ) .
The competition will eventually die , since it wo n't be able to sell products and thus will run out of money .
When the competition goes away , the big company can raise prices again .
The big company can implement one - way transition paths from every competitor 's product to its own , and then introduce a feature that makes a reverse migration expensive .
Users that switch to the big company 's product will be locked in , which will reduce the potential market for the competition .
The big company can improve the product while it has competition , and then stop improving while it has no competition .
The big company can use its credibility to reduce the likelihood that users will buy products from the competition , even if the big company does n't yet have a competing product .
This is known as spreading fear , uncertainty , and doubt ( FUD ) .
This is where the evolution comes in .
If a big company repeatedly kills all the companies that follow the model I 've described so far , then only the companies that use different models will survive .
This is n't all theoretical .
Microsoft is a big company , and they 've played all the tricks above .
Many companies in the software industry have died because they failed to make money , and many of those died because Microsoft starved them of that money by using the tricks described above .
( Sometimes , the use of those tricks has been deemed illegal ; other times , not .
That 's besides the point here . )
What 's interesting is the effects that Microsoft 's strategies have had from an evolutionary standpoint .
When we look at the major companies competing with Microsoft today , we find that none of them are actually using the operating model I describe above .
Beating Microsoft by not needing money : Firefox , Apache , and Linux - based operating systems are examples of open source software arising as ways to compete with Microsoft .
Microsoft 's usual strategies typically do n't work with open source software .
Microsoft can't undersell open source , as it costs nothing .
Furthemore , since the source is independent of the company behind the source , if the company runs out of money another one can simply come along and replace it , continuing from where it left off .
Thus , starving the company of money does n't actually kill the competition ; indeed , open source software actually turns this strategy against the big company .
It will take a long time , but in due course Microsoft will run out of money if it does n't make profits , whereas open source projects can continue indefinitely .
Open source is not perfectly safe against the other tactics described above , though .
It is still vulnerable to vendor lock - in and FUD , and a better product can still beat it .
Projects like Wine help Linux with vendor lock - in , as it allows users using Microsoft Windows to switch to Linux more cheaply than if they had to replace all their software ; similarly Open Office implements file format convertors to read Microsoft Office documents ; and Samba implements Microsoft 's networking protocols to allow a migration to a Linux - based infrastructure without requiring that users switch all their existing infrastructure at the same time .
FUD is heavily used by Microsoft against open source projects ( a recent example is this FUD article against Firefox ) ; open source as a development model can mitigate this by leveraging its community to counter such claims .
The biggest difficulty , though , is in creating and maintaining the best product .
Nothing especially changed in the browser market in the years just before Firefox 1.0 was released : the market was stagnant after IE6's release , with all the alternatives ( Netscape , Opera , etc ) being fundamentally not good enough in comparison .
Firefox 1.0 was the best product of its time , and that reason , and that reason alone , resulted in its success .
All Microsoft have to do to beat Firefox is make a better product , something for which they certainly have the resources .
Similarly , all the Linux OS community has to do to beat Windows is create a fundamentally better product from the end user 's perspective , while ensuring that the cost of migration is lower than the cost of upgrading Windows .
Microsoft has clearly realised that open source is a new type of competitor , and they just as clearly have n't worked out how to compete with it ( which is simply to make a better product ) .
This is probably because they have spent so long as the " big company " that they have forgotten the four ways of making money , and can only remember the tricks for competing with smaller companies .
Microsoft making a superior product would n't kill open source , though .
It would just make Microsoft money while the open source community and companies themselves developed a better product again .
( Just look at open source today : Linux operating systems are n't , from the end user 's perspective , fundamentally better than Windows , but Linux OS companies continue with a growing but small set of the users . )
Thus the technique of improving only until the competition is dead does n't work on open source competitiors .
Microsoft would have to continuously work to improve its products to compete with open source .
Beating Microsoft by not allowing vendor lock - in : Google 's operating practices differ from the typical software vendor in that the main service that Google provides is completely devoid of any vendor lock - in potential .
Google beat the search engines before it by being better than they were , and Google could easily lose all its users overnight if a much better search engine was to be developed .
The only reason Google has a majority market share is that it is the best .
Microsoft 's usual strategies do n't work against this kind of company : they can't lock the users into their alternative , and so the users have a truly free choice as to which service to use , Microsoft 's or the competition 's , and they usually pick the better alternative .
Google has also learnt the zero cost trick : by charging advertisers instead of charging users , Google can get a large market share of users , which is needed to sell to advertisers .
Google 's search engine users do n't care how many advertisers publish ads through Google , so even if Microsoft undercut Google on the advertiser side , it still would n't reduce the number of users on the search side .
In addition , because the advertisers want to advertise on the site with the users , and because advertisers could just use both advertising systems , undercutting on the advertising side does n't actually hurt Google .
( Making advertising free on Microsoft 's network would just lead to advertisers advertising on both networks , which would hurt Microsoft , since they would be footing the bill , but not Google , who would still be making money . )
The FUD strategy depends on the credibility of the company spreading it , but Google is widely trusted , so FUD does n't work very effectively against Google either .
As noted above , though , there is a simple way in which Microsoft ( or any other company ) could compete with Google : make a better product .
In fact , since Google 's entire strategy — intentionally or not — is based on not allowing vendor lock - in , any better product which is also free would almost immediately beat Google .
Naturally , Google invests heavily in making sure it continuously improves .
( Note that unlike with open source , which could probably continue indefinitely under a superior competitor , it is n't clear that Google actually could survive for long once it lost its users to a competitor . )
Beating Microsoft just by being better :
This brings me to my third example , Apple .
Apple has died and been reborn several times , as far as I can tell , but its most recent strategy is based almost exclusively on one concept : making the best product for the user , and doing so in several different markets at once .
This technique is difficult , because it requires constant high - quality development .
However , it is very effective against a big company like Microsoft that has , by and large , stopped relying on quality to compete .
As a corollary , Apple has found an interesting counter - strategy to the big - company strategy of undercutting the competition until it is starved .
It sells its products with very high profit margins , and sells these products in a small number of very separate markets .
Thus , it does n't have to sell many units to survive at all , and it does n't need to sell any units in any one area so long as it sells enough in another area .
So for example , Microsoft could n't compete with the iPod by giving away the Zune : even if most users would stop buying iPods and would instead just get the free , or nearly free , Zune , the net effect would just be that Microsoft would lose lots of money and Apple would wait with few ill effects .
Apple 's switch to intel enabled Boot Camp and products like VMWare Fusion , to mitigate the problems of Microsoft 's attempts at vendor lock - in .
( Apple also plays its own mild games of vendor lock - in to prevent users from leaving Apple products once they make the switch . )
Apple has , even more than Google , become somewhat immune to Microsoft FUD purely on the basis of its own credibility .
By almost never pre-announcing products , by repeatedly delivering products of high quality , and by a management of the media so adept as to be aweinspiring , Apple has managed to almost completely neutralise any FUD attempt against them .
But again , there is one way that Apple is vulnerable .
If Microsoft were to make a truly superior product , Apple would lose users .
However , unless this strategy was applied to all of Apple 's products simultaneously , it would n't kill Apple , it would only starve one particular part of the company .
All Apple would have to do to come back is make a significantly better product again .
Conclusion :
The companies that could n't beat Microsoft have all died , and evolution has resulted in three very different types of companies that are each immune to Microsoft 's strategies in their own way .
Yet all are still vulnerable to the same thing : a better product .
For the end users , this is a good position for the industry to be in .

A low - bandwidth , high - latency , high - cost , and unreliable data channel I like food , and I 'm not really good at the creative art of cooking ( though I 'm a fine sous - chef ) , so I eat out at restaurants a lot .
I usually pay by credit card .
In the US , waiters have a minimum wage below the normal minimum wage , and thus you always have to tip , and so you never pay what the bill says ( and I usually tip well , unless the service or food was appalling , even outside the US ) .
The net effect of this is that you basically get to decide how much you pay .
Indeed , credit card bills at restaurants have a space where you fill in how much you want to pay .
I do n't like doing arithmetic , especially not of the kind " $ 85.47 * 1.17 " , and so I just approximate .
$ 85.47 is about $ 90 , 15 % of $ 90 is about 15 , round to down to cancel out the earlier approximations gives about $ 100 .
So I pay $ 100.00 and go on my merry way .
One day I looked at my bank statement and it was something like : POS Trans ZIBIBBO PALO ALTO CAUS $ 76.00 POS Trans CHEESECAKE PALO ALTO CAUS $ 40.00 POS Trans OUTBACK #0514 CUPERTINO CAUS $ 210.00 POS Trans BROOKFIELD'S REST # 2 SACRAMENTO CAUS $ 34.00
Look at all those zero cents ... there are data bits there , lying unused !
It struck me that with every single restaurant transaction I could set the cents field to some number under my control , thus allowing me to communicate with myself at a later date !
This would be really useful as a way of sending ratings information back to myself , so that I could later review the restaurants online or otherwise keep track of where I would want to go back to or where I would want to avoid ( since I eat out a lot , restaurants somewhat blend together in my memory ) .
We can set any number from 0 to 99 .
In binary , that 's 0b0000000 to 0b1100011 .
In other words , we have seven bits to play with , except that if both of the high bits are set , then we lose bits 3 , 4 , and 5 .
There are five things I wanted to be able to communicate .
The first was the number of guests , so that I can divide the price by how many people I was paying for , to determine the price - per- person .
The second was the rating , whether I should go back or not .
The last three were whether the restaurant had wifi , whether they were suitable for vegetarians ( Carey is vegetarian ) , and whether they had drinks I liked ( I do n't drink addictive drinks , drinks containing mind - altering drugs , carbonated drinks , and drinks containing high fructose corn syrup , which basically excludes almost anything you can buy in the US in many cheap restaurants , and even some fancy ones ) .
If we consider the rating to be a four - state flag , with values " avoid " , " ok " , " good " , " awesome " , and if we limit ourselves to being able to specify 0 , 1 , 2 , or " more than 2 " guests ( in addition to me ) , and if we establish that if we want to avoid the place in future then it really does n't matter whether the restaurant had Internet , a vegetarian selection , or good drinks , then we can neatly fit this into our contstrained not - quite - 7 - bit bitfield like this :
64 32 16 8 4 2 1 r d v i g ... where : r The rating , according to the following scale : 0 awesome 32 good 64 ok 96 avoid ( and ensure d , v , and i are set to 0 ) d Whether drinks are good or not ( set means they are good ) v
Whether a vegetarian selection is available ( set means there are vegetarian options ) i
Whether free wifi Internet access is available ( set means wifi is available ) g
How many guests were paid for in the transaction : 0 just me 1 me and one guests 2 me and two guests 3 me and three or more guests I did this , and used it for a while .
I quickly discovered that something was wrong .
The numbers in my bank statement made no sense , for example dinners with more than 2 guests at locations where I knew that I had been with just one person .
I changed to a new scheme .
Instead of encoding data in the cents field , I instead just store the last two digits of the dollar amount into the cents field .
A checksum , if you will .
So if it cost around $ 34 with tip , then I put $ 34.34 , or if it cost $ 122 , then I put $ 122.22 .
I do this reliably now , on all restaurant transactions .
What I 've found is a shocking number of restaurants do n't charge me what I write .
For a while I thought I just had bad handwriting , but I then went out of my way to write very clear numbers and that did n't help .
For example , Zibibbo's in Palo Alto .
I remember very clearly writing $ 77.77 , but was charged $ 76.95 .
That 's not the original amount without tip ( which was probably closer to $ 65 ) , it 's not what I wrote , what the heck is it ?
On the other hand , the other time I went , they charged me $ 865.65 , exactly what I wrote .
A cafe in Monterey ( Portola Cafe ) charged me $ 18.28 .
Either they charged me ¢ 10 too much , or they gave me a $ 10 discount .
The Melting Pot , San Jose , charged me $ 70.54 .
Where did the .54 come from ?
Why not take the remaining ¢ 16 ?
Pasta Pomodoro did the same trick as Portola , charging me $ 37.47 .
But two months before that , they charged me $ 34.31 , which is probably ¢3 less than I wrote .
Why am I getting overcharged sometimes and undercharged others ?
In Hawaii , the majority of restaurants ignored the tip altogether , just charging me the original amount regardless of what I wrote .
Are people in Hawaii so relaxed that they do n't need the extra money from tips ?
My theory is that it is because I do n't write an explicit tip , I just give the total .
Maybe restaurants need the tip as well as the total , and so to save time they just work out a round dollar tip that is close to what I wrote , and charge me that .
My next step , to test this theory , is to start always writing the actual tip amount in .

For a kid to play , Carey and I have now seen Avenue Q twice , once on Broadway and once in San Francisco .
I love this show .
Everyone should see it .
The internet is really really great .
I ’ve got a fast connection so i do n’t have to wait .
There 's always some new site ;
I browse all day and night ;
It 's like i’m surfing at the speed of light .
Work on HTML5 progresses at a measurable pace — literally , now , since I 'm measuring the number of e-mails I have outstanding on a regular basis to determine how well I 'm hitting my quarterly targets .
( Answer : Not as well as I 'd like , but not as badly as I 'd feared . )
As a side - effect of writing the code to trawl my IMAP folders to count the outstanding e-mails , I wrote a tool that also exposes the folders on the Web ( after having filtered out the confidential feedback I get , of course ) .
I was hoping this would address some of the complaints about lack of transparency , and indeed a number of WHATWG contributors were interested , gave helpful feedback , and even wrote their own frontends using the tool 's APIs .
However , from the W3C corner of the HTML5 communities I only got complaints .
The most notable complaint was that the tool did n't work in IE , which was apparently a problem not because it actually stopped anyone from accessing the page ( I have n't received any complaints from anyone who actually could n't get to the page ) but because it might potentially stop users of old accessibility tools that only work with IE from accessing the page .

I 've actually been using the latest version of JAWS ( the popular Windows screen reader software for blind people ) recently , as part of my work on HTML5 .
From a usability point of view it is possibly the worst software I have ever used .
I 'm still horrified at how bad the accessibility situation is .
All this time I 've been hearing people worried about whether or not Web pages have longdesc attributes specified or whatnot , when in fact the biggest problems facing blind users are so much more fundamental as to make image - related issues seem almost trivial in comparison .
For example , JAWS will happily take the last sentence of a paragraph , and the first sentence of the next paragraph , and run them into each other as one sentence , if there 's no full stop at the end of the first paragraph .
If you really want to make your Web pages more readable to blind users , forget longdesc or even alt , or even markup of any kind , just make sure you 're using full punctuation !
And that 's just one example .
Browsing the Web with JAWS is a horrifying experience not because of the poor state of the Web , which is admittedly very poor indeed from the point of view of semantic and accessible markup , but because of the terrifyingly poor state of the screen reader software .
What might make my experiences with JAWS even more worrying is that I 'm told JAWS is amongst the best of the available screen reader software .
It certainly is n't worth its ridiculous $ 895 price tag ( let alone the $ 1095 price tag for the " professional " version I got ) .
There is a big market opportunity here for someone to make a usable and affordable native speech Web browser or screen reader .
Accessibility advocates could do more for accessibility by writing test suites for screen readers to check their basic HTML support ( like supporting the p element ) than they ever will by trying to educate Web authors .
What do you do with a B.A. in English ?
What is my life going to be ?
Four years of college and plenty of knowledge
Have earned me this useless degree .
Going back to my earlier comment , though , I 'm a little confused as to why several people who have joined the HTML5 community from the W3C HTML WG side are so hostile , while those who joined the community through the WHATWG side are so much more friendly and constructive .
A couple of weeks ago I had to temporarily ban someone from the WHATWG list after they repeatedly cross-posted an off - topic flamewar to four mailing lists including the WHATWG list .
( They did n't get banned from the other three lists as far as I know . )
I was really sad about having to do this , but the health of the community is important , and sometimes extreme measures have to be taken .
This is the first time I 've had to do that to someone on the WHATWG list , and the list has existed since 2004 .
( I 've set up personal mail filters for people on the WHATWG list before , to ensure that I read certain people 's suggestions only once I 've read all the other mail , but I 've never had to actually ban someone . )
The HTML working group is having a meeting in November .
I do n't really see the point , but as I told Dan ( the chair of the working group ) , if we do have a meeting , I 'd like us to use the unconference style , as that 's probably the only useful thing we could do .
Hopefully we 'll have the agenda this week , that way I can know whether I can justify going or not .
I can't really justify spending Google 's money on travel , let alone justify the carbon emissions and the time away from editing the spec , without knowing what exactly the meeting will consist of .
If the meeting just consists of us going through open issues and discussing them , then I wo n't go , since in my experience that 's a huge waste of everyone 's time unless the issue has already failed to be addressed by more asynchronous methods like e-mail .
For technical work like this you really need to be able to sit down and think about issues , and ponder them with a whiteboard ; it is very hard to make sure all the applicable research has been done when there is pressure to discuss and reach a decision on a topic in 60 minutes or less .
This is especially true since for almost all issues , the first time you look at it you 'll find many things you need to research , and it can take days to get all the data you want to make an educated decision .
Using actual data to make decisions about technical issues is n't a very common practice in W3C working groups , which is probably why a lot of the people in the HTML working group who come from a W3C background think a face - to - face meeting is a useful thing to have .
I want you to know
The time that we 've spent
How great it 's been
How much it 's meant .
In July we went to Oslo , Bergen , Geneva , Lourtier , Mamaroneck , Staatsburg , and Hillsdale , to see friends , family , and folk music .
The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival has a sign language interpreter on every stage .
Now mind you , this is a music festival , a specifically sound - orientated event .
Yet it is highly accessible ; all the songs have alternative fallback content for those who cannot hear them .
There are several things about this that I noticed .
First :
The visual version of the song ( lyrics in sign language , and the emotional content of the voice , expressed in the facial expressions and style of the sign language interpreter ) does n't convey the same thing as the original audio version ( the melody , the harmony , the percussion , the lyrics , and the emotion in all of those ) .
It is merely a translation of the parts of the audio stream that are n't intrinsically audio - only .
Alternative content does n't necessarily convey everything in the primary medium , nor does it have to to be useful and enjoyed by the target audience .
Second :
The sign language interpretation is actually quite fun to watch even if you can hear the music , it 's like a kind of interpretative dance .
Alternative content is useful to those who do n't need it as well .
This is n't just my opinion .
It was clear at the festival that the sizeable deaf community present there was fully enjoying the music .
The presence of sign language interpreters made them feel part of the event , and conveyed everything that they wanted conveyed .
Meanwhile , the hearing patrons enjoyed the music and the sign language — I heard comments from several people to the effect that the sign language interpreters were effectively an intrinsic part of the act .
( To the point where even people who did n't necessarily understand sign language had opinions on which interpreter was better . )
It 's interesting how the prevailing opinion of Web accessibility experts is so far removed from the existing and successful accessibility practices in the non -tech world .

Everyone Else is Doing It. Next : Three Smart Things You Should Know About Genomics
Just the mere thought of money can turn a person selfish , so that he helps others less often and prefers to play alone , according to a study .
The concept of money , they suggest , makes a person feel more self - sufficient and thus more apt to stand alone .
You might be more self - sufficient , but that doesn?t mean you ?ll be happy .
A survey of women found that those with higher incomes devoted more time to working , commuting , childcare and shopping , leading to more stress and tension than women pulling in less cash .
Wild success causes elation for many people .
But for some it spells anxiety .
It 's all in how they see themselves .
How people view their abilities in the workplace or classroom impacts how they respond to success and failure , new research reveals .
Individuals who think their abilities are set for life ( as in " a leopard ca n't change its spots " ) experience high anxiety over unexpected accomplishments compared with those who view their capabilities as flexible ( think " turning over a new leaf " ) .
" People are driven to feel that they can predict and control their outcomes , " said co-researcher Jason Plaks , a social psychologist at the University of Toronto .
" So when their performance turns out to violate their predictions , this can be unnerving — even if the outcome is , objectively speaking , good news . "
This phenomenon is intuitive among social psychologists but had never been put to a rigorous test .
Good news ?
Plaks and Kristin Stecher of the University of Washington surveyed groups of UW students in a series of studies .
In one survey , 118 participants answered questions that indicated their type of perspective ( fixed or malleable ) , expectations for test performance and emotional state .
Then participants took three versions of what they thought was an intelligence test .
After receiving a stock score ( 61st percentile ) on the first exam , participants got schooled on how to improve their performances before taking another similar test .
For that test , researchers randomly assigned each student a score that had improved , stayed the same or declined relative to the first test .
Among students with improved scores , fixed - view individuals reported more anxiety and performed worse on the third test compared with the " supple students . "
Plaks suggests the students with steadfast perspectives could n't handle the success , because it went against their established views .
" On the one hand , it 's good news that they [ fixed - view participants ] have improved a lot , " Plaks told LiveScience .
" On the other hand , it 's bad news in that it violates their view of themselves . "
Among participants who showed no change in test scores , those with malleable views reported anxiety and underperformed on the following test compared with their " rigid " counterparts .
A real - life example of this behavior might be dieters , Plaks said .
" They 're trying their best , giving it a good , honest try to lose weight , and it just is n't happening .
And that should be especially frustrating for those adopting a malleable perspective , " he said .
Mind - bending
Whether a person tends to lean toward the flexible or rigid view is a learned behavior , the researchers figure .
That means it can be unlearned or changed , Plaks said .
" Some of my colleagues have isolated socialization patterns and feedback patterns that parents and teachers can give to children that would inculcate you as the fixed view or the malleable view , " Plaks said .
If teachers or parents teach children that ability and intelligence are set at birth , this could lead to a grown - up who thinks he or she can't make any headway with hard work or other self - directed strategies .
That could be detrimental to a person 's professional life .
In the workplace , flexible frames of mind can foster creativity , in that employees will be more likely to try new things and think outside of perceived personal limitations .
As the researchers suggest in the October issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , managers and individuals themselves can help to change perspectives in their favor .
" Managers can create a workplace environment , a workplace culture , in which a malleable view of one 's abilities is encouraged , " Plaks said .
" Rather than labeling the workers and putting them into their respective boxes , and kind of implying that that 's what you do and that 's the limit of your abilities , managers can create an atmosphere in which people are encouraged to try new things without necessarily fear of failure . "
" We are very frustrated because we have a Supreme Court that seems determined to say that the wealthier have more right to free speech than the rest of us .
For example , they say you could n’t stop me from spending all the money I ’ve saved over the last five years on Hillary 's campaign if I wanted to , even though it would clearly violate the spirit of campaign finance reform , " - Bill Clinton , December 24 , 2007 .

And did he really say he 's going to be on the ballot in November ( maybe with Nader ) on what can only be understood as a third - party ticket ?
Noam Chomsky ???
As a Presidential adviser ?
Seriously weird .
On the other hand , as entertainment goes you do approach a Gravel video with the fear that he could do or say anything .

Facebook has suffered its first fall in UK users , with a 5 % drop between December and January , according to new figures .
However , Facebook still had 8.5 million unique users in January and remains the most popular social networking website in the UK , according to Nielsen Online , the internet research company behind the results .
And Facebook 's nearest rival , MySpace , also saw a 5 % drop in UK traffic between December and January , according to Nielsen Online .
MySpace ranked second in terms of UK social networking websites in January , with 5 million unique users , while Bebo , which saw users drop by 2 % month on month , was ranked third with 4.1 million .
Facebook shed around 400,000 UK unique users month on month , following an impressive 17 consecutive months of growth , according to the research .
This is the first drop Nielsen Online has recorded in Facebook 's user numbers in the UK .
Nielsen Online has been recording the number of monthly unique users visiting Facebook since July 2006 , when the social networking website 's UK audience first became large enough to be regularly measured by the company 's research panel .
" One month of falling audiences does n't spell the decline of Facebook or social networking , " said Alex Burmaster , European internet analyst at Nielsen Online .
" However , most of the leading social networks are less popular in the UK than they were a year ago .
It was inevitable that early growth rates could n't be sustained and the larger networks have been plateauing over the last few months . "
To put this dip in context , Facebook 's audience is still a massive 712 % higher than in January 2007 and 9 % bigger than at the end of October .
Over the same period MySpace has seen its number of unique users fall by 9 % since January last year and 14 % over the past three months .
Bebo has seen a 53 % year - on - year increase in unique users compared to January 2007 , but a dip of 8 % since the end of October .
" Growth among the big players looks to be more about getting people from their competitors , not attracting new people to social networking , " added Burmaster .
" However , real growth potential lies in the niche networks , those based on a particular lifestyle or interest , such as travel , music , wealth or business . "
Nielsen
Online only measures website traffic based on a panel of UK users at home and work - it does not cover usage in schools , universities and internet cafes , meaning that younger internet users are under -reported .
Other online traffic research firms , such as Comscore , do include users outside work and home , and as a result their unique user figures for individual websites tend to be significantly higher .

The foreign secretary said in both cases US planes refuelled on the UK dependent territory of Diego Garcia .
He said he was " very sorry " to have to say that previous denials made in " good faith " were now having to be corrected .
The renditions - the transport of terror suspects around the world for interrogation - only came to light after a US records search , he said .
BBC world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds said the revelations were " a serious embarrassment for the British government " .
Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former Prime Minister Tony Blair made statements in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 saying there was no evidence that rendition flights had stopped on UK territory .
Water boarding
Mr Miliband said the US had told him that neither of the two men involved in the rendition were British , neither left the plane and the US had " assured " him that no US detainees were ever held on Diego Garcia and US records showed no other evidence of renditions through UK territory .
But he said he would compile a list of all flights in UK territory about which concerns had been expressed to send to the US for " specific assurance " they were not used for rendition .
One of the men involved has since been released and one is at Guantanamo Bay .
We both agree that the mistakes made in these two cases are not acceptable
David Miliband
Analysis : Political fall - out
In quotes : Rendition denials
Mr Miliband said the UK had been told neither of them had been involved in " secret detention centres " nor were subject to water boarding " or other similar forms of interrogation " .
He said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice shared his " deep regret " about the mistaken assurances .
" Extraordinary rendition " is the term used by US intelligence agencies when they send terror suspects for interrogation by security officials in other countries , where they have no legal protection or rights under American law .
' Widespread concern '
The UK says it expects the US to seek its permission before rendering detainees through UK airspace or territory .
Later Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " It is unfortunate that this was not known and it was unfortunate it happened without us knowing that it had happened but it 's important to put in procedures [ to ensure ] this will not happen again . "
He added : " We share the disappointment that everybody has about what 's actually happened . "
The truth is this is a gross embarrassment for the British government
Sir Menzies Campbell
Former Lib Dem leader
In full : Miliband statement
In full : CIA statement
In the Commons , William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said he accepted assurances were made " in good faith " but said : " This information will cause widespread concern given the categoric nature of the assurances previously given .
" More worrying still , it means that very specific assurances about the use of the facilities at Diego Garcia have also turned out , although given in good faith , to have been false . "
Legal responsibilities
For the Lib Dems , Edward Davey called for a full inquiry and said extraordinary rendition was " state - sponsored abduction " and the government must ensure that Britain was not used to " facilitate " it .
Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell added : " The truth is , this is a gross embarrassment , in spite of its good faith , for the British government , involving as it does a breach of our moral obligations and possibly our legal responsibilities as well . "
Labour MP
Mike Gapes , chairman of the foreign affairs select committee , told MPs the US administration " has clearly misled or lied to our government , [ which ] has resulted in our government misleading ... members of this House . "
But Mr Miliband told the BBC later : " I do not believe the US government set out to mislead the British government .
I believe they told us in good faith they had no evidence of the use of Diego Garcia . "
CIA 'errors '
He said British principles were " absolutely clear " - that it would not support the use of rendition for torture and always required permission for the use of British bases .
" I have it from the mouth of the Secretary of State of the US that that is understood at the highest levels of in the American government , " he added .
Torture is against our laws and our values
Mike Hayden
CIA director
Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said extraordinary rendition was " a polite way of talking about kidnapping and secret detention " .
" It is not enough for the government simply to accept US assurances on correct behaviour in the war on terror - we should retain our own integrity and act accordingly , " she said .
In a statement CIA director Mike Hayden said neither of the two men on the flights " was ever part of CIA 's high - value terrorist interrogation program " but said they would learn from their " errors " .
He added that speculation about a CIA holding facility on Diego Garcia was " false " - as were allegations that detainees were transported to be tortured .
" Torture is against our laws and our values .
And , given our mission , CIA could have no interest in a process destined to produce bad intelligence . "
W ith only days to go before the Iowa caucuses , one Republican candidate is showing his stripes , Mike Huckabee .
Yes , this former Baptist minister , and Arkansas governor , boy next door , Huckleberry Finn , who looks like a cross between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Stewart , as innocuous as a barfly , waited in his campaign bus across the street while three demonstrators , all in their 50's , were arrested for " criminal trespass " at his Iowa headquarters .
According to a press release from the Catholic Peace Ministry , the protesters bore signs reading " Who Would Jesus Bomb ? " called for an end to the war in Iraq , any other planned military adventure , as well as read from the Bible to bolster their argument for peace while they were carted off .
As they were transported to Polk County Jail , where they were charged , and later released , cheers rippled through the crowd of onlookers .
Those apprehended by Des Moines finest were members of a group called SODaPOP ( Seasons of Discontent : A Presidential Campaign ) who , a few months ago , reportedly delivered a letter to Mr. Huckabee in which they requested his pledge to withdraw all troops from Iraq within three months of his presidency , as well as halt any plans for military action against Iran .
Addditionally , they called for tax dollars currently being spent on combat to instead bolster the " infrastructure of the United States . "
The three SODaPOP members gathered in the Huckabee campaign office , in Des Moines , merely to await a response to their letter to the presidential candidate , two months ago , which went unanswered .
If it all sounds surreal , or like something out of Saturday Night Live , guaranteed you wo n't feel that way in November , 2008 , if Huckabee wins the election .
And , while that 's not likely to happen , the fact that his campaign has made it as far as it has is something that would scare the hell out of anyone who considers themselves rational , let alone progressive .
What a sad day it is , in America , when a presidential candidate has a tiny group of middle - aged protestors arrested , and charged , with criminally trespassing on his property .
One wonders , too , if , upon election , Mr. Huckabee would also consider the White House his " property . "
While the First Amendment guarantees " freedom of assembly , " one hardly thinks that the framers conceived of things like You Tube , campaign headquarters , or the Grey Panthers , either , for that matter .
More than thirty members of the press witnessed the protest which was only the first stop scheduled as SODaPOP has reportedly made the same demands of eight other candidates .
Curiously , the candidate who has surged to the head of the polls with his rugged Ronnie Reagan , boy next door , good looks increasingly proves himself to be a formidable shill for neo-Conservative revivalists .
One whose motto is " Faith , Family , and Freedom , " and boasts that : " My faith is my life -- it defines me .
My faith does n't influence my decisions , it drives them " sat patiently waiting , in his campaign bus , across the street , as the three SODaPOP boomers were handcuffed , and driven out of his Iowa headquarters .
One can think of no better way to illustrate what a quintessential farce the former minister 's call to protect the " sanctity of life " is .
Oscar Wilde once said " Only the superficial do n't judge by appearances . "
If the actions of his Iowa staff , as well as what may , at best , be seen as his passive acquiescence to these unnecessary and absurd arrests are any indication of a Huckabee presidency , then his campaign must end in Iowa .
Is the Primary System Flawed ?
As I sit here in New Hampshire , and my primary vote has long since passed , and I watch the rest of the primaries play out , I am left asking myself if the primary system is flawed .
Every four years the New Hampshire primary comes under attack by other states who try to become first in the nation primary states .
When I see my state come under attack for not being diverse enough , or not being representative of the rest of the country , I get defensive .
Hey , if anyone is going to bash my state it ’s going to be me .
I live here , I reserve the right to criticize at will .
But when the attacks come from outside , I have always rallied around the idea that New Hampshire should remain the first in the nation primary .
In defense of New Hampshire being first , I rationalize it by saying we are a small state with few delegates , in the overall scheme of things New Hampshire ’s primary is really just a litmus test of sorts .
I am now beginning to wonder if the primary system is seriously flawed .
I am not just saying this because New Hampshire helped to propel the worst possible Republican candidate to the nomination , well , maybe I am , I do n’t know .
But as I have been surfing through blogs I have seen several people complaining about the primaries , and how their vote does n’t mean anything .
At first I laughed this off as sour grapes , of course their votes have meaning , but as I started to think about it these people do have a point .
In New Hampshire I had the choice between six Republican candidates .
I could chose between every candidate who declared they were running for president .
I am one of a small minority of people in the country who can claim that .
Does that sound like a fair way to elect a nominee for president ?
Since I cast my vote , millions of Americans have headed to the polls unable to vote for their first choice .
Millions of Americans have had to vote for their second , third , or even fourth choice for president .
I ca n’t help but start to think that there has to be a better way .
Republican voters now really have no say in the election because John McCain has basically sewn it up , so what is the point for those who oppose him ?
The only accomplishment they have is knowing that they can cast a protest vote against him .
It may make them feel better , but it does n’t accomplish anything .
I do n’t know what the alternative is , perhaps a national primary day would n’t be such a bad idea .
The only problem I see with a national primary would be if it was held to early , thus creating a general election cycle that was too long .
If the national primary was held shortly before the conventions it may work .
I love the drama of the primaries .
I love watching the ebbs and flows , the ups and downs .
I love watching the candidates gain and lose momentum while they battle for the right to lead the greatest country on earth .
But I have to wonder , would I love it so much if the candidate I wanted to vote for dropped out before I ever got a chance to cast my vote for him ?
Probably not .
Most Dangerous Trouble Spot In The World Update
A prominent U.S. - based human rights group Friday released what it said was a recording of Pakistan 's attorney general acknowledging that next week 's national elections would be " massively " rigged .
Human Rights
Watch said a journalist made the recording during a telephone interview with Attorney General Malik Qayyum when Qayyum took a second call without disconnecting the first , allowing his end of the second conversation to be overheard and recorded .
In the recording , Qayyum , Pakistan 's top legal officer , can be heard advising the caller to accept a ticket he is being offered by an unidentified political party for a seat , Human Rights Watch said .
" They will massively rig to get their own people to win , " Qayyum said , according to a transcript released by Human Rights Watch .
" If you get a ticket from these guys , take it . "
Awan 's comments came a day after Musharraf warned his opponents not to immediately claim fraud and stage demonstrations after the vote .
Another opposition party , headed by ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , rejected Musharraf 's warning , saying it would stage nationwide protests if it believes the election was manipulated .
" We know Musharraf wants to rig the elections , " said Sadiq ul - Farooq , a senior member of Sharif 's party .
" If he did it , we will force him to quit through street protests . "
BARCELONA ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc ousted archrival Google Inc as T - Mobile ’s top Internet partner in Europe as it unveiled a service to squeeze social Web connections on to cell phone screens , a day after rebuffing a $ 41.6 billion takeover bid from Microsoft Corp .

The deal , announced at the Mobile World Congress wireless fair on Tuesday , puts Yahoo on a strong footing with carriers in Europe , building on deals it has closed with operators in the Americas and Asia , as it seeks to make up in mobile the ground it has lost to Google in computer - based Web search .
Yahoo now has access to 600 million potential users through its carrier partners worldwide , and Marco Boerries -- the executive leading Yahoo ’s mobile push -- told Reuters he aimed to reach 1 billion by the end of 2009 .
“ Europe is now wide open , ” he said in an interview at the trade fair .
“ For the rest of Europe , let the games begin . ”
Yahoo’s new service , called oneConnect , creates a single contacts list for users that draws on all their Web connections -- regardless of whether those connections were made through instant messaging services , email or online social networks .
Users can then see -- to the extent that their contacts allow them to -- their friends ’ availability , activities and messages , without the bother of trying to navigate between Web sites and inboxes on a mobile phone .
“ Today , most people have too many forms of communications , ” said Boerries , executive vice president of Yahoo ’s Connected Life division .
“ To keep in touch with all of them you have to go to all of these different Web sites . ”
Once the free service becomes established , Yahoo plans to introduce discreet advertising on parts of oneConnect , sharing the revenues with phone operator partners .
RACE FOR HEADLINES
Google and Nokia briefly grabbed the headlines at the Barcelona wireless fair on Tuesday , announcing a deal to integrate Google Search into Nokia ’s own search engine it preinstalls on dozens of its handset models .
Nokia , which makes 40 percent of cell phones sold in the world , will add Google to the Microsoft and Yahoo search options it already includes .
The race between companies wanting to put their own stamp on consumers ’ experience of the mobile Internet -- and gather information critical to advertising strategies -- has made rivals of parties once happy to mind their own business .
Microsoft , Google , Yahoo and Nokia have been outdoing each other with mobile Web - related news at the fair this week .
Yahoo ’s deal on Tuesday with Deutsche Telekom ’s T - Mobile division trumped the excitement that broke out around Microsoft ’s announcement late on Monday that it had agreed to buy Danger , a company best known for the software that drives the Sidekick mobile Web browser .
Before the fair , a buzz had built up around anticipated sightings of prototypes of phones based on Google ’s new Android software platform -- a buzz that quickly subsided as it became apparent that the working models on display bore little resemblance to anything that might appear in shops .
But the struggle for influence over the mobile Web need not have a single or even just a few winners , said the head of Microsoft ’s mobile communications division , Pieter Knoock , pointing out that the market was growing fast but still tiny .
Just 123 million of the 1.1 billion phones sold last year were so - called smartphones , cell phones with computer - like capabilities like e-mail and Web browsing , and business models are still being developed for mobile advertising .
“ There ’s a lot of opportunity , ” Knoock said in an interview .
“ Mobile advertising is a greenfield site , and PC advertising expertise does n’t necessarily help . ”
“ The question is who ’s going to win in which services . ”
' Asses of Evil ' buttons top seller at Iowa Dem campaign stops
Just as legions of pollsters , campaign consultants and student volunteers are building their political careers in the cold Iowa snow , a smaller group of entrepreneurs is cashing in on this weeks caucuses .
The Hill newspaper tells of one such creative soul , 35 - year - old Jeremy Beggun , who sells buttons and T - shirts outside of campaign events of both candidates ' parties over the last several months as candidates have spent substantial time in the crucial early voting state .
Among the most popular items at Democratic rallies are buttons bidding President Bush " good riddance , " and a button branding Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld the " Asses of Evil . "
Hill reporter Jim Snyder is much more modest , describing the button as simply bearing an " off - color paraphrase of the famous ' Axis of Evil ' line . "
 We re not offering A ---- for Evil T - shirts .
Theyd sell , though ,  Beggun says , according to the Capitol Hill newspaper .
Along with the anti-Bush gear , Beggun sells more traditional buttons and T - shirts bearing the candidates ' pictures and slogans .
Although they do n't see any of the money potential supporters spend on the souvenirs , the candidates seem to welcome Beggun because he is essentially providing free advertising .
Beggun drives 300 to 500 miles across Iowa every day , regardless of lousy weather , and he told the paper he's on a first name basis with several candidates .
Elizabeth Edwards is a favorite among the political candidates and spouses Beggun trails , he tells Snyder .
 One wave from Elizabeth and sales go up 5,000 percent ,  Beggun says .
I sometimes wonder why political ads are so rarely clever the way , you know , real ads are .
Al Franken , naturally enough , is shaking things up :
I do n't really know anything about Franken 's opponent in the primary , so I 'd hesitate to say anything substantive about the race but I feel like this kind of innovation is a good thing .

The Facebook add - on has proved hugely popular on the social network site and regularly racks up more than 500,000 daily users .
Lawyers for toy makers Hasbro and Mattel say Scrabulous infringes their copyright on the board - based word game .
The move has sparked protests by regular fans of Scrabulous keen to keep the add - on running .
Fan protests
Scrabulous is currently one of Facebook 's ten most popular applications - little programs that Facebook members can add to the profiles they maintain on the site .
The request to remove the add - on came from both Hasbro and Mattel because ownership of the Scrabble trademark is split between the two .
Hasbro owns rights to the game in the US and Canada while Mattel has rights everywhere else in the world .

Early dreams of being a happy - clappy , open - source , ' do no evil ' kind of business soon fade when the realisation dawns that you are worth suing

Facebook told the PA newswire that it had no comment to make at this stage .
The Scrabulous add - on was not created by Facebook but was built for the site by Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla - software developers based in Calcutta .
According to the Scrabulous website it has 594,924 daily active users - about a quarter of the total that have signed up to play it .
The game has spawned a host of " scrabble cheat " sites which work out every possible word that can be made from the available letters .
The threat to the game has spawned a new Facebook group called " Save Scrabulous " that already has more than 600 members .
Interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live Karl Savage , a member of the Save Scrabulous group , said : " A lot of people are saying shame on Hasbro , shame on Mattel , if you would n't be so short - sighted about this then you have an opportunity to actually make some money from this rather than alienate your existing customers .
HAVE YOUR SAY Scrabble is a great game and I know two people who have gone a bought the board game after playing it on Facebook Sophie , Belfast
" I 'd say find some common ground .
Look at licensing , " added Mr Savage .
" Perhaps sit down together and say look , these guys have created this fantastic piece of software that lots of people use why not employ them or have a similar product on there that is licensed but use that to advertise your other products ? "
There has been speculation that the challenge to Scrabulous had been launched as Hasbro and Mattel prepare their own online version of Scrabble .
Mr Savage said he doubted that would be a big success .
He said : " The main feature with Scrabulous for me is that I can play it in Facebook .
I do n't have to go to an external site and then search for all my friends all over again because I do n't think that would work and I do n't think many people would sign up for it . "
Links have also been posted to the customer service areas of the Hasbro and Mattel websites so fans can register their protests with the toy makers .
Dow 6,000 or Dow 14,000 ?
It depends on whom you ask .
A week of gut - wrenching losses in the stock market ended on Friday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 59.91 points , to 12,099.30 .
That modest decline capped a four - day 678 - point plunge that left Wall Street traders and everyday investors wondering if the worst was over  or yet to come .
David W. Tice , a renowned bear , said Friday that the Dow would sink to 6,000 by the end of the year as the country slides into a recession .
But Abby Joseph Cohen , the superbull at Goldman Sachs , maintained that the Dow would roar back to finish 2008 at a level 22 percent higher  14,750 is the number  as the economy perks up later in the year .
While their views diverge , both strategists agreed on one point :
The wild ride is far from over .
In whiplash trading , the Dow has fallen 14 percent from its peak in October .
While the market has taken deeper dives in the past  it plummeted 37.8 percent from January 2000 to October 2002 , for example  volatility is approaching its highest levels in several years .
Some of the local deer are quite friendly , and with the drought this year they are hungry .
We supplement their diet with " Record Rack " , a food designed especially for deer and elk .
It has vitamins and minerals and is 16 % protein , the deer look much healthier since we started using this feed .
These whitetail deer are not fenced in and are free to roam across miles and miles of the local ranches of Llano County .
Llano county claims the most deer harvested per year in all of Texas , about 17,000 , so several of the deer you see here will probably not live through the winter .

I have yet to witness the document which allegedly refers to an offer by extraterrestrials to help prepare humanity for the disclosure of extraterrestrial life .
The meeting also apparently discussed how the UN was being encouraged to take a proactive stand on the release of secret technologies that will enable the development of free energy .
The date 2013 was given as the time when extraterrestrials would unambiguously appear .
This was consistent with the date given in my earlier article .
I will share more information on the alleged document circulated at the UN meeting and the independent source confirming the meeting in my next communication on this unfolding UN initiative on UFOs / extraterrestrial life .
What follows next is a report of a further meeting between Clay and Shawn Pickering and their confidential source regarding the UN meeting on UFOs held on the morning of February 12 , 2008 .
They pointed out that the “ unambiguous showing up ” of extraterrestrial life – sitting over major cities - would occur in 2017 , rather than 2013 as described in the earlier article .
The role of religion and population growth was also allegedly discussed , and appeared to raise many issues at the meeting , especially for India .
A significant descriptive term chosen by Clay ’s and Shawn ’s source for the extraterrestrials that would show up in 2017 was “ The Controllers . ”
Such a term has clear psychological connotations and was chosen to have a particular effect on the target audience – both UN member states in attendance and the general public to which the information was being leaked .
This is a clue that Clay ’s / Shawn ’s source is conveying information that has been designed to trigger a certain psychological reaction that influences how issues are framed and discussed .
Another aspect of the following report is that it was claimed that India would have a difficult time processing disclosure of extraterrestrial life , possibly leading to the elimination of Hinduism .
This appears inconsistent with India ’s long tradition of advanced technologies and extraterrestrial life in its Vedic texts , and multiplicity of gods .
If , as the confidential source claims , that Roman Catholics will have an easier time with disclosure due to the belief of “ three Gods in one ” , so too might a religion like Hinduism which has a multiplicity of gods and is very eclectic .
I believe that the mention of India as a country that might experience disclosure problems is likely a fabrication intended to confuse disclosure related issues .
When combined with the use of the descriptive term for extraterrestrials , “ The Controllers ” designed to trigger a particular psychological reaction and lead discussions in a certain direction , the possibility that the information is being relayed through an intelligence agency with considerable expertise in manipulating human psychology cannot be discounted .
In the earlier message ( February 13 ) , Clay ’s and Shawn ’s confidential source referred to an Admiral who was the ultimate authority for disclosure of the UN meeting to UFO / exopolitical community .
Is this evidence that the Office of Naval Investigations is involved in the UFO disclosure initiative at the UN , or at least filtering information to be released to the UN / general public ?
Most interesting for me was contrasting the agenda of the meeting revealed by Clay ’s and Shawn ’s confidential source , and what I had been told by my independent source .
My independent source focused on issues concerning the release of restricted technologies for new energy sources and a document for feedback , while Clay ’s and Shawn ’s confidential source focused on population growth and religion .
Curiously , Clay ’s and Shawn ’s source did not mention any document being circulated to UN member states for feedback .
In conclusion , I am now satisfied that a meeting took place at the UN headquarters in New York of February 12 to discuss the issue of UFOs and extraterrestrial .
What transpired at the meeting itself appears to differ according to the confidential source Clay and Shawn have cited , and the independent source used to confirm the meeting .
The emergence of the alleged document circulated at the meeting and relayed to key ministries of other nations will help considerably in clarifying what was discussed .
The possible role of the Office of Naval Intelligence in filtering information that is being related through Clay ’s and Shawn ’s confidential source is something that cannot be discounted when considering what was specifically discussed at the UN meeting .
I look forward to reviewing any documents circulated at the meeting to get a better idea of the agenda issues discussed involving the role the UN would play in public disclosure of extraterrestrial life .

Ya know , beyond the intellectual , there ’s another advantage to being an atheist : I ’m not looking forward to any life after death , to get whatever it was that I missed here , including the chance to get it right .
Now , that ’s what I ’ve got .
It ’s all I ’ve got .
And that ’s why it breaks my heart to see wonderful opportunities for us as a nation to do better , to be better cynically , thoughtlessly tossed down the drain ; as if “ oh well , I ’ll do better next time , in the next life . ”
Well folks , I ’m here to smash that illusion : simply put , there just is n’t any “ next time . ”
On the floor of the Senate today will be debate over Indian health care , what this nation promised , and sealed those promises with ratified treaties , to the many Native American nations whose land we took .
Point One .
It ’s my wager that few Americans know what the legal significance of a treaty is .
From the Constitution of the United States , Article VI : “ . . . all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ( emphasis mine ) ; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution of the laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . ”
“ The supreme law of the land ! ”
In other words , there are no laws which are or shall be higher than , or even equal to treaties that have been signed and ratified .
No laws ; not a lot of wiggle room there .
Truth One .
Decade after decade after decade , generation upon generation , this country has violated the agreements it has made with Native Americans , with treaties we negotiated freely , and that such treaties were ratified and thereby assumed the highest elevation as “ the supreme law (s ) of the land . ”
Especially in our western states , hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants of Indian reservations live in third world conditions .
They have no water purification or sewage disposal facilities or systems .
Outdoor toileting is the norm , not the exception .
School facilities are inadequate , old , deteriorated , and unsafe .
When the nearest hospital is 90 to 100 miles or more distant , medical care is virtually nonexistent .
And if the federal budget allocations have run out , which has frequently been with nine months remaining in the fiscal year , when a Native American patient arrives at a hospital , they may have attached to their person a federal government notification to the facility that it ought not to look for reimbursement of any kind from the federal government .
Point Two .
The great majority of Americans , somewhere around 80 % by the latest surveys , like to identify themselves as Christians .
Whenever we identify ourselves as believers of a doctrine , whenever we vote for a candidate who identifies him - or herself as a member of a political party , by extension we are also saying we agree with the religion ’s and / or the candidate ’s and his or her party ’s basic tenets and policies .
( If this is n’t so , I ’d like anyone to tell me what other conclusions can be legitimately drawn . )
Truth Two .
From “ The book of the genealogy . . . ” in Matthew through “ . . . no man forbidding him ” in The Acts , the effort is to conclusively answer Cain ’s question of God , “ Am I my brother ’s keeper ? ” as Yes you ( we ) are .
Overwhelmingly the words attributed to Jesus of Nazareth , teachings that Christians profess to attempt to follow , are on behalf of the poor , the sick , the lame , in contrast with the interests of the wealthy “ who have their reward . ”
However , by the standards laid down clearly by Jesus , “ By your acts ye shall be known , ” by and large , there is , as there has been , a dearth of Christ - like acts , or even expressed care , by “ Christians ” for those Jesus claimed those who would follow him ought to retain as uppermost in their hearts .
By the standards laid down by Jesus of Nazareth , any objective analysis would adjudge the overwhelming majority of those who pretend to be “ Christians ” as phonies , as hypocrites .
Conservatives are wont to propound how , while all this may be so , the call is to the individual , not to the government .
The Acts paints any such assertions as a lawyerly weaseling through the narrowest of escape tunnels ; and we all know what Jesus thought of lawyers .
Indeed , in The Acts , the most Christian - like form of government would be socialistic : “ And all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need . ”
( Acts 2:44 - 45 ) See also Acts 4:32 .
“ All ” is an absolute .
It does n’t allow for fractions or ratios or proportionalities .
All means all .
Thus it follows that if all things were held in common , so too ought to be that the woes of those poor , sick , and lame would be a common concern of all in the community , a community that would care for the poor , the sick , the lame by giving as “ every man had need . ”
Nowhere will be found in any New Testament passage the first reference to as every man felt his giving was convenient , or to the level at which convenient became inconvenient .
And by The Acts , it is clear that the most Christ - like form of community is a socialistic one .
And as to the relationship of community and government , especially as it was in the first and second centuries CE ( Current Era ) , excepting the overarching aegis of Rome , the community and government were one and the same with no anticipation differing forms would surface in the millennia ahead .
Thus , whether by dint of the legal obligation to adhere to treaty promises we have made , or to be in accord with the Christian doctrines , as iterated in the biblical texts , that the vast majority of Americans say they identify with , it is incumbent on all of us to support the Senate bill on Indian healthcare that ’s being debated today .
The reason this has special relevance today and in the tomorrows ahead owes to the nature of congressional bills .
Today ’s bill , one Senate Leader Reid has said will be voted on no later than adjournment Friday , is an ‘ authorization ” bill .
Although it ’s important because it ’s the first step in a two - step process , authorization does nothing whatsoever to actually see that whatever is authorized becomes the least realized .
That can only be accomplished via a funding bill .
In authorization , everyone can talk the talk , and claim to support this or that cause or measure in front of their constituents , come election time .
It ’s only during funding legislation that the rubber hits the road , where those who have talked the talk are called on to also walk the walk .
And it ’s there where , for the past ten years , Republicans have each and every time killed all efforts to actually live to our legal obligation or our moral requirements .
Every year , for the past ten , the best that got passed was funding to the previous year ’s levels , or perhaps just slightly above ; never to the levels demanded either by treaty or what ’s needed .
Thousands of those on reservations , frequently a hundred miles from adequate medical care , cannot afford to wait until “ next time . ”
They have been dying during this time .
Next time will be for too many more too late .
And if conservative “ Christians ” want think of me as some bleeding - heart liberal , this atheist absolutely is that .

SO this , in the end , is what love is .
Former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor ’s husband , suffering from Alzheimer ’s disease , has a romance with another woman , and the former justice is thrilled — even visits with the new couple while they hold hands on the porch swing — because it is a relief to see her husband of 55 years so content .
What culture tells us about love is generally young love .
Songs and movies and literature show us the rapture and the betrayal , the breathlessness and the tears .
The O’Connors ’ story , reported by the couple ’s son in an interview with a television station in Arizona , where Mr. O’Connor lives in an assisted - living center , opened a window onto what might be called , for comparison ’s sake , old love .
Of course , it illuminated the relationships that often develop among Alzheimer ’s patients — new attachments , some call them — and how the desire for intimacy persists even when dementia steals so much else .
But in the description of Justice O’Connor ’s reaction , the story revealed a poignancy and a richness to love in the later years , providing a rare model at a time when people are living longer , and loving longer .
“ This is right up there in terms of the cutting - edge ethical and cultural issues of late life love , ” said Thomas R. Cole , director of the McGovern Center for Health , Humanities and the Human Spirit at the University of Texas , and author of a cultural history of aging .
“ We need moral exemplars , not to slavishly imitate , but to help us identify ways of being in love when you ’re older . ”
" We The People must hand count ALL paper ballots or lose democracy to the machine manipulators ! " - Ron Corvus
In new Hampshire , Hillary stole the election via voting machine vendors manipulating the vote count , as evidenced by the discrepancies between the hand counting of paper ballots versus the machine counting of paper ballots .
Hillary got more votes using machine counts and Obama got more votes using hand counts .
This is a FACT !
I predict this " phenomena " ( crime ) WILL HAPPEN AGAIN !
We The People must DEMAND the hand counting of ALL paper ballots , or We The People WILL LOSE to the machine manipulators again !
Mark my words !
I ’ve been searching for a reason why I like libertarians even as they drive me round - the - bend out of my mind sometimes .
And on Saturday , Michael Kinsley of the Washington Post provided me that reason .
In his column titled The Church Doctrines of Pope Ron Paul – What ’s wrong with libertarianism ? , Kinsley described libertarianism as a movement that is so devoted to its principles that it is essentially irrelevant , but that is still vital to our political institutions .
Libertarians focus so much on “ free markets for everyone and everything ” that they lose track of the bigger picture – things like pragmatism , or areas where the idea of personal property simply does n’t ( and ca n ’t ) apply .
For example , Kinsley points out that fundamentalist libertarians ( my term , not his ) would reject government taxes for national defense , which is a “ public good ” issue that no individual should ever be allowed to decide for another .
Similarly , pollution leeches across all personal property lines , and so must be addressed by governmental entities instead of nebulous “ market forces . ”
And while I do understand ( and even agree with ) the right to die arguments that Kinsley rightly attributes to the libertarian impulse , he ’s also right that the libertarian right to not wear a seat belt and speed runs smack into the brick wall of reality when the libertarian is involved in a fatal accident that snarls up traffic along a major highway for half the day .
Rights always come along with responsibilities , and it ’s the latter part of that truism that libertarians generally forget .
But libertarians are still useful in our culture for one , very important reason – they keep us on our toes .
When we ’re asked why we do n’t privatize the national highway system , we ’re forced to answer that , as Kinsley pointed out , the inevitable result is that it ’d end up being controlled by a single monopolistic corporation , and that ’s functionally equivalent to the government that already owns the highways .
When we ’re asked why we should all have to pay for a sports stadium if we dislike sports or a major mass transit program if we live outside the metro area , libertarians force us to explain that the economic benefits of a major sports franchise and mass transit will boost the entire region ’s growth , reduce pollution throughout the region , etc , so fairness requires that everyone who will benefit should help pay the costs ( although sometimes the costs will outweigh the benefits , and in those situations the projects should n’t get any public money ) .
And when libertarians ask why there should be regulations barring too much media consolidation in a single market , we ’re forced to explain to them why monopolies are bad for them as much as everyone else .
In the process of explaining to the libertarians why they ’re wrong on any given issue , the rest of us are forced to reexamine our own assumptions and opinions as they relate to the explanation .
In addition , anyone else listening to the discussion learns more about the issue and comes away understanding the ideological objections and the pragmatic reasons those objections have to be rejected .
Both of those are good things .

The reptiles change colour for a variety of purposes - communication , camouflage and temperature control .
However , the reason why they first evolved this ability to flash bright colours was previously unclear .
Scientists report in the journal Plos Biology that it was to allow them to signal to other chameleons .
Co-author Dr Devi Stuart - Fox , from The University of Melbourne , Australia , told BBC News : " [ Our research ] suggests that chameleons evolved colour change for signalling , to fend off rivals or attract a mate , and not so they could match a greater variety of backgrounds . "
What chameleons see
Dr Stuart - Fox 's team looked at the colour changing ability of 21 southern African dwarf chameleon species ( Bradypodion spp ) , to compare species colour changing ability and consider evolutionary relationships .
As chameleons have a different visual system to humans , they have a fourth type of cone which is ultra-violet ( UV ) sensitive , the researchers had to first measure what the chameleons were actually seeing .
The Melbourne - based researcher explained : " We measured colour with a spectrometer , which measures both the UV and visual colour range , and combined this with information on the chameleon visual system to model chameleon colour perception . "
Colour contest
CHAMELEON FACTS
Colour change is rapid ( milliseconds or seconds ) as under direct neural control Its eyes can move independently
It can see in two different directions at once Its tongue is twice as long as its body
By setting individual chameleons up in a duel with a series of opponents , the colour range between the submissive and dominant colours could be measured .
" If a male is challenged by another male they both begin by showing their brightest colours - until one figures out the other is going to win and changes to a submissive , dark , ' do n't beat me up colour ' , " said Dr Stuart - Fox .
The team also looked at how chameleons change colour in response to a predator , by presenting them with a model bird or snake .
It was shown that the most dramatic colour changes were used to socially signal to other chameleons .
" We found that chameleon species that changed colour the most had displays that were most conspicuous to other chameleons .
But they did n't have a greater range of background colours in their habitats , " said Dr Stuart - Fox .
An excellent wrap up of the surge by Tina Susman in the LA Times today .
This nugget seemed to be especially absurd .
According to U.S. military figures , an average of 1,000 Iraqis have died each month since March in sectarian violence .
That compares with about 1,200 a month at the start of the security plan , the military said in an e-mailed response to queries .
This does not include deaths from car bombings , which the military said have numbered more than 2,600 this year .
We also know that these violence numbers do n't include Shi'a on Shi'a violence in the South or Sunni on Sunni violence in Anbar and other parts of the country .
I have an idea .
Why do n't we count murder rates in the U.S. but exclude all gun violence .
Seriously , what is so difficult about showing the actual numbers !!!
The Remote Disc installer is 42.3MB for Mac , and claims to take almost 86 MB of space .
( Apple let us know it should n't take anywhere near that , and the installer app overestimated the space required . )
Also , expect a restart of the host Mac .
( Windows , ironically , does not require a restart to begin sharing media . )
Although you can disable the " ask before allowing others to use my drive " sharing option , if you have not done so users will be prompted to ask permission to use the drive at each connection .
( Also , there 's no client whitelist or anything like that , it 's all or none for asking permission . )
If you 've already asked permission on that drive and disc and stop using it , you have to ask permission again the next time ( unless the host turns off the whole permission asking thing ) .
Every time you ask permission as a Remote Disc client , the host gets a popup asking if it 's cool to share your drive .
You can , of course , accept or decline ( but the only way to stop getting prompts is to turn off disc sharing ) .
Ejecting the disc on the client side does not eject it on the host side .
Ejecting it on the host side , however , gives a host - side prompt about the disc being in use .
You can override and eject , however .
To reinstall or boot from CD using Remote Disc , the host must use the installed Remote Install Mac OS X application .
It 's a fairly simple process , but sharing an install CD over a wireless network is asking for trouble .
It took an absurd amount of time ( nearly 10 minutes ) to boot over 802.11g .
You need bandwidth , so be sure to get on 802.11n or , preferably , wired ( with the dongle ) .
To remote boot from a shared CD , hold the option key while starting up .
You 'll be presented with a BIOS - level WiFi / network selection that looks surprisingly unpolished for Apple ( but works with WPA and advanced WiFi crypto all the same )
You can browse the file contents of DVD discs , but you cannot actually play that media back over the network .
Apple let us know that this only applies to commercial DVD media , and you should be able to play back home - burned iDVD movies via Remote Disc .
You can't rip DVDs over the network using a tool like Handbrake .
You can't browse a music CD or listen to tracks .
Do n't even think about burning a disc remotely .
Remote Disc appears only to be able to share CD / DVD drives and CD / DVD discs , not high capacity / HD optical drives .
We tested sharing a regular DVD over an HD DVD drive , no luck .
Data CDs on DVD drives worked fine though .
One of the more more interesting , albeit minor , announcements at Macworld was Remote Disc , Apple 's method to undermine the need to bundle an optical drive with the Air .
To our chagrin , Apple also undermined the ability to do much fun or useful with the disc sharing system .
Here 's what you need to know about Remote Disc , top to bottom : Bummer for media :
We 've heard of some client firewalls harshing on Remote Disc , but we did n't see any issues when testing .
Despite its shortcomings , it did work exactly as advertised , and with zero fuss .
We miss anything ?

A Single mother abandoned two
newborn babies in the space of three
years because she was too ashamed to
tell relatives she was pregnant out
of wedlock .
Bronagh Bond , 27 , dumped her daughters
Holly and Angel in the street and ignored
repeated police appeals for their mother to
come forward .
In April last year police realised both
babies ' DNA was a close match to a man
already on their database .
After approaching his family they established
he had four sisters and asked to take
a DNA swab from each of the women .
Only then did Bond finally confess she
was the mother of both babies .
Yesterday she walked free from court after
admitting two counts of child cruelty .
Liverpool Crown Court heard how she was already a single mother when she discovered she was pregnant in March 2003 .
But , with her relationship with the child's
father breaking down , she could n't cope
with raising another child alone .
Scroll down for more ...
She left the five - day - old baby girl , named
Holly by nurses , near a block of flats close
to her home in Walton , Liverpool , at 7 am on
Christmas Eve .
Two years later , in November 2005 , Bond
discovered she was pregnant again after a
holiday romance in Turkey .
Bond dumped baby Angel , then aged four
weeks , on a path in Stanley Park , close to
Everton FC's Goodison Park stadium .
She was found by a passer - by on July 29 ,
2006 .
Her head was resting on a plastic bag
containing a bottle of milk , clothes and an
emotional three page hand - written note
from Bond .
It read : " I 'm truly sorry .
I will love you with
all my heart forever and ever . "
Charlotte Kenny , defending , said Bond
" blanked out " her pregnancy with Holly and
felt no emotional attachment when the
child was born .
When Bond found out she was pregnant
with Angel she dreaded telling her family ,
Miss Kenny added .
" She found the prospect of their reaction
too much to bear , " she said .
Holly has since been adopted and Angel is
in foster care , the court heard .
Sentencing Bond to a two - year community
order , Judge Henry Globe QC told her :
" It is fortunate that neither child has been
physically adversely affected .
How they
might be mentally , only time will tell . "

Scarred Life , Severed Family
Carrying a box of religious and self - help books , a garbage bag full of legal documents and a few worn - out sweaters , Mr. Deskovic went from prison to Cobleskill , a speck of a town in central New York where his mother , Linda McGarr , settled after his conviction .
He calls Cobleskill “ the boondocks , ” adding an expletive whenever he is angry at his mother , which is often .
While he was locked up , Ms. McGarr was Mr. Deskovic ’s connection to the outside world ( he has never known his father ) .
He wrote letters and sent them to her to type .
She , in turn , sent money for cans of oysters at the prison commissary .
When he needed to badger a lawyer , she was his voice .
But the relationship withered through the bars .
Ms. McGarr , 60 , said she tired of the lonely 150 - mile drives to visit him .
Mr. Deskovic said he resented her lack of urgency in tackling his legal appeals .
Two days after his release , Mr. Deskovic exploded : “ How come you did n’t do more to help me ? ”
“ I know you went through hell in there , ” Ms. McGarr responded , “ but I paid dearly , too . ”
The next morning , Mr. Deskovic stuffed his possessions in plastic bags and boarded a train to Peekskill , the scene of the crime that scarred his life .
On Nov. 15 , 1989 , Angela Correa — a sophomore at Peekskill High , like Mr. Deskovic — slipped a “ New Kids on the Block ” tape into a portable cassette player and took her camera to a park near her home , snapping a picture of a dove perched on the roof as she left .
Two days later , someone spotted her naked body in the woods .
The police retrieved hair and semen samples , which did not match Mr. Deskovic ’s DNA ; prosecutors argued that they were from earlier consensual sex .
Mr. Deskovic , however , fit the description provided by a criminal profiler for the police , and raised investigators ’ suspicions when he cried copiously at Ms. Correa ’s funeral , though they were not close friends .
( In a recent interview , Mr. Deskovic explained that he was always picked on in school and Angela was one of few students who were nice to him , once helping him with algebra . )
After repeated questioning over two months , Mr. Deskovic confessed during a seven - hour interrogation and polygraph test , telling the police he had hit Ms. Correa with a Gatorade bottle and grabbed her around the throat .
In the lawsuit , Mr. Deskovic contends that detectives fed him these details , and promised that if he confessed he would not go to prison but would receive psychiatric treatment .
Film : U.S. Students Can't Compete in High - Tech World " Two Million Minutes " says U.S. students unprepared for global economy .
Feb. 20 , 2008  -- Bob Compton , an Indianapolis venture - capitalist - turned - filmmaker , has produced a controversial new documentary called " 2 Million Minutes " that looks at how American education falls short in today 's global economy .
" What I saw in the K - 12 schools absolutely shocked me in both India and China . …
I became very concerned about the competitiveness of my own daughters ' education , " Compton said on " Good Morning America . "
He explained that the students he saw in those countries were " two and three years ahead " of his daughters and their peers in America .
The film follows two students from Carmel High School in Indianapolis , as well as two students from India and two from China .
The premise is that they all have roughly 2 million minutes in high school to build their intellectual foundation and prepare for college and a career .
Twenty months in the making , " 2 Million Minutes " highlights the pressures and priorities of these students and their families .
Ultimately , it provides insight into the changing nature of competition in a technology - based global economy .
" Between the cultures , students allocate their time quite differently .
The difference is the parental expectations of the students , the community 's expectations . "
Unlike in the United States , where he said sports often gets the most recognition , in India and China , " the community recognizes and awards intellectual and academic achievements . "
Nick Ahrendt , one of the Carmel High students featured in the film , said he too could see the difference .
" I would n't say I 'm jealous of their education because a lot of it is one - track education , in engineering or medicine .
But if I had wanted to go into one of those fields , I probably would feel that I would 've been better off growing up over there , " he said on " GMA . "
Now a college student at Purdue University , Ahrendt said that while in high school , " I did n't see the benefit of putting in the extra time .
But over there they see the benefit of getting a better job , a better life . "
" As a high - tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist for the past 25 years , " Compton said , " I can tell you the people who have reaped the greatest economic rewards in the past two decades have been those with the most rigorous and thorough understanding of technology — and thus a solid foundation in math and science — and who have an ability to solve problems and possess entrepreneurial skill . "
The movie is not without its critics , however , including many educators in the United States .
The National Association of Secondary School Principals released a statement that outlines some of the group 's problems with the film .
It says that the film engages in " statistical sleight of hand , " by providing statistics about dropout rates in the United States , but never mentions similar statistics from China or India .
The group also says that the film focuses exclusively on math , science and engineering , but does n't consider excellence in other subjects , and that the film compares students of different achievement levels .
Compton says that 's not the point of the film though .
" It 's not an indictment of the school system . …
If anything it criticizes America culture , " he said .

Two men have been arrested in New York after wheeling a dead friend propped up in an office chair through busy streets to a check - cashing outlet in an attempt to cash his social security payment .
The apparent plan to cash Virgilio Cintron 's $ 355 ( £ 180 ) welfare check , even though the 66 year old had recently died , was foiled after an off duty policeman spotted a crowd which had gathered around the seated corpse .
David J. Dalaia and James O'Hare were arrested yesterday outside the Pay - O - Matic store in the Hell 's Kitchen district of Manhattan after pushing Cintron 's body from the apartment they shared about a block away , police said .
" Hell 's Kitchen has a rich history but this is one for the books , " police spokesman Paul Browne was quoted as saying by the New York Times .
" The witnesses saw the two pushing the chair with Cintron flopping from side to side and the two individuals propping him up , " he explained .
On arriving at the store , the men left Cintron 's body outside and went in to try and cash his cheque , Browne said .
However , a member of staff knew Cintron and asked where he was .
O'Hare said he would go and get him .
By this time a detective having lunch in a restaurant next to the cheque - cashing store noticed a crowd forming around Cintron 's body .
He went to investigate , Browne said , and it was " immediately apparent to him that Cintron [ was ] dead " .
The detective called uniformed colleagues and they and an ambulance crew arrived as O'Hare and Dalaia were preparing to wheel Cintron 's body into the store .
The duo , both aged 65 , were arrested on suspicion of fraud .
It appeared that Cintron had died from natural causes at the apartment shared by O'Hare and Dalaia within the previous 24 hours , police said .
But any idea who this character was - seen photographing the stall from across the other side & lingering around , with a " security " hi vis on & pager on belt ??
He is using a proffessional Canon camera .
The Met Police have a huge deal with Nikon which is why their snappers both uniform and plain clothes are seen with Nikon gear .
He is possibly an agency photographer though his face is not familiar .
Hmmmm
As the BBC's New Media technology chief , Ashley Highfield has some tough questions to answer .
What is the 4,000 strong division really doing ?
How did the BBC manage to burn through £ 100 m - what a Silicon Valley start - up can spend in ten years [ *] - to develop a single piece of client software ?
As he went on a PR offensive last week , El Reg was excluded - because we ask the wrong sort of questions .
But his intent was clear .
Besieged by Linux users and anti-DRM campaigners , the BBC 's tech chief has embarked on a campaign to call their bluff .
In an interview with BBC Backstage , Highfield argued that the BBC never intended to exclude Linux users from iPlayer feature parity with Windows , and would get there in the end .
The DRM and Linux crowd are being lined up as the whipping boys - a welcome distraction from what a thorough examination of the BBC New Media 's department might unearth .
Unfortunately , these rights - for - gadgets campaigners are only too happy to play the part of the boob .
On Highfield 's blog , one Penguinista has already gifted us what must be one of the quotes of the year , with this contribution :
" I would like to say , " he writes , " that accessiblity [ sic ] for Linux users is EXACTLY the same issue as accessibility for those with disabilities . "
Yes , both pay the compulsory tax that funds the BBC .
But being a paraplegic is not a choice , in the way that choosing a hobbyist operating system is a choice , and the tasteless comparison does n't reflect well on the " digital rights " campaigners .
And , heck - why stop there ?
Why not require that the BBC to retransmit its programmes in the Klingon language ?
Google already offers a Klingon language version of its search engine .
It surely costs very little to add subtitles , and we can take it from there .
What a gift for the besieged Highfield .
A smart man , one wonders whether he 's channelling Fake Steve Jobs accidentally , or deliberately .
A blast of righteous indignation from the Daily Mail about sandal - wearing hippies bleeding the taxpayer dry can't be too far away .
One wonders what has kept them so long .
So that 's the first piece of evidence that suggests Highfield is calling the campaigners ' bluff .
In doing so , he 's laid a huge hole for them to march into , all placards waving .
The second is DRM .
The DRM bluff
The small but noisy anti-copyright lobby wants to be able to swap BBC content freely , wherever they are in the world .
In challenging this notion , Highfield is throwing creators ' rights and taxpayers ' rights into the equation .
The BBC is under no obligation to provide stuff for free for the world , and the potential opportunity cost of giving away material , rather than licensing it to other broadcasters who would cheerfully pay for it , will cost the corporation far more than the iPlayer fiasco .
The cost of acquiring the rights outright and upfront from producers , which the campaigners demand , would be extremely expensive - and the beneficiaries would be non-taxpayers .
Why should the BBC , Highfield is asking , spend so much more merely for the benefit of students in Ithica and Kalamazoo can swap files ?
And do taxpayers need to exchange files , or merelyview the material on demand ?
Once again , it is n't hard to imagine another Daily Mail splash on the BBC pouring money down the drain - for the benefit of foreign freeloaders .
It 's a well - rehearsed script : just rub out the word " benefit fraud " and insert " digital fraud " .
Highfield also has an ace up his sleeve .
While the public rejects DRM on music within a few seconds of realising the implications , it is n't clear that there 's such opposition to other kinds of content , alas .
As a rule of thumb , people reject technology when it makes something harder - and DRM on music stops people doing what they 've done with songs since the invention of the consumer tape recorder .
But few people object when it 's attached to something they did n't have before .
On balance , the DRM is weighed against the perceived " advantage " - and from there , we 're into specifics .
i Player content viewable on a PC certainly falls into the category of " something we did n't have before " - although the advantage is slight .
Many Britons can already view on - demand services through a set - top box , and it is n't clear why we need to view it on a PC at all .
Especially since the infrastructure does n't really support it : British ISPs are under no obligation to go broke to fulfill this requirement .
In conclusion , then , Highfield is calling the campaigners bluff on two areas dear to their hearts : support for hobbyist platforms , and DRM .
Yet those tough questions at the top of this article have n't been answered , with campaigners providing easy fodder for Highfield .
I trust that Highfield has a swear box by his bedside , into which he makes generation donations to the these campaigners - they 've gifted him the opportunity to avoid being accountable on the issues that really matter .
Hurrah , for " digital rights " ! ®

Stanley and Florence married in June 1917
But 89 years later , a symbol of their love has been found buried at the bottom of the sea .
The engraved engagement ring was very nearly lost forever but it has now been returned to the sailor 's family in North Yorkshire in almost perfect condition .
The gold band was found by amateur diver Peter Brady , 51 , who spotted the ring during a routine dive around the wreck of HMS Opal , off the coast of the Orkney Islands .
At first he thought it was a piece of the ship 's machinery , but on closer inspection a loving inscription was revealed with the words " To Stanley from Flo , 6 March 1916 " .
Mr Cubiss , 25 , worked in the engine room when he drowned as HMS Opal , along with HMS Narborough , ran aground in a snowstorm on 12 January , 1918 .
He was one of 188 men who perished in the disaster .
He had married his sweetheart Florence in June 1917 .
The gold band was found in almost perfect condition
Keen to hand the ring over to either Stanley or Florence 's descendants , Mr Brady and his diving partner Bob Hamilton began a bid to trace surviving family .
Mr Hamilton , 61 , said : " We 've dived the site several times but have never found any significant wreckage .
" When we realised Peter had found something of such a personal nature we knew we had to try and return it to the family . "
' Touching ' phone call
Having found the ship 's casualty list on the internet and with information from the 1901 census , the divers , with the help of Mr Hamilton 's wife Sue , placed Mr Cubiss ' parents in Yorkshire .
They also discovered that following her husband 's death , Florence had remarried .
From there , a trawl of the telephone directory revealed a listing for a JM Cubiss in York .
Mr Hamilton said it was with " a degree of trepidation " that he decided to call and see if he had any connection with Stanley 's family .
HMS OPAL Constructed at Sunderland in 1915 An Admiralty M class destroyer Ran aground 12 January , 1918 , while on patrol hunting German warships suspected to be laying mines off the Scottish coast
The ship was found two days later battered and broken on the Clett of Crura , in Orkney
" My first words were ' Please listen , this is not a funny phone call , but I 'm part of a group of divers who dive around the Orkney Islands and we 've recently been diving on the site of British destroyers ' .
" As I soon as I had said those words , he interrupted and said , ' The Opal ' . "
The man turned out to be Mr Cubiss ' nephew Malcolm , a retired brigadier .
" It was a very touching phone call and my eyes filled up .
I had a lump in my throat and I had to take a minute to collect myself , " Mr Hamilton said .
" I remember thinking how unbelievable it was that we had managed to trace this man 's family . "
' More than coincidence '
The divers , who live in Liverpool , visited Mr Cubiss at his home where he expressed the wish that the ring , and some items of his uncle 's which were already in his possession , be donated to a naval museum in Orkney .
Mr Cubiss said : " Buried in the sea and then found after all these years , it 's amazing .
It 's fitting that the ring is kept in a museum so people can remember the events of that night . "
The divers are now hoping to arrange a handing over ceremony of the ring to the museum to ensure its safekeeping .
Mr Hamilton said : " The million - to - one chance of finding the ring and the ease with which we were able to trace the family has seemed at times to be a little eerie - more than just coincidence .
" We now want to make sure the ring is given its rightful place in history . "

Kako naredimo neumnost v 22 korakih .
1 . Naredili smo stran .
2 . Prijavimo smo se v nek oglaševalski program in vstavimo oglase na svojo stran .
Program nam plačuje za vsak klik .
3 . Čakamo .
4 - 9 . Čakamo. 10 .
Še malo čakamo .
11 . Na računu se je iz treh klikov nabralo 30 centov .
12 -20 .
Čakamo , in še malo čakamo .
21 . Počasi začnemo izgubljati živce .
Halo .
To služenje denarja na internetu je en velik nateg .
Nič ne zaslužimo .
22 . Pridemo na idejo , da bomo sami klikali na oglase .
Rekli bomo tudi vsem prijateljem naj kliknejo dvakrat na dan .
To bo zihr 30 klikov na dan in končno bo padlo nekaj evrov .
Zanimivo , da se precej ljudem se to še vedno ne zdi narobe .
Zakaj to ni OK ?
1 . Kot prvo in najbolj preprosto – zato ker je to proti pravilom glaševalskega programa .
Več ali manj kateregakoli .
Razen tistega , ki plača za akcijo – torej ko nekdo , ki je kliknil na oglas , potem tam tudi nekaj dejansko zapravi – česar pa mi in naši prijatelji seveda ne bomo počeli .
Tu smo da služimo in ne da zapravljamo 🙂
Ampak , če tudi sicer parkiramo na pločniku , potem se bomo mogoče bolj zamislili nad naslednjim razlogom …
2 . Ker pljuvamo v lastno skledo .
Zakaj bi kdo oglaševal na internetu ?
Zato , da si pridobi več kupcev , strank , volilcev , naredi branding blagovne znamke… whatever .
Ampak denar , vložen v oglaševanje ne raste na drevesu .
Zato , ker jaz kliknem na oglas mora nekdo iz denarnice odšteti par kovancev .
Ki bi jih sicer lahko privarčeval in šel na sladoled .
Če iz tega oglaševanja ni učinkov ( ampak le naval vedno enih in istih oseb in njihovih kolegov po parkrat na dan ) pač naslednjič ne bo več oglaševal , bo oglaševal manj … ( in šel raje na sladoled ) .
In nasprotno .
Če bo učinek dober , bo naslednjič verjetno oglaševali več , povedal kolegom da oglaševanje ne internetu blazno kicks ass , da se splača in podobno .
Le kaj je v interesu lastnikov spletnih strani , več oglaševalcev , ki vlagajo več denarja ali obratno… .hmmmm , težko vprašanje .
3 . Ker je na dolgi rok to preprosto bedarija .
Če nismo sposobni narediti strani , ki bi imela dovolj obiska in dovolj klikov , da nam prinese par evrov jo zbrišimo in naredimo tako , ki bo obisk imela .
Ko imamo stran , ki ustvarja nekaj denarja , je to neka vrednost oziroma naložba za naprej .
To da sami klikamo po oglasih ni vredno nič .
Kaj če se s krampom udarimo po kazalcu ?
4. Kaj pa : “ Če me stvar na oglasu res ( čist zares ) zanima ? ” ali pa : “ Hotel sem samo preizkusiti , če sistem deluje … “ .
Jebiga , zase lahko človek vedno najde opravičilo ( če hoče 🙂 ) .
To je to .
Pa vaše mnenje ?

5 Ways to Keep the Gimmes Away This Christmas
My children have always liked Veggie Tales .
We began watching them in 1999 , when my daughter was just one year old , and they have been a staple in our family ever since .
Around Christmas time , my kids start begging to watch The Toy That Saved Christmas * .
It was Veggie Tales ’ first Christmas video .
My kids have it memorized .
Come to think of it , so do I .
The show starts out with the Veggie Kids running around Dinkletown , excited about Christmas and singing songs .
The mood is frenzied .
And the latest must - have toy is Buzz Saw Louie .
The kids see a TV commercial about Buzz Saw Louie , and watch with wide eyes .
They ’re amazed as the announcer tells them Buzz Saw Louie knows the true meaning of Christmas .
And then he pushes the button .
Buzz Saw Louie opens his mouth and says ,
Christmas is when you get stuff !
You need more Toys !
The commercial ends .
For a moment , the kids stand there .
Then chaos breaks loose !
The kids run home to their parents crying ,
I need more toys !
Billy has more toys than me !
I need a Buzz Saw Louie !
I need TEN Buzz Saw Louies , ‘ cuz that ’s the true meaning of Christmas !
Waaaaaaaah !
Of course that ’s a little far - fetched , but in today ’s society , it ’s easy for kids to get the gimmes at Christmas time .
And my kids are n’t immune .
My 5 year old son seems especially vulnerable when he sees TV commercials for toys .
He begs and begs for the toy , which is the best toy ever , of course .
The latest object of his desire is the Shake ‘n Go Crash - Ups Speedway * .
Never mind that he already has a matchbox track that does the same thing .
So how does one prevent kids from getting the Christmas gimmes ?
I do n’t think there ’s one fool - proof method , but there are several small things you can do to keep the “ I wants ” to a minimum .
1. Limit TV Commercials .
My husband has had a long career in advertising sales .
I know for sure that the people who put together television commercials for kids ’ toys have a strategy .
They know that if they can get little Suzy to beg mom for Baby Alive * or little Johnny to cry about wanting a Nintendo DS * , mom or dad will be more likely to buy the toy than if the commercial were aimed at adults .
The best way to cut out commercials is to cut way back on the television viewing .
But if you can ’t , or do n’t want to do that , I think the DVR or TIVO is the best invention ever .
You can start the kids ’ show 15 minutes late , and then just skip through the commercials .
The kids wo n’t beg for what they do n’t see .
2 . Toss the catalogs .
I remember when I was a kid , my family always got the Sears Wish Book at Christmas .
Oh , my brothers and I loved it !
We would spend hours pouring over the catalog , refining our Christmas lists , and circling the things we wanted .
I remember staring at the Barbie Dream House , imagining how much better my life would be if I owned it .
At Thanksgiving my mom told me she always felt bad , because that Dream House was so expensive , and they could n’t afford it .
One Christmas I got the Barbie Townhouse , which was a less expensive version of the Dream House , and you know what ?
I enjoyed it just as much .
The point is , get rid of the catalogs .
Why put images of more things in your child ’s head ?
Why even set your child up to be disappointed on Christmas morning , when he does n’t get all the stuff he dreamed about ?
Unfortunately we ’re learning this lesson the hard way .
My son got a hold of the Toys R Us catalog before we had a chance to toss it , and it ’s been his best friend ever since .
He will not let that thing out of his site .
Yes , I could get rid of it now , but the damage has already been done .
I just keep telling him that he is not getting everything in the catalog for Christmas .
So please , learn from our mistakes .
Put the toy catalogs in the recycle bin before they even make it into the house !
3 . Stress activities , not presents .
We stress a lot of activities at Christmas time .
Nothing too harried or hectic , but lots of fun family activities .
We read a lot .
We watch movies together .
We make cookies and candy together .
I ’m a firm believer that kids would rather have meaningful interaction with their parents than toys any day .
So that ’s what we try to provide them .
My kids probably wo n’t remember every toy they received every Christmas .
I know I sure do n’t .
But what I do remember is how I felt at Christmas .
Times spent with family that made me feel happy and secure .
Those are the gifts I want to give my children .
4. Explain why you wo n’t overindulge them .
As a Christian , I want the focus of the Christmas season to be on Christ .
I do n’t want my children so wrapped up in receiving gifts that they forget why we ’re celebrating Christmas .
For that reason , we buy our children three gifts each Christmas : a toy , a book , and a game .
We also buy pajamas to be opened on Christmas Eve , but they usually need new pajamas around that time anyway .
We try to get them a toy that they will enjoy for a long time , not one that will be tossed to the side by Christmas afternoon .
We buy a book to encourage reading .
And we buy a game to encourage family togetherness .
The reason we only buy three gifts ( and then pajamas , which I consider a need wrapped up like a gift ) is that baby Jesus only got three gifts .
And if three gifts was good enough for Jesus , it ’s good enough for my children .
I ’ve explained this to my children , and my daughter has a pretty good grasp of the concept , and a pretty mature attitude about it too .
My son is a little young , but he ’ll come around .
Whatever your reason for not wanting to overindulge your children , explain it to them .
You ’d be surprised at how much they understand and accept and even embrace .
5 . Start young .
The best time to start reigning in the gimme monster is when your children are young .
If you ’ve never given them $ 1000 worth of presents on Christmas morning , they will never expect it .
But if they ’ve had 10 years of receiving the latest and greatest and most expensive toys , it ’s much harder to tone the spending down without protest from you child .
For those of you who do n’t have children yet , make a plan as to how you want to handle Christmas presents before you have children .
When your first baby has her first Christmas , you will be tempted to spend a lot .
Trust me .
But if you have your goals in mind and a plan in place , you can avoid overindulging your children .
If you have older children , you can still cut back on the spending .
You might encounter a big protest from the kids , but that can be toned down by explaining why you ’re spending less and doing some fun things with your children .
The bottom line is if you limit the advertising that comes into your home and do n’t stress gifts yourself , your children are far less likely to get a bad case of the gimmes at Christmas time .
Do you have any ideas for taming the greed monster at Christmas ?

Interview
The Rediff Interview / Benazir Bhutto
September 03 , 2003
T he Pakistan government is considering filing a case of treason against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto for revealing in an interview to India Abroad that General Pervez Musharraf harboured ambitions of capturing Srinagar long before the Kargil war .
Rediff.com owns India Abroad , the widely circulated newspaper published for the Indian - American community .
In an exclusive interview with Senior Editor Shyam Bhatia in London , Bhutto had disclosed that Musharraf , then her Director General of Military Operations , outlined a plan to infiltrate Kashmir and start a war that would end up , he believed , with the Pakistani conquest of Srinagar .
rediff.com presents the now controversial interview which was published in the August 22 issue of India Abroad .
Is it true that you have met Condoleezza Rice because the Bush administration wishes to build bridges with you ?
No , I would love to meet her .
I did meet her before she was National Security Adviser .
I have tremendous respect for her being a woman and rising to such a high position .
I think the Bush administration is very sensitive about contacts with the opposition .
These days Musharraf is a key ally of the West .
I am sorry about this because I think the more the West supports Musharraf , the stronger the extremist forces grow and the moderate forces are being marginalized , that 's not good for Pakistan .
How long can Musharraf last ?
As long as the army supports him , not as long as America supports him .
The American support is one factor because the army will say , 'we need weapons or money and so we need Musharraf . '
Right now they think good , he 's getting us the money and our ideological perception continues .
Since 1977 our security establishment was hijacked by Zia-ul Haq 's officers .
They think Pakistan should have a puppet government in Afghanistan so that we can get strategic depth all the way up to the Amur river .
They think that through nuclear brinkmanship they can bring India to its knees because they think no matter how intense the insurgency gets in Kashmir what can India do ?
Ultimately , if India tries to have a war , the world community will have to intervene to stop it going nuclear and if the world community does not come in , India knows if it crosses into Lahore , Pakistan will throw a bomb .
India might retaliate but it will still mean so many people in India will die .
They have this strategy and they think having Musharraf on top allows them to pursue this strategy .
There is also rising anti-Americanism in Pakistan .
There is rising anti-Americanism for different reasons .
One of them is that Musharraf is a dictator and people feel angry that the West talks about freedom but turns a blind eye to the empowerment of Pakistanis .
The second reason is that we have a very large Pakhtun population and the bombing in Afghanistan led to many civilian deaths and people knew each other across the border , so there is that grief .
The third thing is that we have a large military class wedded to the idea that Afghanistan is critical to Pakistan because of strategic depth .
This class also has a pensioner class and there are constituencies within that who are anti-American .
Does Musharraf have an exit strategy ?
No he does not .
He thinks if he remains head of the army nobody will throw him out .
He fails to remember that army chiefs in Pakistan have not had a very nice life .
Yahya
Khan went to Ayub and told him , ' Go home sir ' and he had to .
General Gul Hasan went to Yahya and said , ' Go home sir , ' and he had to .
General Zia died and if he was killed it had to be by his own men .
General Asif Nawaz died and again if he was killed it is because his own men wanted a change .
[ Jehangir ]
Karamat resigned and Musharraf himself was about to be killed in a plane crash .
General Musharraf is a pretty bright man , is n't he ?
That 's what people say , but from what I remember of him , I was quite disappointed by his analytical skills .
He was my Director General Military Operations and he presented me with his plan in front of 50 officers about how the mujahideen would infiltrate an area similar to Kargil .
How they would bring about a war and the Indians would n't be able to dislocate us and they would be forced to start a second front at which point the international community would intervene and we would take Srinagar .
I said to him , ' General , what would happen on the day after you took Srinagar . '
He replied , ' I do n't know what you mean , I do n't understand your question . '
I think he personally does n't like me because of that confrontation we had in GHQ on the Kargil issue .
But believe me I had to have that confrontation because if I did not , the blood of 3,000 soldiers would be on my hands .
After I was overthrown they went ahead with their folly and 3,000 of our young boys , the best in our army , died , so many on the Indian side died , there was so much bitterness .
The whole world had to intervene to stop it escalating into a nuclear war .
How did you find Musharraf personally , all those pictures of him with his dogs and his whisky ?
He was quite a jolly officer initially .
I do n't know about the whisky drinking and dog loving because I did not see him with his dogs or his whisky .
But he was my translator for the Turkish delegation , he was very sharp .
He was also very close to General Hamid Gul , who was one of the corps commanders .
When they had this exercise ' Zarb Al Momen , ' he was my conducting officer .
We had this fracas on the Kargil war games proposal and I do n't know if he has ever got over it .
But we politicians learn that there are no such things as personal feelings in politics .
It 's the interests of the country , of the party , of the people .
Nawaz Sharif and I were at daggers drawn .
Believe me what we suffered at his hands I will always remember , but I have put it behind me .
He suffered too and now he is a changed man .
He very much opposes the military exploitation of our country .
Do Pakistanis hate all Indians , or is it just Hindus they dislike ?
It changes from times of tension to times of less tension .
When there is tension and there are troops on the border they hate everyone who is Indian , irrespective of whether they are Muslim or Hindu .
When there is no tension people really welcome Indians .
Indian films are very popular , Indian goods are smuggled across all the time , people are desperate to get Indian visas and travel to India to visit their families or the Taj Mahal .
Overseas the Pakistanis , Indians , Bangladeshis see themselves as South Asians , they work together , they socialise together , there is no hatred at all .
There must be others in Pakistan who are broadminded ?
If you leave it to the people they want to be friends .
Sometimes I think your country and my country , the military need wars so they can go on buying weapons .
I do n't know , but as far as people to people links are concerned , there is a lot of love and affection .
When l first talked of peace in 1987 between India and Pakistan there was so much criticism .
I was called an Indian agent and an Israeli agent .
Now I see that everyone is falling into line .
So Kashmir is the stumbling block ?
It 's for negotiation .
When I was prime minister the Indian government had agreed to put Kashmir as an agenda item and we had two agenda items .
One was Kashmir and the second was Indo - Pak .
We said we would not let lack of progress on one issue impede progress on the other .
After India went nuclear in 1988 the Pakistan People 's Party had a reappraisal .
We said we do n't want to follow tit for tat with India .
We should follow our core interests , but not copy India .
India wants a bomb , we want a bomb .
India wants a missile , we want a missile etc .
We said we must dissociate from tit for tat .
The second thing we said was that if we disagree on the territorial unity of Kashmir , we can till work for the social unity of Kashmir by working for safe and open borders .
If we have safe and open borders people can travel and trade .
Ultimately I feel we have to ask ourselves with all that population what can we do to pick ourselves out of this mess for the future .
The only way forward for us is to try and see what the European Union did and to have a kind of tariffs and common market .
If we open up , people will come and visit Pakistan , more hotels will be built , more people will get jobs .
It 's the same in your country .
Do Pakistanis feel they should rule in New Delhi ?
I do n't know about that but I have met people who are very bitter about India and I am sure you have the same on your side who have witnessed massacres .
People who witnessed the massacres find it difficult to let go .
But generally those who did not witness massacres all want to talk about their homes in India .
Indians are the same .
Mr I K Gujral [ former Indian prime minister ] has told me of his homes in Jhelum and Mr Advani has told me of Karachi and Hyderabad .

As if 1080 p video , full - resolution audio , net connectivity and multi- tuner signal decoding was n't enough , Toshiba 's HD DVD team had even cooked up a system of embedded animatronic control before the format was put out of its misery .
In this video left over from CES 2008 , this little mechanical jazz band playing the Duke Ellington classic " Take the A Train " is controlled by , that 's right , an HD DVD disc .
Here 's how :

Toshiba Kills HD DVD , Official
We have been saying it for ages , but now it 's official .
HD DVD has been pronounced dead on Tuesday , Read more

The disc is encoded with an animation control signal embedded directly into the video channel ( sort of like how Dolby ProLogic was just mixed into stereo audio tracks ) .
That signal is interpreted in a separate outboard box , which uses the animation cues to tell the figurines how to move .
All in all , a fairly labor - intensive process that would have required the purchase of an additional box , not to mention a collection of tiny plastic chanteuses , cool cats and swingin ' daddy - o's .
But if you wanted the power of a full miniature jazz band made of plastic in your very own living room , you lost your chance .
We loved you HD DVD .
But we can't help but think what could have been if your developers wasted less on this sort of R&D and stuffed a little more of that cash into envelopes aimed at studios like Fox .
After all , it might work if the video playing was Star Wars , and those figurines were holding lightsabers .

Fresh evidence has emerged that the US government 's warrantless wiretapping program predates the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Secret surveillance operations that enabled the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to access telecommunications traffic data have been in place since the 1990s , according to the New York Times .
In an attempt to gain intelligence on narcotics trafficking
The NSA forged an uneasy alliance with telcos to gather data on phone calls and emails from the US to Latin America .
The alliance between the US government and telcos to gather call records involving thousands of US and foreign citizens was constrained by legal worries and fears of public exposure .
Even so , it took until 2004 for one unnamed carrier to break ranks and refuse to provide customer data , the paper reports .
Separately , US carrier Qwest refused to provide NSA spooks with access to local communications switches ( a move that would have allowed surveillance of domestic phone calls without a court order ) in early 2001 - before the devastating World Trade Center attacks in September that year .
Negotiations between the NSA and AT&T in February 2001 allegedly involved replicating a New Jersey network centre to allow the US signals intelligence " access to all the global phone and email traffic that ran through it " .
The incident has become one aspect of a lawsuit which also brings in allegations that Verizon set up a dedicated fibre - optic line from New Jersey to a large military facility in Quantico .
Spooky .
An AT&T technician at the time has provided evidence supporting the allegations .
However , other AT&T technicians are due to testify that the project was confined to improving internal communications within the NSA .
News that the NSA eavesdropped on the international communications of terrorism suspects making calls from the US without warrants first emerged two years ago .
The latest revelations that this was a development of a much longer running practice that also involved US domestic calls come as the Bush administration is pushing Congress to pass legislation indemnifying telecoms carriers from liability in assisting law enforcement with warrantless eavesdropping programs .
Since 2005 , the warrantless wiretapping program has become the topic of 40 lawsuits . ®

My main hunting grounds are the mean streets of BART , which I am forced to endure twice a day for half an hour at a time .
Many people from other places tell me that BART is great or some similar shit , but anyone who rides it daily like me knows that it sucks .
To pay $ 10 a day for the right to park and ride to and from work is excruciating , especially on the way home when I think about paying to stand on a packed train with a bunch of self absorbed aholes .
But I must give BART some credit , for they launched my career as the most lethal vigilante in history .
Here is a list of some of the victims and the methods with which they were punished :
Mr. Read the newspaper to his wife on speaker phone guy :
You are on the top of the list for one reason and one reason only ; you are without a doubt the biggest asshole in history .
Who sits there and yells on speaker phone and reads stories about an axe murderer to his wife during rush hour ( in the elderly and handicapped seat no less ) ?
You do .
I fought for almost two minutes , desperately pumping the volume up button on my iPod trying to block out your transgressions .
My career as a fartist started then , my ignorant self absorbed friend , and you were treated to turkey chili con queso .
Oooooh it was hot and wet when I crop dusted you , how did it smell ?
Call your wife and tell her about it .
Ms. Lower her shoulder and cram her way on to a way too packed train lady : I could not believe you were actually going to try to cram your way on to our way too packed train , but you sealed the deal when you lowered your shoulder and repeatedly rammed your way into the crowded mass of frustrated passengers .
It took me a stop or two , but slowly I was able to back my tight buttocks right up to within 2 feet of your short ugly face .
I used the silencer once again but you bathed in it .
When you cried , “ Oh god , who farted ? ” I was crying I was laughing so hard .
Two teenage girls talking about sex and two teenage guys talking about taking drugs and driving :
You have no idea how stupid you sound talking about subjects like that on a silent BART train during the afternoon commute .
I saw one lady actually get up and move away because your conversation was so inane and ignorant .
Bonus points for the one girl saying she prefers wine and salmon to a beer and burger now , I ca n’t tell you how impressed we all were with you .
The woman behind you who rolled her eyes and slumped in her seat wanted more of your tips on living the high life for sure .
And guys , I ’m not sure what drug exactly you were talking about taking and then driving on the freeway but I just hope you do n’t take anyone with you when you earn your Darwin Awards .
I approached smiling , appearing to be heading for the exit , utterly forgettable in my everyday Dockers with polar fleece pullover .
You were all sitting together in the “ quad ” chairs that face each other and no one else was around you for obvious reasons .
The ambient noise from the tunnel meant I was able to really make you shiver when I delivered , I am actually shocked that a burnt hole was n’t left in the back of my pants .
It was one of my fall specials , a preseason pumpkin fart that smells for five minutes .
By the time you realized what was happening I was doubled over laughing on the escalator in the station , I hope my gas taught you something valuable .
Silence is golden .
Next time , more victims and a discussion over which came first – the need to fart or the elevator .
A survey was taken around the world and the results were determined by :
1 ) Quality of women , 2 ) Amount of Women per men ratio and 3 ) Ease of talking to women .
10 . Amsterdam , Holland
This city has women more beautiful riding past on bicycles than other cities .
Dutch girls are amazing in so many ways , they ’re trendy , as well as cool , they ’re fun , and they are exceptionally beautiful .
They ’re the kind of girls that you just want to date for a very long time .
9. Tel Aviv , Israel
Israel has some of the best looking women in the world .
Perhaps it is something about those green eyes that are just particularly attractive .
8. Montreal , Canada
The exquisite taste of France but with the convenient location of Canada , Montreal is truly one of the world ’s best cities filled with beautiful women .
So many universities and colleges and so many women with fashion sense and a desire to take care of their bodies .
One of the best parts is that the women all speak French commonly known as the language of love .
7. Caracas , Venezuela
Caracas is the capital of Venezuela .
For the record , Venezuela is the country with more Miss Universe Pageant titles than any other nation , therefore you know it ’s capital is going to be teeming full of beautiful women .
The women of Caracas are so beautiful that they make Brazilian women look like trashier counterparts .
6. Moscow , Russia
Mother Russia is home to some of the world ’s finest women .
It ’s not only the regularity of tall , blonde hair , blue eyed women that make it so great , it ’s also the amazing level of friendliness that you will find .
5. Los Angeles , California
How much can be said about L.A. girls , well I think you will find upon arrival that so much can be said you ’ll find yourself at a lack of words .
The women of L.A. are on a level unlike most any other kind you may have ever seen .
All the beautiful people from across the United States flock to this mecca , this is where the cool people come to live , to work , & to try to “ make it ” .
4. Varna , Bulgaria
Bulgaria is a land of no drug laws , cheap vodka , mechanical bulls on the beach , waterslide and some of the most uninhibited natural beauties in the world .
This land has cafes with inflatable furniture , thongs and g- strings everywhere you turn your head , see through pants on every corner and topless sunbathing on every beach .
What ’s more , these women retain a certain level of class and sophistication and take great care of their bodies .
The most important part of Bulgaria is the charm and beauty that you will find in these stunning women .
3. Buenos Aires , Argentina
Buenos Aires is a city unlike any other .
The women of Buenos Aires are beautiful , natural women who are comfortable in their amazing bodies .
Nearly every women in Buenos Aires is a model waiting to be found .
The parties are legendary and the clubs and events are overloaded with beautiful , approachable , and fun women .
2. Copenhagen , Denmark
Copenhagen ’s women are probably some of the most approachable you will ever meet .
Also , these women are much more liberated sexually than most other cities throughout the world .
They are all over , working in all places and always ready to head to the local bar for a drink or two .
The environment runs at a much slower pace and the women enjoy a wide variety of situations .
1. Stockholm , Sweden
It seems like every woman in Stockholm is amazingly beautiful .
Also , these women know how to party and enjoy each other .
Per capita the women of Stockholm were the most beautiful .
These women were also extremely educated and friendly .
These women make you feel good in every way .
Sweden is a must visit on a future vacation !
Later edit : I love you Keyra ! 🙂
This year i will come to Buenos Aires .
Maybe we will meet .

1 where were those legs ?
You ’ve seen them– they go on for days .
So , tell me …
How did the producers manage to keep them off the monitor ?
2 the woman was sitting down .
The only time the world should be deprived of seeing such a beautiful creature standing up is if she ’s on her back , or on all fours .
3 a little more action .
A female as gorgeous as Adriana Lima needs to be seen in action to be fully appreciated .
Crawling towards you , walking away from you …
4 girl has mad back .
Here we have a specimen who possesses one of the most spectacular rear ends known to human existence , and also a few producers who somehow thought we would n’t feel cheated out of viewing it .
5 more cleavage , please .
The girl ’s profession is modeling bras and underwear for a living , so we know she can maximize what she ’s got going on .
Who ’s idea was it to put her in non-cleavage - enhancing lingerie ?
6 everything about her was understated .
Considering every feature that she has is completely exaggerated , I feel that this particular portrayal of Miss Lima was just downright criminal .
7 that football she was holding obstructed the view .
Not that anyone one would mind watching her play any sport …
I just know that we would all rather see her stretched out across the goal line .
8 just hose her down .
This is one thought that can instantly take you from mental image to full - blown day dream .

CROSS CITY , Fla .  Warren Messner was 15 when he and some friends attacked a homeless man and left him for dead .
Mr. Messner jumped on a log laid across the man ’s ribs .
He does not know why .
He was high , does not remember much and wants to forget the rest .
Today Mr. Messner is a baby - faced 18 - year - old serving 22 years for second - degree murder .
He used to like skipping school and listening to rap music with friends .
He imagined he eventually would help his father install flooring .
Now he talks to his parents nearly every night from the maximum - security Cross City Correctional Institution .
“ It was just a senseless crime . ” he said , his eyes down , his shoulders slumped .
“ I wish it would have never happened .
It made no sense .
It was stupidity . ”
Mr. Messner ’s story is not unusual .
Nationwide , violence against the homeless is soaring , and overwhelmingly the attackers are teenagers and young adults .
In Florida the problem is so severe that the National Coalition for the Homeless is setting up speakers bureaus to address a culture that sees attacking the homeless as a sport .
It is the first time the organization has singled out a particular state .

Bletchley 's code - breaking effort shortened the war by many months
For the first time in more than 60 years a Colossus computer is cracking codes at Bletchley Park .
The machine is being put through its paces to mark the end of a project to rebuild the pioneering computer .
It is being used to crack messages enciphered using the same system employed by the German high command during World War II .
The Colossus is pitted against modern PC technology which will also try to read the scrambled messages .
War work
Colossus is widely recognised as being one of the first recognisably modern digital computers and was developed to read messages sent by the German commanders during the closing years of WWII .
It was one of the first ever programmable computers and featured more than 2,000 valves and was the size of a small lorry .
The German participants in the code - cracking challenge will transmit three enciphered messages - one hard , one very hard and one ultra hard .
Speaking to the BBC , Andy Clark , one of the founders of the Trust for the National Museum of Computing , said radio problems had stopped the challenge getting under way on time .
" The radio path has not been particularly good between Germany and here , " he said .
" We are at a bad point in the sunspot cycle . "
Signals had improved throughout the day , he added , and he hoped to get 100 % of the ciphertext - the code - through soon .
The Colossus machine will be pitted against modern computer technology that will also be used to decipher and read the transmitted messages .
" A virtual Colossus written to run on a Pentium 2 laptop takes about the same time to break a cipher as Colossus does , " he said .
It was so fast , he said , because it was a single purpose processor rather than one put to many general purposes like modern desktop computers .
Mr Sale it could be Friday before the teams find out if they have managed to read the enciphered messages correctly .
Re-building the pioneering machine took so long because all 10 Colossus machines were broken up after the war in a bid to keep their workings secret .
When he started the re-build all Mr Sale had to work with were a few photographs of the machine .
In its heyday Colossus could break messages in a matter of hours and , said Mr Sale , proved its worth time and time again by revealing the details of Germany 's battle plans .
" It was extremely important in the build up to D - Day , " said Mr Sale .
" It revealed troop movements , the state of supplies , state of ammunition , numbers of dead soldiers - vitally important information for the whole of the second part of the war . "
The Cipher Challenge is also being used to mark the start of a major fund - raising drive for the fledgling National Museum of Computing .
The Museum will be based at Bletchley and Colossus will form the centre - piece of its exhibits .
Colossus has a place in the history of computing not just because of the techniques used in its construction .
Many of those that helped build it , in particular Tommy Flowers and Tommy Kilburn , went on to do work that directly led to the computers in use today .
The Museum said it needed to raise about £ 6 m to safeguard the future of the historic computers it has collected .
We told you about the plans and simulations last May , but now a couple of bold Swiss adventurers just unveiled a prototype of Solar Impulse , a carbon fiber solar - powered airplane they plan to fly around the world in 2011 .
The 3000 - pound aircraft will have a wingspan that 's about the same as the Airbus A380 , but instead of streaking around the globe at 560 mph , this one will poke along at a mere 40 mph .
At that rate , it 'll take four weeks for it to carry its single passenger all the way around the planet .
Let 's take a look at the details and more pics of the plane .

The solar cells on the wings will suck up power for a maximum seven to eight hours a day because of the angle of the sun .
The pilot wo n't have to worry about clouds , though , because the plane will cruise at 42,000 feet .
After sunset , the plane 's designers hope batteries will power the plane through the night .
They admit that battery technology is n't efficient enough now for this to work , but insist that it will be possible by 2011 .

For now , they 're planning to test - fly the prototype in 2009 , with a smaller wingspan of 197 feet that flies for 36 hours at 27,000 feet .
Will they make it ?
With $ 87.5 million backing up the project , who knows if they 'll actually fly all the way around the world , but they 'll probably have enough cash to at least mount an attempt .

Mr Sarkozy urged Mr Hu to strengthen China 's currency
These include a delivery of 160 Airbus passenger planes to the value of about 10bn euros .
And state - owned French energy firm Areva said it had signed a contract to build two nuclear reactors in China .
The announcements came as Mr Sarkozy held a second meeting with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao .
" The total amount of these contracts has never been matched before , " he told the Chinese president as they met in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People .
China growth
The reactors will be built in six years ' time in the south of the country and will start generating power in 2014 .
They will be operated by a new company set up by Areva and its Chinese partner , China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp , until 2026 .
The BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing says China is increasingly looking to nuclear energy to meet its growing demand for power and France is keen to make sure that it is involved in this process .
In addition , China is also expected to become the world 's second biggest aircraft market after the US with strong growth in its domestic routes over the next few years .
The Airbus deal to supply 110 of the firm 's single aisle A320 jet and 50 of the slightly bigger A330 plane will be welcome news to the European planemaker , which has struggled in the face of delays to new models and the weakening dollar .
Human rights
Following the signing of these deals , President Sarkozy will carry on with his official visit , his first to Asia since his election in May .
Mr Sarkozy is set to hold further talks in Beijing and will then travel to Shanghai to meet Chinese business leaders .
According to some critics , the French President should be doing more during the trip to pressure China over its human rights record and use of the death penalty .
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent Jill McGivering said that " although Mr Sarkozy is travelling with seven ministers , for example , the French human rights minister is not one of them " .
And she added that there has been little evidence that Mr Sarkozy had raised other difficult issues such as Tibet and China 's relationship with Iran .
Some observers are calling on China to take a harder line with Iran over its nuclear programme .
Mr Sarkozy has warned that it would be unacceptable if Tehran acquired nuclear weapons .
However , the President 's office countered that despite the commercial focus of the trip , Mr Sarkozy had used a state dinner to urge China to employ the death penalty less frequently .
Citigroup lined the $ 12.5 billion of capital through the sale of convertible preferred securities from several big investors , including two funds sponsored by cash - rich foreign governments .
That comes on top of a $ 7.5 billion stake that the company sold to a Middle Eastern government fund , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , in November .
The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation will make a $ 6.88 billion investment , giving it one of the biggest ownership stakes in the company .
The Kuwait Investment Authority , Capital Research and Management , Citigroup ’s biggest shareholder , and the New Jersey Division of Investment also made large investments .
But the most interesting investments came from Mr. Weill and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia , who met privately to discuss ousting Charles O. Prince III , Citigroup ’s former chairman and chief executive , soon before he resigned in early November .
Prince Alwaleed , who until recently had been Citigroup ’s biggest shareholder , had bailed out the company from the real estate crisis in the early 1990s .
Mr. Weill , Citigroup ’s former chairman who four years ago chose Mr. Prince as his successor , has complained his own personal fortune has been hurt by the bank ’s poor performance and may see this as his own personal rescue mission .
Both are also large existing shareholders and their actions will prevent their ownership stakes from being more severely diluted .
Citigroup announced other actions to strengthen its finances .
It will offer public investors about $ 2 billion in newly issued debt securities , a portion of which will be convertible .
It reduced the assets held on its balance sheet by $ 176 billion , or 7.4 percent , by shedding mortgage - backed securities and other assets held by both its consumer and investment banking businesses .
And it sold ownership stakes it held in Redecard , a Brazilian company in the credit card industry , and an investment advisory arm of Nikko Cordial , a Japanese brokerage it agreed to buy last spring .
Citigroup ’s board agreed to cut the stock dividend to 32 cents from 54 cents , reversing a position it staunchly held for the last few months .
The reduction could free up $ 4.4 billion a year but could be a significant blow to big institutional shareholders and many retail investors , who bought Citigroup shares for their retirement accounts .
The latest moves highlight the extent to which Citigroup ’s capital position has weakened and raise questions about the company ’s diversified business model .
Wednesday night Republican candidates for President will hold their own YouTube debate .
Since those in the mainstream media we depend upon to ask the really important questions more often than not do n't , we can only hope they let the YouTubers do it for us .
We can each make our own list of what we consider " important questions " the candidates are not being asked by reporters .
But for me it 's no contest .
We 've now experienced 7 years of God - talks - to - me , faith - based , Jesus - is - my - favorite - philosopher , science - shmyence , governance of George W. Bush .
And look where it 's gotten us .
Which is why I really want to start getting some specific questions posed to any candidate , Republican or Democrat , who wears his / her faith like an American flag lapel pin and / or tosses around references to their " faith " as though it 's some kind of UL certification of righteousness .
This Wednesday night , during the CNN Republican YouTube debate , Americans will get a rare opportunity to ask the candidates the kinds of questions reporters shy away from .
At the top of that list are questions that plumb the depths of what candidates themselves claim they hold sacred -- their religious beliefs .
Bush keeps telling us we have to take terrorists at their word , and act accordingly .
Fine .
Then let 's also take the candidates at their word too .
Let 's listen to what they say the believe in and then connect that to the job they are applying for , President of the United States of America .
Overtly religious candidates , particularly Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney , have been allowed by the media to flash their religious " gang signs " to like - minded voters without challenge , without digging , without context or exploration of the consequences that might flow should that candidate become our next leader .
Which is why I submitted a YouTube question for Mike Huckabee .
I doubt it will be selected but I sure hope there are plenty more submitted by others .
( See also : Mike Huckabee is Not a Sane Man )
I figured I 'd have , at best , one shot at a YouTube question so it was hard to pick between Huckabee and Romney , the two candidates I think have gotten the away with the most god-pimping .
Both men belong to Christian sects with core beliefs so out of the political , social , scientific and intellectual mainstream that it 's breathtaking .
But even more breathtaking is the media 's refusal to confront them with pointed questions about those beliefs and how they would shape their presidency should the win .
Since Huckabee , a minister himself , adheres to the most fundamental of Christian fundamentalist sects , can we assume he would favor teaching the creationist 's anti-evolution pseudo - science in our public schools ?
We do n't know because no reporter has yet forced him on to explain his beliefs about creation on the record .
That lack of journalistic curiosity and courage is even harder to excuse in the case of self - described devote Mormon Mitt Romney .
Mormonism ( Church of Latter Day Saints , LDS ) is , like Scientology , a belief system created by a modern - day " prophet , " Joseph Smith .
Unlike Scientology 's founder , L. Ron Hubbard who invented an entirely new school of superstition , Joseph Smith borrowed liberally from the old and new Testaments as well as mis-translated Egyptian papyrus fragments .
When those sources of inspiration failed to distinguish his sect from the dozens of Christian spinoffs , Smith simply made up entire civilizations complete with competing tribes living in city - states here and abroad , civilizations that archeologists say never existed .
Smith , a half - educated , failed treasure hunter , claimed he could translate ancient languages because he possessed a " seer stone . "
This mystic stone not only allowed him to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics decades before scientists were able to do so , but showed him where to find treasures his made up civilizations had buried during times of turmoil .
Among those alleged treasures were the gold tablets off which he claims to have transcribed the Book of Mormon .
It 's all pretty weird stuff if you can stick to it and read the whole BoM.
( Mark Twain tried , describing the Book of Mormon as " Chloroform in print . " )
But , since Romney states he 's proud of his faith then he should have no problem having his beliefs probed .
For example , does he really believe , as the BoM states , that that American Indians ( " Lamanites " as described in the BoM , ) were one of the lost tribes of Israel , and were direct descendants of pre-Columbian Judeo - Israelite colonists who fled to the American continent around 400 AD ?
Does he believe this central tenet of the Mormon faith ?
And if so , how can he believe it since DNA testing has proven beyond doubt that America Indians actually descended , not from Semitic lines , but rather Asian and Eurasian linage ?
I want to hear him reason that one through .
Why is that important ?
Because it tells us a lot about a person 's critical thinking and reasoning .
And since the American presidency is an office that is often faced with reasoning through some of mankind 's most potentially deadly matters , would n't you like to know how Mitt 's mind works ?
Would n't you like to know how he navigates the world or real things with the spirit world he inhabits as a devote Mormon .
I sure would like to know .
At the very least I would not want a fellow as president who actually believes that the ancestors of American Indians were , at any time in their history , a part of a worldwide Jewish Diaspora .
I sure as hell do n't want someone that gullible and -- let 's not mince words --- stupid , mucking around in Middle East politics .
And I sure do n't think we want someone who defend or otherwise rationalizes the absurd and entirely fictional version of human history making decisions about how we educate our children .
( So , call me picky . )
Maybe Romney would like to elaborate on the Mormon belief that when Christ returns to earth he will build a new Jerusalem .
Where ?
Not on the West Bank , not even in the Middle East , but in Jackson County , Missouri !
This new homeland will then serve as the seat of Christ 's 1,000 - year reign on Earth .
Jerusalem in Missouri , imagine that !
And then try to imagine a president of the United State who believes that .
( I guess Jackson County Missouri can expect some big-ass earmarks during a Romney administration . )
During Bill Clinton 's first run for President a student asked him , " boxers or briefs . "
It was viewed a humorous though frivolously question to ask a candidate for president since it had nothing to do with how he would preform in office .
He said boxers , and now we can only wish he'd kept them on for his whole term in office .
Nevertheless , the same similar question for Romney would be more justifiable .
It would go like this :
Mr. Romney , inquiring minds want to know , boxers , briefs or holy underwear ?
If Romney wears these so called " temple garments " he believes they protect him from evil , and possibly even physical harm .
Would n't you like to know ?
What if , just for comparison , a candidate believed that wearing garlic around his neck protected him from vampires ?
Would that be something you 'd like to know about a would - be president of the United Staes ?
Well holy underwear is no less silly -- and no less telling .
So , who 's going screw up the courage and ask Romney ?
He claims he does n't mind talking about his religion , so let 's talk .
Yet reporters seem hindered by the notion that it 's rude , or " intolerant " to ask critically probing questions about a candidates ' stated religious beliefs .
Well , that 's just plain wrong .
Sure it 's rude to run around cross examining your generic church - going Joe or Jane Blow about their beliefs just because you disagree with them .
But it 's not rude or out of bounds when when candidates for high office volunteer such information implying that we should consider their religious beliefs a reason they deserve our vote .
If so then we deserve to know exactly what those beliefs are and how they might shape a candidate 's social and world view during his / her presidency .
But reporters have failed us badly in this regard .
With the exception of one silly " hold up your hand if you do n't believe in evolution " question in the first GOP debate we 've gotten nothing out of the bible thumpers running for the GOP spot on the ballot .
Allowing candidates to get away with their wink - wink , nod - nod , code - word assurances to religiously - like - minded voters without following up with probing questions , is nothing short of dereliction .
After all , that 's how we got stuck with alleged born - again , George W. Bush .
We got war against Muslim nations , we got perverted science , global warming denial and a condescending , Father Knows Best disdain for our basic freedoms .
This time around I 'd like us all to know exactly what we 're getting when we vote .
But god forbid we should ask any " rude " questions to find out .

The Machine Gun Of Capitalism
By Mark Morford
19 February , 2008
SF Gate
S urprisingly moving Barack Obama music videos ?
The potential end of the writer 's strike ?
Cute young deer being saved by helicopters ?
No no no no no .
Here are your most deeply inspiring news stories of the month :
A flurry of pink slips fluttered over the job sector as corporate payrolls were sliced like sour pie .
Foreclosures are skyrocketing and new home sales across the nation are plummeting faster than Britney Spears ' serotonin levels .
A nasty recession is either creeping or flooding in , depending on your perspective and how recently you purchased your home and / or tried to dump your Google stock .
Meanwhile , the largest corporation in the world , the one which has consistently raked in the largest and most appalling profits of any organization on Earth , a company so powerful and deeply influential to the machinations of our own nation , our government , the globe , so ingrained and unstoppable that no president , no administration , no nuclear warhead to its CEO 's home planet stands a chance of slowing it down or altering its behavior in any significant way because there is simply far , far too much money involved in its nefarious endeavors , has recently posted the largest profit of any company in American history .
Yes , the Exxon Mobil corporation sucked in a staggering $ 11.7 billion in a single quarter ( more than $ 40 billion for the year , a new record for an American company ) thanks largely to record - breaking prices for a barrel of oil , which are of course only record - breaking because , well , the Bush administration has essentially engineered the economy and launched a bogus war and desiccated the American idea exactly so they would be .
Oh yes , two more trifling stories , buried beneath the nauseating Exxon headlines and the tales of looming economic struggle : More U.S. soldiers are dead in Iraq as a result of Bush 's failed war , U.S. military spending in 2009 will reach its highest levels since WWII ( $ 515 billion ) , insurgents have taken to strapping suicide bombs to mentally retarded women and nearly 100 more civilians are dead in another bombing in Baghdad because the U.S. troop surge is working so well .
Oh wait .
Do you feel the righteousness ?
The inspiration ?
Can you sense the deep connection between these stories ?
Because the truth is , they merely add up to the heartwarming conclusion that , without a doubt , American capitalism is still firing on all cylinders .
Praise !
Yes , the system is working just exactly as those in control of the nation right now wish it to be working , with the most dominant , ruthless corporations in the world ( Exxon joined by Shell , Chevron , BP , ConocoPhilips et al ) still making the most money in the most destabilizing and environmentally devastating manner possible , while poor uneducated kids die like chattel in unwinnable wars trying to secure a tiny bit more of the source of their profit .
And somewhere in between , the nation 's overall health and well - being are sacrificed like dazed lambs to an ignorant god , with our government offering up only the most meager , desultory efforts to keep it functional so as to not induce all - out fire - and - pitchfork revolt .
Is that too simplistic ?
Too reductive ?
Not even close .
Hell , you can distill it down even further .
For if you understand , as most sentient creatures on the planet now do , that this " war " is merely a particularly bloody chunk of a particularly brutal , fraudulent national energy policy spearheaded by Dick Cheney and beloved by Saudi Arabia and Halliburton and most of Texas , then it is no stretch at all to say that we are sending American kids to their deaths exactly so Exxon can continue to make $ 3 billion in a single month ( or : $ 100 million per day , $ 4 million per hour , or more than $ 1,000 every .
Single . Second ) .
Or how about this for dark math : $ 40 billion for the year , 4,000 dead U.S. soldiers ... that 's a cool $ 10 million in pure profit for every American soldier BushCo has thrown to the wolves of petroleum , just for 2007 alone .
Even if you factor in the 20,000 wounded , paralyzed and brain damaged U.S. soldiers — not to mention the record number of military suicides — on a body - by - body basis , you 've still got yourself one hell of a sweet profit margin .
See Dick Cheney 's vile , crooked little grin ?
Now you know where it comes from .
This , you might argue , is perhaps the bleakest way to look at American capitalism , as an instrument of war and death and gluttony that serves only the most cretinous corporate masters at the expense of , well , everyone else .
This is the capitalism of the hard right , a particularly ruthless type that happily sacrifices quite literally everything — the environment , health , human life , God , national identity , the stability of future generations — for the sake of immediate and unchecked profit .
It is the kind of system , furthermore , that brings with it a huge , nauseating sense of shame for how we have approached the world , pouring a vague disgust over the nation like a cancerous sludge .
This is perhaps BushCo 's cruelest gift of all : tragically convincing us that this strain of capitalism , a furious weapon of greed and disgrace , inviting all manner of corruption and destruction as it brings out the absolute worst in the human animal , is the only flavor there really is .
But then again , no .
Maybe there 's something else , a flipside we 've forgotten amid the insane oil profits and dead bodies and global mistrust .
It 's the awkward truism that American capitalism is potentially capable , despite its dark core of profit , despite its frequently poisoned heart , of tremendous creative opportunity and ingenuity .
Like porn , like God , like wisdom and plutonium and very , very dark rum , it 's all in how you use it .
Here , then , is perhaps the most dominant question surrounding the upcoming big transition , as the nation prepares over the next year to finally rid itself of the cancer of Bush :
Are we still capable of reshaping the capitalist demon , injecting it , on a national scale , with something like conscience and compassion and responsibility , sans the need to sell your mother , rape Alaska , or bomb ancient cities and kill pathetic foreign dictators in a pitiable attempt to vindicate your dad ?
Is such a turnaround even possible anymore ?
Because this nasty truth remains : Bush or no , Exxon and its nefarious , insanely powerful ilk are ramming full speed ahead , undertaking more incredibly brutal , land - raping techniques as you read these very words to get at the Earth 's remaining supply of oil , sucking up tar sand and coal and anything else possible to maintain profit and power .
They are , and will continue to be , utterly relentless and , at least for a number of years to come , quite unstoppable .
There is no eliminating the dark side of capitalism , the gluttony and the greed and the violent underbelly .
There is only minimizing , shifting the emphasis , changing the pitch and angle of approach , trying to take what is , at its very heart , a flawed and self - destructive system , and making it into something proud and interesting and vibrant , something actually worth defending .
Can it be done ?
Is it still possible ?
No matter how many poetic Barack Obama speeches , no matter how many pragmatic Hillary Clinton promises , it 's a question that seems far bigger than both of them .
And the truth is , it 's really the only question that matters .
Mark Morford 's Notes & Errata column appears every Wednesday and Friday on SFGate and in the Datebook section of the San Francisco Chronicle
There are many people who do get into our field purely for money .
The sad thing is that they ’re allowed to .
There are not enough sufficiently hard courses that weed out the less dedicated ones available on the university / college level .
Same could be said of the HR people who are not able to distinguish wheat from chaff …
— Srdjan
I do n’t see why that ’s necessarily a sad thing …
The fact is that the majority of programming tasks are n’t actually that difficult .
They do n’t require a superstar in order to get done …
( Please read Guillaume ’s clarification below ) — Guillaume
For a solid grounding on how to successfully develop software , start with The Mythical Man-Month : Essays on Software Engineering .
It is one of the most important books ever written about developing software , from the small to the large .
Read the book that spawned the expression , “ There is no silver bullet . ”
On another of my posts , there were the following pair of comments : I agree that many programming tasks are not difficult .
I am not convinced we have found a good way of predicting which tasks are difficult and which are not , which require a cut and a paste and which require some careful thought to avoid breaking something else or adding cruft to code .
I do n’t think we do a very good job of dividing up work on a project such that the people with the least experience are protected from damaging the code .
But that is just my opinion .
I may be wrong .
I am much more confident when I say that we have to be very careful when we set the bar for the minimum standard needed to ship software .
The choice between ( a ) employing people who are n’t particularly dedicated and would fail anything remotely resembling challenging courses in computer science and , ( b ) hiring “ superstars ” is a false dichotomy .
There is such a thing as someone who is competent and professional enough to pass tough courses .
Someone who wo n’t get confused if you ask them to keep abreast of developments in their field .
Guillaume seems to agree
In many other fields there are tough courses .
MBA programs are often touted as separating the wheat from the chaff .
Yet we do n’t assume that every MBA is a superstar in business .
We do assume they have a baseline of competency .
Likewise Chartered Accountants do not tolerate people taking a lukewarm attitude towards their field .
But nobody would describe every accountant as a financial wizard .
There ’s a continuum of talent , and we can raise the bar above the gutter without leaping from mediocre to world - class in a single bound .
In any business situation , it ’s prudent to be wary of people who put their own selfish interests ahead of the business .
So it ’s fine to avoid people who want to learn to use the latest bauble on your dime .
But again , let ’s not establish another false dichotomy : people who are curious about programming and eager to learn are not automatically disinterested in shipping solid code using conservative strategies .
The most important thing is to establish the baseline competency required for the job and find the people who meet it .
We do n’t lower the bar to match whomever is available when we are looking , and we do n’t assume that our choices are always binary ( Superstar vs. Mediocre , Passionate vs. Pragmatic , Java vs. Ruby ) .
There is another way we can misinterpret Guillaume ’s comment .
Many programming tasks are not difficult .
True .
But that does not mean that all programming tasks are not difficult .
Furthermore , I have experienced a paradox : sometimes when a good person works on an easy task , they see things in the easy task that an average person would miss .
An average person might copy and paste code all day .
A good person might refactor to eliminate duplication .
Of course , that means the good person can do far more of the easy work than the average person .
But more importantly , the code base is forever improved , its friction has been lowered .
The existence of easy tasks in programming can lead us to believe that a programming is a relatively unskilled trade .
When we examine the pieces on their own , we might believe so .
My question is this :
If anyone can do it , Why do we as an industry stink at it ?
Although each piece seems easy , the whole of completing a successful project on time and budget with acceptable quality and good long - term cost of ownership is elusive .
Now I know that Joel Spolsky and everyone else at Microsoft will tell you that software is ridiculously high quality compared to something - or - other .
And with auto - widget - building wizards and AST - bending IDEs and memory management , today ’s programmers ought to be ridiculously productive .
But yet …I admit this is anecdotal , but I ’m hearing a different story from my ex-colleagues and ex-clients out there : projects are late , bug lists are long and getting longer , and a lot of companies are scrutinizing their IT ROI and getting very Scrooge - like about starting new projects in - house .
They just are n’t happy with the results they ’re getting .
Now maybe this has absolutely nothing to do with programmers .
Maybe it ’s all about requirements and waterfall and managing expectations .
Maybe it ’s all about looking at writing code and realizing that getting ’er done today with a few minor warts is more important than getting ’er done tomorrow with no bugs .
( Or worse , tomorrow ’s code is even buggier because it features an abstraction of a framework plugged into a component organized in a service architecture , and there ’re so many moving parts that nothing works properly . )
Or maybe this has nothing to do with the problem - solving , hold a complicated thing in your head , visualize all the ways it can go wrong so you can program defensively part of programming .
I buy that .
I buy that maybe we have to be better at writing programs for people to read .
I buy that we have to be better at testing our code .
I buy that we have to be better at all sorts of software development skills like analyzing requirements .
It could be that programmers on the whole have all of the skills needed , and that our problem is we just have n’t found the right formula for harnessing their power , for getting them all to march in lock step towards project success .
Maybe we programmers are doing a fine job and there ’s no need to be better at it .
But somehow something is n’t right , and throwing more people with fewer skills at the problem does n’t seem to be working .
NeXT / OpenStep Emacs for GNUstep and OS X
This is a port of the latest GNU Emacs source to the OpenStep ( or NeXTstep ) APIs , as implemented by Cocoa on OS X as well as the GNUstep open source project .
It runs on OS X 10.4 ( " Tiger " ) and above ( and possibly Panther ) , as well as GNUstep on Linux , FreeBSD , and NetBSD ( use 9.0r c2 release ) .
It probably needs more work to run on Solaris and Windows .
On OS X , 10.1 and 10.2 are not supported due to the absence of certain APIs supporting explicit character layout in text rendering .
( Use Emacs on Aqua for those platforms as well as 10.3 . )
Current Status
NOTE : This project is obsolete .
It was merged into GNU Emacs .

King Abdullah is on the third leg of a European tour
King meets
Pope
The Vatican described the private meeting as " warm " and said the two men discussed the presence and hard work of Christians in Saudi Arabia .
An estimated 1.5 m Christians live in Saudi Arabia but are not allowed to worship publicly .
The Vatican said Abdullah requested the audience as part of a European tour .
The two sides have no diplomatic ties , although when Abdullah was crown prince he met the late Pope John Paul II .
Correspondents say the visit comes as relations between the Vatican and the Muslim world are improving , more than a year after the crisis caused by a papal speech appearing to associate Islam with violence .
The 84 - year - old Saudi monarch is on the third leg of his European tour after visiting the UK and Switzerland .
He will travel next to Germany and Turkey .
Inter - faith dialogue
Pope Benedict warmly greeted King Abdullah at the Vatican on Tuesday , grasping both his hands before leading him to a library for their brief private meeting , which lasted only 30 minutes , with both leaders speaking through interpreters .
Afterwards , the king offered his host a gold sword encrusted with jewels .
He was given a 16th Century engraving of the Vatican in return .
The most important thing is to get the possibility to gather in freedom and security for our worship
Bishop Paul Hinder
Emerging voice of Islam
The Vatican said the talks allowed a wide discussion on the need for religious and cultural dialogue among Christians , Muslims and Jews " for the promotion of peace , justice and spiritual and moral values , especially in support of the family . "
Both sides also emphasised the need for a " just solution " to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , the Vatican said .
About a million Catholics , many of them migrant workers from the Philippines , live in the conservative desert kingdom , which is the home of Islam 's holiest shrines .
They are allowed to worship in private , mostly in people 's homes , but worship in public places and outward signs of faith , such as crucifixes , are forbidden .
Christians complain that rules are not clear and hardline Muslim authorities sometimes crack down on legitimate congregations .
" The most important thing is to get the possibility to gather in freedom and security for our worship , our masses and our activities , " said Bishop Paul Hinder , responsible for Catholics in Arabia , in an interview with Reuters news agency .
Saudi Arabia has no legal protection for freedom of religion
The Saudi authorities cite a tradition of the Prophet Muhammad that only Islam can be practised in the Arabian Peninsula .
King Abdullah , who is styled the Custodian of the Two Sacred Mosques - in Mecca and Medina - is an advocate of cautious reform in Saudi Arabia , often against the wishes of the powerful conservative religious establishment .
The BBC's Frances Harrison in Rome says the symbolism of the meeting was huge for those who believe there should be more dialogue between Islam and Christianity , especially after the pontiff 's controversial September 2006 speech at Regensburg University .
In it , he quoted Emperor Manuel II Paleologos of the Byzantine Empire , who said in the 14th Century that the Prophet Muhammad had brought only " evil and inhuman " things .
The pope later stressed that these had not been his own words and expressed regret for any offence they had caused .

Amid renewed talk of a John Edwards endorsement for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton come disturbing rumors also that the former progressive candidate for president might actually be thinking about endorsing Clinton .
While Mr. Edwards considers his options , it seems worthwhile to consider also what he has said about Clinton and other " corporate Democrats " in the past , and the degree to which a Clinton endorsement from him now would constitute an act of unforgivable hypocrisy .
Like Barack Obama , Edwards has energetically campaigned against the Washington system of entrenched interests and insider entitlement that Clinton represents to Edwards ' own supporters as well as to Obama's .
In the course of his presidential campaign Edwards frequently reminded us how deeply embedded in that corrupt system Clinton and her campaign actually are .
As ABC News reported in October 2007 , for example , Edwards called Clinton a " corporate Democrat " and compared her campaign strategist Mark Penn to the infamous Republican strategist and Bush aide Karl Rove , drawing attention to Penn 's lobbying ties to such corporate villains as Blackwater USA ( as president and CEO of Burson - Marsteller and its lobbying subsidiary BKSH , Penn has worked with Blackwater as well as with oil and tobacco companies ; and has assisted corporations in impeding union organizing efforts , about which labor leaders have expressed " distress " to the Clinton campaign ) .
Edwards ' opinions on Clinton are also clear in comments from the campaign trail quoted by Mother Jones in November :
" Do you really believe that if we replace a crowd of corporate Republicans with a crowd of corporate Democrats that anything meaningful is going to change ...?
The presidential candidate who has raised the most money from Washington lobbyists is not a Republican .
It 's a Democrat .
The candidate who has raised the most money from the health industry - insurance companies and drug companies - is not a Republican .
It is a Democrat ....
And the candidate who has raised the most money from the defense industry is not a Republican .
It is a Democrat .
And all those descriptions fit the same candidate .
They 're all Senator Clinton . "
Progressives will never forgive John Edwards if he helps Hillary Clinton try to derail the best opportunity for real change we seen had in America for forty years .
To back Clinton now for the sake of his own political prospects would be rightly seen by progressives as a sell - out and a betrayal of the highest order .
Out of respect for John Edwards and his record on behalf of the progressive cause , I will assume that this is not what he intends to do .
An inquiry into the accident at the building in E 66 St is under way
Wife 's reaction
Alcides Moreno , 37 , tumbled some 500 ft ( 150 m ) to the ground in a scaffolding accident that killed his brother .
Mr Moreno suffered severe brain , spine and abdomen injuries and both his legs , his right arm and ribs were broken .
But after undergoing a series of surgeries he is now awake , able to talk and is expected to walk again .
" If you are a believer in miracles , this would be one , " Dr Philip Barie , a surgeon at New York 's Presbyterian Hospital where Mr Moreno is being treated , was quoted as saying by the New York Times newspaper .
" Above 10 floors , most of the time we never see the patients because they usually go to the morgue ... this is right up there with those anecdotes of people falling out of airplanes and surviving , " Dr Barie said .
' What did I do ? '
Mr Moreno , an immigrant from Ecuador , plummeted from the Manhattan skyscraper on 7 December , when a platform on which he was working came loose .
His younger brother died instantly in the fall .
An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way .
Immediately after the accident Mr Moreno received 24 units of blood and several units of blood plasma .
Nine operations followed to stitch together his broken body .
But now doctors say that now Mr Moreno has movement in all his limbs and is able to talk .
His wife , Rosario , said that one day he even reached out and stroked the face of one of the nurses .
" I looked at him and said , ' You 're not supposed to do that .
I 'm your wife , you touch your wife ' , " Mrs Moreno was quoted by the New York Times as saying .
She said his answer was : " What did I do ? "
Dr Barie said that " although there is more work to be done , we are very optimistic for his prospects for survival " .
Mr Moreno still has to undergo several surgeries in the coming weeks .
The medical team , however , warns that there is still a chance he could develop serious complications .
I think Bush is looking to build himself a positive a legacy for history .
This is SOMETHING in the plus column anyway , keeping us safe from call centers in strange foreign lands .
I feel safer already .
Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons dominate the sector
The watchdog is looking into claims that Tesco and Asda have been pressurising suppliers to cut prices .
It is part of larger inquiry launched last year into the sales methods of Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons .
The supermarkets deny any wrong - doing and say they follow a strict code of conduct when dealing with suppliers .
' Thorough investigation '
A spokesman for the Competition Commission confirmed legal notices , called Section 109s , had been served on Tesco and Asda .
The notices would allow the watchdog " to investigate more thoroughly " , he said .
He added : " We are being thorough and using our powers where we can . "
We are happy to help and we have got absolutely nothing to hide
Asda spokeswoman
But the supermarkets said they had " nothing to hide " .
A spokeswoman for Asda , which is based in Leeds , said : " We adhere to the code of conduct between suppliers and supermarkets .
" During the period which the commission want to see our correspondence there were about 11 million e-mails to suppliers .
" But we are happy to help and we have got absolutely nothing to hide . "
Stores ' squeezed out '
A spokeswoman for Tesco , based in Hertfordshire , also confirmed the commission has issued the supermarket with Section 109 notices .
She said : " We have nothing to hide and we are doing what we can to assist the commission with this enormous data request .
" We expect the commission to conclude that at Tesco , relationships with suppliers are professional and act to the ultimate benefit of the customer . "
The Office of Fair Trading referred the £ 120bn supermarket sector to the Competition Commission in May last year , amid claims that top supermarkets had become too powerful and smaller stores were being squeezed out .
The watchdog has been examining the supply chain , planning and land banks of the four big UK supermarkets as part of its two - year inquiry into their market dominance .

Public Health Response to a Rabid Kitten --- Four States , 2007 On July 24 , 2007 , the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ( SCDHEC ) was notified by the North Carolina Division of Public Health ( NCDPH ) of a stray , rabid kitten that had been handled by players on several girls ' softball teams during a tournament in Spartanburg County , South Carolina .
This report summarizes the public health response to exposure to the rabid kitten and highlights the importance of multistate collaboration in a rabid animal investigation .
During July 13 -- 15 , 2007 , the South Atlantic Summer Showdown softball tournament was held at a recreational complex in Spartanburg County .
Softball games were held at four recreational facilities .
Approximately 60 teams of approximately 12 players each from multiple states participated in this tournament .
Spectators at the tournament included families and friends of the softball players and tournament coordinators and staff members .
On July 14 , a softball coach from a North Carolina team found an apparently healthy and alert kitten in a barrel - shaped garbage bin located near one of the playing fields at which the tournament was held .
The kitten was placed in a box and later brought to at least six different games played at two recreational facilities that same day .
That evening , the kitten was transported by the coach in her private vehicle to her home in Buncombe County , North Carolina .
On July 15 , the kitten began behaving abnormally and became increasingly lethargic .
The coach 's housemate brought the kitten to an emergency animal hospital in Buncombe County for care .
Although further investigation would reveal that the housemate had been bitten by the kitten , she did not disclose this to the attending veterinarian at the time of the visit .
After evaluation indicated that the kitten was severely ill , the kitten was euthanized and held for cremation , planned for July 18 .
Rabies was not suspected by the attending veterinarian .
On July 18 , the mother of a softball player from North Carolina , after learning from the coach that the kitten had become ill and was subsequently euthanized , contacted the emergency animal hospital and asked whether the kitten had been tested for rabies .
The mother had been bitten while trying to feed the kitten during the tournament .
Rabies testing had not been planned by the animal hospital because the coach 's housemate had signed a routine release form indicating the kitten had not bitten anyone during the preceding 10 days .
The mother went to the clinic , requested the cat 's body , and took it in her private vehicle to her local health department .
On July 20 , the local health department sent the body to the North Carolina State Laboratory for Public Health for rabies testing .
On July 23 , the kitten had rabies diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody testing .
The rabies virus was identified as the eastern United States raccoon variant by rabies monoclonal antibody typing .
The mother provided her travel history to NCDPH , which then contacted SCDHEC on July 23 to alert the department about the possible human rabies exposures in Spartanburg County .
NCDPH and SCDHEC obtained a roster of teams from the tournament organizer and discovered that Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Tennessee all had teams participating in the tournament .
NCDPH and SCDHEC contacted CDC and state public health authorities in Georgia and Tennessee , and all four states subsequently initiated contact investigations ; these investigations sought to identify and locate potentially exposed persons and ensure that only persons with actual exposures ( i.e. , contact with saliva , either through a bite , a lick on the oral or nasal mucosa , or a claw scratch ) received postexposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) .
SCDHEC coordinated the interstate investigation and led its own intrastate investigation to locate persons , assess exposures , and prescribe PEP as warranted ; in South Carolina , PEP is provided by the state to exposed persons as determined by SCDHEC .
To locate potentially exposed persons , each state issued advisories ( e.g. , through daily e-mails ) to local health departments ; additionally , South Carolina , Georgia , and North Carolina used local news media to alert the public and solicit responses from potentially exposed persons .
South Carolina also activated the state 's 2 - 1 - 1 telephone information system , which uses media channels to advise the public to call a dedicated state telephone number ( 2 - 1 - 1 ) for information related to specific public health emergencies .
The multistate contact investigations and interviews of persons who had potentially been exposed to the kitten revealed that at least two other stray kittens of similar age as the rabid kitten were found in the parking lot of a fast - food restaurant near the garbage bin where the rabid kitten was found .
These stray kittens , which were possibly from the same litter as the rabid kitten , were reported by interviewees to also have been present throughout the length of the softball tournament ; several softball players had handled them .
These kittens were never located by public health authorities .
Interviewees were questioned about their handling of all of the kittens to assess potential exposure to rabies .
Health department personnel relied on the point - of - contact for each team , usually the coach , to identify persons who might have been exposed to the kitten .
If players reported exposure , they were interviewed by health department personnel .
Anecdotal evidence indicated that no tournament spectators had handled the kitten ; investigators were unable to contact spectators because neither documentation nor recorded entry of persons to any of the recreational facilities was available .
Of the approximately 60 teams participating in the tournament , 38 had players and associated family and friends who reported exposure to the rabid kitten .
From these teams , 27 persons were identified as having exposures that warranted PEP : one from South Carolina , 15 from Georgia , and 11 from North Carolina ; Tennessee reported no exposed persons .
All recipients of PEP had reported actual exposure to a kitten 's saliva , either through a bite , a lick on the oral or nasal mucosa , or a claw scratch .
No reports of human rabies or adverse reactions to PEP were reported .

Editorial Note : Animal rabies - control programs , including extensive vaccination campaigns implemented during the 1940s and 1950s , resulted in a substantial decline of rabies in domesticated animals in the United States ( 1 ) .
Domesticated animals accounted for 7.9 % of all rabid animals reported in the United States in 2006 ( 1 ) , compared with 82.6 % in 1950 ( 2 ) .
Despite this decline , stray animals , including cats , continue to pose a risk for transmission of rabies to humans .
During 2006 , a total of 49 states and Puerto Rico reported to CDC a total of 6,940 cases of rabies in wild ( e.g. , raccoons , bats , skunks , and foxes ) or domesticated ( e.g. , cats , dogs , and cattle ) animals and three cases in humans ( 1 ) .
Of these reported rabid animals , 318 were cats , representing 4.6 % of all cases .
This represents an 18 % increase from 2005 , when 269 cases of rabid cats were reported ( 1 ) .
Of the 24 human rabies cases reported to CDC in the United States since 2000 , none have been associated with exposure to a rabid cat .
The last documented case of human rabies from exposure to a rabid cat was in 1975 ( 1 ) .
Nevertheless , the risk for human rabies from rabid cats in the United States should not be discounted .
In addition to the risk for rabies , exposure to rabid cats carries substantial economic implications for exposed persons , health insurance companies , and health departments .
For example , in Maryland , during 1983 -- 1986 , approximately 194 persons received PEP at a total cost of nearly $ 68,000 because of rabid cat exposures ( 3 ) .
In New Hampshire , in 1994 , approximately 600 persons received PEP after potential exposure to a single rabid cat , at a cost of approximately $ 1 million for biologics alone ( 4 ) .
During 1995 -- 2000 , cats accounted for 523 ( 24 % ) of 2,216 animal rabies exposures requiring PEP reported by four counties in upstate New York ( 5 ) .
Measures to reduce rabies exposures among humans by promotion of responsible pet ownership and routine vaccination of cats remain public health priorities .
Children should be taught to be cautious in their interactions with animals , especially those that are unfamiliar , to avoid potential exposures to rabies and other infectious diseases ( 6 ) .
First aid for animal bites and scratches should include thorough washing with soap and water ( 7 ) .
An apparently healthy dog , cat , or ferret that bites a person should be confined and observed daily for 10 days ( 7 ) .
If the animal becomes ill or dies during this observation period , its brain should be examined by a state laboratory for evidence of rabies virus infection ( 1 ) .
If rabies is detected , prompt administration of PEP is indicated ( 7 ) .
If the animal is unavailable for testing , public health officials should be consulted ( 7 ) .
The rabid kitten in this investigation was infected with a raccoon rabies -- virus variant .
Most rabid domesticated animals are infected with the terrestrial rabies -- virus variant associated with the geographic location of the animal ( 8 ) .
In the southeastern United States , the region in which this incident occurred , the raccoon rabies -- virus variant predominates ( 8 ) .
Raccoons have been recognized as a major reservoir for rabies in the southeastern United States since the 1950s ( 1 ) .
This investigation highlights the need for rabies - prevention measures , such as continued rabies vaccination among domesticated animals and wild animal populations .
The investigation also demonstrates the importance of interstate collaboration during a rabies response .
Exposed persons were identified through cooperation among the states and CDC , which included daily conference calls and e-mail exchanges among investigators in the affected states ; CDC participated in conference calls to provide additional expertise .
In this investigation , rapid , open , interstate collaboration enabled the expeditious identification and prophylactic treatment of exposed persons while preventing unnecessary administration of PEP .

Should Congress care if a minister drives a Bentley , flies private jets , or buys a $ 23,000 commode ?
Yes , says Sen. Charles Grassley ( R ) of Iowa , if the high - spending ways violate the US tax code – especially a tax exemption for religious organizations .
He 's given six televangelist ministries a deadline of this Friday to respond to questions on issues ranging from compensation and housing allowances to personal use of assets and unreported income .
" If tax - exempt organizations , including media - based ministries , thumb their noses at the laws governing their preferential tax treatment , the American public , their contributors , and the Internal Revenue Service have a right to know , " says Senator Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee .
In the past five years , Grassley has led probes of nonprofits that unearthed lavish perks at the Smithsonian Institution , conflicts of interest at the Nature Conservancy , and mismanagement at the American Red Cross .
Now , he 's looking at some of America 's largest , media - based ministries .
" Considering tax - exempt media - based ministries today are a billion - dollar industry ... with minimal transparency , it would be irresponsible not to examine this tax - exempt part of our economy , " he said in a statement this week .
But church groups and other nonprofits worry that this probe could lead Congress to pass laws that slip into constitutionally protected territory – imposing excessive government oversight on a wide range of churches and other nonprofits .
Last week , National Religious Broadcasters ( NRB ) wrote to Grassley expressing concern about " the broader implications of this issue , not only for our members , but for all non-profit Christian ministries as well . "
The information requested of the six ministries " goes far beyond a mere request for financial records necessary to scrutinize the charitable nature of an organization 's operations , " said NRB president and CEO Frank Wright in a Dec. 4 statement .
This includes requests for compensation agreements , employment contracts , minutes of board meetings , credit card statements , flight records , plastic surgery expenses , and a detailed account of the personal use of assets .
" There is financial information in an employment contract but also a lot of information that 's none of the government 's business , " says Craig Parshall , NRB senior vice president and general counsel .
While none of the six ministries included in the probe to date is an NRB member , Mr. Parshall says that if abuses are found , Congress may be tempted to move government into the spiritual life of a church .
" There are thousands of Christian ministries engaged in electronic communications who are doing the right things – agonizing about how they are going to use donor dollars .
Then you have , perhaps , a handful that have abused the tax laws .
That 's how bad laws get made , " he says .
The six ministries include Without Walls International Church in Tampa , Fla. , the World Healing Center Church , Inc. in Grapevine , Tex. , Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton , Mo. , the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia , Ga. , World Changers Church International in College Park , Ga. , and Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Newark , Tex .
Grassley says that he chose these six ministries because of " disturbing news coverage " and information provided to his staff by interested third parties .
All six are also associated with the so - called prosperity gospel , which says that God wants people to be financially successful and they can get there by giving generously to church .
Some groups say the decision to target these six may signal that lawmakers are picking and choosing among religions in violation of the Constitution .
" Anytime a Congressional committee gets involved in this kind of issue , a red flag goes up , " says Brent Walker , executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee in Washington , which advocates for religious liberty .
" A lot of us are not enamored with the prosperity gospel , but this is not a decision for government to make .
Government is supposed to enforce the law evenhandedly , not get involved in picking and choosing the best expression of religion , " says Mr. Walker .
Americans gave more than $ 295 billion to charity in 2006 , and Congress gives tax breaks to encourage it .
Under federal law , churches are exempt from some of the reporting requirements of other tax - exempt organizations , but must ensure that donated funds are used to meet goals of the organization and not be diverted to personal use .

When June Clarke walked again after six years in a wheelchair , the committed Christian put it down to the power of prayer .
But when she shared the good news with benefits officials , they refused to stop her incapacity allowance - telling her their computer " did n't have a button for miracles " .
With the Government pledging to crack down on " sicknote Britain " , it seems remarkable the 56 - year - old received more than £ 3,500 she did not even want .
Scroll down for more ...
Mrs Clarke , from Plymouth , slipped on a wet floor at her workplace in 2000 .
She badly damaged her hip , pelvis and spine and had to give up work and draw incapacity benefits as her symptoms worsened .
Her husband Stuart , 58 , a pastor at Hooe Baptist Church , said that he prayed every day after the accident that God would " bring my wife back " .
The prayer seemed to be answered when his wife attended a Christian conference in January last year .
Within hours , Mrs Clarke was able to fold away her wheelchair and stop taking painkillers .
When she realised she was permanently cured four months later , she contacted the Government 's Industrial Injury Department to put a stop to her benefits .
Scroll down for more ...
But the department continued to give her £ 600 a month - and she ended up being paid £ 3,600 in incapacity benefits for a period when she was in perfect health .
" After I got healed in January 2006 I went to the doctor to check it out with him , " she said yesterday .
" He said wait six months .
" But after four months I felt uncomfortable taking benefits when I did n't need them .
I contacted the offices to ask to come off the benefits . "
But officials told her that the system was unable to recognise an apparently miraculous recovery .
Mrs Clarke had been awarded an allowance for life and the computer was n't programmed to allow the payments to end until her death .
" They said : ' We have n't got a button to push that says miracle ' . "
She then saw a government doctor , who was baffled about her recovery but declared her fully fit .
The allowance was stopped and Mrs Clarke has since been able to repay the money by working as a carer .
Mr Clarke said that he found the couple 's battle with the benefits system amusing , if frustrating .
" We would have loved to have used the money for a good cause , " he said .
" But it was n't ours to spend .
It ca n't be often that a government department gets a complaint about unwanted cash . "
A spokesman from the Department for Work and Pensions said : " Each case is treated individually .
When a customer contacts us to say they no longer require or need to claim benefits we ask for a letter of confirmation for security reasons . "
MANAGUA , Nicaragua --
The New England Patriots won the Super Bowl and ended the season with a perfect 19 - 0 record -- at least it looks that way in Nicaragua .
The NFL donated 290 Patriots hats and an equal number of team jerseys trumpeting the slogans " Super Bowl Champions , 19 - 0 " to impoverished children from two small communities in southern Nicaragua .
Thursday 's gifts could not change history -- the Patriots lost the Feb. 3 game to the New York Giants 17 - 14 -- but they made a lot of youngsters in the communities of San Gregorio and Buena Vista very happy , said Miriam Diaz , spokeswoman for the humanitarian organization World Vision , which arranged the donation with the NFL .
" They [ Patriots ] lost , but the children won , " Diaz said .
The only " football " most of the children know is soccer , but they were very enthusiastic about the U.S. version of the game once the rules were explained to them , she said .
" They were very happy to receive the hats and jerseys , " Diaz said .
" They said they did not expect such a surprise . "
Neither did the Patriots .
There are three important differences between this turtleneck and those his Steveness actually wears :
First , it is slightly cheaper ( we suspect ) .
Second , it has the words " Hello my name is Fake Steve Jobs " printed in large , friendly letters on a fake name tag on its front .

Third , it is made of cotton , rather than woven from the finest black carbon nanotubes harvested from the backs of cybernetic sheep .
Available in small and medium sizes , the only reason we can think for this not coming in size L and above is so that no one buys one for Real Steve and he gets so pissed he shuts the company down .
Only $ 20 .

1. Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets : Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics In Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets , Bonner and freelance journalist Lila Rajiva use literary economics to offer broader insights into mass behavior and its devastating effects on society .
Why is it , they ask , that perfectly sane and responsible individuals can get together , and by some bizarre alchemy turn into an irrational mob ?
What makes them trust charlatans and demagogues who manipulate their worst instincts ?
Why do they abandon good sense , good behavior and good taste when an empty slogan is waved in front of them .
Why is the road to hell paved with so many sterling intentions ?
Why is there a fool on every corner and a knave in every public office ?
2 . A Demon of Our Own Design : Markets , Hedge Funds , and the Perils of Financial Innovation
Why do markets keep crashing and why are financial crises greater than ever before ?
As the risk manager to some of the leading firms on Wall Street–from Morgan Stanley to Salomon and Citigroup–and a member of some of the world ’s largest hedge funds , from Moore Capital to Ziff Brothers and FrontPoint Partners , Rick Bookstaber has seen the ghost inside the machine and vividly shows us a world that is even riskier than we think .
The very things done to make markets safer , have , in fact , created a world that is far more dangerous .
From the 1987 crash to Citigroup closing the Salomon Arb unit , from staggering losses at UBS to the demise of Long - Term Capital Management , Bookstaber gives readers a front row seat to the management decisions made by some of the most powerful financial figures in the world that led to catastrophe , and describes the impact of his own activities on markets and market crashes .
Much of the innovation of the last 30 years has wreaked havoc on the markets and cost trillions of dollars .
3 . Poop Culture : How America
Is Shaped by Its Grossest National Product Poop Culture is an excellent book about a topic that is largely ( and unfairly ) ignored .
Perhaps the greatest asset and the greatest weakness of the book is its breadth .
The author covers many different approaches to the topic -- from the psycho- social elements of poop ( i.e. shame ) to the history of the toilet to cultural symbolism to poop in art to the economic / ecologic effects of the way we as a society deal with our poop .
It 's at once odd and heartwarming to see a diagram of the best way to poop ( squatting ) or talk of South Park in the same book that also contains theoretical musings on Jonathan Swift and Marcel Duchamp .

The Logic of Life : The Rational Economics of an Irrational World I think that I have read all of the recent " economics of everything " ( Harford 's phrase ) books and this one is , in my view , the best .
I also try to keep up with recent research in applied economics and found some gems in these pages that I had missed .
The author alludes to about 200 papers and books from recent economics research and presents them in the most reader - friendly way , all in about 200 pages .
I call that very efficient .
Harford 's summary is also a useful antidote to all the " behavioral economics " that the popular press has picked up .
The idea that some of us depart from rational choice on occasion is hardly news .
The point of this book , that the rational choice model , has amazing power range is worth reiterating .
5 . The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable Four hundred years ago , Francis Bacon warned that our minds are wired to deceive us .
" Beware the fallacies into which undisciplined thinkers most easily fall -- they are the real distorting prisms of human nature . "
Chief among them : " Assuming more order than exists in chaotic nature . "
Now consider the typical stock market report : " Today investors bid shares down out of concern over Iranian oil production . "
Sigh .
We 're still doing it .
6 . The Economic Naturalist : In Search of Explanations for Everyday Enigmas
The book indeed is like Freakonomics in that its purpose is to reveal the economic rational behind everyday matters .
It is different from Freakonomics in that it follows a " top - down " approach : each of the book 's chapters corresponds to a basic economic principle ( for example supply and demand for a chapter , and signals and asymmetric information for another ) that is explained via real world examples .
So if one can say that the goal of Freakonomics was in reaching the bottom reason / motive of particular phenomena , it can also be said that the goal of The Economic Naturalist is to elicit fundamental economic principles through questions and answers .
In this sense the book is more educational .
7 . Discover Your Inner Economist : Use Incentives to Fall in Love , Survive Your Next Meeting , and Motivate Your Dentist
The book is full of fascinating stories in which psychology meets economics .
The author applies the above concepts and ideas to a wide , wide variety of everyday situations , such as chess , doing the dishes , UN diplomat parking violations , bonuses in the workplace , petty crime , expercise programs , student drinking , tardiness , RSVP 's , meetings , going to museums , buying paintings , reading , buying music , toilet seat positions ( a very , very important topic ) , gift giving , pickup lines , personal ads , marriage , being tortured , recognizing liars , gym memberships , shopping , eating and restaurants and getting the best food , " The Seven Deadly Sins " , sexual intercourse , beggars , charitable giving , and tipping .
WHEW !
WOW !8 . The Wisdom of Crowds In 1906 , Francis Galton , known for his work on statistics and heredity , came across a weight - judging contest at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition .
This encounter was to challenge the foundations of his life 's study .
An ox was on display and for six - pence fair - goers could buy a stamped and numbered ticket , fill in their names and their guesses of the animal 's weight after it had been slaughtered and dressed .
The best guess received a prize .
Eight hundred people tried their luck .
They were diverse .
Many had no knowledge of livestock ; others were butchers and farmers .
In Galton 's mind this was a perfect analogy for democracy .
He wanted to prove the average voter was capable of very little .
Yet to his surprise , when he averaged the guesses , the total came to 1197 pounds .
After the ox had been slaughtered , it weighted 1198 .
James Surowiecki takes Galton 's counterintuitive notion and explores its ramification for business , government , science and the economy .
It is a book about the world as it is .
At the same time , it is a book about the world as it might be .
Most of us believe that valuable nuggets of knowledge are concentrated in few minds .
We believe the solution to our complex problems lies in finding the right person .
When all we have to do , Surowiecki demonstrates over and over , is ask the gathered crowd .9 .
The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less Like Thoreau and the band Devo , psychology professor Schwartz provides ample evidence that we are faced with far too many choices on a daily basis , providing an illusion of a multitude of options when few honestly different ones actually exist .
The conclusions Schwartz draws will be familiar to anyone who has flipped through 900 eerily similar channels of cable television only to find that nothing good is on .
Whether choosing a health - care plan , choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans , Schwartz , drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences , shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains , ultimately restricting instead of freeing us .
We normally assume in America that more options ( " easy fit " or " relaxed fit " ? ) will make us happier , but Schwartz shows the opposite is true , arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well - being .
Part research summary , part introductory social sciences tutorial , part self - help guide , this book offers concrete steps on how to reduce stress in decision making .
Some will find Schwartz 's conclusions too obvious , and others may disagree with his points or find them too repetitive , but to the average lay reader , Schwartz 's accessible style and helpful tone is likely to aid the quietly desperate .

Crimes Against Logic
This book deserves the widest possible exposure in America , especially so close to the election , because it an excellent primer on how to guard yourself against the faulty reasoning that governs so much modern political discourse - and avoid adopting it yourself .
I first heard about the book because one of its points was mentioned in an essay .
The point was basically that just because someone has a motive to hold a certain position does n't necessarily mean that the position is false .
This seemed pretty obvious , but as I turned to the media I was amazed at how often politicians use this method , and how easily I had accepted their claims if they lined up with my political preferences .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Human egg cells can be tweaked to give rise to valued stem cells that match the tissue types of many different groups of people , U.S. and Russian researchers reported on Wednesday .
They said the stem cells they have created from unfertilized human eggs look and act like embryonic stem cells .

And they have been carefully tissue - matched in the same way as bone marrow donations to prevent the risk of rejection if they are transplanted into people .
The team at California - based International Stem Cell Corp. hopes to create a bank of tissue - matched stem cells that could be used as transplants that a patient ’s immune system would accept .
“ The process is efficient , it is relatively safe and it is ethically sound , ” Jeffrey Janus , president and director of research at the company , said in a telephone interview .
The cells are created by a process known as parthenogenesis , a word that comes from Latin and Greek roots meaning virgin beginning .
It involves chemically tricking an egg into developing without being fertilized by sperm .
Several teams have now created parthenogenetic human stem cells from eggs .
Other teams have created similar cells using human skin cells or human embryos .
Writing in the journal Cloning & Stem Cells , Janus and colleagues say they have created four lines , or batches , of stem cells that have specific immune properties .
The closer the match , the less likely a transplant will be rejected .
“ One of our lines will match 5 percent of Caucasians , ” Janus said .
“ One matches 4.7 percent of Native Americans . ”
A third matches 1.2 percent of African - Americans , he said .
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
“ Our goal is to ... create a bank of stem cells from which a doctor or a researcher could draw , ” Janus said .
“ That would make regenerative medicine take one big step closer to reality . ”
Stem cells are the master cells of the body .
Those found in the earliest embryos are powerful because they can form any kind of cell and are virtually immortal in the laboratory .
Using human embryonic stem cells -- which can be made from embryos left over from fertility clinics or by using cloning technology -- is controversial because of concerns about the sanctity of human life and is restricted in some countries .
Some experts see human eggs as a viable alternative .
International Stem Cell ’s Elena Revazova recruited women getting fertility treatments in Russia .
The women agreed to donate unfertilized eggs left over from the process .
The team managed to get four of the eggs to divide long enough to get stem cells out of them and immune - matched the cells to types known in the population .
They are working to differentiate the cells -- to grow them into various tissue and cell types .
Janus said the first goals are liver cells , the pancreatic cells destroyed by type - 2 diabetes and retinal cells that could treat certain types of blindness .
Some groups believe they can achieve an even better match by growing a patient ’s own cells .
But Janus said that takes time .
His company ’s banked cells could be grown into large batches and frozen , ready for immediate use .
“ The biology is sound , ” cloning and stem cell pioneer Ian Wilmut , director of the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and editor of the journal , said in an e-mail .
“ The value of such cells remains to be seen and depends upon competing techniques . ”

Rats have long been eaten in poorer regions of Thailand
Roasted rat on sale
While rat has long been eaten in Thailand 's poorer northern regions , a growing number of the country 's roadside vendors are now serving it up .
The rats are drowned and sold uncooked or ready to eat , with happy customers purchasing rat meat for as much as 150 baht ( $ 4.82 ; £ 2.30 ) a kilogram .
" It 's better than chicken , " one customer told the AP news agency .
' Nothing can compete '
" It all depends what you like , but it 's a normal meat like any other , " added Thongyu Roruchit .
They are definitely clean
Rat vendor Sala Prompim
One rat seller , Sala Prompim , said that the hip and liver were the best cuts .
" It 's tastier than other meats - nothing can compete with rat , " he added .
Mr Prompim said he only used rats caught from rice fields , and not those found in towns or cities .
" They are definitely clean , " he said .
The animals are killed by drowning , before being skinned ready for cooking - poached , fried , grilled or baked .
Mr Prompim says he sells as much as 100 kg of rat meat on some days .
Youngsters who are allowed to leave the house without an adult are more active and enjoy a richer social life than those who are constantly supervised , according to a study conducted at UCL and reported in a special edition of the journal Built Environment ( 19th December ) .
The project helped to inform the Government ’s new Children ’s Plan and was led by Professor Roger Mackett of UCL ’s Department of Civil , Environmental and Geomatic Engineering .
His team studied 330 pupils from two schools in Cheshunt , Hertfordshire , all aged between 8 and 11 .
The children completed questionnaires , kept travel diaries , had their movements logged using GPS monitors and wore portable motion sensors to measure their speed of travel , changes in direction and the number of ‘ activity calories ’ they consumed .
( ‘ Activity calories ’ are those burnt during activities , rather than those used to maintain core bodily functions . )
Professor Mackett says : “ We asked children whether they were allowed out without an adult and then looked at where they go and how they behave .
In general , children who are n’t constantly supervised tend to leave the house more often – exploring their surroundings , playing with other children and using up more calories than their sedentary , house - bound peers . ”
Key findings from the paper include :
-- Children allowed out without adult supervision are more active , being found at home less often .
Statistically , they are more likely to be found playing out or visiting the homes of friends than children who are n’t allowed out alone .
-- Children walk faster and take a more direct route when an adult is present , but they do not use more energy than unaccompanied children .
This is because unsupervised children move in a more meandering fashion as they investigate their environment and socialise with other children .
-- Access to local open space is a significant factor in determining whether boys are allowed out of the house without an adult .
71 % of those with access to open space were allowed out , compared to just 51 % of those without such access .
--
Of the three types of activity monitored during the study ( walking , unstructured play and participation in organised clubs ) , walking used up the most activity calories .
Professor Mackett goes on to say : “ Fears over road safety and ‘ stranger danger ’ need to be balanced against soaring levels of childhood obesity and poor health .
Letting a child out to play is one of the best things a parent can do for their child ’s physical health and personal development .
“ Allowing children to leave the house without an accompanying adult has significant benefits , but we need to design and build environments that children feel comfortable in and that parents feel confident to let them use on their own .
The health benefits are clear , but without action the less tangible benefits of increased independence , self - reliance and general ‘ growing up ’ are in danger of being lost . ”

We recently blogged about some statistics we have collected on different reasons why a website can be down .
Our statistics mostly covered software and network issues with facts about the most common problems .
With this in mind we found it interesting when we encountered a survey by Aperture Research Institute done back in April 2007 that asked the question “ Which causes of outage have you experienced ? ”
According to the survey , human errors are behind 57.3 % of all data center outages .
The second most common reason was improper failover with 43.7 % .
Above : Diagram from the Aperture survey .
Another interesting fact from the survey is that 21 % of the participants did not know how many servers their racks could handle power wise .
This is a statement from the conclusion of the survey :
In many cases the widespread use of high - density equipment is putting a strain on data center infrastructure , massively reducing any margin for error …
Unfortunately the survey does not go into more detail about the type of errors involved , and of course human errors can be hard to categorize .
What you can do to minimize the risk of human errors
To minimize the risk of the “ human factor ” affecting operations , it is important to have up - to - date documentation on everything connected to your data center and manuals on how different critical operations should be performed .
Manuals and documentation together with scheduled tests should help you avoid many of the problems and outages described in this survey .
About the survey
More than 100 data center professionals from a broad selection of industries participated in the survey , which also covered the topics of data center power usage and the use of blade servers .
There is roughly a 100 percent chance that we ’re going to spend much of this year talking about the subprime mortgage crisis , the financial markets and the worsening economy .
The only question is which narrative is going to prevail , the Greed Narrative or the Ecology Narrative .
The Greed Narrative goes something like this :
The financial markets are dominated by absurdly overpaid zillionaires .
They invent complex financial instruments , like globally securitized subprime mortgages that few really understand .
They dump these things onto the unsuspecting , sending destabilizing waves of money sloshing around the globe .
Economies melt down .
Regular people lose jobs and savings .
Meanwhile , the financial insiders still get their obscene bonuses , rain or shine .
The morality of the Greed Narrative is straightforward .
A small number of predators destabilize the economy and reap big bonuses .
The financial system is fundamentally broken .
Government should step in and control the malefactors of great wealth .
The Ecology Narrative is different .
It starts with the premise that investors and borrowers cooperate and compete in a complex ecosystem .
Everyone seeks wealth while minimizing risk .
As Jim Manzi , a software entrepreneur who specializes in applied artificial intelligence , has noted , the chief tension in this ecosystem is between innovation and uncertainty .
We could live in a safer world , but we ’d have to forswear creativity .
LOS ANGELES ( AP )  The 100 - day Hollywood writers ' strike took a $ 2.5 billion toll on the Los Angeles County economy — less than previously estimated .
The figure includes wages lost by writers and other entertainment industry workers when the strike shut down production , according to Jack Kyser , chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp .
His Tuesday estimate also represents damage done to Hollywood - dependent businesses such as limousine services and caterers in the area .
The Writers Guild of America strike began Nov. 5 and ended Feb. 12 , after union members reviewed a tentative contract deal and voted to return to work .
Last week , Kyser pegged the cost of the walkout at $ 3.2 billion .
The revised final number reflects a reassessment of data and the fact that entertainment is a difficult industry to track .
The industry typically represents $ 54 billion of the Los Angeles County economy , Kyser said .
The last writers ' strike , a 153 - day walkout in 1988 , resulted in an estimated $ 500 million in lost wages .

In the movie Back to the Future II , a gigantic shark from a mock Jaws sequel springs out of a theater marquee and engulfs Michael J. Fox .
Now , a Canadian company has developed a way to print lifelike holographic posters that could make that kind of eye - catching advertising possible .
Last week , 10 U.S. theaters rolled out full - color 3 - D posters with motion and photorealistic detail to promote the movie How She Move .
Made by Quebecois company RabbitHoles , the advertisements feature one of the film 's characters tearing up the dance floor in an eight - second clip that can be " played " in 3 - D by walking from left to right of the poster .
Despite the images ' slightly transparent quality , what you see is pretty close to the real thing .
" The sensation you first get when you look at this is your mouth automatically responding with , ' Oh my God , ' " says Michael Page , visiting professor at the University of Toronto 's Institute for Optical Sciences and a RabbitHoles board member .
Holographic imagery is becoming more common these days , from the fraud deterrents on credit cards to National Geographic 's 3 - D magazine covers .
However , these images have been limited with respect to color , resolution , viewing angle and size .
RabbitHoles ' new technology takes the crisp , detailed 2 - D images we 're used to seeing on computer and TV screens and translates them into full - color , 3 - D images .
" Up until now , 3 - D advertising has n't always been done very well , " says M2 Research analyst Wanda Meloni .
" The technology has just been evolving and we 're just starting to touch the surface of 3 - D being incorporated into our everyday lives . "
Rather than simple static images , RabbitHoles ' can take six - to eight - second movie clips from 2 - D and 3 - D films and print them into a poster that " moves " as the viewer walks past .
RabbitHoles poster art unveiled at Comic - Con in July features pop surrealist painter Ron English ’s iconic character Cathy Cowgirl as she flirtatiously cocks her head , lifts her pistol , and fires a shot – all while her udders slightly shudder .
To produce the imagery , RabbitHoles creates a 3 - D computer model of the object that will be turned into a hologram .
A virtual camera takes snapshots at different angles , and a software algorithm developed by RabbitHoles calculates how light would bounce off each angle in the scene .
The result is up to 1,280 different snapshots , or frames , that not only hold color , distance and angle info , but light patterns as well .
To record the actual hologram onto a sheet of film , the data is sent to a printer that divides each frame into pixels – a poster - size print can hold up to 700,000 .
The company then exposes each pixel with red , green and blue pulsed lasers .
If the hologram is destined to become framed artwork , it 's mounted on Plexiglas , but it can be mounted on virtually anything .
At the Los Angeles Auto Show last month , Scion 's promotional vehicle had windows exploding with artwork by English .
The development of the RGB pulsed laser was key to RabbitHoles ' process .
Previous systems used either a continuous - wave laser or a single - color pulsed laser .
The former employs a low - intensity light that requires a long exposure time lasting from less than a second to a few minutes .
Any vibration during filming can lead the laser and the film to slightly shift , diminishing the hologram 's resolution .
In contrast , pulsed lasers flash for just 1/10,000,000 of a second , so getting a clear image is much easier .
But up until now , pulsed lasers were monochromatic .
RabbitHoles ' newly engineered RGB pulsed laser offers the best of both worlds – crisp images in full color .
In the future , doctors may even use RabbitHoles ' technology to visualize the human body .
" Much of our work in the area of scientific and medical imaging is now in 3 - D , " says Page .
" Once we 're able to accurately parse a variety of forms of medical data into this process , we will be able to provide researchers and surgeons with more detailed visualization of the data .
This could save lives . "
BALI , Indonesia ( CNN ) --
In a dramatic reversal Saturday , the United States rejected and then accepted a compromise to set the stage for intense negotiations in the next two years aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide .
Protesters gather outside the conference center in Bali as delegates discuss climate change .
The White House , however , said in a statement that it still has " serious concerns " about the agreement .
" The negotiations must proceed on the view that the problem of climate change cannot be adequately addressed through commitments for emissions cuts by developed countries alone .
Major developing economies must likewise act , " the White House said .
Under the global warming pact , negotiating rounds would end in 2009 .
The head of the U.S. delegation , Paula Dobriansky , undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs , announced the United States was rejecting the plan .
Her comments were met by booing from other delegations .
The White House said the negotiations must " clearly differentiate " and link responsibility with the level of emissions , size of the economy and energy use among developing countries .
" In our view , such smaller and less developed countries are entitled to receive more differentiated treatment so as to more truly reflect their special needs and circumstances , " the statement said .
Rep. Edward J. Markey , D - Massachusetts , chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , called the compromise " a modest but important road map , " and said the House committee would meet Wednesday to review the agreement .
The Saturday session , unpredictable and charged with emotion , was a roller coaster ride for delegates and the media .
After Dobriansky 's announcement , a delegate from the developing country of Papua New Guinea challenged the United States to " either lead , follow or get out of the way . "
Five minutes later , when it appeared the conference was on the brink of collapse , Dobriansky took the floor again to say the United States was willing to accept the arrangement .
Applause erupted in the hall and a relative level of success for the conference appeared certain .
Watch as emotional conference declared a success »
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon called the pact " a good beginning . "
" This is just a beginning and not an ending , " Ban said .
" We 'll have to engage in many complex , difficult and long negotiations . "
The U.N. climate change conference was to end Friday , but delegates returned to the negotiating table early Saturday after talks went well into the night before .
The new pact is meant as a guide for more climate talks , which will culminate in Copenhagen in 2009 .
Humberto Rosa , a Portuguese environmental official , said a standoff had come to an end when specific guidelines were removed from wording about future emission cuts .
The United States objected to the specific guidelines , saying including them was moving the process too quickly and would preempt any future negotiations .
The European Union wanted an agreement to require developed countries to cut their emissions by 25 to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
The United States , Japan and Canada oppose those targets .
The latest draft of the agreement removes the specific figures and instead , in a footnote , refers to the scientific study that supports them .
Markey lambasted the Bush administration for initially opposing the guidelines , saying it was operating on " basis of denial and obfuscation . "
" Not since Emperor Nero tried footnoting firefighting through more fervent fiddling have we seen such a transparently vain effort to avoid the inevitable , " he said .
While the EU and the United States appeared to have ended their impasse , India raised objections to other parts of the agreement , notably the contributions developed nations would make to help developing nations clean up their emissions problems .
Environmental groups said the new pact makes the agreement less forceful than it might have been , but agreed that it is probably the best that could be had given the Bush administration 's staunch objections .
Ban , who attended the conference earlier this week , but left for a visit to East Timor , announced Saturday he was unexpectedly returning to Bali to help shepherd the talks to a conclusion .
At one point Saturday , Ban took the podium to urge compromise .
" Frankly , I 'm disappointed at the level of progress , " he said .
Without specifics , however , some believed the final agreement would amount to failure .
" Let me underline once again that the Bali road map must have a clear destination , " said Stavros Dimas , the EU environment commissioner .
But Rajendra Pachauri , who heads the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , said such a stance would ignore the other progress being made at the conference .
He said simply having a strong statement paving the way for future action would suffice .
" I would n't term that a failure at all , " Pachauri said .
" I think what would be a failure is not to provide a strong road map by which the world can move on , and I think that road map has to be specified with or without numbers .
If we can come up with numbers , that 's certainly substantial progress , and I hope that happens . "
The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change passed the Kyoto Protocol 10 years ago , with the goal of limiting greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere .
The United States was the only one among 175 parties -- including the European Union -- to reject it .

How to read body language tip 2
This tip is not about particular body part , it is about How To Read the signals that are being given off and how to interpret them .
As stated on the BBC site “ Most body language experts favour the Rule of Four , which means look for at least four signals suggesting the same thing before totally believing it . ”
This is a good rule of thumb because the same sign can mean different things depending on the situation .
For example if someone is pointing with their finger , it could mean they are pointing to an object .
Or this could mean they are doing it in anger .
So if you look for more signs to go with the same emotion you will be able to come to a more accurate conclusion .
If they are also frowning with their eyebrows , their jaw is shut tight and their stance is a bold one then we can more or less assume this person is angry .
So remember the four signal rule when reading body language .
It will give you a much more accurate assement of the situation .
Dont forget to check out the rest of the tips section , located on the right side of this page .

How to read body language tips
The day after the notably down - and - dirty Nevada caucuses , I asked Hillary Clinton if , on occasion , her campaign had been wont to play the game a tad too rough .
Now and then , Clinton allowed — then quickly pivoted and trained her fire on Barack Obama ’s operation .
She argued that his campaign had incited racial animus by playing up her remarks about Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King .
That it had made “ what I thought was a breathtaking charge that I was in some way responsible for Benazir Bhutto ’s assassination . ”
That it had “ basically condoned a really mean - spirited ” Spanish - language ad in Nevada that asserted Hillary “ does not respect our people . ”
Without pausing to catch her breath , Clinton concluded , “ There ’s no outcry .
There ’s no drumbeat .
And so I accept that I will always be under a higher level of scrutiny ; it goes with the territory . ”
The scrutiny Clinton was talking about was media scrutiny , of course .
So I asked if she agreed with her husband ’s loudly voiced view that there was a double standard inherent in the coverage of her and Obama .
“ I do n’t go there , ” she replied , waving one hand in the air .
“ Certainly , a lot of my supporters express their feelings about it .
But I just do n’t think about that because it ’s not a useful thing for me to think about . ”
Whether Clinton is actually so Zen - like about this topic — and , really , who would be ?— her adjutants are adamantly not .
Instead , for the better part of a year , they have complained to any reporter who would listen about what they regard as a manifest pro-Obama , anti-Hillary tilt in the press corps .
With the contretemps over David Shuster ’s “ pimped out ” comments about Chelsea Clinton , this line of argument has become more heated , to be sure , especially as it pertains to NBC and MSNBC .
( “ A horror show ” is how one Clinton adviser describes her nightly treatment by Chris Matthews , Tim Russert , and even Brian Williams . )
But it ’s connected to a long - simmering sense of grievance that ’s deeper and more subtle .
That the campaign exaggerates its degree of outrage , and Hillary her victimhood , in order to gain a tactical advantage is obvious .
But that does n’t mean their critique is meritless — quite the contrary .
The more interesting question , however , is what role each campaign has had in fostering a media dynamic that has clearly favored Obama and plainly damaged Clinton .
And also whether that dynamic will come back to bite Obama if he ’s the Democratic nominee .
It ’s worth pointing out , to begin with , that the Clinton forces are hardly alone in noting the disparity .
“ Both of them have gotten an enormous amount of play , ” says Marion Just , a political scientist at Wellesley who has made a systematic study of the coverage of the race .
“ But the coverage of Hillary has been primarily negative , while the coverage of Obama has been so positive that you have to call him , though I really hate this term , a media darling . ”
Divergence in tone is one thing , double standards are another .
And it ’s the latter that most galls the former advisers to the other , now - departed , Democratic candidates .
“ Obama has been able to get away with a stunning amount of hypocrisy that would get called on her , ” says one such operative .
“ They ’ve run the nastiest , most deceptive pieces of paid media : the mailer they did lying about her health - care plan , with the Harry and Louise look - alikes .
The idea that it took Hillary growling Tony Rezko ’s name in a debate to get any national coverage .
How he complained in Iowa about 527s and then had them supporting him like crazy in Nevada and California .
And nobody says a peep about it .
It ’s fucking comical ! ”
There are countless other examples of this syndrome , both large and small .
The way that Clinton ’s famous fumbling of a question about whether illegal immigrants should be allowed to have driver ’s licenses in a debate last fall was hammered on for weeks — whereas Obama ’s flubbing of the same question in the next debate was essentially let slide .
The way that Obama ’s evisceration of his rival in his stump speeches was applauded by the media — whereas Clinton ’s plunge into negative territory was widely condemned .
The way that Clinton was roundly criticized for being inaccessible , and thus unaccountable , to the press — when Obama has since January been even less available for questioning than she .
Theories abound as to why the media has treated Clinton and Obama so differently .
The simplest is that reporters simply like Obama better ; that he ’s new and fresh and unburdened with anything resembling Clinton fatigue .
Another theory revolves around cultural bias .
“ The fact is that the national press is a bunch of northeastern liberals , ” says the adviser to an erstwhile Democratic runner , “ and they just love the idea of this post - racial black dude being the nominee . ”
A third revolves around the respective dramatic arcs embodied by Clinton and Obama .
Citing the Times primary - beat reporters assigned to the candidates , a competitor of theirs observes , “ Pat Healy ’s job is to challenge the Clinton myth and machine .
Jeff Zeleny ’s is to write the epic rise of Barack Obama .
That ’s generally the media ’s approach — Clinton and Obama are just at different points in their stories . ”
All these theories contain at least some truth , but it ’s the last one that edges closest to what I think has actually gone on .
Campaigns are , at bottom , a competition between memes : infectious ideas that gather force through sheer repetition .
The most powerful of these memes are what Just refers to as meta- narratives , the backdrops against which everything plays out in the media .
“ Clinton ’s meta - narrative , ” she says , “ is that she ’ll do anything to win ; she ca n’t be trusted , she ’s ethically challenged ; she ’s manipulative , calculating , and programmed . ”
Obama ’s meta- narrative is decidedly otherwise .
“ It ’s the same , in a way , as John McCain ’s , ” says Just .
“ He ’s authentic , honest , free of taint .
Then you add in new , charismatic , and an agent of change . ”
For any candidate and his or her team , the formation and management of the meta- narrative are paramount strategic challenges .
And these challenges were especially daunting for Clinton because she started out with much of hers already baked in .
Even so , early on , her campaign had ample opportunity to alter the vestigial perceptions of her .
They had done so effectively , after all , when she first ran for the Senate in New York .
But instead , the affect she presented to reporters was in perfect keeping with all the stereotypes about her :
She was guarded and relentlessly , robotically on - message on the rare occasions when she sat for interviews , displaying little of her charm or humor .
She adopted an arch - Establishmentarian posture rather than an inspiring , transformational one — an alterna - stance that would n’t have been such a stretch for someone who stood a reasonable chance of becoming our first female president .
And , in fact , it was worse than that .
By arguing that one of Clinton ’s key virtues was her ability to go toe - to - toe with the GOP attack machine , her campaign exacerbated instead of ameliorated her reputation for ruthlessness .
“ By bragging about how tough they were , ” says John Edwards ’s former chief strategist , Joe Trippi , “ they reinforced the sense of the media that everything they did had a negative cast to it . ”
At the same time , Trippi argues , “ it made it really hard for them to call Obama on his shit .
How can you complain about Obama being negative when you ’re bragging about your willingness to do the same thing against the Republicans ? ”
Obama , by contrast , was in the enviable position of being able to author his own meta-narrative .
With his two autobiographies , he was able at once to accentuate his positive qualities and , in pointing out the potentially damaging aspects of his past ( his teenage drug use preeminent among them ) , to inoculate himself against attacks .
The grassrootsy , bottom - up , decentralized campaign structure that he and his team built , funded by small donors via the Internet , enhanced the impression of him as a man committed to a different kind of politics .
And his strategists were wise enough to understand that when it was time to go negative , they should never do so with TV ads but stick instead to more sub-rosa media , from radio and direct mail to robo-calls .
“ In my experience in politics , ” Trippi says , “ nobody ever really gets called out on that crap . ”
The implications of Obama ’s and Clinton ’s respective meta-narratives for their press coverage have been profound .
For Clinton , the inability to change the story line meant that any vaguely negative maneuver was interpreted in the darkest possible light , for it reinforced a preexisting supposition .
For Obama , however , any criticism could be fended off as a manifestation of grubby old politics .
And any act he committed that could be perceived as nefarious created cognitive dissonance .
As Just points out , a prime example is the case of Tony Rezko , the now - indicted Chicago fixer and slumlord to whom Obama has been linked for many years .
“ There was no way for the press to believe it was n’t true — because , you know , it looks like people are going to jail , ” she says .
“ So instead the press dismisses the story as an aberration . ”
The trouble for Obama is that the Republicans are n’t terribly likely to let that dismissal stand — nor the polite avoidance of discussing his controversial minister , his wayward youth , or , indeed , his blackness itself .
Again and again , as Clinton often points out , the GOP has proved painfully adept at taking compelling , carefully honed meta- narratives and blowing them to pieces .
In ways too numerous to mention , Obama has been toughened up by the primary process .
But no matter what his handlers say , the notion that he ’s been subjected to the most withering press scrutiny imaginable is — how to put this ?— a fairy tale .
His success has turned in no small part on his skill at avoiding such flyspecking , and on his rival ’s inability to muster the same kind of dexterity .
If Obama winds up facing John McCain , a man whose meta - narrative is spun from pure gold , he is unlikely to be so fortunate again .

Benjamin Fulford was Asia -Pacific Bureau Chief for Forbes Magazine for seven years , until 2005 when he quit because of the " extensive corporate censorship and mingling of advertising and editorial at the magazine . "
He currently lives in Tokyo Japan where his books are waking up the Japanese people to 9/11 Truth .
On November 13 , 2007 Fulford received a tip that David Rockefeller was on his turf , and without hesitation Fulford arranged to meet with him to ask some questions .
It is not odd for a reporter who 's career has been filled with Financial News jobs , to sit down with the former head of Chase Bank , Except when its Benjamin Fulford and David Rockefeller .
Back Round :
Earlier this year Benjamin Fulford interviewed Heizo Takenaka , a former finance minister in Japan and confronted him about " having sold the Japanese financial system over to the Rockefellers and Rothschilds . "
According to Fulford this interview made a lot of people angry .
He says a professional assassin showed up and told him to accept a job of great importance or be killed .
The following day Fulford claims to have been contacted by a powerful Asian Secret Society with more than 6 million members that have targeted the Illuminati .
They asked Fulford to represent them , negotiate for them , and offered him protection in return .
He came out with his story on the Jeff Rense radio show this summer .
Fulford said that he could link Rockefeller to crimes in Japan as a " part of his effort to take over the Japanese financial system . "
This story was picked up by the Colbert Report .
As unlikely as it may seem David Rockefeller agreed to meet with Benjamin Fulford on November 14 , 2007 .
The two men sat down and Fulford began with the topic of global government , saying that he had heard some quotes by Rockefeller that were supportive of the idea , but Rockefeller attempts to deny and dodge the history books , saying he cannot imagine the likelihood of any single government elected by the people of the world would be desirable , and he is visibly bothered , perhaps because of his words on page 405 of his book , Memoirs ...
" Some even believe we ( the Rockefeller family ) are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ' internationalists ' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure --- one world , if you will .
If that 's the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . "
At the mere mention of Ron Paul , Rockefeller grinds his teeth , and acts as if he does n't know anything about him , but when Fulford says that Ron Paul wants the powers of the Federal Reserve returned to the United States government , Rockefeller 's eyes widen in amazement and dread , " I would not look upon that as one of the great issues that needs to be addressed . "
Yet here we are , our dollar collapsing .
He knows who Ron Paul is .
Fulford moves on .
It is established that David Rockefeller is in Japan to meet with the Emperor , he claims to have been summoned by him and he casually mentions that his family has been close with Japan and the Royal family for many years .
Fulford breaks in the video throughout the interview with some commentary , and at this point he tells how he sees it , " a secret representative of the secret government of the United States meeting with the secret government of Japan . "
Fulford offers insight into his concerns for the people of Asia , and about the role of Asia in the world .
He poses a question to Rockefeller about the choices of the UN , why Asian countries are not properly represented there , and to that Rockefeller says that " someday , " they will be .
Fulford makes it clear in the edit , that the Asian people are tired of waiting , and an answer like some day is as good as forever to them .
YOU ca n’t say law firms are n’t trying .
At the Chicago office of Perkins Coie , partners recently unveiled a “ happiness committee , ” offering candy apples and milkshakes to brighten the long and wearying days of its lawyers .
Perhaps this will serve as an example to other firms , which studies show lose , on average , nearly a fifth of their associates in any given year , in an industry in which about 20 percent of lawyers over all will suffer depression at some point in their careers .
Last year , Cravath , Swaine & Moore tried a more direct approach , offering associates an added bonus of as much as $ 50,000 , on top of regular annual bonuses that range from $ 35,000 to $ 60,000 .
At the august Sullivan & Cromwell , partners in 2006 began a program , groundbreaking in white - shoe firms , encouraging the uttering of “ thank you ” and “ good work ” to harried underlings , as reported in The Wall Street Journal .
Probably not a bad move at a firm that had been hemorrhaging associates at a rate of about 30 percent a year .
( The rate dipped below 25 percent in the year after the program was started , although Fred Rich , a partner , said better etiquette was simply an element in a “ very broad agenda ” focused on more open communication . )

Two big genetic studies confirm theories that modern humans evolved in Africa and then migrated through Europe and Asia to reach the Pacific and Americas .

Two big genetic studies confirm theories that modern humans evolved in Africa and then migrated through Europe and Asia to reach the Pacific and Americas .

The two studies also show that Africans have the most diverse DNA , and the fewest potentially harmful genetic mutations .
One of the studies shows European - Americans have more small mutations , while the others show Native Americans , Polynesians and others who populated Australia and Oceania have more big genetic changes .
The studies , published in the journal Nature on Wednesday , paint a picture of a population of humans migrating off the African continent , and then shrinking at some point because of unknown adversity .
Later populations grew and spread from this smaller genetic pool of founder ancestors -- a phenomenon known as a bottleneck .
Populations that remained in Africa kept their genetic diversity -- something seen in many other studies .
“ The one thing that I think we cannot say from this study is that any one person ’s genome is any healthier or evolutionarily fit than another person ’s genome , ” said Carlos Bustamante of Cornell University in New York , who worked on one study .
“ You have to think of this at the population level , ” Bustamante said in a telephone interview .
Bustamante ’s team has been looking at the DNA sequences of 15 African - Americans and 20 European - Americans , examining tiny one - letter changes in the DNA code called single - nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs ( pronounced “ snips ” ) .
FIT OR EXTINCT
They tested these changes to qualify them as benign , or potentially affecting genes , amino acids and eventually proteins in a way that could damage health or make people less “ fit ” -- in evolutionary terms , less likely to survive and reproduce .
“ Like every other study ... the African - American panel as a whole showed more variation than the European - American panel , ” Bustamante said .
Then his team did a computer simulation of a bottleneck , and found it predicted this pattern .
Bustamante said it is possible some of the SNPs are beneficial , and he said his team and others should compare the genetic changes they found to known genetic changes linked with diseases .
“ I wish we had done that ( already ) , ” he admitted .
In the other study , Noah Rosenberg and colleagues at the University of Michigan and the National Institute on Aging analyzed DNA from 485 people around the world .
They looked for three types of genetic variation , including SNPs and larger changes that involve duplications , deletions and repetitions of large segments of DNA .
The patterns they found produced what they call the highest - resolution map yet of human genetic variation .
They also reinforce the idea that humans originated in Africa , then spread into the Middle East , followed by Europe and Asia , the Pacific Islands and finally to the Americas .
“ Diversity has been eroded through the migration process , ” Rosenberg said in a statement .
People of African descent are the most genetically diverse , followed by people from the Middle East , and then Asians and Europeans .
Native Americans resemble one another the most on a DNA level .
The study also found it is sometimes possible to trace a person ’s ancestry to a small group within a geographic region .

British scientists have discovered cells that are the source of the most common form of childhood leukaemia after studying twin sisters from Kent , one of whom fell ill with the disease .
The achievement , a world first , came after doctors treating four - year - old Olivia Murphy , from Bromley , learned that her identical twin , Isabella , had not developed the illness .
Their parents , Sarah and Justin , agreed to take part in the research , in the hope that it would help reduce the number of children needing chemotherapy .
Less aggressive therapies
The work was hailed as a big step forward by cancer experts , who said it would lead to less aggressive therapies for sick children and new drugs .
It is the first time scientists have discovered the tiny but crucial group of cells that are the root cause of human cancer .
Only a fraction of a percent of cancer cells drive the disease .
Cancer specialists now aim to develop drugs that target the cells with precision , effectively destroying the engine at the heart of the disease .
The discovery is expected to boost the search for similar cells that drive other types of cancer .
Olivia was two when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , which strikes one in 2,000 people before their early teens .
She has since received chemotherapy for the disease , which has a success rate of more than 80 % .
During treatment , she contracted a chickenpox virus that overwhelmed her immune system and left her blind in one eye .
Vital clues
Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Institute of Cancer Research in London joined forces with the scientists at Oxford University to study the sisters in the hope that they would reveal vital clues about the cause of the disease .
" The twins gave us this unprecedented opportunity to look at the very earliest stages of this disease ... there is no other way we could have got at this , " Professor Tariq Enver , of the John Radcliffe hospital , in Oxford , said .
The doctors compared blood samples from the two girls and found that both had genetically abnormal cells in their blood .
The defect was caused by two genes , called MEL and AML , fusing together inside stem cells that make blood in bone marrow .
However , this alone was not enough to cause leukaemia .
Further tests revealed that Olivia 's blood stem cells carried a second defect , a missing gene , which switched the cells from a " pre-leukaemia " state into full - blown leukaemia .
Although Olivia has now been treated for her illness , her sister still has a 10 % chance of developing the disease .
Helping other families
" What we have always said is that anything that would improve the treatment , we would be very , very happy to contribute to , " the twins ' mother said .
" We have seen the families who have gone through all the chemotherapy .
Anything which leads to a lessening of the intensity of the chemotherapy which can help other families is a good thing .
" Without the research we would n't have had the treatment available to us . "
Writing in the US journal Science , the team described how they confirmed their discovery by injecting blood cells with the genetic defects into mice .
The animals developed a leukaemia - like disease .
Doctors said pre-leukaemia cells developed in one of the twins some time after the first month of pregnancy and spread to the other while in the womb .
Shortly after birth , a chance infection , perhaps from a common cold virus , was enough to trigger the second , dangerous mutation in Olivia .
" What we 've never been able to see before is where this disease begins .
The surprising thing is that it's a very small population , only 1 % of leukaemia cells , that turn out to be the ring leaders , " Enver said .
Tailor - made therapy
The cells may also be to blame for cancer returning after treatment .
If chemotherapy does not wipe them all out , they can slowly begin to produce new cancer cells years later .
The discovery gives doctors the first chance to tailor chemotherapy to suit individual children .
" This is undoubtedly a major step , " Professor Andy Pearson , a paediatric oncologist at the Institute of Cancer Research at the Royal Marsden hospital , in London , said .
" We 'll be able to monitor children for these cells throughout their treatment and stop when they have been killed off .
It will also help us develop new treatments aimed at these cells that drive leukaemia . "
In the future , it might be possible to screen children for pre-leukaemia cells and give them preventative treatment .
" We do n't know what causes the initial genetic abnormality , " a spokesman for Leukaemia Research said .
" It 's possible this is one of many , many genetic mishaps that occur in the womb as a matter of course , but are not usually so unlucky . "
The Armani - style beige suits worn by security staff at BP headquarters in London and introduced under the reign of former boss , Lord ( John ) Browne , are to be quietly dropped in favour of more traditional grey ones .
It is a small change but one dripping with symbolism that the flamboyant days of the " sun king " are definitely over and the company is going back to basics and a bit of no -nonsense austerity .
New chief executive , Tony Hayward , has embarked on a cost - cutting programme that will see the removal of 14,500 jobs and slice £ 500 m off the company 's overheads as part of a wider plan to streamline the business .
The biggest change at the oil major is associated with none of these initiatives : it is the decision to accept that high crude prices of between $ 60 and $ 90 per barrel are here to stay , which will affect the whole strategy of BP .
This " seismic shift , " as one veteran analyst described it , promises to hasten in an era of higher dividends , more capital expenditure and investments in high - cost areas such as the oil sands of Canada that were previously considered too costly - and environmentally unfriendly .
' Climate crime '
BP appears to be dropping a central plank of Browne 's strategy , the green promise to go " beyond petroleum " , in favour of going back to petroleum - a move which many believe has riled the former boss .
In what some saw as a thinly veiled criticism , Browne argued at a recent conference that some energy groups were " in denial " over the need to clean up their carbon output .
The move into tar sands through a deal with Husky Energy has been condemned by Greenpeace as " a climate crime " because three times as much carbon is produced extracting the crude from the ground compared with ordinary oil operations .
Steam or hot water is used to separate the oil from the sand and then more power must be used to turn it into useable fuel .
Hayward has also upset green groups by downgrading the company 's alternative energy portfolio and dropping plans for an innovative carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) experiment at Peterhead , Scotland .
The former head of exploration and production makes clear that now every -
thing , including renewable fuels , must pay their way , at a time when BP is under pressure to restore its financial standing .
The firm was once the biggest company on the UK stockmarket , but a reversal of fortunes has left it vulnerable to acquisition .
Despite four years of increasing crude prices , BP has contrived to destroy its advantages through of a series of accidents , notably the Texas City refinery fire and Alaskan pipeline spills , while being hit by a number of trading scandals .
Browne was forced to leave the group in April after lying in the high court over his personal life .
Hayward may have been tanned and relaxed at the recent annual financial results announcement after his holiday in the British Virgin Islands , but he was desperate to declare he felt anything but complacent .
" The year 2007 was one of change for BP .
In terms of financial performance it was one which most of us will be glad to leave behind .
We are judged by investors in relation to our peers .
In that regard our financial performance was not good enough , " he said candidly .
The company had just reported a 22 % fall in annual profits to $ 17.3 bn at a time of record oil prices , so there was little place to hide , except in the knowledge that the problems had started and gathered pace during the reign of his predecessor .
By far the biggest hole in the accounts came from the low throughput performance of the Texas City and Whiting refineries , assets acquired by Browne during a spending spree , after being hit by a mixture of explosion , hurricanes and repair problems which cut output in half at peak times .
Carbon billionaires
Hayward appears to be doing all he can to distance himself from the man who had appointed him head of exploration and once saw him as a successor .
While he is instilling a new commercial discipline into BP 's alternative energy portfolio , which takes in small wind farms , CCS experiments in California and hydrogen fuel research , Hayward is as keen as ever to ensure the company 's greener image remains .
But the environmental groups do not believe him .
James Marriott , of campaigning group Platform , said : " Moving into the tar sands of Canada and dropping a carbon capture and storage plan for Peterhead are part of a recarbonisation of BP .
It might help the share price in the short term but longer term Hayward is exposing the company to the dangers of a rising carbon price [ for CO2 emissions permits ] and falling oil price . "
There have also been rumblings that some BP staffers are unhappy .
A senior manager who left in December has questioned the wider strategy of the oil industry in searching for ever more reserves at a time when the world is trying to reduce its carbon output .
Jan-Peter Onstwedder , formerly BP 's most senior risk manager , calculates potential carbon emissions from proven oil , gas and coal reserves at 700bn tonnes , compared with about 500bn tonnes which can be emitted this century and keep temperature increases within less dangerous bounds .
" It prompts the questions : where does more exploration fit , do we already have all the reserves we possibly need ?
I do n't know whether they [ the oil industry ] thought their strategy through . "
Browne has kept a low profile since he left the company , but at a recent speech to the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi , he let fly , saying there was a need to " displace high - carbon options " in the choices that were made in future .
Browne said the way energy companies approached carbon in future would be a core issue for investors and it was only a matter of time before the world would see several carbon billionaires while renewable power " majors " would make it into the Fortune 500 .
" Carbon is coming and it will impose costs on conventional energy sources .
Energy businesses should not live in a state of denial , but work constructively with governments to ensure a smooth transition , " he said at the summit .
" The challenge is to reduce emissions against business - as - usual projections , which does not necessarily mean revolutionising existing energy infrastructure .
The key is to displace high - carbon options with low - carbon options in the choices we make from now onwards about new energy capacity , " he added .
It is unclear what Browne will make of the end of the beige suits , but he certainly does not sound ready to endorse the black oil sands .
The president of the Columbia College Libertarians , Mathieu Gordon , Class of 2008 , says that he has watched dozens of video clips featuring the antiwar Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul .
Gordon has so deeply absorbed Paul ’s message of non-intervention that he has decided not to contribute to Paul ’s campaign .
“ You do n’t really have the right to get involved in another country ’s politics , ” Gordon , who is British , said at a club meeting last week , after Paul ’s supporters raised four million dollars in a single day , surpassing Mitt Romney ’s record .
“ I suppose I should really support Hillary Clinton , because she ’ll impose loads of taxes and all the businesses will come to London . ”
It was fall break , and there were six libertarians in attendance , down from the usual ten .
All were men , and all had seen the movie “ V for Vendetta , ” in which the British holiday Guy Fawkes Day figures prominently .
Fawkes , a Catholic rebel who tried to assassinate King James I in 1605 , has become an unlikely inspiration for Ron Paul fans , who used the recent anniversary of Fawkes ’s failed attempt at terrorism to stage their one - day fund - raising blitz — a “ money bomb , ” according to the organizers ’
Web site , ThisNovember5th.com .
“ It gets quite confusing , ” Gordon said .
“ On a date that ’s meant to be anti the guy who ’s anti-Parliament , the idea here is to be giving money to someone who ’s anti-Parliament . ”
“ The important part is that it worked , ” Russell Whitaker , a junior and a biochemistry major , said .
Whitaker was wearing a black “ Ron Paul Revolution ” sweatshirt , and showed off his copy of Paul ’s book “ Freedom Under Siege : the U.S. Constitution after 200 - plus Years , ” which was signed by Paul in 1988 ( “ back when he had black hair ” ) and again last month , at a party on West Twenty - ninth Street .
On another night , the libertarians — who fancy themselves a kind of informal debating society — might have been discussing the gold standard and the Federal Reserve , or the differences between the Chicago and the Austrian schools of economics , but the primary topic of this meeting was , as a physics grad student who was wearing suspenders put it , “ Why is Ron Paul awesome ? ”
They compared notes on favorite YouTube videos : the Bill Maher interview , the dorm - room guy , the stripper girl ( “ Oh , yeah , everybody ’s seen her ” ) , the “ Morton Downey Jr. Show . ”
To help make the case for awesomeness , among the fellow - travellers cited were Dennis Kucinich , Ayn Rand , Howard Dean , Barry Goldwater , Eugene V. Debs , Ronald Reagan , Eugene McCarthy , and Robert A. Heinlein .
“ The thing about Ron Paul is , there is nothing spectacular about Ron Paul the man , ” Adam Sparks , a bearded senior , said .
“ He ’s the most boring little old man from Texas who has these laughs that make him look like a Muppet sometimes . ”
He added , “ I was completely politically apathetic before Ron Paul . ”
Sparks is the founder of a Facebook group , Columbians for Ron Paul .
“ I do n’t know why people ca n’t rally behind someone who actually does want to lower your taxes , ” he said .
Unlike most college students ,
Whitaker , who is forty - one , is a full - time wage earner , and therefore a real taxpayer .
He works as a software engineer at Google , in addition to his coursework .
“ I ’m a Navy veteran myself and I think that war sucks , ” he said .
He considers himself an anarcho - capitalist , although he recently registered as a Republican , so that he could cast a ballot — his first — for Paul in the New York primary next year .
“ It ’s a historical event in my life , but I did n’t really want to go and hang out with Republicans , ” Whitaker said .
“ They ’re a little bit too starched and old - boy network for me . ”
He has been known on occasion to socialize with Hillary Clinton supporters .
“ If Ron Paul does n’t win , the only way to solve this ever - increasing spiral of government involvement is to start a new nation and put even stricter checks and balances in place , ” Sparks said .
“ Except you ca n’t go west any farther , ” Gordon said .
“ NASA ’s starting a moon base in 2020 , ” Sparks said .
“ We can have a three - man country . ” ♦
Researchers at the University of Minnesota have grown a beating heart in a jar .
They used detergents to strip a rat heart of its own cells , leaving behind a white , three - dimensional scaffolding of connective tissue .
They then infused it with living cardiac cells from newborn rats , which multiplied and grew into a fully functional heart -- a first in the field of tissue engineering .
" We 've figured out how to use nature 's own matrix -- chambers , valves , blood vessels , " said Dr. Doris Taylor , the lead researcher and director of the university 's Center for Cardiovascular Repair .
She said that the technique holds promise for growing human tissue to repair not only hearts , but many other parts of the body .
It might be possible , she said , to grow whole organs for patients who need a transplant .
Other tissue engineering scientists around the country said there are enormous obstacles to using the technique for people .
But they described the work as exciting and a landmark .
" It 's gutsy .
I am very impressed with her going right for the meat of it ... and showing remarkable results , " said Dr. Buddy Ratner , a University of Washington bioengineer .
The research was published online Sunday by Nature Medicine , a journal known for publishing cutting - edge science .
Growing human tissue outside the body has been a medical Holy Grail for decades .
Progress accelerated in recent years with the use of stem cells , special cells in embryos and adults that can be manipulated to grow into many kinds of tissue .
The National Institutes of Health has provided millions of dollars for tissue engineering , but so far researchers have had success with only a few types of human tissue -- primarily bladders , skin , and blood vessels .
A challenging task
Though growing heart tissue holds the greatest therapeutic promise of all , it also has proven the most difficult .
The heart is a complex structure of chambers , valves , and thick - muscled walls fed by an intricate system of blood vessels .
And it does n't just contract ; it also twists , as if the muscle were wringing the blood out of the chambers and into the body .
Researchers have tried to grow cardiac patches in the lab to use for repairing damaged hearts .
But in order to work , tissue patches must be quite thick , and researchers have not found a way to provide the growing tissue with enough oxygen .
And the cells need a three - dimensional scaffold on which to grow , one that allows the cells to contract in the right way to do the mechanical work of a heart .
" Scaffolding is the challenge where we are doing most of our work , " said Ratner , who is trying to build an artificial structure with the same kind of material used for contact lenses .
Taylor said that one of the rules in her laboratory is " to give nature the tools and get out of the way . "
That 's how she and her co-researchers came up with the idea of adopting a strategy that 's been used elsewhere for smaller parts of the body .
They stripped a heart of its cells -- or de-cellularized it -- leaving behind what 's called the extracellular matrix .
" When you think about a steak , it 's the gristle , " she said .
It provides both the blood - vessel system to deliver oxygen and the three - dimensional structure .
The researchers placed it in a glass chamber and gave it oxygen , nutrients and fluids to pump .
" The cells know they are in a heart and that they should act like a heart , " she said .
She has done the same thing with a pig heart and believes it could also be done with kidneys , livers , and lungs .
Many healing possibilities
Some experts said that for transplantation , the technique could prove most useful for organs other than the heart .
" Long term , a transplant of the heart is not necessarily going to be the preferred therapy , " said Dr. Robert Nerem , director of the bioengineering institute at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Ga . " I think there may be more interest in repair of the heart . "

The object database lives somewhere under .git/ in each and every repository clone — nevermind where exactly .
The object database is garbage collected : the only way to delete an object is to remove all roots that point to it , and let the GC reclaim it .
Roots also live under .git / , but are distinct from the database .
Since content is immutable , there is no way to mutate anything in the database — you can only add new objects .
Now , there are four kinds of objects in the database .
Today we will cover just two of them — the lower level , if you will .
This is content at its most content - seeming :
Blobs are binary content .
They do n't contain any pointers .
Blobs are used to store file contents .
Not file names , etc — just contents .
If you have files x / foo.txt and y / bar.txt , which both contain just the string " foobar " , then in the object database there will be a blob that stores the string " foobar " — representing the content of both files .
Remember : content is identity .
Trees are lists of entries .
The entries represent other objects in the database : for each entry the tree stores the object type , the pointer / SHA1 for the object , the object name , and the mode ( the executable bit , really . )
A single tree object represents a single directory with its files and subdirectories ; in normal circumstances a tree willl only contain blob and tree entries .
Again , content is identity : if you have to two directories containing identically named files with identical contents and executable bits , both will be represented by the same tree object .
Consider directories and the file here : x/y/z.txt
We have :
Blob - object B z for the contents of z.txt .
for the contents of z.txt .
Tree - object T y for y/ , containing the name z.txt , and a pointer to B z .
for y/ , containing the name z.txt , and a pointer to .
Tree - object T x for x / , containing the name y , and a pointer to T y .
Now , if we change the contents of z.txt , and commit the new content to the object database — what happens to the object graph as a whole ?
Remember : Content is identity , and not just for blobs , but all objects .
If you change the contents of a file , you need a new tree object containing a pointer to the new blob , etc .
This is a really important bit , so make sure you understand this : any pointer into the object database is a unique identifier for the whole object graph reachable from that point .
So , you will have :
Blob - object B z2 for the new contents of z.txt .
for the new contents of z.txt .
Tree - object T y2 for y/ , containing the name z.txt , and a pointer to B z2 .
for y/ , containing the name z.txt , and a pointer to .
Tree - object T x2 for x / , containing the name y , and a pointer to T y2 .
The old versions are still there : content is immutable — as long as GC has n't reclaimed them , we can get at them .
Now , as long as you remember that a tree object represents the whole state of the whole directory structure under it , including file contents , you can forget about blobs .
Just think of trees , and you will be fine .
Review :
Why did the hacker cross the road ?
Where does Git store content ?
How are files and directories stored ?
Can you mutate stored content ; if so , how ; if not , why not ?
Can you deleted stored content ; if so , how ; if not , why not ?
What does a tree object represent ?
Next time : how history is content , and how it is stored .
Congress is back , and so is the fight over whether the nation 's telecommunication companies -- and the Bush administration - - will skate on the charges of spying on American citizens without a warrant .
If the Congress grants telcos the amnesty they and the administration are seeking , investigations on the scope of the illegal spying wo n't go forward , and we might never know the full extent of this administration 's illegal activity against American citizens .
As Markos notes his column in today 's The Hill , the Democrats have a choice of falling for GOP scare tactics one more time , or doing the right thing .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto gave us an idea of the kind of hyperbole we can expect when he warned , " We ’re exactly three weeks away from the date when terrorists can be free to make phone calls without fear of being surveilled by U.S. intelligence agencies . "
A terrific scare tactic , but dead wrong .
No one thinks U.S. intelligence agencies should be denied surveillance capabilities .
The sole issue is whether outlaw telecommunications companies should be given a pass on their illegal behavior .
And since President Bush has threatened to veto any FISA legislation without telco amnesty , it ’s clear that he ’s more concerned about Verizon ’s checkbook than he is about our nation ’s security .
Too bad Bush ’s love is unrequited .
Many FISA wiretaps were recently pulled by the supposedly heroic telcos because of the government ’s failure to pay its phone bills .
The news that the telcos pulled their wiretaps because the were n't getting paid reveals two truths : the telcos are n't great patriots doing their duty for national security -- they 're greedy and willing to break the law if they can boost the bottom line ; the Bush administration does n't care enough about national security to pay the freaking bill for it and is using this issue as yet another bludgeon to beat up on Democrats .
Too many times we 've seen the Dems capitulate at the mere threat of that bludgeon .
It does n't need to happen again , because that fear is baseless .
Consider this recently release poll commissioned by the ACLU , ( via Greenwald ) :
Majorities of voters on both sides of the political spectrum oppose key provisions in President Bush 's proposal to modify foreign surveillance laws that could ensnare Americans , according to a poll released Tuesday .
The survey shows nearly two - thirds of poll respondents say the government should be required to get an individual warrant before listening in on conversations between US citizens and people abroad .
Close to six in 10 people oppose an administration proposal to allow intelligence agencies to seek " blanket warrants " that would let them eavesdrop of foreigners for up to a year no additional judicial oversight required if the foreign suspect spoke to an American .
And a majority are against a plan to give legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping .
" Across the board , we find opposition to the administration 's FISA agenda , " pollster Mark Mellman said Tuesday .
Last month , we generated over half a million calls and e-mails to Senate offices in support of Senator Dodd 's filibuster of telco amnesty .
We need to double that number this week .
We need to tell our Senators that we stand with the majority of Americans in opposition to amnesty , and they should be more afraid of us voters than of a lame duck , failing president .
Particularly , those calls need to go to our presidential candidates .
Again , Greenwald has details :
The three leading recipients of telecom money for this election cycle are , unsurprisingly , the three sitting Senators running for President ( with two Democratic members who are key to amnesty -- Jay Rockefeller and Rahm Emanuel -- close behind ) .
That 's how " Washington works " -- the process they are all pledging to battle and change .
Needless to say , all of the viable GOP presidential candidates will be blindly supportive of whatever surveillance powers and lawbreaking immunity the President demands , but thus far , Obama and ( less emphatically )
Clinton have both claimed that they oppose such measures and thus pledged to support a Dodd - led filibuster .
Clinton and Obama have reiterated that opposition this week in response to Markos 's inquiries .
But the Senators need to do more than issue statements .
They need to take a break from their campaigns and spend a few days actually on the job that they currently have -- that means physically standing with Chris Dodd in support of his filibuster .
You can urge them to do that with this page set up by Working Assets .
Matt Browner - Hamlin has more on that campaign .
Call or e-mail the Presidential candidates .
Spend a few minutes of the time you would have spent squabbling about the campaign in some diary here on sending an e-mail , making a phone call .
Contact the Presidential candidates and call and e-mail your Senators .
Tell them to stand with the majority of the American people who demand accountability .
The most important word uttered in the Republican presidential primary has not been “ terrorism ” or “ taxes , ” not “ faith ” or “ family . ”
Rather , it was “ macaca . ”
Two years ago , conventional Beltway wisdom had Sen.
George Allen of Virginia easily winning reelection and becoming the presumptive front - runner for the 2008 GOP presidential nomination .
He had been embraced by the Republican business and fundraising establishment , as well as by the social and religious conservative voters who represent the strength of the party ’s grass roots .
But when he uttered what many considered to be an ethnic slur against an opponent ’s staffer , Allen ’s Senate reelection campaign began a downward spiral from which he never recovered .
Instead of touring Iowa and New Hampshire as a conquering hero , he returned to his home state as a private citizen , leaving a vacuum atop the GOP field that fundamentally shaped the race .
Unlike Democrats , who seem to enjoy the muddle of a free - for - all primary season every four years , we Republicans have generally been much more hierarchical as we choose our presidential standard - bearers .
Early in the campaign cycle , we identify the party ’s establishment candidate , shower him with money and endorsements , and anoint him as the likely nominee months before any primary .
It ’s a very efficient process : Seven of the last 10 GOP nominees have been elected president .
Advertisement
But Allen ’s premature departure from the field left us without a front - runner .
And unlike our friends across the aisle , we ’re not very good at chaos .
The result has been a string of candidates , each not entirely comfortable with either the party establishment or grass roots , each attempting to remake himself to fit the preferences of those two groups .
John McCain started out with the inside track to becoming the likely Republican nominee , followed in turn by Rudy Giuliani , Fred Thompson , Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee .
( Romney and McCain have had multiple shots at front - runner status , while the jury ’s still out on whether Giuliani will get another chance . )
Each of the five leading Republicans has stumbled at some point because of his efforts to position himself as someone other than what his biography would suggest .
If Allen had entered the race as the preferred candidate of both the party establishment and religious conservatives -- as George W. Bush did eight years ago -- the nature of the campaign would have been very different .
Romney would have run as the pragmatic problem - solver whose business experience allowed him to save the 2002 Winter Olympics and later govern Massachusetts by working with Democrats to reform the state ’s healthcare system .
Giuliani would have run as the solid centrist who combined inspirational leadership , strong anti-terrorism credentials and social moderation .
Both have instead struggled to convince religious conservatives of their purity on a range of cultural issues that have been incidental , to this point , in their political careers .
Huckabee would have long since retreated to the sidelines , and Thompson might very well have skipped the race altogether .
Most intriguing was the effect that Allen ’s absence had on McCain , who could have reprised his role as the reformer and outsider who tilted at Washington windmills in his 2000 campaign .
Instead , McCain attempted to run a gold - plated campaign designed to appeal to the Bush - Cheney donor base , an effort that resulted in his political near - death experience last summer .
Ironically , it was that meltdown that forced him to abandon his efforts to run an establishment - oriented campaign and return to the straight talk and populist strategy that have brought him back to the front of the pack in New Hampshire public opinion polls .
Advertisement
The temptation for all of these men to remake themselves is understandable :
It ’s been almost half a century since the Republican nominee was not selected by the party leadership .
But although the opening that presented itself was alluring , it ’s a political version of fool ’s gold .
Voters are smart enough to recognize artificiality when they see it , which is one of the primary factors for the comparative lack of enthusiasm among GOP partisans .
It ’s far too soon to tell whether McCain ’s decision to run as himself will gain him the nomination .
But if he is defeated , it ’s going to be at the hands of an opponent who will have made the same decision -- realizing that voters will always pick a leader who ’s comfortable in his own skin over someone who tries to fit into somebody else’s .

Charles Barkley appeared on The Situation Room to promote Barack Obama 's candidacy .
As you may remember , Barkley was a very vocal Republican not that many years ago .
Well , no more .
Barkley 's disgust with the Republican Party was so palpable that Wolf Blitzer could only flounder to try to make it a little less vitriolic .
BARKLEY : Hey , I live in Arizona .
I have got great respect for Senator McCain .
Great respect .
But I do n't like the way the Republicans are taking this country .
Every time I hear the word " conservative , " it makes me sick to my stomach , because they 're really just fake Christians , as I call them .
That 's all they are .
But I just -- I 'm going to vote Democratic no matter what . [..]
BLITZER : All right .
One quick point before I let you go .
You used the phrase " fake Christians " for conservatives .
Explain what you 're talking about .
BARKLEY : Well , I think they -- they want to be judge and jury .
Like , I 'm for gay marriage .
It 's none of my business if gay people want to get married .

And I think these Christians -- first of all , they 're supposed to be -- they 're not supposed to judge other people .
But they 're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in this country .
And it bugs the hell out of me .
They act like their Christians .

9/11 Firefighters and Family Members Plot Anti-Giuliani Ad Campaign Group weighs TV campaign to " take ... down " former N.Y. mayor 's 9/11 legend .
Nov. 17 , 2007  -- A group of 9/11 firefighters and victims ' family members with eyes on derailing Republican Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign is close to a decision on forming an entity that would run issue ads in key early nominating states .
" TV made him a hero , and we 'll use TV to take him down , " New York Fire Chief Jim Riches told ABC News .
The final decision about the formation of an outside entity will happen sometime within the next few weeks after the group finalizes its plans at a meeting scheduled for after Thanksgiving .
So far , though , under Riches ' leadership , the group has sought legal guidance and help from political consultants .
If the group decides to move forward , it would set up a 527 committee -- or something similar to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , which in 2004 helped sink Democratic Sen.
John Kerry 's White House bid .
This Monday , the firefighters and family members are holding a meeting at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire hoping to spread the word about what they say is Giuliani's " egregious " use of 9/11 for political gain .
The group also is considering additional trips to early presidential primary states Iowa , Florida and South Carolina .
Riches , who lost his firefighter son Jimmy in the World Trade Center 's north tower , said , " We do n't want him running on 9/11 or the bodies of all these dead people or my dead son saying that he did a great job that day . "
He and other members of the anti-Giuliani group claim 9/11 first responders were given bad radios and that that prevented them from hearing evacuation orders when the World Trade Center buildings were about to collapse .
They also contend Giuliani rushed cleanup work and misled people about air quality at Ground Zero , where recovery workers , including Riches , say they contracted illnesses .
Asked to comment for this story , the Giuliani campaign referred ABC News to a statement from Lee Ielpi , another firefighter whose son died on Sept. 11 .
" I understand the emotion surrounding Sept. 11 , but we cannot lose sight of the fact that it was the terrorists who attacked New York City , " the statement said .
" On that day and the days following , New Yorkers and the rest of the country were fortunate to have the steady and strong leadership of Mayor Rudy Giuliani . "
Like Ielpi , there are numerous firefighters and 9/11 family members who do n't agree with the criticism leveled against Giuliani for his handling of the terrorist attack .
They instead laud Giuliani for his leadership and resolve during the crisis .
The Giuliani campaign has a team of " First Responders for Rudy " across the country who vouch for the mayor .
Claims that Giuliani has exploited and misled people about his 9/11 record are not new .
A major union representing firefighters , The International Association of Fire Fighters ( IAFF ) , released a 13 - minute film this summer focusing on what it describes as " failures " by Giuliani before , during and after 9/11 .
Chief Riches was featured in the union 's video .
The IAFF has had ties to the Democratic Party .
It has endorsed Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd 's 2008 presidential campaign and supported Sen. Kerry in 2004 .
Comments Giuliani made back in August , in which he told reporters in Cincinnati that he was at Ground Zero " as often , if not more , than most of the workers , " infuriated some 9/11 recovery workers .
On that issue , Riches told ABC News Giuliani " was at Yankee Stadium more than he was down at Ground Zero . "
Giuliani later admitted he could have better articulated what he meant .
It is unclear what effect , if any , Riches and his group will have on the widely held perception that Giuliani is a hero of 9/11 .
But an issue ad campaign like the one they are contemplating would target what is believed to be one of Giuliani 's greatest strengths -- that he is a proven leader who is strong on national security .
As a 527 entity , the group would be able to raise millions dollars from both low - dollar and large donors , seemingly enough money to run numerous ads .
The criticism of Giuliani does n't seem to have changed his standing in the Republican presidential contest or his image overall .
He 's still widely admired by much of the country .
Despite holding liberal views on abortion , guns and gay rights , polls still show the former mayor atop the GOP presidential field .
FEBRUARY 7-- One of the ' Jena Six ' defendants was arrested yesterday for allegedly assaulting a fellow student at a Texas high school .
Bryant Purvis , 19 , was busted on the misdemeanor charge following an 8:30 AM altercation at Hebron High School in Carrollton , where his family relocated from Louisiana .
According to this arrest warrant affidavit , Purvis assaulted a male student he apparently suspected of vandalizing his auto .
Along with choking the 18 - year - old victim , the 6 ' 6 '
Purvis allegedly slammed the teenager 's head on a table .
Purvis , pictured in the mug shot at left , was briefly jailed before being released on $ 1000 bond .
Purvis and five codefendants were originally charged with attempted murder in connection with the December 2006 beating of a white high school student in Jena , Louisiana .
The case , which triggered protests over the severity of charges brought against the so - called Jena Six , remains pending , with Purvis scheduled for a March trial on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy .
If convicted of those felonies , Purvis could face a maximum of more than 20 years in prison .

Well not really , but still pretty freaking sweet .
I was at AltWheels last weekend and besides all the very cool hybrids , biofuel , bicycle , and electric cars there was a booth with this little gem .
Yes that is a Toyota Prius made to look like a star trek shuttle craft .
As you approached the vehicle you heard the familiar “ ping ping ping ” from the original series .
There were lights that flashed on the bottom of the craft , and ample decals to make it look more like the real thing .
The wonderful eco -trekker that made this also went so far as to program in touch pad enabled sounds ( really just an mp3 cd , but still cool ) .
You could press photon torpedoes , and Whoosh the familiar sound of a photon torpedo would echo throughout the cabin .
Take that you Klingon bastards !
Kirk is my co-pilot
Overall a very cool Prius mod .
I said to the guy who made it “ You must get all the chicks in this thing ” and he replied “ You bet I do , but they are all trekkers ” after a short pause “ but thats fine with me ” * giant grin on his face * .
Makes you wonder if perhaps the geeks will inherit the earth .
Romney turns back on patient who asks about medical marijuana
At a campaign stop in Dover , NH , Mitt Romney was asked about medical marijuana by Clayton Holton , who has muscular dystrophy .
" I have the support of five of my doctors saying I am living proof that medical marijuana works , " Holton told Romney .
Romney suggested he use synthetic marijuana instead , but Holton said , " I have tried it and it makes me throw up . "
He then asked , " Will you arrest me and my doctors if I get medical marijuana ? "
" I 'm not in favor of medical marijuana being legal , " Romney told Holton curtly , then deliberately turned his back on him to say " Hi , how are you " to other members of the audience .

Christopher Eslick , 61 , of Plymouth , Devon , pleaded guilty to the common assault outside his home at Halloween .
He had put a " no trick - or - treat " poster up and lashed out when the boy called .
Eslick was given a two - month prison sentence suspended for a year , ordered to do 80 hours of community service and told to pay the victim £ 150 .
The boy was one of a number of young people to have called at Eslick 's home despite the poster .
Eslick , of Charlotte Street , told police he was so fed up with Halloween callers that he lashed out when he saw the boy , who was wearing a horror mask .
The child was left shocked and with a cut lip .
Clenched fist
Plymouth Magistrates '
Court heard the attack was witnessed by police community support officers who were on duty in Morice Town to make sure trick - or - treaters did not cause trouble .
Miss Jenny Cater , prosecuting , said Eslick shouted and swore at the boy before hitting him in the face with his clenched fist .
She told the court the notice was behind the window glass and was poorly lit .
Eslick , who represented himself , said the notice was issued by the police and was easy to see and read .
" I feel there was an element of provocation but it is no excuse and I am distressed that I let my temper slip in this way , " he said .
Plymouth magistrate Paul Farmer told Eslick there was no excuse for his behaviour .
" You are old enough to know better , " he said .

" Huge New Diebold Disparities Found in Manchester , Ward 5 During NH Hand Counts "

Brad :
You posted your blog at 6:26 .
I was writing the following on the blog at Black Box Voting at the same time .
What I wrote follows .
I did do the math and percentages .
Something is fishy .
I do not know which precincts were hand counted and which were machine counted , so those that know may let us know .
In reviewing the results of the first days recount in Hampshire County I noticed something unusual .
In particular Manchester Ward 5 .
The recount confirmed the same count for all Democratic candidates other than Edwards , Clinton , Kucinich , Obama , and Richardson .
All of those candidates LOST votes .
The error rate percentages are very high , ranging from 9.3 % to 15.2 % .
The actual lost votes and error rates are : Edwards : minus 38 votes 14.9 %
Clinton : minus 64 votes 9.3 %
Kucinich : minus 3 votes 13.04 %
Obama : minus 39 votes 9.6 %
Richardson : minus 7 15.2 % Now if this is a handcounted precinct some may make the argument that this proves the inherent inaccuracy of hand - counted ballots .
I would counter that with this high of percentages of inaccurate counts there was either deliberate miscounting , or missing ballots .
I would want to compare the number of people that actually voted with the total of ballots involved in the recount .
If this was a Diebold AccuVote optical scan precinct then these percentages could be the result of several possibilities :
1. Someone ran the same ballots through the optical scanner more than once at the precint .
2 . The machines were miscalibrated or the ballots were marked with the wrong marking tool .
3 . The ballot definitions used to assign vote credits were defective , programmed incorrectly , or manipulated .
4 . There are missing ballots .
5 . The GEMS program did not tabulate or report the totals accurately .
The original total for the above 5 candidates was 1,411 .
In the recount there was a cumulative vote loss of 151 , an average error rate of 10.7 % .
Now if there were vote switching that would mean that the total of votes would remain the same , just the crediting of those votes would change .
In this case all the vote totals remained the same for the other candidates other than the five main ones .
If there was an error in the scanning , tabulating , or reporting it should have affected some of the smaller candidate 's numbers , which did not happen .
Many other precincts had errors both positive and negative , but none as large as Manchester Ward 5 .
What sticks out even more is the fact that the error is consistently negative for the candidates .

Not my strong suit and of course , the sample above is too small , but is it a bit consistent to have about a 10 % difference between the totals , almost 15 % with Edwards ?
You would expect more votes because of votes not counted by the machines , but less ?

Excuse me ?
" The continuing Democratic primary recount in New Hampshire has not found any voting problems . "
this is a patently false statement and is obviously an attempt to deceive New Hampshire citizen's .
One has to wonder whether there is editorial bias based on politics or simply lack of due diligence in investigating this story ( which would be a good example of lack of journalistic ethics ) .
Do n't you think the citizen's of New Hampshire deserve accuracy in the news presented them ?

Hello , Brad !
I know that you can only cover so many things , but how about a lead story on the Brad Blog on this !
An Open Letter to Senator John Edwards : The Constitution Prohibits Secret Vote Counting !
Will You Take Action ?
http://www.opednews.com/...an_open_letter_to_se.htm
Article II , § 1 of the Constitution of South Carolina states , “ the ballots shall not be counted in secret . ”
Computers count inside their case , with no oversight , just like they are told to do , unless of course , they malfunction or are hacked .
This is the election integrity jackpot , a Constitutional provision prohibiting counting votes in secret !
No more need to refer to case law , evidence , or logic to argue against secret vote counting , at least in South Carolina .
Senator Edwards , you have courageously spoken out against touch screen voting .
Will you take action to require South Carolina to follow the law ?
If Edwards takes action , I can hear JOHN STEWART on the DAILY SHOW saying , “ John Edwards has taken legal action to protect the Constitutional rights of Republicans .
You know , those guys whose leaders do n’t care about Constitutional rights ! ”
It would explode across America !

Based on the current NH recount results , Clinton , Obama , and Edwards all lost exactly 12 votes .
They gained a little in many towns and lost a bunch in Manchester Ward 5 , but all lost 12 votes after all .
Is n't this very suspicious ?
It looks like Richardson lost all his votes in Bedford .
Is this typo ?

I sent this to WMUR : " No voting problems ?
In District 5 in Manchester Diebold gave Clinton 683 votes when she only got 619 ballots cast for her .
There are similar problems with other candidates .
That 's not a problem ?
I used to have respect for the citizens of New Hampshire .
Missing a count by over sixty votes for one candidate in one district is pathetic .
So if that 's not a problem , I can imagine all the other stuff that you guys overlook .
I understand that if you use the wrong pen at a polling place you might lose hundreds of votes , like in Stratham .
But how does a machine count votes that were n't cast ?
Do n't you feel a little ashamed being responsible for reporting news and not even understanding what 's in front of you ? "

JOSH , are you a Clinton supporter ?

Is it only about who won or lost for you ?
How did 151 votes that were never cast get counted ?

Eh this is called pulling an Ohio , you get the same nubers in the end , but you give some counties less or more votes .
In OH they took votes away from urban counties an sub- burbs , and gave votes to the rurual counties .

I just had a thought , and I 'm going to throw it out here to see what anybody else thinks .
In another thread someone mentioned a Karl Rove / Dick Morris connection to this election fraud .
When I read that , what popped into my mind is that ... is there a possibility that our elections are being rigged for betting purposes ?
I think the reason this popped into my head is because Dick Morris has a proven track record of operating without integrity , and Karl Rove has a similar track record , except with an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence only .
They 're both very intelligent , on a level that people who get into high stakes gambling are , and I once heard of Rove mentioning somewhere where it got picked up as a low - key news item that he finds it interesting that he 's found a way to convince the far - right Christian demographic that the Republican Party is the party of the Jesus crowd , even though he does n't buy into the Christian thing at all .
I may be completely off - the - wall here , but there 's so much else about this EI issue that 's off - the - wall that it might fit in .

interesting to note in these scant numbers that both clinton and obama's ' loss ' from the handcount was just under 1 % , where edwards ' was 1.5 % .
would have to do more math than my brain cells can manage at this late hour to determine if this is a significant discrepancy or not , but i'm suspecting it is .
and so , not at all sure what to make of THAT .
more numbers will be important to see if this pattern holds up .
will keep watching .....

Check my math .... they each lose and gain votes in different places but so far Clinton , Edwards and Obama are all at - 12 votes .
Very weird and if richardson loses 2 more votes when bedford is finally posted he 'll be at - 12 as well .

Now I 'm no expert , but it still strikes me as patently wrong that somehow numbers are gained and lost across the board yet everything stays consistant ... is that supposed to be reassuring ?
it 's fine that there was so many errors cause the results came out the same ?
I dunno , to me it makes it seem all the more fixed .

Well , I plugged all of the numbers into excel , and I came up with this : Leading Candidates % Jan 8th % Recount
Clinton 42.6 % 42.8 %
Obama 34.3 % 34.4 %
Edwards 15.6 % 15.6 %
Kucinich 1.0 % 0.9 % total votes Jan 8th 42183
total votes Recount 42026
Difference - 157
% Difference - 0.003721878
I read somewhere that .002 % is government standard , so this is pretty darn close .
I am one of the people that is highly suspicious of how the primary turned out considering all of the polling that took place and the results , but that seems like it is pretty close considering .
Until I started to dig a bit deeper into the numbers .
Per this source :
http://electionarchive.o.../ucvData/NH/Primary2008/
I found that all of Hillsborough wards were Diebold Optical Scanned ...
Jan 8th Recount Change % Change
Amherst 2,930 2,923 - 7 - 0.0024
Bedford 4,059 3,874 - 185 - 0.0456
Brookline 936 962 26 0.0278
Hollis 1,923 1,927 4 0.0021

Manchester 5 1,466 1,312 - 154 - 0.1050

Manchester 7 1,601 1,609 8 0.0050
Manchester 8 2,056 2,067 11 0.0054
Manchester 9 1,883 1,884 1 0.0005
Manchester 10 1,831 1,848 17 0.0093

Nashua 4 1,331 1,334 3 0.0023
42,183 42,026 - 157
Two that stick out like sore thumbs are Bedford and Manchester 5 .
They are two of only 4 wards that lost votes ( a total 339 votes for those two wards alone ) ... the other 14 gained votes .
6 of the 18 wards met the .002 % federal standard and 8 of them had less than 10 votes change .
Every single ward had an error .
In the end , it is almost statistically insignificant when you look at the overall percentages .
But , that being said , all of this was done by a machine ( granted , humans feed the machines ) .
And , in the end , it took two candidates willing to pony up the cash to ensure the EVERY persons vote was counted ... some more than once apparently .
Other interesting bits : 1 . Every single candidate that received at least one vote in the primary was mis-counted and either gained or lost at least 1 vote .
2 . Every candidate that had more than 1000 votes lost votes in the recount .
3 . Every candidate with less than 1000 votes picked up votes in the recount , with the exception of .... wait for it ... Kucinich , Hunter , and Dodd .
4 . That means that the top 5 candidates lost votes in the recount ( Clinton , Obama , Edwards , Richardson , and Kucinich ) .
5 . The single largest glaring error was Richardson loosing 9.9 % of his votes , virtually all of them ( 184 ) in one single ward , Bedford .
WTF ?
How does that happen ?
So , I 'll leave it up to you to decided if this is enough to raise your shackles over .
I 'll wait until I see the whole state before getting too upset ...

Opps , I made on ommission , and wanted to make one clarification :
Leading Candidates Jan 8th Recount
Clinton 42.6 % 42.8 %
Obama 34.3 % 34.4 %
Edwards 15.6 % 15.6 %
Richardson 4.5 % 4.1 %
Kucinich 1.0 % 0.9 %
I forgot Richardson ... Sorry Gov .
Also , I forgot to add that even thought there was a 157 net loss in votes , that there were 581 mis-cast votes ... which works out to .0138 % , well above the .002 % ( if that is indeed the federal standard ) .
Either way , that is a lot of people that either do n't exist , or did n't have their vote count .

Keep trusting recount numbers put up by convicted felons with ties to the criminal 1 % ers in office who cheated to win in 2000 and 2004 .
Their inaccurate riggable electronic computer totals were counted and then stored in secrecy by diebold .
Keep wearing a fcking question mark on yer forhead Americans .
Keep allowing this to be the status quo for an American election let alone the presidential and enjoy the treason .
Pre-empted wars , questionable policies favoring the corporate 1 % and your loss of rights as American citizens was to fcking easy to get away with .
Brought to you by the someone who knows that " white " alqueda terrorists who got away with taking out Federal World Trade Tower building # 7 ON 9/11 IN 7 SECONDS without the help of any airplanes or arabs 10 1/2 hours after the other 2 Federal World Trade Towers fell are still running this country .
To be clear , the bush / cheney terrorists responsible are still is office .
I command thee to impeach , and remove President Bush and Vice President Cheney from office stripping them of all their Executive powers immediately .
They can take their Alberto Gonzalez defensive strategy to a world court hearing their case to try and explain away their despicable 7 yr anti-environmental agenda to destroy our land and planet in the name of greed , obvious treasonous activies against the American people , and the numberous high crimes and misdemeanors offenses they will prosecuted for .
Findings will be : Consecutive life sentences for the bush / cheney administration and their accomplices who retired early to spend more time with their families .
Abolish electronic computer voting machines and an election process that allows votes to be counted in secrecy without transparency .

Alright , last one .

I forgot to convert the percentages of mis-cast votes per precinct to actual percentages .
The correct list : Hillsborough Jan 8 Recount Change % Change
Amherst 2,930 2,923 - 7 - 0.24 %
Bedford 4,059 3,874 - 185 - 4.56 %

Manchester 2 2,068 2,073 5 0.24 %
Manchester 3 1,277 1,285 8 0.63 %
Manchester 4 1,567 1,578 11 0.70 %
Manchester 5 1,466 1,312 - 154 - 10.50 %
Manchester 6 2,012 1,989 - 23 - 1.14 %
Manchester 7 1,601 1,609 8 0.50 %
Manchester 8 2,056 2,067 11 0.54 %

Nashua 4 1,331 1,334 3 0.23 %
42,183 42,026 - 157
Lastly , I took some extra time and ( and code ) and figured out that actually , 698 votes have been miscast ( the 581 just summed up the differences in each district rather than counting each vote change between the primary and the recount for each candidate and in each ward ) .
My bad .
Better now .
Incidentally , 698 mis-cast votes is 1.66 % , which would have finished in 5th place , behind Richardson and ahead of Kucinich in Hillsborough County .
Sorry about the errors ...

Please post the link to the Union Leader election night results which apparently got Manchester Ward 5 more correct .
Ward 5
Clinton - 615 ( 619 )
Obama - 362 ( 365 )
Edwards - 215 ( 217 )
In this case , I 'm willing to be there was a problem with whoever entered the Ward 5 sheet into the database at SOS ?

It looks like this was correct on election night as those numbers look about what you would expect with the hand count finding one or two extra .

Hopefully the local folks in WMUR - TV ville USA agree with me .
Your headline should be changed
from : " Recount Finds No Voting Problems So Far . " to :
WMUR -TV Recount Finds No Voting Problems with a more than 50 point change !?
Why lie to the people ?
No voting problems ?
Are you freaking kidding me no voting problems ?
What was the source for that information , admit it really you just make it up out of thin air , that 's not journalism , that 's not news that 's pure lies and propaganda .
The simple fact that there is even ONE vote off is serious problem .
Everyone in corporate media is touting these crappy electronic voting machines as some kind of perfect thing .
They have failed over and over time again and again .
This is n't some kind of joke .
This is National Security .
People can die because of these decisions .
You better get schooled on what journalism is .
You might try here : New Hampshire
Bedford Community Television
Concord Community Television
Conway Valley Vision Community Television
Durham Community Access Television DCAT -22

Merrimack Community Television Channels MGTV - 23 and METV - 24 and MPTV - 25

If all you care about profits , and deceiving your local public , you do n't serve the public interest and do n't deserve a license to broadcast .
Now even the most mentally disabled among us could easily point to : http://www.sos.nh.gov/recountresults.htm
And see for some of the results are off by more that fifty !
50 points man !?
WMUR -TV Recount Finds No Voting Problems with a more than 50 point change !?
Wow man , your headline just got worse .
I just pointed some data to you , you know where the frigging page is not , so your journalists can get on the ball and correct your lying propaganda webpage :
http://www.wmur.com/news/15078710/detail.html
Stop pretending to be the news media .
http://www.wmur.com/news/
And you also talk about rumors from voting groups .
I say your the one making up the rumors .
After all you should just say who your sources are .
And if your talking about arresting Garner maybe you should send one of your journalists into your own public law library with a couple big gulps and some coffee to read your own laws on why that might have been so .
Could it be he was breaking his own laws ?
( that really was n't meant as a question ) Garner should not be trusted .
Voting is not based on trust .
I do n't care if you have Jesus of Nazareth working as your Secretary of State , even he should not be trusted .
That 's why theres something called public oversight , but WMUR has lost that concept due to it 's desire for corporate profits , it no longer serves the public interest .
And really if that 's the way you want it to stay , then there really is no reason for WMUR to even have a frequency allocated to it by the FCC , since they are public airwaves , and your promising to be in the public interest , yet time and time again you are not serving the public interest .
If you really were serving the public interest you would be
telling everyone to 1 . Outlaw electronic vote tabulation devices .
2. Maintain an unbroken chain of custody .
3. Create harsh penalties for tampering .
4 . Roll back measures , propositions , and elected officials who are sworn in if the vote is later shown that they are not the winner .
5. Deactivate the electoral collage .
6 . Only use electronics to print paper ballots for the disabled .
7 . If someone breaks their oath of office after being elected - drop , reject or nullify it .
8 . Allow equal time on all channels for all candidates .
9 . Remove corporate financing of elections .
But you do not serve the public interest .
You do not deserve a license for your station .
I am going to let people know ( right now ) to come into your station and have at your Public File because you do not serve their interest .
Sure you might have an email contact , and you might be able to re-edit your webpage , but you can't change what 's in your public file when you go for a license renewal .
Got ya there .
Have a nice day now .
( For others that have n't sent them a message , I can say without a doubt it feels good to really let them have a piece of your mind .
It 's too bad I do n't actually live there , I would visit their public books every day . )

It 's so easy !
You summon a randomly picked jury from among the voters who go to each polling station .
The participants are forced to serve just like court juries .
They are chosen from a large , pre-qualified pool three days before the election .
They count the vote and run everything , with no interference from " Secretary of State " characters .
They are legally required to stay home from work the next day , but are well compensated by the election system .
Give the money and the time off to the people instead of the hackers !
There are no machines , the juries just hand count the ballots on the night of the election .
Then they publish and announce the results ( at each individual polling station ) prior to handing them up to tabulation pools .
They are all required to take home a complete record of their local results .
There would some few errors , but not systematic errors .
Even if some juries were biased , other juries would be biased in other directions , so any biases would canceled .
Recounts are useless because the chain of custody of the secret ballots is such a weak link .
The results taken home by all the jurors would certainly be expected to agree , anyway .
See , then we would n't have the worries , would we ?
Does anyone here want to keep the super - complicated electronic lightning rods for election fraud ?
Really ?
Why ?

As a result , all major candidates lost votes .
Kucinich lost three in the ward and has a total of 20 votes there .
Hillary Clinton lost 64 with a new total of 619 ; John Edwards lost 38 and has 217 votes ; Barack Obama lost 39 and has 365 , and Bill Richardson lost seven , leaving him 39 .

Brad :
Here is a message I sent to WMUR :
" I have been following the New Hampshire recount story very closely .
I noticed that the SOS Gardner told you that the hand count so far has not found any voting problems .
There is , however , information that conflicts with his statement .
Or , I suppose it would be a matter of what degree of accuracy we are to accept when casting and counting votes .
If you look at Manchester , I believe in ward 5 , you will see that almost all the candidates gain votes with the hand count .
More important , we should really be concerned about not only the chain of custody of the paper ballots , as the count began some 8 or 9 days after the machine count - but also the question of securing the memory cards from the machines for close inspection by experts .
There are reports that LHS employees had access to some of the machines , and thus the cards , DURING the lection .
Why is this allowed ?
And of course , one point that has often been overlooked in the press coverage of this recount is the idea that we outsource our elections to private companies .
Thank you for your time . "

when the recount occurred , the totals changed because those vice presidential votes were not presidential votes .
so , they had to come off .
it was human error .

Fine , if the recount provides us with the answers to our questions ( which already it looks like it wo n't ) , then we have to look at these people doing the polls and exit polls .
The first step is to check out the vote count .
Kucinich is right .

There .
How 's that .
The Union Leader has an article about it .
Look , the AP numbers for Ward 5 were insanely different from the SOS numbers .
That set off red flags , but I assumed it was one extra machine added in .
In fact , the AP numbers from election night are correct ( available at Union Leader for Manchester by precinct ) .
The SOS office or Manchester town clerk merged the VP and Pres votes somehow .

Clinton volunteers and local lawyers acting on behalf of the campaign demanded in Nashua , Concord and at least one other town that poll moderators ban the Obama volunteers from the polls , saying that their presence violated a state law stating that only the state party chairmen can delegate people to monitor the polls .

You know tell me the protocol .
Ken Hajjar :
Well in that case , first of all in this case that did n’t happen .
None of the machines failed .
If a machine were to fail either on election day or in any other circumstance it would be merely a matter of removing the memory card , there ’s a little card that keeps track of the votes , bring a new machine over , put the memory card in the new machine , when you turn it on the new machine picks up right where the old machine stopped .

Simply , Diabold would not be inserting ' vote grabbing ' code that would subtly shift votes the wrong way , as appears to be the case , because they would know they'd get caught , every single time .
Only in close elections are recounts asked for , and that bothers me the most .
Having a scan , THEN fully transparent hand count would mean we'd have known this almost immediately .
Within 24 hours of a vote .
Sure , more places would have to hire a lot more people , but elections are worth it .
A day in Iraq 's cost would pay for it .
This also means almost no more court cases , or denied recount requests .
Vaotes counted twice by trusted hand and a machine that 'd protect against ' ballot box stuffing ' that hand count opponents would try to say is a risk , and again , since they'd get caught every time , if Diabold wants the business , they 've have no choice but to make secure machines with no GOP code in them .
That 's the best way to beat the corporate elite turning tricks / votes for the GOP , as only profit has more say in their activity .
Along with a push for publically financed elections , no lobbying allowed in D.C. if money / gifts are involved , and no Electoral College .
A two count , one universal voting system is a movement we need to start .
Who better to do that than you Brad ?
Spread the word .

I too took a look at the recount results so far and wanted to draw attention to Republican recount in Litchfield and the 12th Ward in Manchester .
It looks like there were no votes casted at all for the Republican candidates in the original count , but apparently they found some ... or can we not trust the original counts ??

Re : Comment # 32 :
Please post the link to the Union Leader election night results which apparently got Manchester Ward 5 more correct .
Ward 5
Clinton - 615 ( 619 )
Obama - 362 ( 365 )
Edwards - 215 ( 217 )
That is VERY interesting , but deepens the mystery of Ward 5 rather than fixing it .
This shows that the results for Ward 5 originally posted on election night ( as reported in the newspaper ) correspond to the recount totals .
However , the official reported vote tally that Brad reports at the top of this thread is not just something typed into the recount report , it is the OFFICIAL tally from the primary .
Someone added a lot of votes between the time the polls closed and when the votes were reported to the NH SOS .

NONE [ # 45 ] says " the AP numbers from election night are correct ( available at Union Leader for Manchester by precinct ) .
The SOS office or Manchester town clerk merged the VP and Pres votes somehow .
NOT a big Diebold problem . "
A discrepancy between the UNOFFICIAL AP numbers and the OFFICIAL NH Sec. of State numbers is a reason enough for a recount : this was a substantial error that is now explained , and will not happen in the general election thanks to this investigation .
Who cares if it is human error , machine error , and / or fraud ?!
The point is to uncover problems and fix them .
This is a vindication of the recount process , not somehow an argument against it .
Duh .

You should never forget that the " people of New Hampshire " that are involved in the electoral process have only one goal : GET IT OVER WITH FAST AND GET OUT ALIVE .
They absolutely do n't care about the integrity of the electoral process or anything else .
They just want it OVER WITH .
These are people who would say and do ANYTHING to avoid any serious discussion of how totally incompetent and corrupt their process is .
If you want to cut them slack and pretend they are " doing the best they can , " please remember that they certified and allowed a company to count our ballots who had FELONS working for them .
They certified and accepted the counts of systems that are TEN TIMES above the federally accepted margins of error .
They allowed the paper ballots of their fellow citizens and the electronic records of their counting to be handled like TRASH and handed to just about anybody , rather than following RULES AND REGULATIONS ALREADY IN PLACE .
They played the game like THEY DIDN " T CARE THAT THERE WERE RULES , BUT just " get it done and move on , it 's not that important to follow the rules . "
They DO NOT CARE .
They have cashed the checks , and by election day , the state has made all the money they are going to make from being " the first in the nation . "
They want all the media and everybody else to move on for another 3 years and 9 months .
So , to Paul , I would only say : " SCREW YOU ! "
This is my democracy , whether I am in New Hampshire or not , and your state has thrown it on the dump heap .
Your state primary should be moved to LAST IN THE NATION on June 1st , and then your position in the Secretary of State 's office would be worth about as much as dog catcher of Truth or Consequences , New Mexico , and the only thing New Hampshire would be good for is skiing when you can't get into Vermont and can't afford Utah .

I 'm not finding any specifications as to how ballots are to be transported , other than they are " forwarded " to the SOS for recounts .
That is very problematic .
There is specification for the condition of the containers when depositing in the town or city hall .
" The clerk or his designee shall , without breaking the seals or ' otherwise changing the condition of the containers , '... "
I fail to see why this " condition of containers " clause would not apply to ballot containers in transit .
That some containers arrived with slits cut in them would seem in violation of this clause .
The NH SOS seems to lack a lot of curiosity about what 's happening to election evidence in NH .

The moderator , or his designee , and the selectmen , or their designee , after they have sealed and certified the state election ballots as provided in RSA 659:95 and 96 shall deliver the sealed containers to the town or city clerk , or to his designee , who shall in their presence enter in the appropriate place on each sealer the time of day and shall sign his name in the appropriate blank on the sealer .

Some followup comments and additional observations after reading the comments above :
I am not making any accusations , especially not against either the poll workers of Ward 5 or of Bedford , nor any voters who trusted their election officials .
I am simply pointing out that the numbers and explanations do not add up .
1 . In Bedford and Ward 5 ALL other candidates ' vote totals , other than the top five , remained exactly the same .
If the VP choices had been mistakenly added why were they not added to those other candidates too .
2 . The poll workers ( or " vote counters " as one person stated ) did not count the votes , nor have the ability to mistakenly add on the VP choices .
The votes were recorded by Diebold scanners and downloaded to memory cards .
The poll workers should have printed out a vote totals report from each optical scanner , signed the paper , and submitted that along with the memory card to election headquarters .
3 . The election headquarters for Hillsborough County would have then downloaded the memory cards into their central server containing the Diebold Global Election Management System ( GEMS ) which would then tabulate and issue a vote totals report for the county .
Those would be the numbers that the Union Leader newspaper would have reported that night .
Those numbers are rather close to the recount for all five candidates :
Newspaper ............ Recount
Clinton 615 ............... 619
Obama 362 ................ 365
Edwards 215 ............... 217
Richardson 38 ............... 39
Kucinich 20 ................ 20 Notice that the recount added votes to all except to Kucinich .
For an additional 10 votes over what was originally reported .
While the top five candidates ALL lost votes from the SoS 's reported totals .
The Diebold GEMS program has an export feature for reporting the results from the county to the SoS 's office .
I am not sure if Hillsborough County used that feature or chose to call in the totals ( which I doubt ) .
That means the added - on votes probably occurred within GEMS ( no poll worker error ) , or at the state level .
If it was a " glitch " in the GEMS tabulation system I would question why did the large " glitch " only occur for Bedford and Manchester Ward 5 .
If the programming problem affected only those two precincts , why did it not affect all the other candidates in those same precincts ?
I would assume that the reports that the Union Leader used were generated from the GEMS program , and were relatively accurate .
That means the added votes must have occurred at the state level , or between the time the totals were reported to the local press and sent in to the state .
If the additional votes were mistakenly added at the state level , why was the same error repeated five times , and not at all for the smaller candidate totals ?
The same question would be appropriate addressed to the local election headquarters .
Why were these major errors confined to just two precincts out of fifty ?
Some may say that the error rate was small .
But if extrapolated over an entire state , especialy a larger state , such errors can be critical .
More importantly , the recount is showing that the optical scanners do make errors .
That fact alone justifies at the minimum random audits to detect such errors .
This was a pretty simple election .
What if it had been a ballot with local races and initiatives which many times are determined by very slim margins .
Even the Presidential race in New Mexico was determined by just a few hundred votes .
Some have pointed out that after the entire county was recounted the vote totals had an average net gain of 12 .
That means that excluding Manchester Ward 5's negative 151 votes , the other precincts had to add a large number of previous counting errors .
It was commented that people from other states should stay out of New Hampshire 's elections .
I would state that all of us are affected by what occurs in these early primary states .
Candidates drop out of the race leaving other states ' citizens fewer choices .
Candidates are excluded from future debates based upon their showing in a particular primary election .
What happens in New Hampshire affects us all .
More importantly , examining what happened in New Hampshire shows the inherent problem with electronic recording , tabulating , and reporting of votes .
It also demonstrates that any secret handling of our votes needs to be audited at each stage .
We cannot and should not just trust the election officials , nor the electronic voting systems they trust .
The poll books , memory cards , printed out vote totals from each optical scanner , audit and event logs and reports for the recounted counties should be forensically exmained to determine what went wrong .
Until that is scientifically determined we cannot trust the current system .
First election officials must admit there is a problem , determine the cause of the problem , before they correct the problem .
Denials by election officials , or the media , of any problems only increases our mistrust in our elections .

So far , the real issue has not even been dealt with .
Although Brad correctly has an issue with the Diebold machines , I always thought that a recount meant a " recount of all ballots " .
Suspiciously , so far only polls that used Diebold machines have been reported .
How can you compare machine vote inaccuracy rates without some sort of standard inaccuracy rate in hand counting .
Secondly , it seems that it would be a good idea to test all the machines used to determine if the errors were machine , machine - operator , card - operator , or a ballot error .
You cannot fix something if you cannot identify where and why it fails .
Certainly it is already evident that the error rate across diebold precincts appears to be acceptable ( except of course for Manchester 5 ) .
Finally , I do n't know how they do it in New Hampshire , but in Canada the precinct captain pre-signs the back of every ballot ( to keep track of the numbers ) , and the desk - jockeys have to fill out count sheets , which altogether monitors the numbers used and unused but available .
This allows a precinct and the system to verify counts so that the miscount in Manchester 5 would be seen very quickly .
Secondly , it would allow for the determination of any funkiness occuring after the count cards have left the polling place .

Why is it that citizens have more knowledge than the reporters on the story ?

I am not American , Australian actually , but have followed this with some interest here in South America .
My three comments both concern this Vice President voting error .
1 . How is it possible that there is not a reconciliation between the results and the actual number of people who voted , which would have flagged this and other possible errors or fraud days ago .
It seems it should be a requirement of any election .
2 . Contrary to what has been posted I am figuring this would indeed make a difference to results , as lower profile candidates would have received a higher percentage of the vote .
Dennis K might , as was pointed out , not have changed his number of votes , but his percentage ( and others , Paul , Guiliani etc ) would I gather have been higher .
After all percentages are what CNN etc make the biggest deal about , and although these candidates don´t win , under double figure results versus over make a big ongoing difference ( for example Guiliani´s dive ) .
3 . Now that the count has be found to be flawed ( counting Vice Presidential votes as Presidential ones is a significant incompetent thing to have done , should not the organizers now pay the cost and refund monies .
Thinking it was important , probably fascinating or even possibly Watergate - ish , I actually tried to donate to the recount but it was after the 2 PM freeze , so was unable to do so , so this is not in any self interest .

I do n't know why Dennis chose to do the recount in New Hampshire .
Maybe he figured " the earlier the better , " maybe the laws were best there , maybe the costs were best , maybe the fact that it was only DieBold COUNTING mechanisms that we MIGHT be able to catch some of the fraud of , rather than DieBOld VOTING mechanism , where the fraud would be built - in and almost uncatchable ( yea , right , like those " paper voter trails " can't be faked up right along with the count ) , who knows .
Point is , N.H. is where the front lines ARE for the moment , until they move somewhere else .
Personally , I blame Christime Gregouire in Washington for not having a MASSIVE investigation after her ultra-close race in which THOUSANDS of votes were stolen for her opponent in Squahomish County by electronic means ( extensive documentation online ) .
As a Dem , and the WINNER , and an ex-Prosecuter , she could have started a massive invesigation across the whole state to " assure the voters of Washington that their votes were correctly accounted for , " and possibly have found and proven DieBold , Sequoia and / or ES&S corruption and fraud in 2004 , when there would still have been time to make some corrections .
But no , she took her close win and settled in and sold out Democracy .
Meanwhile , the battle is in N.H. until it is not there any more .
My thanks to those camera - wielding patriots who are fighting for our American Republic in the small , cold towns of the granite state .

Actually , he should be held responsible for lack of enforcement or potentially aiding and abetting because at this point , even if the cards are retrieved there is no way to insure they have n't been altered .
If you have a law like this on the books , and NH does , then one ought to be holding those cards if needed as evidence )
( The following amendment to RSA 659:42 will take effect January 1 , 2007 )
RSA 659:42 Tampering with Voting Machines .
Whoever shall tamper with or injure or attempt to injure any voting machine or device for the computerized casting and counting of ballots to be used or being used in an election or whoever shall prevent or attempt to prevent the correct operation of such machine or device or [ [ [ whoever shall tamper with software used in the casting or counting of ballots [ or design such software so as to cause incorrect tabulation of the ballots ] ] ] ] or any unauthorized person who shall make or have in his or her possession a key to a voting machine to be used or being used in an election shall be guilty of a class B felony if a natural person or guilty of a felony if any other person .
As for documentation at polling sites , NH law seems to provide for such : 659:56
659:57
659:62
659:59
659:71
659:77 I am not saying the software was tampered with or designed to cause incorrect tabulation - I 'm saying that because of the horrendous break down in the chain of custody , there would be no way to know for sure .

One thing we might have to consider , and I know this will be unpopular , is the role of the press , polls , and exit polls in the history of our elections .
I have the book " VoteScam . "
The authors make a good case that when VNS did all the exit polling for all the networks - it seemed like some sketchy business was going on .
They are also however , as far as I know , the first to warn against electronic voting .
It looks like Bush # 1 might have pulled an electronic votescam in NH in ' 88 . ( disclaimer : these opinion do not represent the opinions of bradblog.com . )
They also bring up interesting observations about a power stuggle between the media ( Katherine Grahmn of WaPo ) and the Nixon people .

Here in Canada we count our " paper ballots " twice .
The first count is called the " preliminary results " .
When all the ballots are counted for one polling station , the results are submitted electronically ( I thought it was by phone so will have to find out what they mean by " electronically submitted " ) to Elections Canada .
A week or so is spent verifying the results
In each riding , the totals for every polling stations are checked and added up once more , before being submitted to Elections Canada ; these are known as the " verified results . "
In our 2006 Federal Election , approximately 15 million voted ) and we had the results within four hours .
I do realise we do n't have all the choices that you have to make so it 's difficult to guess how long it would take to count in the US .

The judge makes the recount from the statements contained in the ballot boxes , or recounts some or all of the ballots returned by the deputy returning officers .
If the candidates still have the same number of votes after the recount , a by - election will be held for that electoral district .
At least with paper ballots you can SEE the mistake .

We did , thanks to the skillful driving of Susan Pynchon .
There was a dark green SUV waiting for them in a rural location .
They stopped , one of the transport team jumped out , went to the driver of the green SUV , said something , then the transport team headed one direction and the green SUV the other .
Clearly , he had been waiting there to hook up with the transport team .

Brad it bothers me that you buy into the hype .
This counntry does not have a Democracy , and never has .
What we are supposed to have is a Deocratically elected Republic .
Our founding fathers went to great pains to develope this , The Great Experiment , because none of them believed a Democracy could work .
Please read the Federalist Papers .
The Federalist Papers are a group of Essays published in New York Newspapers between the years of 1787 and 1788 written by Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay to better explain their intent with the Constitution to the public .
These short Essays explain specifically what our Founding Father meant and what their fears were without any spin .
The Diebold voting machines are a problem , but they are just an example of what happens when everyone loses sight of what we are fighting for .
Our founding Fathers warned us about this in Federalist Paper # 4 except John Jay used a different referance , but it can be applied to this .
A Democracy is the rule by majority , and a Republic is rule by law .
We are supposed to Democratically elect people to protect and create laws , period .
That is what your election is .
Today we elect people who make us feel warm and fuzzy .
That is why I have very little faith in the future of this experiment .
Plato ( 423-348 BC ) said a Democracy could never work .
He said men would come to power based on their looks and family instead of thier skill .
He said that roughly 2,407 years ago .
All of our Founding Father studied Plato prior to constructing this government .
Plato 's word are especially true today in the TV age .

I have read credible testimonies of similar incidents mostly on a much smaller scale in the last 7 years , investigated and verified , sometimes even witnessed by human rights organizations .
It is certainly in keeping with Israeli practices in the occupied territories .
However , I will wait for more reports before I put this one in the " truth " column .
Certainly Gaza is a concentration camp of sorts , and all over the occupied territories malnutrition is at high levels as is " food insecurity " ( a measure of people skipping meals , that is , going hungry ) .
The occupied Palestinian territories are one of the few areas throughout the Middle East where many lack sufficient water to drink , cook and wash with , entirely due to Israeli policies .
Gaza is n't like what the Nazis ran .
They are n't running death factories ( possibly they 've made some experiments of technology on human beings
http://www.vtjp.org/report/Timeline.htm,
http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=1056...
But then , every story of oppression and ethnic cleansing is different - and honestly , Israel is trying accomplish its ethnic cleansing without the world paying attention .
Large - scale massacres might bring more of such unwanted attention .
No one knows how many civilians were murdered at Sabra&Chatila ( see , for example , http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article47...
but it 's certain that the Lebanese Phalangists ( fascists ) who did most of the slaughter were armed and assisted by the Israeli army , headed by Ariel Sharon had a clear sight of the camps while it was going on .
I find most curious people who deny that Palestine existed .
Good grief , it 's the place the crusaders invaded - the place is even mentioned in the Balfour declaration .
But it kind of turns my stomach when people celebrate massacres , like the fellow who calls slaughtering however many thousands of helpless women , children and men at Sabra and Shatila a great victory .

" The fact that I worked at the store at ( the time of the robbery ) is coincidental .
If I had went over to the book store on my break and they were being ripped off , I would have helped them . "
- fired worker John Schultz
• • •
" The fact that he touched him , period , is means for termination , "
-
Kate Klotz , Whole Foods spokeswoman .
BY DAVE GERSHMAN
The Ann Arbor News
John Schultz says he lost his job at Whole Foods Market in Ann Arbor after he tried to stop a shoplifter from making a getaway .
But the company says he went too far and violated a policy that prohibits employees from physically touching a customer - even if that person is carrying a bag of stolen goods .
Schultz says he had just punched out for a break at 7 p.m. on Sunday when he heard a commotion at the front door of the store , 3135 Washtenaw Ave .
He said he came to the aid of the manager who yelled for help in stopping a shoplifter .
Schultz , the manager and another employee cornered the shoplifter between two cars in the parking lot .
Schultz said he told the shoplifter he was making a citizens arrest and to wait for the police to arrive , but the shoplifter broke away from the group and ran across Washtenaw Avenue and toward a gas station at the corner of Huron Parkway .
Before the man could cross Huron Parkway , Schultz caught up and grabbed the man 's jacket and put his leg behind the man 's legs .
When the manager arrived at the intersection , Schultz said , the manager told him to release the shoplifter , and he complied , and the shoplifter got away .
Schultz said he was called to the store 's office the next day , on Christmas Eve , and was fired because he violated a company policy prohibiting employees from having any physical contact with a customer .
Kate Klotz , a company spokesperson , said the policy is clear and listed in a booklet that all employees have to acknowledge that they received before they can start work .
" The fact that he touched him , period , is means for termination , " said Klotz .
Schultz said he acted as a private citizen on property that is n't owned by Whole Foods , but Klotz said where the incident happened does n't change the policy .
" He is still considered an employee of Whole Foods Market regardless of where he was and what was happening , " she said .
The police report of the incident does n't mention Schultz 's involvement .
It says police responded to the call of retail fraud at 7:09 p.m. and could not locate the shoplifter .
The thief was described as a thin white male , 5 - foot - 10 , in his mid-20s , wearing a black jacket , tan pants and carrying a backpack .
The report says store employees were suspicious when the man walked into the store and they watched as he filled up a basket and then took it into a bathroom .
When he came out , his basket was empty , but his backpack looked full .
Then he filled up a canvas store tote bag with groceries , and walked out the door .
The manager and the other employee told police they caught up to the shoplifter at the corner of Washtenaw and Huron Parkway .
It says one of them grabbed the tote bag away from the shoplifter , and the suspect walked away .
The bag contained $ 346 worth of food and other products .
Schultz , 35 , of Ypsilanti Township , had worked at the store for five years , most recently as a fishmonger .
He wants his job back .
" The fact that I worked at the store at ( the time of the robbery ) is coincidental , " he said .
" If I had went over to the book store on my break and they were being ripped off , I would have helped them . "

Last May , the web sites of a number of high - ranking Estonian politicians and businesses were attacked over a period of several weeks .
At the time , relations between Russia and Estonia were chillier than usual , due in part to the Estonian government 's plans to move a World War II - era memorial known as the Bronze Soldier ( pictured below at its original location ) away from the center of the city and into a cemetery .
The country 's plan was controversial , and led to protests that were often led by the country 's ethnic Russian minority .
When the cyberattacks occurred , Estonia claimed that Russia was either directly or indirectly involved — an allegation that the Russian government denied .
Almost a year later , the Russian government appears to have been telling the truth about its involvement ( or lack thereof ) in the attacks against Estonia .
As InfoWorld reports , an Estonian youth has been arrested for the attacks , and current evidence suggests he was acting independently — prosecutors in Estonia have stated they have no other suspects .
Because the attacks were botnet - driven and launched from servers all over the globe , however , it 's impossible to state definitively that only a single individual was involved .
Dmitri Galushkevich , a 20 - year - old Estonian student , launched the DoS ( denial - of - service ) attacks from his own PC last year .
Although he 's a native Estonian , Galushkevich was angry over his government 's plans to move the statue , and launched the attack as a means of protesting the decision .
The fact that a single angry student was able to impact international relations between two countries is an startling development .
Understanding why Estonia and Russia got into a tiff about a war memorial statue in the first place , however , requires that we take a trip down history lane .
American history tends to focus its coverage of World War II on the theaters of combat we participated in .
This makes logical sense — but it leaves the story of the eastern front largely untold , and does n't begin to explain why the Russians would be upset over Estonia 's movement of a statue nearly 63 years after the war 's end — or why the Estonians would want to move it in the first place .
The Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1940 as part of the 1939 German - Soviet Nonaggression Pact .
Once it held the country ( Russia , to this day , insists the USSR was invited into Estonia and did not " occupy " it ) , extraordinary elections were held with the ballots restricted to pro-Communist choices .
The country became a member of the USSR in August 1940 — and was promptly invaded and occupied by the Germans in 1941 when that country opened the Eastern Front of the war .
Germany 's eastern front with the USSR was both the longest and the deadliest in worldwide military history .
Contemporary estimates on how many Soviet soldiers and civilians died can vary widely , but the median figures suggest that the Red Army lost approximately 10 million men , with an additional 20 million civilian casualties .
Soviet casualties and losses dwarfed those of any other nation , and the conflict left an indelible imprint on Russian society .
The war memorials built in Soviet - occupied territories after the war ended were n't just monuments to the millions of soldiers and civilians killed in the conflict — they were Soviet ideological bulwarks and physical representations of what the Great Patriotic War had cost the motherland .
The majority of Estonians , however , have a different view .
To them , the Bronze Soldier was a symbol of 50 years of Soviet and communist oppression — many Estonians , in fact , voluntarily enlisted and fought with the Germans in 1944 once it became apparent that the Soviets were about to reoccupy the country .
Combine the two viewpoints with a significant minority of ethnic Russians who still identify with the memorial as a reminder of Soviet sacrifice , and you 've got a pile of tinder just waiting for a spark .
The fact that a single student was able to trigger such events is particularly ominous when you consider just how many potential flashpoints exist between various countries all over the world .
The DoS attack against Estonia is an excellent example of how a cyberattack carried out by a 20 - year - old student in response to real - life events further exacerbated an existing problem between two nations .

Continuing with my Adga programming practice .
This time I am implementing the example in another section of Why Dependent Types Matter by Altenkirch , McBride , and McKinna in Agda : proving that mergesort returns an ordered list .
> module Main where > open import Prelude > open import Data .
Nat hiding ( _≤_ ) > open import Data .
List
Order
To begin with , a term of type m ≤ n is a proof that a natural number m is at most n :
> data _≤_ : Nat -> Nat ->
Set where > le0 : {n : Nat} -> zero ≤ n > le1 : {m n : Nat} -> m ≤ n -> ( 1 + m ) ≤ ( 1 + n )
An auxiliary function weaken , which I will need later , weakens a proof of ( 1+m ) ≤ n to a proof of m ≤ n :
> weaken : {y x : Nat} -> ( 1 + y ) ≤ x -> y ≤ x > weaken ( le1 le0 ) = le0 > weaken ( le1 ( le1 p ) ) = le1 ( weaken ( le1 p ) )
Given two natural numbers m and n , the function order , to be defined later , determines their order by returning a proof .
The proof has to be wrapped in a datatype Order :
> data Order : Nat -> Nat ->
Set where > leq : {m n : Nat} -> m ≤ n ->
Order m n > gt : {m n : Nat} -> ( 1 + n ) ≤ m ->
Order m n
Agda does not provide a generic case expression , so I have to define my own for Order :
> caseord : {m n : Nat} {a : Set} -> Order m n > -> ( ( m ≤ n ) -> a ) -> ( ( ( 1 + n ) ≤ m ) -> a ) -> a > caseord ( leq p ) f g = f p > caseord ( gt p ) f g = g p
The function order can thus be defined by :
> order : ( m : Nat ) -> ( n : Nat ) ->
Order m n > order zero n = leq le0 > order ( suc m ) zero = gt ( le1 le0 ) > order ( suc m ) ( suc n ) = > caseord ( order m n ) ( leq ∘ le1 ) ( gt ∘ le1 )
Ordered List
There are many ways one can express the property that a list is sorted .
The choice depends on what one needs for the proof .
To prove that merge sorts the list , Altenkirch , McBride , and McKinna suggests the following “ external bound ” representation of sortedness :
> data OList : Nat ->
Set where >
Nil : {b : Nat} ->
OList b > Cons : {b : Nat} -> ( x : Nat ) -> ( b ≤ x ) -> OList x ->
OList b
The datatype OList b represents a sorted list of natural numbers whose elements are all greater than or equal to the bound b .
The bound , however , is supplied externally and need not be precise .
Every sorted list of natural numbers has type OList 0 , for instance .
The Cons constructor demands that the newly added element x is bounded by the externally supplied bound b , and that the tail can be bounded by x .
Merging Sorted Lists
With OList , merge can be verified very easily :
> merge : {b : Nat} -> OList b -> OList b ->
OList b > merge
Nil ys = ys > merge xs Nil = xs > merge ( Cons x blex xs ) ( Cons y bley ys ) = > caseord ( order x y ) > ( \\ xley ->
Cons x blex ( merge {x} xs ( Cons y xley ys ) ) ) > ( \\ pylex ->
Cons y bley ( merge {y} ( Cons x ( weaken pylex ) xs ) ys ) )
Note , for example , that Cons y bley ys : OList b is updated to Cons y xley ys : OList x simply by using a different proof .
Mergesort
The rest are just some routine code : dealing elements to a tree , and perform successive merging by a fold on the tree .
Mergesort is defined by mergeT ∘ dealT .
The code below is similar to that in my previous blog entry , but without the size constraint .
なんか頼まれたし書いておくか。結論から言えば、迷って benchmark をとって、騙されていたら世話無いという。

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Britain's Prince Andrew on Wednesday defended comments he made suggesting the United States might have been better off had its leaders learned from the British experience with colonialism before invading Iraq .
Prince Andrew says he has accepted that his comments could be interpreted as controversial .
" The fact is that we have learned , sometimes at our expense , in the years when we were a colonial power , " he told CNN .
" So there may or may not have been things and ideas that were of valid use to what was going on at that particular time . "
The 47 - year - old prince , in Atlanta on a 10 - day U.S. tour to promote British business , said the two countries are closely allied .
" We 've been allies , for goodness ' sake , for how long ? " he said .
Watch him discuss his new role »
" We are now working very much more closely together than we have over the centuries , apart from when we were very , very close during the second World War . "
The Duke of York cited U.S. - British anti-terrorism efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as an area where the two countries are working together to promote stability and change .
Do n't Miss Prince : U.S. ignored UK over Iraq
The New York Times last week quoted the prince as saying there are " occasions when people in the U.K. would wish that those in responsible positions in the U.S. might listen and learn from our experiences . "
He added , " If you are looking at colonialism , if you are looking at operations on an international scale , if you are looking at understanding each other 's culture , understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign -- we have been through them all . "
The problems faced by U.S. war planners in Iraq have bred " healthy skepticism " toward what comes out of Washington , he told the newspaper .
In his CNN interview Wednesday , Andrew said he did not consider those comments controversial when he made them , but has since accepted how they could be interpreted that way .
Still , the Falklands War veteran who served 22 years in the Royal Navy added , " You have to take the bashes with the good bits , and I 've got a thick skin . "
Asked whether he believes the situation in Iraq is improving , Andrew said he could not answer what he described as " almost a university Ph.D. question . "
" I do n't think I can possibly predict those sorts of ways that governments work to each other , " he said .
" I 'm only a small cog in a very , very large machine . "
The main purpose of his visit is to promote business investment in Britain , he said .
Of the approximately 1,000 investment projects that were begun last year in Britain , more than half came from the United States , resulting in the addition of more than 32,000 jobs , he said .
" Now I realize that what keeps us all going is international commerce , it 's global trade , " he said .
" In some cases , politics keeps a lot of people thinking , but what actually makes the world go round is the commerce that goes on . "

All About Prince Andrew
" Killer Escapes from Psych Hospital with Survival Gear , " read the headline in our local newspaper .
I prefer my local news to focus on Little League scores and the status of library construction .
I read on .
" A manhunt is underway for William Enman , a dangerous escapee from Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Winslow , Camden County ( NJ ) , with authorities concerned he could return to Morris County where he killed a father and his 4 - year - old son in 1974 . "
Enman was found yesterday -- well , he returned to the hospital grounds himself .
So much for the great escape .
But this episode got me thinking about prison breaks .
In our third annual ' 10 ' issue , Jim Noles wrote a terrific piece recounting some of the more memorable ones .
Here are five of them .
1. Ghasr Prison , Tehran , Iran
On December 28 , 1978 , the Iranian government arrested Paul Chiapparone and Bill Gaylord , two executives of Texas - based Electronic Data Systems Corp. , who were working overseas at the time .
The Iranians accused EDS of trumped - up bribery charges and threw the two men into Tehran 's notorious Ghasr Prison .
Despite American concern for Chiapparone and Gaylord , the Iranian revolution against the Shah grew more and more chaotic , and the United States government seemed powerless to free them .
Enter EDS founder ( and sometimes presidential candidate ) , H. Ross Perot .
Taking matters into his own hands , Perot contacted retired Army Colonel Arthur " Bull " 
Simons , a Special Forces hero who had led a raid on the Son Tay POW camp during the Vietnam War , and asked him to rescue his two employees .
Refusing payment for his services , Simons took a volunteer team of seven civilian EDS employees to Tehran , where they set about plotting a rescue .
But before they could spring into action , Iranian revolutionaries stormed the prison .
Hundreds of prisoners fled in the confusion , including Chiapparone and Gaylord .
Shortly thereafter , they linked up with their would - be rescuers at Tehran 's Hyatt Hotel and then escaped overland to Turkey with the aid of an Iranian EDS employee .
Inspired by the unbelievable rescue , best - selling thriller writer Ken Follett took his first turn at nonfiction , penning On Wings of Eagles and proving that truth can , in fact , be stranger than fiction .
2. States Model School , Pretoria , Natal
This particular escape joins the ranks of history 's greatest not because of elaborate planning or daring breakaways .
Instead , its infamy is solidified by what might have later happened on the future stage of world history had it not occurred .
On November 15 , 1899 , Boer fighters in the colony of Natal ( now part of South Africa ) ambushed a British armored train , and , in the ensuing firefight , captured a British war correspondent for the Morning Post .
To their delight , the new captive was the brave ( some would say foolhardy ) and adventurous son of a British lord — a catch with a great deal of leveraging power .
But nearly a month later on December 12 , the Boers ' prize escaped the school in which he was imprisoned .
Despite a price on his head , the plucky escapee successfully stowed away onboard a train , slipped to safety into Portuguese East Africa ( now Mozambique ) , and made international headlines .
Within a year , the former prisoner of the Boers had returned to England and embarked on a political career that landed him a seat in Parliament .
It also eventually got him a spot at 10 Downing Street , where he served as prime minister of Britain during World War II .
His name , of course , was Winston Churchill .
3. Yakutsk , Siberia
When Joseph Stalin's Red Army joined in Hitler 's attack on Poland in 1939 , the Russians bagged thousands of Polish soldiers as prisoners .
Stalin promptly ordered hundreds of these men executed , while dispatching the rest to his brutal gulag labor camps in Siberia .
Among those imprisoned was cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz .
While in Siberia , the resourceful Rawicz befriended the camp commissar 's wife , and with her help , he and six other prisoners managed to escape during a blinding snowstorm .
A journey of epic proportions followed .
A Polish teenage girl who had escaped her own camp joined Rawicz 's band , and the ragtag group skirted Lake Baikal , slipped over into Mongolia , traversed the Gobi Desert , and crossed the Himalayas .
After a journey of 4,000 miles , the Polish officer and his four fellow survivors staggered into British - controlled India , finally free .
Amazingly , the irrepressible Rawicz soon returned to Europe to again battle the Germans .
Rawicz 's memoir , The Long Walk , continues to sell well , even though his amazing story has its doubters ( some of whom point out its similarity to the Rudyard Kipling story " The Man Who Was "  ) .
4. Libby Prison , Richmond , Virginia
During the American Civil War , the Confederate government turned Richmond 's three - storied Libby & Son Ship Chandlers & Grocers warehouse into what became known as Libby Prison .
Not long thereafter , they crammed some 1,200 Union officers into it , many of whom , not surprisingly , spent their stays planning an escape .
But of all the break - out attempts at Libby , the most successful ( and most elaborate ) was masterminded by Colonel Thomas E. Rose .
Using makeshift tools , he and a few fellow inmates tunneled down through a chimney , out of the prison 's rat - infested cellar , underneath a vacant lot , and up into a shed some 50 feet away .
Confident in his secretive route , the colonel returned to the prison on February 9 , 1864 , and led 15 other prisoners through the narrow tunnel and out into Richmond 's unsuspecting streets .
Encouraged by Rose 's success , 93 other prisoners quickly squirmed their way to freedom .
Of those , an impressive 59 eventually returned to Union lines , making it the largest prison escape of the war .
Although two officers drowned in the attempt , and the rest were recaptured , the Confederates could n't help being impressed by their enemy 's feat .
The Richmond Examiner praised Rose 's " scientific tunnel "  and declared his breakout to be an " extraordinary escapade . " 
5. Alcatraz , San Francisco , California
Over the course of Alcatraz 's three decades of operation as a federal prison in San Francisco Bay , it earned a fearsome reputation as America 's escape - proof prison .
But that did n't deter the dozens of inmates who attempted to flee " The Rock . " 
Officially , none of these men succeeded , and at least seven died trying .
But if any did pull it off , they were Frank Morris , John Anglin , and John 's brother Clarence .
With the assistance of fellow inmate Allen West , the three men worked for months to carefully enlarge the vent holes in their cells to clear a way to the prison 's roof .
On June 11 , 1962 , after leaving carefully crafted dummy heads in their beds to fool prowling guards , they slipped out of their cells and , under the cover of darkness , reached the island 's rocky shore .
Relying on rafts made of their prison raincoats , Morris and the Anglin brothers entered the cold waters of San Francisco Bay to paddle for the mainland .
The following morning , Alcatraz guards discovered their absence and a massive manhunt ensued .
But the three convicts were never re-captured .
Although the FBI eventually concluded that they must have drowned , their bodies were never recovered .
The resulting " what if "  scenarios spawned the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz and , less directly , the annual Escape from Alcatraz triathlon in San Francisco .
In the aftermath of the 1962 " escape "  event , the federal government closed down Alcatraz the following year .

A few months back I read Scott Machella 's story , via BoingBoing 's post , about cleaning a computer keyboard by putting it in the dishwasher .
From the little bit I know about electronics , it rang true to me but I did n't feel compelled to actually try it .
At least , not at first .
The thing about a dirty keyboard is that it 's only dirty if you notice it .
I 'm a touch - typer , so I rarely look down .
But once the aforementioned articles caused me to examine my own keyboards , I was sorry that I looked .
Yuck .
Clearly , I had to do something about it .
Scott wrote about how he let his keyboard dry out for 5 days , and given my own impatient nature , I thought it best to wait until I was going to be out of town before giving it a try .
But I decided to go whole - hog and wash both my beloved Matias Tactile Pro Keyboard and my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard at the same time .
( My Apple Bluetooth Keyboard is the original , white plastic model .
Not the current slim metallic work of art . )
The Tactile Pro's USB cable can't be removed , so I wrapped it up tightly with a twist - tie .
For the Apple keyboard , I removed the batteries and left the battery door cover off .
I decided not to remove the keycaps on either of them , having done that in the distant past ( while replacing the keyboard springs on my Atari ST ) and found it to be too nerve wracking and tedious .
But on the whole I followed Scott 's process .
The hardest part was figuring out how to turn off the drying cycle and suppress the rinse - chemical additive on my dishwasher .
After the washing was over , I shook out as much water as I could , then propped - up the keyboards so they 'd drain .
( See the photo .
The other item pictured is an extension cord that I also washed ; it was impulse add - on . )
Both keyboards dripped like crazy for a long time , but by the next morning there was only a slight fog of moisture visible inside the clear parts of the Apple keyboard .
I resisted all temptation to plug them in , and then left town for 7 days .
Upon my return , both keyboards were completely dry , of course .
They were also sparkling - clean and — the moment you 're waiting for — functioned perfectly .
Hurray !
A time - efficient and effective path to cleanliness .
What a great feeling .
Hey , this mouse looks a little dirty too …

John Kerry , was named on Wednesday as the most memorable quote of 2007 .
REUTERS / Steve Marcus
Fred R. Shapiro , the editor of the Yale Book of Quotations , said the plea made by University of Florida student Andrew Meyer on September 17 , accompanied by Meyer ’s screams as he was tased , beat out the racial slur that cost shock jock Don Imus his job and the Iranian president ’s declaration that his country does not have homosexuals .
Shapiro said Meyer ’s quote was a symbol of pop culture success .
Within two days it was one of the most popular phrases on Google and one of the most viewed videos .
It also showed up on ringtones and T - shirts .
Second on Shapiro ’s list was this tortuous answer by Lauren Upton , the South Carolina contestant in the Miss Teen America contest in August :
“ I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation do n’t have maps and I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and Iraq and everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for us . ”
Upton had been asked why one - fifth of Americans are unable to locate the United States on a map and later apologized for her answer not making a lot of sense .
Third was Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s October comment at Columbia University in New York , “ In Iran we do n’t have homosexuals like in your country . ”
Shock jock Don Imus comments about the Rutgers University women ’s basketball team : “ That ’s some nappy - headed hos there , ” was fourth .
Imus created a national outcry and lost his job at CBS radio in April , but returned to the airwaves in December with Citadel Broadcasting .
Other phrases on the list :
5. “ I do n’t recall . ” -- Former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’ repeated response to questioning at a congressional hearing about the firing of U.S. attorneys .
6 . “ There ’s only three things he ( Republican presidential candidate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ) mentions in a sentence : a noun and a verb and 9/11 . ” -- Sen. Joseph Biden , speaking at a Democratic presidential debate .
7 . “ I ’m not going to get into a name - calling match with somebody ( Vice President Dick Cheney ) who has a 9 percent approval rating . ” -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Democrat .
8. “ ( I have ) a wide stance when going to the bathroom . ” -- Idaho Republican Sen. Larry Craig ’s explanation of why his foot touched that of an undercover policeman in a men ’s room .
9 . “ I mean , you got the first mainstream African - American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy .
I mean , that ’s a storybook , man . ” -- Biden describing rival Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
10 . “ I think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world , this administration has been the worst in history . ” -- Former President Jimmy Carter in an interview in the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette newspaper .

As part of a Public Accounts Committee session on BBC procurement last Tuesday , the director - general was grilled by Liberal Democrat John Pugh MP on the decision to release the download version of the iPlayer for Windows and Internet Explorer only .
The move has prompted anger from Mac , Linux and Firefox users .
Thompson claimed the Christmas day marketing launch of the service had been a great success .
" All the feedback we 've had is that consumers are enormously enjoying using iPlayer .
About a million people in this country have tried it already . "
Pugh followed up the meeting with a letter to Thompson on Wednesday .
He wrote : " By guaranteeing full functionality to the products of one software vendor [ the BBC ] is as a public body handing a commercial advantage to that company - effectively illegal state aid !
" What might be a pragmatic choice for a privately funded company becomes deeply problematic for a public corporation . "
Pugh is the MP for Southport and takes particular interest in IT issues , especially around public sector procurement and interoperability .
The Open Source Consortium , a lobby group for Linux , has vowed to pursue its illegal state aid complaints in European Court if the BBC does not release the iPlayer application for other operating systems and browsers soon .
Thompson erred under Pugh 's questioning over the current level of interoperability offered by the iPlayer desktop application .
He was asked : " At what stange will you be able to download and stream to a Mac or a Linux computer ? "
" You can do that now , " Thompson replied .
He later recanted the statement , conceding that only streams are currently available on non-Windows computers .
" We will get those [ downloads ] as soon as possible , " he said , noting the two - year deadline set by the BBC Trust .
" I recognise and welcome the assurances that the BBC and you personally have given on this subject but wonder whether the sheer novelty of the new media has blinded many to the clear commercial inequity in the delivery of it , " Pugh replied in his letter .
He argued that the plan to release Mac and Linux versions within two years is not " sufficient excuse for past sins or indeed much of an explanation " .
In previous public statements , the BBC has insisted that desktop versions for Mac and Linux were not developed because it could not provide the Digital Rights Management demanded by TV production companies .
In a statement on Friday , the BBC said it will respond to Pugh 's letter in due course .
" We would like to underline our commitment to universal access to BBC iPlayer , as with all other BBC services , which BBC director - general Mark Thompson reiterated to the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday , " it added .
Video of the session is available here ( relevant passage begins at 12 minutes 15 seconds ) .

A man who used his mobile phone to film a violent clash between villagers and officials in rural China was beaten to death by public order " enforcers " , Chinese state media reported yesterday , bringing more unwanted attention to the country 's unruly hinterlands .
The People 's Daily reported that 24 residents of Tianmen , a city in central China 's Hubei province , have been detained after Wei Wenhua , the general manager of a company owned by the local water resources bureau , was pulled out of his car and savagely beaten .
Wei was driving through the area when he stopped to film the protests , which were triggered by a decision to build a rubbish tip close to a residential area .
It was not clear whether he stopped on impulse or deliberately set out to record the clashes , in which villagers faced about 50 local officials and enforcers known as chengguan .
But when it became clear what he was doing , the chengguan turned on him .
He tried to flee but was beaten for 10 minutes , witnesses said .
Among those being questioned by police is a senior government official , the state news agency Xinhua said .
Witnesses also revealed that at least five other people were taken to hospital when the chengguan tried to put an end to an ugly confrontation that began at new year after the authorities reneged on a promise to shut down a rubbish tip built close to a residential area .
Normally hired by local authorities to enforce relocation orders , crack down on " antisocial " behaviour and disperse crowds , the role of the chengguan has aroused concern about the power and accountability of Chinese officialdom .
One indignant contributor to a local online discussion group said that they were " inhuman " and " out of control " .
Another , worried that the news will be suppressed by government censors , urged fellow internet users to spread the message as far as they could .

EUROPE'S LAST COMMUNE BRACES FOR BATTLE
There is something different in the air at Christiania these days the usual spicy aroma of marijuana smoke now occasionally mixes with the smell of tear gas and burning tires .
That 's because , more than three decades after Europe 's oldest and largest commune was established as an antidote to " selfish society , " Danish authorities are moving to close it down .
More than 90 people were arrested a few weeks ago after groups of youths fought running battles with police , throwing bottles and cobblestones and burning homemade barricades .
The riot , a rare occurrence in this normally placid Scandinavian country , was prompted by police arriving to demolish a shelter deemed unsafe by the authorities .
" There is a radicalization between young people and police in Copenhagen that we have n't seen in years , " says Henrik Bang , professor of politics at the University of Copenhagen .
" And the conflict will get worse . "
Since 1971 the commune 's 800 residents , inspired by the ideals of peace and free love , have maintained a free - wheeling idyll in this former navy base  an overgrown woodland spotted with lakes and pretty redbrick and wood houses that provides a retreat for artists , musicians and free - thinkers of all stripes in a self - declared " free state " that flies its own flag and does not pay market property tax rates .
But Christiania sits on prime real estate in Copenhagen 's upmarket Christenhaven neighbourhood , and Denmark 's conservative government wants to reclaim the territory for an ambitious housing project .
" I think ordinary Danish people just think it 's a little odd , " explained Bang .
" People are living in houses worth $ 5 million , the land has big recreational possibilities  so why should they be allowed to govern [ themselves ] outside Danish society ? "
Traditionally , the commune 's friction with local police has been over drug policy .
Pusher Street , Christiania 's ramshackle main thoroughfare , allowed cannabis dealers to display their wares in glass - topped cabinets , graded according to strength  until a police incursion in 2003 .
Still , the authorities claim , some $ 200,000 of marijuana is still bought and sold every day in Christiania , and critics charge that the commune long ago sold out its ideals .
" The original idealism has long since evaporated , " says Jens Sorensen , a Copenhagen - based political consultant .
" Christiania is now home to an ' alternative ' elite . "
Still , the old hippie idealism still shapes many of the rules that govern the commune : Selling property is not allowed , and instead of cars  also banned  residents use bicycles to ferry everything from groceries to children .
At the day care center set on the shore of the commune 's wooded lake , minder Richard Lonsdale has just put on a movie for children after finishing school classes .
" I 've been here for five years and it 's changed a hell of a lot , " he says .
" There 's been a general hardening of attitudes [ from the police ]  they think we 're the enemy , but we do n't teach our kids that . "
As well as the kindergarten , Christiania also boasts a health clinic , a book shop , a vegan restaurant and a concert venue , which gets transformed into an impromptu dining hall once a year when residents organize a Christmas party for the city 's homeless .
But the clashes with the authorities has brought about changes in the attitudes of a traditionally tolerant Danish society .
The current conservative government , for example , rules in coalition with the openly anti-immigrant Danish People 's Party .
In response , a new political party  dubbed the New Alliance  was set up in May , electing its leader , Syrian - born Nasser Khader , as the country 's first - ever member of parliament from the 8 % of the population whose origins are foreign .
And , in the seven weeks since the Christiania riots , the New Alliance has become Denmark 's third largest party , boasting 20,000 members and polling 15 percent of the popular vote .
" Danish society used to a be a consensus society , " says Khader .
" But in the last few years Danish politicians [ have ] forgotten the centre .
We want to go back to the middle of the road . "
But even a New Alliance surge in elections expected later this year could be too late for the communards of Christiania .
As they make the most of the long summer evening on a recent Tuesday , the conversation among the gardeners , painters and barbecue chefs can quickly turn tense .
" The government is taking the temperature of how it 's going to be when they clear the whole place out " , says Marco Malcopes , the 25 - year old manager of the commune 's Info Cafe .
" If that 's their intention we showed them what will happen  we have to defend the places we live in . "

It 's a nostalgic smell .
Solder .
Back in a sniff to the 10 - year - old me - watching my dad " mend things " .
Some have wires and oscilloscopes attached .
It 's electronic open heart surgery .
Almost as soon as Steven Murdoch and Saar Drimer start talking , the image in my mind 's eye , is of a similar room , perhaps a bit better equipped .
Similar figures hunched over similar desks .
Not these two Cambridge researchers though , but the bad guys .
They 're just as bright , similarly educated , about the same age - but on the other side .
We have seen no evidence from the Cambridge academic paper of anything we did not know
Visa statement
They 're all trying to do the same thing - find the weak spots in the systems we use to carry out our financial lives , ever more hi-tech - ever more online .
The Cambridge team 's approach is academic , and they do n't have so much money to tackle each problem .
But they know the other guys do .
They 've seen photographs of desks just like theirs - in court - where they act as expert witnesses in a legal system struggling to keep up with ever more inventive forms of plastic card fraud .
They 've seen at first hand that once the bad guys have decided to lie , they have so much more power to bribe their way to the equipment - the spare dummy and live terminals they need - to work out how to beat the system .
Steven and Saar have to be smarter to find the weak spots , yet stay inside the law .
The Cambridge team is not best mates with the banking industry .
In the UK , the people that run the banks do n't much like to admit that their systems are anything but infallible .
Jane Badger faced charges after disputing withdrawals
Chip and PIN was supposed to help protect us all from card fraud .
But Steven and Saar have found a number of ways that the criminally - minded could crack it - and extract your account number and PIN and all the details needed to create a cloned card .
Take that card abroad to countries where cash machines read only the magnetic strip on a card , key in the PIN - and criminals can have a field day getting cash out of your account .
And that 's a pattern in recent card fraud cases .
Transactions have been taking place on cards in countries as far flung as Canada , Australia , Malaysia , the Philippines and India .
We at Newsnight hooked up with the Cambridge duo as they honed their latest " attack " on a PIN terminal , their most simple to date .
This was on a machine popular with UK retailers - the Ingenico i3300 .
But it was only theoretical .
We provided the Cambridge duo with a real merchants ' terminal to see if it would work away from the lab bench - and it did .
The pair was able to read off the account number and the PIN from a real credit card as it communicated with the Chip and PIN machine in a trial transaction .
Nightmare for customers
So what about the people who've had phantom cash withdrawals on their accounts , only to be told by their banks that they must have left their PINs lying around somewhere or given them to someone .
Or worse - been part of the fraud themselves .
We spoke to Jane Badger , who earlier this month was acquitted by a judge who saw it her way and not her bank's .
She 'd spotted cash withdrawals on her Egg credit card account she did n't recognise , and disputed them .
She was accused of lying and found herself facing charges .
Her life changed - she was suspended from her police force job and spent close to a year fighting her case .
She asked Professor Ross Anderson who heads up the Cambridge team , to be her expert witness .
The case collapsed and Egg now says it was the police , not them , who decided to pursue her case and that she failed to send them vital paper work .
The importance of the Cambridge team 's work is that if the machines are not totally secure , then perhaps more customers with experiences like that of Jane Badger are telling the truth .
The banks need to take responsibility
Professor Ross Anderson
At the very least , the onus is shifted to the banks to come up with the evidence to show that these people are lying , and it's not their own Chip and PIN systems that are at fault .
Professor Ross Anderson told us : " The attacks that we 've shown have demonstrated that it 's easy to get the PIN as well as the card data out of chip and PIN terminal - and this means that simply holding your hand over the terminal is no good , in other words the customer cannot defend himself or herself no matter how astute and careful they are - therefore surely the banks need to take responsibility . "
So whose job is it to make sure that Chip and PIN is tougher to crack ?
The Ingenico terminal that the Cambridge team tapped appears to be approved by both the Visa certification scheme and under the so - called Common Criteria scheme maintained , bizarrely , by part of GCHQ ( Government Communication Headquarters ) .
The Cambridge team contacted Visa last November , and were available this week to clarify any questions they had .
But Visa told us they could not comment further without seeing footage of the attack .
' Liability engineering '
In a statement Visa said : " We have seen no evidence from the Cambridge academic paper of anything we did not know or anything that presents a real - world threat to card security . "
Ingenico told Newsnight : " The method identified by the Cambridge University paper requires specialist knowledge and has inherent technical difficulties .
This method is therefore not reproducible on a large scale , nor does it take into account the fraud monitoring used throughout the industry . "
GCHQ said the terminal is n't one of theirs .
Yet for some reason the banking industry body , APACS , claims on its website that along with many other similar terminals , it is evaluated under Common Criteria , giving the impression that it has passed muster .
Seems to be some dancing on pinheads here .
But perhaps our whole approach needs a shake - up .
In America , customers are better protected .
Here , consumers are more exposed than when we used to pay for things with our signature , or so Ross Anderson believes .
He calls it " liability engineering " - as soon as you accept paying with a PIN - or an online password - you take on the responsibility to keep those safe
He helps out a lot of people who are having trouble persuading their banks or building societies that the withdrawals on their accounts were " phantoms " .
More and more cases are going to the courts instead of ending up with the financial ombudsman - who in the past has tended to side with the banks , according to Professor Anderson .
His most recent case is likely to turn on whether the banks are prepared to produce crucial evidence which they have been reluctant to do in the past .
All that solder may have brought us to a turning point .

IN our celebrity - studded world , where we make a cult of genius and individual achievement , the mind rebels at the notion that geography trumps personality .
Yet the inescapable lesson of the iPod , Google , eBay , Netflix and Silicon Valley in general is that where you live often trumps who you are .
Just ask Sim Wong Hoo .
About seven years ago , I met Mr. Sim in Singapore , where he was born and was then living .
He talked about the rising creativity of Singaporeans and with a flourish , as if to dramatically make his point , he pulled out a prototype of a hand - held music player that he insisted would replace Sony ’s famous Walkman .
Mr. Sim ’s device was breathtaking , possessing all the elements of what we now know as the MP3 player .
Yet today , a Silicon Valley icon , Apple , dominates the market for MP3 players with the iPod .
In recognition of its emergence as a music powerhouse , last month Apple dropped the word “ computer ” from its name .
Some months after my Singapore encounter , I visited the thriving code - writing communities in Tallinn , Estonia ; Reykjavik , Iceland ; and Helsinki , Finland , three Nordic cities that were being transformed by advances in cellphones , mobile computing and the Internet .
Their tight - knit network of engineers seemed poised to create the tools required to make good on a much - hyped prediction : the death of distance .
After all , if necessity is the mother of invention , no one had more need than the hardy Estonians , Icelanders and Finns , living on the frozen edge of Europe , when it came to killing distance as a barrier .

SEATTLE , July 19 — The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded more than a quarter of a billion dollars today to researchers in 19 countries to speed the lagging development of an H.I.V. vaccine .
The grants are the largest private investment in making such a vaccine , the foundation said .
They represent a significant shift in emphasis , to large - scale collaborative projects instead of small teams of researchers working independently .
The money will be given over five years to 16 scientific teams , including two New York groups .
The scientists applied for the grants before Warren E. Buffett announced last month that he was giving $ 31 billion to the Gates Foundation .
The Gates Foundation has made development of an effective vaccine against H.I.V. , the virus that causes AIDS , a major goal , and the new grants bring to $ 528 million the foundation ’s investment for this purpose .
By contrast , the National Institutes of Health has spent $ 3.4 billion since the 1980 ’s to develop a vaccine .
I have to do some teaching on the subject of the falling dollar and whether it ’s recessionary .
So herewith some ruminations .
WARNING : FAIRLY WONKISH .
First , we need a model .
My starting point is to think of the Fed as setting “ the ” interest rate ( more on that later ) , and facing two tradeoffs .
On one side , the lower the interest rate the higher is employment .
On the other side , the lower the interest rate the lower the dollar .
In normal times the Fed tries to set the interest rate so as to achieve more or less full employment , and lets the dollar fall where it may .
Now along comes a change in investor expectations that makes the dollar weaker at any given interest rate .
This also , with some lag , makes the economy stronger at any given interest rate , because a weaker dollar means stronger exports and less imports .
So what would we expect the effect of changing expectations that weaken the dollar to be ?
We ’d expect it to lead to a weaker dollar ( duh ) and also higher interest rates — but the latter effect would happen only because the Fed is trying to offset the expansionary effect of that weaker dollar .
It should n’t depress the economy at all .
OK , so how do we make this story more pessimistic ?
One way is to argue that the Fed will have to raise interest rates more than is necessary to stabilize employment .
The usual reason given is that the falling dollar will be inflationary , so the Fed will have to support the dollar with higher interest rates to ward off this inflation .
OK , this could be right , but I have a hard time making the numbers look big enough to get worried about : imports are only 16 percent of GDP , and exchange rates are much less than fully passed through into import prices .
The big dollar fall from 1985 to 1988 was n’t notably inflationary .
Another argument I used to make was that a dollar plunge would pop the housing bubble , setting in motion a rapid fall in domestic demand that would outpace any rise in exports .
But the bubble popped all on its own , so I do n’t think this is still valid .
Finally , there ’s a fairly subtle argument about term structure and timing .
You see , the Fed only controls short - term interest rates , while investment spending depends on long - term rates .
Meanwhile , the effects of a weak dollar on exports take a while , maybe as much as two years , to take full effect .
So there ’s a story that runs something like this : a plunging dollar will eventually be very expansionary , and will force the Fed to raise rates to cool off the economy — not now , but a year or two from now .
But the expectation of this future rise in short - term rates will push up long - term rates now , causing a recession even if the Fed does nothing .
This story depends on the effect of interest rates on demand working faster than the effect of the exchange rate on exports .
I guess this could work .
But it ’s a fairly tricky story , and a lot subtler than the alarm I ’ve been hearing .
There ’s always the possibility that I ’m missing something big , but right now that ’s where my thinking is .
Followup : Great comments .
A few general thoughts :
1 . A fair number of commentators are skeptical about whether a weak dollar really increases exports and reduces imports .
There is room to worry about how big those effects are , but the direction is quite clear .
Over the past year real exports are up about 10 percent , a lot faster than overall growth , while real imports are up only about 2 percent , slower than overall growth ; all this is presumably the effect of the weak dollar , and there ’s probably a lot more to come .
Overall , the improving trade picture added about 1 percent to the economy ’s growth rate , which is modest but significant .
2 . When people wonder why anyone would invest in the US without a rise in interest rates , you have to make the distinction between a falling dollar and a fallen dollar .
If the dollar gets really weak , investors will see US assets as a bargain , and flock here even without higher rates .
The question is how far the dollar has to fall to make that happen , and whether the Fed can let that big a fall happen .
It is known by some , but not all , that businesses pay fees in order to accept credit cards as a form of payment .
In fact , over 7 million merchants in the U.S. accept credit cards .
During 2006 they collectively paid over 30 billion in credit card acceptance fees .
Despite the size of the industry , it ’s a mystery to most who is pocketing all this money and how prices are determined and reported .
I had a CPA tell me the other day , “ I ’m a smart guy .
I understand numbers , pricing and reconciliation , but for whatever reason I just cannot get my head around credit card processing fees and the unbelievably complicated way companies report them . ”
He ’s not alone .
Hopefully this article will clear up some of that confusion as I provide some context about where credit card fees come from , who ’s making the money , and how fees and rates are determined .
Issuing Financial Institutions make roughly 85 % of all credit and debit card processing fees
The financial institutions that issue credit and debit cards are the biggest benefactors .
Some financial institutions such as banks co-issue debit and credit cards with Visa and or MasterCard while others such as American Express and Discover issue them directly ( though now after years of litigation , some banks are now issuing American Express to cardholders ) .
Visa and MasterCard are now public membership associations owned by the issuing banks , and collectively own roughly 75 % of the credit cards in the market .
For example , Visa is a membership association of over 13,000 banks nationwide .
These issuing financial institutions make money every time a card they issued is used to purchase something .
For example , let ’s assume that a business is paying an effective rate of 3.5 % to accept credit cards ( that 3.5 % is usually comprised of a discount rate and a per transaction fee but I just used a flat rate for simplification purposes ) .
Roughly 85 % of that 3.5 % is going to the issuing bank .
The remaining 15 % is divided among Visa or MasterCard , the credit card processor , and if there is one , the Independent Sales Organization ( ISO ) .
How do financial institutions justify their fees ?
Credit card usage has seen explosive growth in the past 20 years for a number of reasons .
Benefits of using plastic include 15 to 45 days to pay original purchases , rewards , a line of credit for extra spending power , fraud protection , a monthly accounting of all purchases and general convenience .
The use of Purchase Cards by Corporations or the government ( GSA ) has also been growing rapidly to lower the cost and to streamline Accounts Receivable and Payables .
An example of some of the costs these financial institutions incur providing and maintaining card holders include fraud , bad debt , customer support , rewards and other perks , and float ( they pay for your purchases before you pay them ) .
Usage rewards alone account for roughly 40 % of the fees they generate and end up back in the pockets of cardholders .
They fiercely compete for new cardholders primarily on their rewards programs .
Continuing our example from above , if you buy movie tickets for $ 20 and the movie theater is paying 3.5 % , the financial institution that issued that credit card would make $ 0.60 ( $ 20×3.5 % = $ 0.70 , x 85 % equals $ 0.60 ) .
Visa and MasterCard add their respective fees of .0925 % and .0950 % on top of what the banks charge ( Note : that ’s 9.25 and 9.50 basis points .
100 basis points equals 1 % ) .
Adding the fees from the bank and Visa or MasterCard together form what is called ‘ interchange ’ .
You now understand why you find a credit card offer in your mailbox everyday .
Outside of the 18 % interest rates , annual fees , and late fees , being a card issuer is a lucrative business !
The issuing institutions are making money on both the front and back end .
That seems simple enough , why does everyone say it ’s so complex ?
From a high level , the rate structure seems pretty simple , but it gets messy fast once we get into the details .
There are over 100 different interchange ‘ rates ’ or ‘ categories ’ .
The particular rate that is charged on any given transaction depends on a number of variables , including :
1 ) The type of card that is used in the transaction i.e. debit , credit , rewards , or business card , international , etc.2 )
Where the card is used i.e. restaurant , retail , gas , business to business , ecommerce , etc.3 )
The method of usage i.e. swiped , over the phone , or via ecommerce .
4 )
What information the business captures during the transaction i.e. name , address , tax ID , tax amount , unit description , etc. ( the information required is a whole other layer of complexity ) .
5 ) When the transaction is submitted to the processor for settlement and funds transfer after the initial authorization .
As you can see , it ’s a very complicated matrix .
Very few people , including those who ’ve been in the industry for years , really understand interchange .
Qualifying for different rate categories and getting hit with downgrades Merchants can often do more than they think to better manage the credit card fees they pay .
For example , transactions can be ‘ downgraded ’ ( penalized ) when they do n’t meet interchange requirements .
Example reasons for downgrades include not capturing the correct information when processing ( such as billing zip ) , settling the transaction after a certain period of time , not swiping the transaction and many more .
Learning how to recognize these penalties and then making the appropriate adjustments can help you lower the fees that are paid .
One downgrade example is if a restaurant employee hand keys a credit card number into the point of sale system because the magnetic strip ca n’t be read , the transaction falls into a different and higher rate category .
The transaction is penalized because ‘ non swiped ’ transactions carry more risk and therefore higher interchange fees .
The increase in rate can be significant ranging from 30 basis points to 2 % , or more depending on how the service provider has the account priced .
Different rate categories and downgrades are the dirty little secret for merchant service providers .
It ’s where they make most of their margin because they offer artificially low rates and do n’t disclose higher marketups on transactions that do n’t fall into a specific rate category .
Too many merchants fall for this and think they ’re paying the single , highly competitive rate that was advertised .
A quick search of merchant service providers will demonstrate that non disclosure of fees is a standard practice .
See two examples here .
The undecipherable monthly credit card statement
As icing on the cake , the unreadable format most merchant service providers use to present this information to you on a monthly basis does n’t help .
Of course , the format used is not because they have no other option , it ’s because that ’s what makes them the most amount of money .
The frustration with credit card fees Some merchants accept credit cards because they find them to be a easier and more efficient method of accepting money from customers .
Most merchants however accept them because they have no other choice .
Many merchants and advocacy groups have cried foul lately with Visa and MasterCard increasing ‘ interchange ’ fees over 117 % in the past five years while maintaining over 75 % market share .
The Card Associations have been accused of being monopolistic .
Interchange has come under increased pressure lately A few years ago , Wal - Mart won a class action lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard .
They claimed that debit card interchange was being improperly priced because it had the same interchange rate as credit cards .
Among other things , they argued that debit cards should be have a lower interchange rate because money comes directly out of the cardholder ’s account versus a credit card where there is 15 to 45 days between purchase and payment .
The courts agreed and awarded Wal - Mart and other retailers billions of dollars in compensatory damages .
There are currently a number of other legal battles against the Card Associations surrounding interchange .
It looks like PlayStation 3 owners could be in for a welcome surprise when they boot up their console tomorrow , at least if an apparent slip - up on Sony 's European website is any indication .
As a user on the NeoGAF forums noticed , it recently put up a page which revealed that 2.10 firmware update " was released on December 18 , 2007 , " bringing with it a number of additions , including DivX support ( with some limitations ) and , as rumored , support for Blu-ray Disc Profile 1.1 .
You 'll also apparently soon be able to take advantage of the new " Voice Changer " feature , which will let you disguise your voice in voice or video chat , and you 'll be getting support for ( VC - 1 ) WMV files in addition to the aforementioned DivX ones .
If any of that interests you , we 'd suggest keeping an eye out , ' cause it sure looks like this one 's about to drop .

The University of Utah ’s esports program along with student video game clubs from 10 other Pac - 12 universities have formed a new unofficial esports organization to compete in multiplayer video games including the popular titles “ League of Legends , ” “ Overwatch ” and “ Hearthstone . ”
The new organization , The Pacific Alliance of Collegiate Gamers ( PACG ) , will involve multiple , semester - long leagues .
In addition to the University of Utah , the PACG organization will include student video game clubs from the University of Arizona ; Arizona State ; University of California , Berkeley ; University of California , Los Angeles ; University of Colorado , Boulder ; University of Oregon ; Oregon State University ; University of Southern California ; Stanford University and Washington State University .
Matches begin in February .
The formation of the PACG is to further the interests of collegiate esports among Pac - 12 college campuses .
Like traditional college athletics , PACG will be self - governed by representatives from each school .
Because PACG is an unsponsored organization , players will not be participating for scholarships or prize money like most other collegiate esports associations such as Tespa or the AVGL .
“ The fact that these students were able to come together to form their own league speaks volumes about their desire to represent their schools in this space , and athletic departments and school administrations everywhere should take notice , ” said A.J. Dimick , who runs the University of Utah ’s esports program .
“ I ca n’t wait to watch these Pac - 12 esports teams compete for a championship . ”
The University of Utah will be the only official collegiate varsity program in the PACG organization .
Last fall , the U launched its first college esports team to compete in multiplayer games “ League of Legends , ” “ Overwatch , ” “ Hearthstone ” and “ Rocket League . ”
The program , “ Utah Esports , ” was created by the university ’s nationally - ranked Entertainment Arts & Engineering video game development studio and is made up of 33 U student players and coaches .
Each of the players on the U ’s team receive a $ 1,000 - per - year scholarship and are playing against club teams from all over North America and 50 other scholarship esports programs .
Utah Esports is the first college - sponsored varsity esports program from any school in a Power Five athletics conference ( Pac - 12 , Big Ten , Big 12 , Atlantic Coast and Southeastern ) .
Global revenue from esports is expected to reach $ 1.5 billion by 2020 , more than double that in 2017 , according to market research firm Newzoo .
Also by 2020 , esports ’ global audience is expected to hit 303 million people .

After months of rumors and tantalizing leaks — and as we first told you earlier this week — Indian automaker Tata Motors has finally unveiled the Tata Nano — its already legendary $ 2,500 ( 1 - lakh ) car .
As expected , the car that Tata claims will change the face of not only the Indian car market , but the global auto industry will be a four door , five seat hatch , powered by a 30 HP Bosch 624 cc four stroke engine mounted out back and mated to a CVT .
That makes the Nano the first time a 2 - cylinder gasoline engine will be used in a car with a single balancer shaft .
The Nano's also expected to get 54 US miles per gallon .
Yes , but will it blend ?
Full press release after the jump with all the details .
By the way — are we the only ones happy to see a Tata Nano sporting what looks like a bra above ?
Also — how long do we think it 'll take before Apple files a lawsuit over the name ?
Update :
We 've got video of the unveil posted HERE
Tata Motors unveils the People's Car
A comfortable , safe , all - weather car , high on fuel efficiency & low on emissions
Mr. Ratan N. Tata , Chairman of the Tata Group and Tata Motors , today unveiled the Tata ' NANO ' , the People 's Car from Tata Motors that India and the world have been looking forward to .
A development , which signifies a first for the global automobile industry , the People 's Car brings the comfort and safety of a car within the reach of thousands of families .
The People 's Car will be launched in India later in 2008 .
Speaking at the unveiling ceremony at the 9th Auto Expo in New Delhi , Mr. Ratan N. Tata said , " I observed families riding on two - wheelers - the father driving the scooter , his young kid standing in front of him , his wife seated behind him holding a little baby .
It led me to wonder whether one could conceive of a safe , affordable , all - weather form of transport for such a family .
Tata Motors ' engineers and designers gave their all for about four years to realise this goal .
Today , we indeed have a People 's Car , which is affordable and yet built to meet safety requirements and emission norms , to be fuel efficient and low on emissions .
We are happy to present the People 's Car to India and we hope it brings the joy , pride and utility of owning a car to many families who need personal mobility . "
Stylish , comfortable
The People 's Car , designed with a family in mind , has a roomy passenger compartment with generous leg space and head room .
It can comfortably seat four persons .
Four doors with high seating position make ingress and egress easy .
Yet with a length of 3.1 metres , width of 1.5 metres and height of 1.6 metres , with adequate ground clearance , it can effortlessly manoeuvre on busy roads in cities as well as in rural areas .
Its mono - volume design , with wheels at the corners and the powertrain at the rear , enables it to uniquely combine both space and manoeuvrability , which will set a new benchmark among small cars .
When launched , the car will be available in both standard and deluxe versions .
Both versions will offer a wide range of body colours , and other accessories so that the car can be customised to an individual 's preferences .
Fuel - efficient engine
The People 's Car has a rear - wheel drive , all - aluminium , two - cylinder , 623 cc , 33 PS , multi point fuel injection petrol engine .
This is the first time that a two - cylinder gasoline engine is being used in a car with single balancer shaft .
The lean design strategy has helped minimise weight , which helps maximise performance per unit of energy consumed and delivers high fuel efficiency .
Performance is controlled by a specially designed electronic engine management system .
Meets all safety requirements
The People 's Car 's safety performance exceeds current regulatory requirements .
With an all sheet - metal body , it has a strong passenger compartment , with safety features such as crumple zones , intrusion - resistant doors , seat belts , strong seats and anchorages , and the rear tailgate glass bonded to the body .
Tubeless tyres further enhance safety .
Environment - friendly
The People 's Car 's tailpipe emission performance exceeds regulatory requirements .
In terms of overall pollutants , it has a lower pollution level than two - wheelers being manufactured in India today .
The high fuel efficiency also ensures that the car has low carbon dioxide emissions , thereby providing the twin benefits of an affordable transportation solution with a low carbon footprint .

Progress always comes at a cost .
In the case of web browsers , users bear the cost when developers take the rendering of certain authoring tools and browsers ( especially Internet Explorer ) as gospel .
When a new version of that browser comes along and fixes bugs or misinterpretations of the spec ( or introduces new ones ) or in any way changes behavior , sites break and our clients , bosses , and users get very unhappy .
Article Continues Below
We could spend hours explaining why our sites broke , but would n’t it be better if they did n’t break in the first place ?
A little background #section2
Building on the momentum created by the release of Internet Explorer 7 , which included major advances in CSS support , the IE team began work on a completely new rendering engine for IE8 — one that followed the CSS 2.1 spec as closely as possible .
The culmination of their efforts is a browser capable of rendering the Acid2 test accurately .
For those of you keeping track , this means that IE will soon support generated content and data URLs , and , it has been confirmed , will banish hasLayout forever .
This will put its rendering on par with other browsers that have passed Acid2 , including Safari , iCab , Konqueror , and Opera .
( Firefox 3 , which passes Acid2 , had not been released as of this writing . )
Throughout the development of the new engine , the IE team has been mindful of the backlash they received upon the release of IE7 .
Some standards zealots and even a few Microsoft fans felt that they did n’t go far enough in IE7 with bug fixes and improvements to CSS support .
But a far greater number of developers gasped in utter disbelief as their websites , which looked great in IE6 , broke in IE7 .
On his blog , standards advocate Roger Johanssen offered three reasons for the breakage , and in their drive to improve standards support , the IE team discovered a fourth : the DOCTYPE switch , a core technique enabling modern CSS layouts , is fatally flawed as a way to protect compatibility .
The DOCTYPE switch is broken #section3
Back in 1998 , Todd Fahrner came up with a toggle that would allow a browser to offer two rendering modes : one for developers wishing to follow standards , and another for everyone else .
The concept was brilliantly simple .
When the user agent encountered a document with a well - formed DOCTYPE declaration of a current HTML standard ( i.e. HTML 2.0 would n’t cut it ) , it would assume that the author knew what she was doing and render the page in “ standards ” mode ( laying out elements using the W3 C ’s box model ) .
But when no DOCTYPE or a malformed DOCTYPE was encountered , the document would be rendered in “ quirks ” mode , i.e. , laying out elements using the non-standard box model of IE5.x / Windows .
This concept was first implemented in IE5 / Mac two years later , and was quickly adopted by the other browser makers .
Standards - aware developers were already including a DOCTYPE declaration in their documents for validation purposes , so it required no extra effort on their parts to get browsers to render documents according to the spec .
Developers who were n’t standards - minded were blissfully unaware that their documents were being given special treatment because neither they nor the tools they were using inserted well - formed DOCTYPE s .
Unfortunately , two key factors , working in concert , have made the DOCTYPE unsustainable as a switch for standards mode :
egged on by A List Apart and The Web Standards Project , well - intentioned developers of authoring tools began inserting valid , complete DOCTYPE s into the markup their tools generated ; and IE6 ’s rendering behavior was not updated for five years , leading many developers to assume its rendering was both accurate and unlikely to change .
Together , these two circumstances have undermined the DOCTYPE switch because it had one fatal flaw : it assumed that the use of a valid DOCTYPE meant that you knew what you were doing when it came to web standards , and that you wanted the most accurate rendering possible .
How do we know that it failed ?
When IE 7 hit the streets , sites broke .
Sure , as Roger pointed out , some of those sites were using IE - 6 - specific CSS hacks ( often begrudgingly , and with no choice ) .
But most suffered because their developers only checked their pages in IE6 — or only needed to concern themselves with how the site looked in IE6 , because they were deploying sites within a homogeneous browserscape ( e.g. a company intranet ) .
Now sure , you could just shrug it off and say that since IE6 ’s inaccuracies were well - documented , these developers should have known better , but you would be ignoring the fact that many developers never explicitly opted into “ standards mode , ” or even knew that such a mode existed .
Chris Wilson , Platform Architect for Internet Explorer , has often said that one of the core tenets of development on IE is that any choices the IE team makes must not “ break the web ” .
Sadly , IE7 did just that for quite a number of people .
Unwilling to make the same mistake twice , Microsoft reached out to The Web Standards Project ( of which I am a member ) and to several other standards - aware developers , and asked for our help in coming up with a better method of allowing developers to “ opt in ” to proper standards support .
The goal was to find a method that was more explicit than the DOCTYPE switch , and could be implemented in any browser , not just IE .
Future perfect#section4
At last year ’s SXSW , I had the good fortune to watch a fantastic panel led by New York Public Library ’s Carrie Bickner ( who also happens to be the wife of ALA ’s publisher , Jeffrey Zeldman ) .
The panel , “ Preserving our Digital Legacy and the Individual Collector , ” amounted to a discussion of the problems libraries and individuals run into when trying to maintain digital archives .
Most of these problems stem from advances in file formats and applications : Microsoft Office 2007 , for example , cannot reliably render a Word 1.0 document as it was originally intended to be rendered .
The panel got me thinking about how the web has changed since its creation and how it will continue to change as web standards evolve .
As a proponent of web standards , I want to see browsers continually improve their implementations of standards while adding support for new ones , but I also see it ’s important to preserve the web we ’ve worked so hard to build — table - based layouts and all .
Sure , most trips through the “ Wayback Machine ” do n’t suffer in modern browsers because the DOCTYPE switch still serves them well , but what about a site built to IE6 ’s implementation of “ standards ” mode ?
We already know that , in many cases , IE7 wo n’t render it properly .
Does that mean that we need to keep a copy of IE6 on hand in order to view the page as the author intended ?
That ’s exactly what many libraries have done in order to be able to view elderly files .
With IE8 on the horizon , we have the same potential problem with documents created using IE7 ’s rendering engine .
What ’s the solution ?
Targeting a browser version #section5
In an ideal world , of course , all specifications would be perfect from the get - go , and their implementation in user agents would be immediate and flawless .
In a slightly more down - to - earth version of an ideal world , browser vendors would immediately integrate regularly updated standards into new user agents — and users would have instant access to the latest version of those browsers without having to lift a finger .
Were that the case , we developers would be able to build sites and applications that take advantage of the latest and greatest web technologies without worrying about backward compatibility .
But as we all know , the world is nowhere near even that level of perfect .
Standards are developed and advanced in fits and starts , sometimes taking several years to find their way to “ recommendation ” status .
Browser release cycles are driven by product management and marketing concerns — security , features , speed — and rarely coincide with the finalization of standards specifications , even when the browser makers themselves have been intimately involved with the development of those very standards .
And users , especially within an organizational context , are often slow to upgrade their browsers .
All of these factors leave us , the website developers , in a bit of a pickle when it comes to making websites .
How do we ensure that browsers continue to render what we want them to ?
We could specify the version of the languages we use , such as CSS 2.1 or JavaScript 1.5 .
Unfortunately , browser vendors often implement only part of a spec and the interpretation of a specification often differs from browser to browser , so any two contemporary browsers may offer completely different renderings of the same CSS or may trigger completely different events from the same form control .
With this spanner in the works , we ’re really only left with one option for guaranteeing a site we build today will look as good and work as well in five years as it does today : define a list of browser versions that the site was built and tested on , and then require that browser makers implement a way to use legacy rendering and scripting engines to display the site as it was intended — well into the future .
This is exactly what our group decided to recommend for IE8 , and we hope to see it implemented in other browsers as well .
Keeping the syntax simple #section6
One key to ensuring that this browser “ version targeting ” was easy for developers to adopt was to make it easy to implement by hand or in an authoring tool .
We considered many syntax options , including a conditional comment - like syntax , processing instructions a la the XML prolog , and even HTML profiles such as those adopted by the Microformats community , but few seemed to fit the job as well as the meta element .
Using a simple meta declaration , we can specify the rendering engine we would like IE8 to use .
For example , inserting this :
< meta http -equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=8 " />
into the head of a document would make IE8 render the page using the new standards mode .
This syntax could be easily expanded to incorporate other browsers as well :
< meta http -equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=8 ; FF=3 ; OtherUA=4 " />
In the interest of speeding up the processing of the lock instruction , it is important to prioritize the version targeting meta element in much the same way as we prioritize the character encoding information .
In order to work , the meta element will need to be placed in the head of your document , as close to the top as possible .
It can be preceded by other meta elements and the title element , but will need to be placed above any other elements — and you ca n’t add it into the DOM via JavaScript .
As those of you with keen eyes probably noticed , the meta element we are using here is of the HTTP - equiv alent variety , which means we can set the following header on the server to get the same effect :
X - UA - Compatible : IE=8 ; FF=3 ; OtherUA=4
We can also use both methods in concert .
For example , it is possible to set a baseline lock on a whole site using the header method and then override that header on individual pages , as needed , using the meta element .
Whither progressive enhancement ?
#section7
Having the ability to lock your site to a particular browser version is fantastic for ensuring that your site will be usable well into the future , but does it undermine the concept of progressive enhancement ?
Will we have to alter the way we build sites ?
Can we still take advantage of new CSS properties automatically , as they become available ?
These were some of the many questions I had when we began discussing a possible “ version targeting . ”
For instance , let ’s say IE8 was n’t going to support generated content — if the Acid2 announcement is any indication , it should , but just bear with my use of it as an example — and we used generated content on a website that “ targeted ” IE8 .
Every other modern browser with the exception of IE would render that generated content , but even if IE9 included support for generated content , someone using that browser would not see the generated content because the site was locked to IE8 .
The site ’s lock would need to be updated to IE9 for the generated content to appear , which goes against the core concept of progressive enhancement .
As much as it pains me to lose this particular aspect of progressive enhancement , this behavior is honestly the best thing that could happen , especially when the site concerned is public - facing .
After all , we should n’t make assumptions about how browsers will behave in the future .
If a change in IE9 would break the layout of our site or the functionality of one of our scripts , that could be disastrous for our users , sending our team into a mad scramble to “ fix ” the website that was working fine before the new browser launched ( which is pretty much the boat we ’re in now ) .
Version targeting gives our team the ability to decide when to offer support for a new browser and , more importantly , gives us the much - needed time to make any adjustments necessary to introduce support for that new browser version .
So does version targeting spell the end of progressive enhancement ?
At this point , no .
First of all , we will be dealing with legacy / pre-lock browsers for years to come , and progressive enhancement is a proven way to manage the differing levels of CSS and JavaScript support among them .
Furthermore , there will still be a place for conditional comments to deliver style and scripting patches to IE browsers though we hope there will be a diminishing need for them over time .
Finally , writing JavaScript using progressive enhancement techniques will still greatly cut down on the re-factoring time needed when preparing to launch support for a new browser .
Extra credit : living on the “ edge” #section8
For those willing to throw caution to the wind , let the chips fall where they may , or any other manner of colloquialism for coding with reckless abandon , IE will support a keyword value of “ edge : ”
< meta http -equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=edge " />
This option , though strongly discouraged , will cause a site to target the latest IE browser versions as they release .
It is a far cleaner alternative than the inevitable hack of setting an arbitrarily high value — IE=1000 , anyone ?
But with all of the benefits of version targeting , the “ edge ” value is probably not practical for anything but experimental websites .
That ’s because even Eric Meyer ca n’t predict layout or scripting bugs that may be accidentally introduced by a new browser version .
Hope for the future # section9
For many years , we designers and developers have been yearning for a way to reliably deploy our websites .
In addition to the headaches of writing cross-platform styles and scripts , we ’ve had to deal with the fallout from new browser releases that inevitably broke something we could n’t possibly have anticipated .
It ’s never fun explaining the cause of an unexpected break to our clients , bosses , and users .
But with IE8 ’s introduction of version targeting , there is a light at the end of the tunnel .
I , for one , hope other browser vendors join Microsoft in implementing this functionality .

Thin に関するメモ。（なんだけど、試していないので実態は不明。）
Thin actually relies on Mongrel , but is ultimately faster than it , even against Mongrel 's EventMachine - enhanced guise .
とのこと。公式サイトの about を読むと 、Mongrel のパーサを使っているので 、Mongrel の速さとセキュリティを受け継ぎ 、EventMachine を使っているから、安定していてスケーラブル。そして

上記のブログのコメントからいくつか抜粋。
Does
Thin run multiple Rails processes ?
Or do you still need to put it behind a load balancing proxy like you do with Mongrel ?
( like this config : http://blog.codahale.com/2006/06/19/time-for-a-grown-up-server-rails-mongrel-apache-capistrano-and-you/) に答えて 、
Thin is exacly like Mongrel on that side , you ’ll need multiple Rails processes for a web site with some traffic .
You should probably also check out Rev ( http://rev.rubyforge.org) which is a light simple binding around libev ( not libevent ) and works only in Ruby 1.9 .
Tony is building a very nice API for it that you can use , and libev is very fast and small .
これは Zed Shaw のコメント。libev はこれか 。
How long , you think , before it can be used on a production server ?
への回答 。 A better reply would be : you tell me !
If you feel like it , deploy an app using it and let me know if it works for you .
そら、そうだw
（ Ruby はあんまりスケールしない（しなかった）って議論があるんだけど、その点はどうなの？って質問に答えて。）
Ruby had some problems in the past with threads , Mongrel helped fixing those bugs in Ruby ’s core but still , Ruby threads are not native ( do n’t use OS processes , so ca n’t take advantage of multicore processors ) .
And threading is not the most scalable way of handle huge loads .
Event - driven I/ O can handle more requests and uses only one thread .

Cases of pupils bullying teachers are not always reported Many teachers are being bullied and harassed by pupils , but school heads are concealing the problem , says the National Association of Head Teachers .
When the NASUWT teachers ' union asked its members about the issue , many said they had been taunted , abused or physically attacked by their pupils .
And the NAHT union said its members feared reporting ill - treatment would reflect badly on their school .
Head teachers ' leaders insist they take their responsibilities very seriously .
Ministers say heads have a duty to report cases of teachers being bullied .
They said new powers make it easier for schools to tackle the problem .
' In hiding '
HAVE YOUR SAY
How about letting the teacher discipline the children appropriately as some parents fail to do this basic task .
Robbie , Inverness
The NAHT 's general secretary , Mick Brookes , told BBC Breakfast : " I think we 're quite right in asserting the under - reporting of these sorts of incidents because it's not the sort of thing that schools , and even teachers , will want to be shouting from the rooftops . "
One teacher , who did not want to be named , said : " There have been times when the bell 's gone for the end of that lesson , and I 've got out of there as quickly as possible because you 're just so nervous .
" I 've been punched a number of times , I 've had aerosols sprayed into my face , I 've had my mobile phone stolen and texts sent out to my friends .
" I 've been intimidated by a group of year 11 pupils , I 've had a torrent of abuse and , on one occasion , I 've even been asked to hide in an office because a child had come in with a knife , looking for me . "
John Dunford of the Association of School and College Leaders said : " Head teachers take their responsibility to protect staff very seriously .
No one , teacher or student , deserves to be bullied , but the issue is not as clear cut as it may seem .
" There is a fine line between rowdy behaviour by groups of students and direct bullying of teachers .
In the case of bullying , heads have a duty to protect staff but in other instances the more effective response may be to help struggling teachers develop better classroom management techniques .
" This is where peer observation to reflect on , and improve , classroom management can be effective . "
Children 's Minster Kevin Brennan said : " Any incident of bullying or assault on teachers is unacceptable .
Standards of behaviour in all schools have been steadily improving according to Ofsted and although assaults on teachers are rare , as a former teacher I know that one assault is one too many .
" That is why we have given teachers and Heads the statutory powers they asked for to enforce discipline in schools and we fully support them in using them . "

Prince recently performed for 21 nights at London 's O2 arena
A fan group , Prince Fans United , claims the star is trying to " stifle all critical commentary " and he is in " violation of the freedom of speech " .
But Web Sheriff , the UK firm the pop star has hired to enforce the ban , said it was " not an attack on fans " .
In September , Prince took action against video sharing website YouTube to remove clips of his London concerts .
' Voluntary and unpaid '
He is now hoping to have any album covers , images of him in concert and any lyrics removed .
" The dispute , in so far as there is one , is related to the use of photographs and images of Prince , many of which are Prince 's copyright , " said John Giacobbi , managing director of Web Sheriff .
" At the end of the day it 's the artist 's decision as to what they 're happy to let people have , " he added .
However , a spokesman for Prince Fans United , who asked to remain anonymous for legal reasons , denied the sites had done anything wrong .
The websites are run by fans , therefore it is an attack on fans
Prince Fans United spokesman
" We respect copyright laws always .
However about 80 % of the images on the websites are not copyright owned by Prince , " he said .
" For example there are photos taken of him in concert where the copyright remains with the photographer . "
Tight security
Prince Fans United was formed by housequake.com , Princefams.com and Prince.org , to fight back .
The spokesman said all the websites were run on a " voluntary unpaid basis " and none of the sites were a " commercial venue " .
He added : " The websites are run by fans , therefore it is an attack on fans . "
During Prince 's recent residency at London 's O2 arena , fans were banned from taking photographs or video footage on their mobile phones .
Prince publicly protested against his record company in the 1990s
Security at the concerts was tight with people 's bags being searched for cameras .
But clips of the singer still appeared online .
Prince is well - known for being protective of his image .
In 1990 he fell out with his record company , Warner Brothers , over the ownership of his master tapes .
He went on to change his name and famously wrote the word " slave " on his cheek during public appearances .
More recently , in the UK his most recent album , Planet Earth , was given away free with a newspaper .
Several websites offered copies of the album for download as soon as the paper went on sale - despite the album being sold commercially in the rest of the world .
The state agency that regulates Pennsylvania liquor stores may take its products on the road .
The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board spokesman Nick Hays says the idea of mobile liquor stores is just one of several possibilities the agency is weighing to make wine and hard liquor more available in rural parts of the state .
Board chairman P.J. Stapleton mentioned the idea Tuesday during a Senate hearing on the agency 's budget , but says it 's not a priority for the agency .
Hays says the agency has n't fully investigated the concept .
He says officials would have to determine whether state law allows it and whether it 's logistically feasible .
The agency oversees more than 600 liquor stores .

In a revelation bound to cast a pall over the 9/11 Commission , Philip Shenon will report in a forthcoming book that the panel ’s executive director , Philip Zelikow , engaged in “ surreptitious ” communications with presidential adviser Karl Rove and other Bush administration officials during the commission ’s 20 – month investigation into the 9/11 attacks .
Shenon , who led The New York Times ’ coverage of the 9/11 panel , reveals the Zelikow – Rove connection in a new book entitled The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation , to be published next month by TWELVE books .
The Commission is under an embargo until its February 5 publication , but Washington DeCoded managed to purchase a copy of the abridged audio version from a New York bookstore .
In what ’s termed an “ investigation of the investigation , ” Shenon purports to tell the story of the commission from start to finish .
The book ’s critical revelations , however , revolve almost entirely around the figure of Philip Zelikow , a University of Virginia professor and director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs prior to his service as the commission ’s executive director .
Shenon delivers a blistering account of Zelikow ’s role and leadership , and an implicit criticism of the commissioners for appointing Zelikow in the first place – and then allowing him to stay on after his myriad conflicts – of – interest were revealed under oath .

That 's because genetic material is severely damaged or destroyed by exposure to so - called " cosmic radiation flux " , he said .
Falkowski is co-director of the two - year study of frozen glacial microbes , conducted in conjunction with Boston University , and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers were mainly interested in whether genetic material from the microbes , which they identified as different types of bacteria , could have mixed with that of other organisms in the Earth 's ancient oceans , and influenced evolution , Falkowski said .
The Rutgers study refutes at least part of the " panspermia hypothesis " - a theory from the Greeks , and popular among many scientists since the 19th century - that micro-organisms and biochemicals were carried to the planet by comets , meteors and asteroids .
Other scientists in New Jersey said that they were intrigued by the Rutgers study , but suggested there might be ways some organic material could survive long - term rides on a comet .
" The only question I 'd have is whether the radiation can penetrate into the interior of a comet , " said Dale Gary , an astrophysicist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark .
Comets are called " dirty snowballs " , which implies there is a certain amount of rocky material at their centre which could provide a shield for travelling DNA , Gary said .
" Certainly anything on the surface of comets would suffer radiation damage , " he said .
Gary , chairman of physics at NJIT , had not seen the study .
" Perhaps they ( Rutgers ) have done some calculation of the penetration of these cosmic rays through ice , and concluded that , for a certain radius , it can destroy DNA deep inside .
" However , we do n't know everything there is to know about the interior of comets , " he said .
A large comet might have enough rock in its core " to keep DNA material rather pristine and safe " , Gary said .
Radiation might be a problem for microbes , but not for very basic organic material , said Kevin Conod , an astronomer and manager of the Dreyfuss Planetarium at the Newark Museum .
" I think the theory of panspermia is not about microbes from space , but amino acids , the building blocks of life , " Conod said .
" Radiation would n't necessarily affect those enough to kill pieces of protein . "
The Rutgers researchers thawed five microbial samples taken from ice between 100,000 years and eight million years old , and were able to grow several organisms in liquid media , said Kay Bidle , a Rutgers marine microbiologist and oceanographer .
They also wanted to know how long organisms could live over extended geologic periods , Bidle said .
" This is of interest to whether there is life on Mars , " he said , as the site in Antarctica resembled icy regions on the Red Planet .
Microbes might survive a trip from Mars if encased in a meteorite , Falkowski of Rutgers said .
" So we could all be Martians , " he said .
In Indonesia , he said , more than 18 million hectares of forest , or 44 million acres , have already been cleared for palm oil developments .
Environmental groups say the developments are endangering wildlife like the orangutan and the Sumatran tiger , and putting pressure on indigenous peoples who depend on the forests .
Western scientists are increasingly pointing out the need to distinguish between types of biofuels .
On Monday , for instance , the Royal Society , a national science academy in Britain , said requirements to use a certain percentage of biofuels were not sufficient .
Instead , the society said , there should be specific goals for emissions reductions .
“ Indiscriminately increasing the amount of biofuels we are using may not automatically lead to the best reductions in emissions , ” said John Pickett , head of biological chemistry at Rothamsted Research , a research center in Britain , who helped write the report for the Royal Society .
“ The greenhouse gas savings of each depends on how crops are grown and converted and how the fuel is used . ”
Last week , scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Washington also warned that biofuel production can result in environmental destruction , pollution and damage to human health .
“ Different biofuels vary enormously in how eco-friendly they are , ” said William Laurance , a staff scientist at the institute .
“ We need to be smart and promote the right biofuels . ”
Experts say certain types of fuels , particularly those made from agricultural wastes , still hold potential to improve the environment , but they add that governments will have to set and enforce standards for how the fuels are produced .
With its new proposal , Europe appears to be moving ahead of the rest of the world in that task .
The draft law probably would have the greatest impact on palm oil growers in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia , according to Mr. Drinkwater .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
The top four Republican candidates for president are in a statistical tie in Florida , where Democrat Hillary Clinton holds a 21 - point lead over Barack Obama for their party ’s nomination , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday .

Among Republicans likely to vote in Florida ’s January 29 primary , Arizona Sen .
John McCain has 22 percent followed by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani at 20 percent .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee stand at 19 percent each , the independent poll said .
The gap among all four was within the poll ’s error margin of 4.8 percent .
Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson has 7 percent of likely Republican primary voters and Texas Rep. Ron Paul has 5 percent , the poll said .
“ The Republican race is a dead heat with all four major contenders within three points for first place , ” said Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
Republicans and Democrats are waging a state - by - state fight to win their parties ’ nomination to compete in November ’s election to succeed President George W. Bush .
The Florida primary is one of four state contests later this month .
The poll of 419 Republican voters likely to take part in the selection of the party ’s presidential candidate and 421 Democratic voters likely to vote in that primary in Florida was conducted from January 9 to 13 .
McCain , fresh from a victory in New Hampshire ’s nominating contest , showed the largest movement since the last Quinnipiac poll on December 20 , gaining 9 percentage points from his fourth - place 13 percent showing .
Giuliani , who has pinned many of his presidential hopes on the Florida primary after largely ignoring Iowa and New Hampshire and showing poorly in each , has lost 8 percentage points from his then - first - place 28 percent in the December survey .
“ These numbers ca n’t be good news for Mayor Giuliani who has staked his entire campaign on winning Florida and whose lead has evaporated , ” Brown said .
“ McCain ’s jump is not unexpected given his New Hampshire victory , ” he added .
Among Democratic likely voters , Clinton leads Obama 52 percent to 31 percent , a margin virtually unchanged from December .
Clinton , a New York senator who would be the first woman president , held an even wider lead among women voters .
Former Sen. John Edwards was the big loser , dropping to 9 percent in January from his 19 percent showing in December .
Clinton ’s lead looked more solid , with 75 percent of Clinton voters saying they were unlikely to change their minds .
Only 61 percent of those supporting Obama , an Illinois senator who would be the first black president , said they felt that way .
Vermont has always been a state where citizens valued freedom and independent thought .
A compelling belief in freedom and the importance of following the U.S. Constitution have served as motivations for the citizens of Brattleboro , Vermont .
A new proposal in the township of Brattleboro to authorize local law enforcement to arrest Bush and Cheney will be voted on in the coming weeks at a town hall meeting .
Yesterday , February 20 , the New Hampshire State House held an impeachment hearing , which was flooded by activists and community members insisting that their state legislature take action .
Hollywood actor and activist Ed Asner wrote a letter concerning the hearing .
The letter expressed his support for the resolution , which indicts Bush for “ invading Iraq without just cause or provocation . ”
Bush and Cheney are equally culpable for raping the Constitution at home as well as abroad through the continuing use of 9/11 to justify invasions of privacy .
How can we forget as well the gross violations of international law as well as the Constitution in pathetic waterboarding episodes in addition to numerous other unlawful detentions and torture of those the administration suspects of involvement in terrorism .
The term terrorism is used in the broadest and most applicable sense to justify continuing violations of law and human decency .
As the vigilant VoteToImpeach.org site states :
“ We are keeping the pressure on and ‘ impeachment ’ has become a household word .
We are mobilizing the impeachment movement for the anti-war actions on the 5th anniversary of the war .
We are lobbying Congress .
We are taking out impeachment advertisements .
We are telling the courageous people of Brattleboro that they speak for millions more .
We are telling the New Hampshire activists who filled the State House yesterday that people from the other 49 states stand with them . ”
These grievous actions in gross violation of the Constitution should not stand .
Concerned citizens should unite to vigorously lobby members of Congress to act expeditiously on the vital issue of impeachment .

Case in point , recently a rather popular Flickr member was involved in a ridiculous flame war against some angry trolls .
As an intended joke , she posted a GIF of some bouncing ( covered ) breasts in the comments thread , which appeared to most Flickr users ( including myself ) to be rather silly , a joke amongst friends .
The GIF was rather small and , unbeknownst to the poster , contained an explicit image in the upper corner .
The owner of the photostream did not complain .
But someone else did .
In a rather impulsive act of nepotism , Flickr went ahead and started deleting every comment ever made by this person , or as they said chillingly " we 're scrubbing your comments from the Flickrverse . "
Over 10,000 of them .
It was n't too long ago that Flickr implemented its own questionable censorship system ( which resulted them in restricting all of my photos and then apologizing about it later with a whoops , our bad ) and became perhaps a bit heavy handed with their abilities to decide what we can and cannot see .
It appears that now one is not allowed a single mistake , as instead of issuing a warning for a violations , instead they just start deleting to their heart 's content .
In the so - called Flickrverse , inadvertently putting one naughty - esque photo in a comment thread will get you flagged and censored , maybe even having all your comments from the past , 10,000 in all , deleted .
( WTF is a Flickrverse and when did they get so damned important that they are not just Flickrland or even Flickrworld but a whole Flickrverse ? )
Flickr stated that putting dirty animated GIFs in the comments is a way of circumventing their safety filters and a means of spreading porn to the public .
Sure , maybe it is , and that behavior should be flagged if it happens , let 's say , repeatedly .
But once ?
As a joke ?
Coming from a user whose photostream is comprised of stuffed animals and flowers and a few dead leaves , one would think a more appropriate response would be deleting that comment , erasing all of her comments with embedded GIFs , or giving her a warning and saying " what the hell were you thinking ? "
Instead they took their big giant Flickrverse sterilizer and went through and sanitized everything she 'd laid her dirty little paws on and bleached it out , saving the souls of Flickr users everywhere .
Even those of us who really wanted needed her comments there to boost the entertainment value of their otherwise mundane and dull photostreams , yes , we 've been saved as well .
Maybe what is comes down to is that Flickr should stop calling itself a community and reiterate that it is not nearly as friendly or democratic as it would like to sound .
Its users are not entitled to specific rights and privileges .
Mistakes are not allowed .
Cruel and unusual punishments are not beyond the reach of the powers that be .
There is no writ of habeas corpus .
And there are many rules prohibiting the exercise of free speech which are not clearly delineated but can be enforced at any time to the fullest extent of the law .
Dozens of people wrote complaints about this harsh overreaction for one mistake .
Here is Flickr 's response :
All reports are reviewed against our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines and where appropriate , action is taken .
As mentioned previously , we wo n't discuss the specifics .
I 'm sorry that a contact of yours may have been impacted by team actions , but it 's important that we ensure that all of our members comply with what it means to be a good citizen on Flickr ....
I 'm sorry that you 're upset / appalled / incensed / concerned / horrified / [ insert your term here ] with the actions taken by Member Support .
While TequilaAndDonuts has come to the discussion , our Privacy Policy precludes us from discussing the specific actions taken on other member accounts in the forum , with 3rd parties , etc -- I will however say that I 've returned T&D 's account level status to " safe " .
In ensuring that our members are in compliance with the Yahoo !
Terms of Service and our Community Guidelines we often take actions that some may consider to be unfair , inappropriate or downright wrong headed .
Please rest assured that these decisions are n't made lightly -- we 're not sitting around munching on bon bons hitting a big red button with glee .
Good to know there 's no bon bons involved .

The university ’s switch to Google - hosted e-mail has gone smoothly , and Mr. Sannier estimates that the school is saving $ 500,000 a year by not handling e-mail itself .
Students , he added , also get more than e-mail .
They have access to Google Apps , and thousands of them , he says , now use Google ’s Web software for calendars , word processing and spreadsheets .
To be sure , Microsoft is not ceding cloud computing to Google .
It is investing heavily in huge data centers and Web software .
Inside Microsoft , there are engineers and product managers who sound a lot like Googlers .
Ellie Powers - Boyle , 25 , a graduate of M.I.T. , works on Microsoft ’s Web e-mail products .
In the last three years , she says , there have been a dozen significant upgrades of the Web e-mail product , and she has worked on three or four new features each time .
“ We iterate quickly , ” she says .
“ For someone of my generation , the whole idea of waiting years to see if you made the right product makes no sense . ”
The challenge for Microsoft is not the ability to do much of what Google does .
Instead , the company faces a business quandary .
The Microsoft approach is largely to try to link the Web to its desktop business  “ software plus Internet services , ” in its formulation .
It will embrace the Web , while striving to maintain the revenue and profits from its desktop software businesses , the corporate gold mine .
That is a smart strategy for Microsoft and its shareholders for now , but it may not be sustainable .
Assuming that competition heats up , Office may continue to be an outstanding product , but Microsoft may not be able to charge as much for it  just as low - cost personal computers eventually undercut the mainframe business , and traditional publishing and media companies have grappled with Internet distribution .
The traditional products remain popular , but they become much less profitable .
FOR its part , Google faces its own set of challenges : competition from Microsoft and from Web - based productivity software being offered by start - ups like Zoho and Transmedia as well as more established players like Yahoo .
A recent report by the Burton Group , a technology research firm , concluded that it was “ unclear at this point whether Google will be able to capitalize on the trends that it ’s accelerating . ”
Is Google “ really committed to the productivity of information workers ? ” asks Chris Capossela , a vice president in Microsoft ’s Office group .
“ Boy , there ’s no question that we are .
No customer on the planet thinks about Microsoft without thinking about Office .
It ’s part of the DNA of Microsoft .
“ Needless to say , we are going to do everything we can to remain the leader in this space , ” he adds .
“ And whoever comes our way , we ’ll certainly be waiting for them . ”
It was Christmas Eve when George Bailey stared into the black depths of the river beneath the bridge in Bedford Falls , convinced that the world would be better off without him .
That scene from the 1946 movie classic “ It ’s a Wonderful Life ” could well have given birth to the media myth that Christmas is a trigger for increased suicides and episodes of depression .
It is a baseless notion , according to a body of published studies by statisticians who have examined hundreds of thousands of suicides in the United States and around the world .
The number of suicides goes down , not up , over the holiday season , by as much as 40 % .
During the season of good cheer , there are certainly those whose blue mood stands in stark contrast to the season ’s bright lights and festivities .
But pointing to the Christmas season as a cause of increased depression and risk for suicide is just wrong , says Dan Romer , director of the Annenberg Adolescent Risk Communication Institute at the University of Pennsylvania .
“ Holiday blues ? ” asks Dr. Eric Caine , co-director of the center for the study and prevention of suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York .
“ I ’m not sure .
I just know I get a lot fewer admissions [ to the psychiatric ward ] over the holidays . ”
Advertisement
In one of the most thorough examinations of what researchers call acts of deliberate self - harm , which can be an indication of depression , Helen Bergen , research scientist at the University of Oxford , found that Christmas , for most people , is protective .
Bergen and colleagues reached this conclusion after examining emergency room admission records of 19,346 people in England and looking at daily rates of self - induced injury from 1976 to 2003 .
Drug or alcohol overdoses , self - poisoning with gas or other harmful substances and self - inflicted injuries -- with or without the deliberate intention to die -- all decreased from average levels during the week of Dec. 19 - 26 , Bergen and colleagues found , and these lowered levels held through New Year ’s Day .
The decrease in rates of self - inflicted damage before , on and immediately after Christmas and into the New Year was found regardless of age , family connections or social isolation , the researchers reported in the September issue of the journal Social Science & Medicine .

Even people with family relationship problems were less inclined to attempt to hurt themselves during the holidays .
“ These findings are contrary to the popular view that Christmas is a time of stress and arguments , ” Bergen says .
Perhaps , she says , problems within the nuclear family ease up instead of intensify when the extended family is around .
Another possible reason why depression and suicide rates fall this time of year is that the season , more than other times , is one of giving .
“ People tend to reach out over the holidays , ” says Dr. Douglas Jacobs , a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School .
Elderly people in nursing homes might suddenly get visitors .
People who have n’t heard from friends all year might get a card or a phone call .
It ’s only in the last year that the majority of news stories reflected the fact versus the myth about seasonal suicide rates , says Romer , who since 2000 has been tracking trends in media interpretations of the link between holidays and suicide .
In a national search of news stories linking the holidays with suicide , he says , 9 % of news organizations supported the myth in 2006 , compared with 57 % in 2005 and 77 % in 1999 .
This is not to say that the holidays are easy for everyone .
“ Some people have unreasonable expectations -- the holidays have to be happy , ” says Dr. Ian Cook , director of the UCLA depression research program .
If in - laws are sniping at you about your home , your food and your lifestyle ; your 2 - year - old has already broken his new toys and is wailing ; and your sister ’s teenage daughter is sulking in the family room , happiness can be a tall order .
Advertisement
Others are reminded of losses at holiday time .
Some churches have started offering a special service -- more somber and reflective than joyful -- on Dec. 21 , often the darkest day of the year , or on Christmas Eve .
“ The holidays put on us an expectation for a certain set of feelings , ” says Father Larry Rice , pastor at the St. Thomas More Newman Center at Ohio State University , which will be celebrating a “ Blue Christmas ” Roman Catholic Mass on Christmas Eve .
“ Everyone around them seems joyful , and they ’re not feeling that . ”
Ryan Warne - McGraw , associate pastor at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Irvine will hold the church ’s second Blue Christmas service Thursday .
Last year ’s service was a hit , he said , an acknowledgment that traditional services can be hard on widows , widowers , divorcees or people who have lost jobs or loved ones .
“ Not everyone wants to come and sing Christmas carols , ” he says .
It ’s that kind of cultural reaction -- an extra dose of caring -- that probably adds to the psychological protection of a season that seems to insist on happiness .
No matter how bad it may seem , holiday rituals add up to more good than bad , buffering adults and children against depression and anxiety .
Advertisement
Barbara Fiese , chairwoman of psychology at Syracuse University , reviewed 32 studies done over 50 years and concluded that holiday family rituals may be annoying , but they ’re good for us .
People with strong family routines and rituals at holiday time reported more marital satisfaction , better academic achievement among children and better overall health among family members , she found .
Even in families in which there has been a divorce , the continuation of family rituals improves the children ’s ability to adapt and increases their stability .
“ Each family defines its own rituals , ” she says .
“ It can be things as simple as unpacking a particular ornament or menorah , or cooking a dish that ’s been passed down for generations .
. . .
It provides an emotional connection , a symbolic bonding . ”
Certainly , many people feel alone during the holidays .
But , Caine of the University of Rochester asks , “ If you banned all holidays , do you think people would feel happier or sadder ?
If they were really bad for us , do you think they ’d have been around for so long ? ”

OSLO ( Reuters ) - Six of the world ’s eight bear species are under threat of extinction after the addition on Monday of the sun bear , the world ’s smallest type of bear , to a “ Red List ” which says China ’s panda is most at risk .
A giant panda drinks milk at the China Panda Protection and Research Center in Wolong , southwest China 's Sichuan province , October 9 , 2007 .
Six of the world 's eight bear species are under threat of extinction after the addition on Monday of the sun bear , the world 's smallest type of bear , to a " Red List " which says China 's panda is most at risk .
REUTERS / China Daily
The sun bear is threatened partly by poachers who sell its gall bladder bile in China as a traditional medicine , said the World Conservation Union which runs the list of threatened wildlife .
“ Things are getting worse for all the bear species except the American black bear which is unquestionably increasing , ” said Simon Stuart , senior species adviser for the Union .
The addition of the sun bear to the authoritative Red List after a major review means the American black bear and the brown bear , found from Europe to Alaska , are the only two of eight species still considered robust .
The sun bear , found in Asia from Bangladesh to Borneo and weighing up to about 70 kg ( 150 lb ) , was rated “ vulnerable ” by experts at the Union , which comprises more than 80 governments , conservation groups and scientists .
The sun bear , named after a yellow crescent on its chest , had not previously been listed because of a lack of data .
The Union said there were several thousand sun bears in the wild .
“ We estimate that sun bears have declined by at least 30 percent over the past 30 years ... and continue to decline at this rate , ” said Ron Steinmetz , head of the Swiss - based Union ’s sun bear expert team .
Scientists did not change the level of threat to any other bear species .
Deforestation , loss of habitat to roads and cities and poaching are among risks .
The Asiatic black bear , the sloth bear and the Andean bear were all reaffirmed as vulnerable after the reassessment of land - living bears .
The polar , the only species not reassessed , is separately rated as vulnerable .
BAMBOO
Pandas were reaffirmed as endangered , one step closer to extinction than vulnerable , despite China ’s protection efforts for the bamboo - eaters .
There are an estimated 1,000 - 2,000 in the wild , fewer than any other bear species .
“ Even though some people have claimed that panda populations are on the rise , we still consider them endangered because too much uncertainty exists to justify changing their status to vulnerable , ” David Garshelis , co-chair of the Union ’s bear specialist group , said in a statement .
“ The fact that six of eight bear species are under threat is bad news for species that are generally resilient and hang on under human pressure , ” Stuart told Reuters .
Many bears were unfussy eaters and could live in a wide range of habitats .
The brown bear , including grizzly bears , and the American black bear are listed as of “ least concern , ” meaning populations are robust .
There are more than 900,000 black bears -- more than twice as many as all other species of bears combined .

WASHINGTON - Leading Republican presidential candidates , who declared in an October debate that the economy is in good shape , last night said President Bush 's economic stimulus package did not go far enough to stave off what economists fear may be a looming recession .
In a debate in Boca Raton , Fla. , five days before the state 's GOP primary , former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said the plan to distribute tax rebate checks to 117 million families was " a good start , " but needs more tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire people .
Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain of Arizona both called for permanent tax reductions to spur the economy , and McCain repeated his calls for lower federal spending and greater incentives to save .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee - who was alone among his main competitors last year in warning of a weakening economy - said he was " grateful that something is being done . "
But sounding the populist theme of his campaign , Huckabee said the money would be better spent on building US roads , employing American workers , and using US - made supplies .
" We 'll probably end up borrowing this $ 150 billion from the Chinese , and when we get those rebate checks , most people are going to go out and buy stuff that 's been imported from China , " Huckabee said .
Representative Ron Paul of Texas , meanwhile , took his own party to task for running up deficits and expanding the size of government .
" The Republican Party has a problem because we do n't act like Republicans , " he said .
The debate at Florida Atlantic University hosted a five - man field that appeared to have taken a mutual vow to stay civil and even complimentary of one another .
While the Romney and McCain campaigns released TV ads last night attacking each other , on stage , the men kept their remarks conciliatory .
Instead , the candidates saved their attacks for Hillary Clinton , saying the Democratic New York senator would weaken American security by pulling the United States out of Iraq prematurely .
No GOP candidate mentioned either of the other two Democratic contenders , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former North Carolina senator John Edwards .
Asked how he would run against Hillary and Bill Clinton , who has been aggressively campaigning for his wife , Romney cocked an eyebrow .
" I frankly can't wait , because the idea of Bill Clinton back in the White House with nothing to do is something I just can't imagine .
I can't imagine the American people can't imagine , " Romney said , declining to elaborate .
Romney said he looked forward to taking on Hillary Clinton , whom he referred to as " General Hillary Clinton , " saying she is " so out of step with the American people . "
Both Romney and McCain appeared relaxed and confident as they headed into a race that has the two men battling each other for first place .
McCain sought to burnish his conservative credentials while describing himself as someone willing to take on the Washington establishment ; Romney , who was often the target of attacks from fellow Republicans in earlier debates , deftly deflected questions about whether he kept changing his positions .
Thanks to Jennifer for sharing this scary ghost video clip

When they review back the video clip , it was indeed someone else in that room ( of course , it ’s a ghost ) .
The Bush administration hit the brakes Friday on a controversial law requiring Americans to carry tamper - proof driver ’s licenses , delaying its final implementation by five years , until 2017 .
A number of states have balked at the law , objecting to it largely over cost and privacy concerns .
But under the administration ’s new edict , states that continue to fight compliance with the law face a penalty :
Their residents will be forbidden from using driver ’s licenses to board airplanes or enter federal buildings as of May 11 of this year .
Congress passed the Real ID law in 2005 to address security flaws spotlighted by the 2001 terrorist attacks .
But 17 states , including Arizona , Colorado and Nevada , have passed legislation calling for its repeal or opposing its implementation .
“ Come May 2008 , [ their ] citizens . . . will feel the consequences ” of the states ’ resistance , Homeland Security Department spokesman Russ Knocke said Friday .
To board a plane or enter a federal building , those residents will have to use a passport or other form of accepted identification , he said .
Advertisement
California is well on its way to compliance , Knocke said .
States that are moving toward implementing the law can request a waiver from the May deadline , and their driver ’s licenses will remain valid for security purposes , the agency said .
Giving states more time to comply with the law will lower costs , said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .
Civil liberties groups disagreed .
Advertisement
“ DHS has kicked the can down the road to the next administration , ” said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union .
Steinhardt disputed that the delayed deadlines would have a major effect on the costs of complying with the law .
A basic problem with the law remains , he said : People will have difficulty obtaining the original documents , such as a birth certificate , that eventually will be required to obtain a Real ID license .
“ It ’s going to be a real nightmare for American drivers , ” Steinhardt said .
Sen . Susan Collins of Maine , the ranking Republican on the homeland security committee , praised the department for giving states more time but chided it for not addressing privacy concerns raised by the law ’s critics .
Advertisement
Real ID will require a linked system of databases so that motor vehicle authorities can share information with all other states .
The administration ’s changes will lower implementation costs to about $ 3.9 billion , from an original estimate of $ 14.6 billion , Chertoff said .
Other Homeland Security officials said as much as $ 360 million was available through the agency to help states pay for the costs .
But Jeremy Meadows , senior policy director at the National Conference of State Legislatures , said most states considered the federal help inadequate .
“ Financing does remain a major issue , ” Meadows said .

Under the new regulations , by the end of 2009 states must check the legal status of a driver ’s license applicant with Homeland Security , ensure that the applicant has no licenses in other states and check the validity of the applicant ’s Social Security number .
By 2011 , states must verify with the issuing source that all identification documents people use to obtain driver ’s licenses are valid .
By 2014 , all license holders born on or after Dec. 1 , 1964 , will be required to carry a Real ID license .
By 2017 , all license holders , regardless of age , will have to carry one .

I am working away at a book on Nietzsche , and was about to write a brief synopsis of his revaluation of all values project .
He thinks there are genuine values , I think , but they are rooted in health , or the perspective of life , and not in any transcendent moral truths .
Basically , to be healthy , you need to cultivate all the forces at work in your psychology ( or as many as you can ) , turning your garden into a teeming jungle , with a result that is profound , complex , powerful , and noble .
It may be that no two individuals will turn out alike — one may become Goethe , another Napoleon , etc .
Then I wanted to go on to say “ But this is no Disneyland jungle cruise .
You may turn out to be a moral monster . ”
I also have in the back of my mind McCarthy ’s Blood Meridian ( since I ’m reading it ) , in which there is a character named the judge who is one cruel and cool - headed son of a bitch .
He is very learned , speaks eloquently , and thinks nothing of scalping a child .
McCarthy makes him out to be like another species — hairless , extraordinarily strong , taller than everyone else , and set apart from everyone else .
( Near the end he ’s traveling around with a hairy imbecile , hunting another character down — so it reminds me of the ape and the superman chasing down the human , who is caught in the middle . )
So I looked through Nietzsche ’s Beyond Good and Evil , looking for a telltale quote that made it clear that Nietzsche means terror .
( Is n’t there something about a race of supermen returning from war , raping , and pillaging as if from a lark ? )
But I could n’t find one .
All I could find were quotes attesting to the fact that he is no liberal , let alone a utilitarian , since he thinks truly terrible and terrifying experiences might forge a great individual .
But that ’s different from saying thatthe great individual would himself be terrible and terrifying .
I ’m probably missing some obvious passages , but thought I ’d toss this question out to see what anybody thinks : is it obvious that a Nzean superman might well be a moral monster ( like the judge ) ?

Historical Significance of the Farm
Thanks to Boingboing .
net for posting this .
If you want , after you sign the petition , Digg this ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hi there ,
My name is Aaron Newton and I 'm writing because the state of South Carolina wants to put a freeway through my grandfather 's home ( google map link ) .
His house was originally built by his grandfather and is around 200 years old .
In the 1950's , my grandparents remodeled part of it and because of these changes we could n't get the historical building society to declare it a landmark .
My father , Don Newton , who lives nearby , has spent time with several officials of South Carolina and has worked out an alternate route that takes the freeway down the west side of the farm instead of through the center of it , leaving the house completely intact .
Unfortunately , the bureaucracy involved in changing things like this is quite thick and though we 've managed to convince all the parties that it should move , they need some sort of public " outcry " to be able to rubber stamp the change .
Which is why I 'm setting up this petition to get signatures .
Signatories do n't even have to live there .
The do n't even have to have ever visited .
I 'm currently located in San Francisco and it does n't matter .
They just need " the public " to demonstrate the need for the change in plans .
So please , take a moment and share your information in this petition so we can save his house .
According to the privacy policy of this site , your name , city , state , country , and comments will be shared with the Governor 's office .
Details and links :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(
Written by Don Newton ) My original ancestor , Giles Newton , emigrated from England to Virginia and finally to the land on which the home was built and still stands today .
The land was part of two 640 land grants awarded to Giles Newton by colonial Governor Moultrie .
He granted the first property in 1785 .
By the very early 1800's , Giles ' two sons , James and Younger I , owned approximately 3000 acres , much of which still is owned and farmed by Giles ' descendents .
My 91 year old father , Lt. Col. ( Retired ) Peter J. Newton , Sr. , still owns over 300 acres of the original land and the ancestral home .
Historical statements from generation to generation date the building of the home by Younger I around 1800 .
While there is no specific written evidence to properly date the home , there are two entries in archived records placing Younger I in a home on the land around 1790 , and that is corroborated by family lore .
( From Which Newton Are You Or How Are You Connected by David F. Newton , pg 210 ) THE HOMEThe home was built from trees that were cleared from the forests that now are open fields of fertile farmlands .
The underpinning of the home was and still is hand - hewn logs held together by 10 " wooden pegs .
The original structure consisted of four equally sized rooms and the kitchen was separated from the home in the back to save the home in case of a fire in the kitchen .
In the late 1940's , the kitchen was joined to the rear of the home and three other rooms were added across the back of the house .
The floors of this section were not joined evenly , and there is an approximate ten inch step down from the original section of the home to this rear section .
The porch was also extended across the front and down the West side of the house .
In 1957 , my father , who was actually born in the home in 1916 , remodeled the home , leaving the basic four rooms of the home but installing oak hardwood floors .
He also left most of the original windows in rooms and by the front door , which were hand - blown glass with " wavy " imperfections and bubbles .
The chimney on the East side of the house is also original which , according to family lore , has brick laid with " salt crete " .
It was covered with a thin layer of concrete years ago to protect it from weathering .
Around 1965 , dormers were added to the roof of the house and the attic was opened to house two bedrooms .
And the final remodeling occurred around 1985 when the kitchen was remodeled and a carport was attached at the kitchen entrance .
HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCEFrom the date of the land grant until the present , no one but Giles Newton descendents have lived in this house and worked this farm .
The only other inhabitants of this land were native Americans .
And from the family record Which Newton Are You or How Are You Connected , researched and compiled by David F. Newton , archived documents clearly show that the descendents of Giles Newton have played a significant role in South Carolina 's and our nation 's history , namely : Three men , Giles , James , and Younger Newton , fought in the Revolutionary War .
Three men , Henry C. , Giles II , and Younger II , fought in the War of 1812 Eighteen fought in the Civil War : John C. Newton was killed at Drury 's Bluff in May 1864H .
H. Newton was wounded at Haw's Shop , VA in May 1864 Peter L Newton died as a POW in GeorgetownCornelius D. Newton was a POW at Point LookoutJoseph NewtonJohn W. Newton lost fingers while servingRichard Newton died in the WarRobin Newton died in the WarSmith Newton Thomas B. NewtonPeyton NewtonBenjamin NewtonJames E. Newton died in the WarJohn H.

Newton ( Many fought in WWI and WWII for which I do n't have definitive records .
My father fought with General Marshall and General Patton and because of his valor and duty , he was promoted from 2nd Lt. through the ranks to Lt. Col. by the age of 30 .
He was wounded three times and was finally medically discharged . ) I have cousins that fought in Korea .
My brother and I are Vietnam Veterans as are many of our cousins . )
Cornelius Newton was a SC State legislator from 1880 - 1882 and served as Solicitor , 4th Circuit , for six years .
Joseph Newton was a patent holder for a medicinal pillGiles Y. Newton served as a US representative to the Philippines in 1924 , and Elizabeth Newton was the first woman to be admitted to the Bar and licensed to practice law in the courts of the United States .
The home place and the nearby family cemetery still play an important role in this family , much greater than that of the home of one family residence .
It is quite common for a relative who is researching their family history to learn that the family originated from this area and drive to the home to see for themselves .
Even though they do n't know who resides in the home now , they arrive and find that it is the earliest known residence of their ancestors , and that most of those ancestors are buried in family cemeteries about one mile away .
Two recent unusual events further verify this significance .
About three years ago , an elder family member , who moved away in 1928 , had her nephew drive her from Phoenix , Arizona over a ten day period to arrive at the local ( and home ) church on the first Sunday in August to attend the Newton family reunion , the oldest continuous family reunion in SC .
She had attended the very first reunion in 1927 , and wanted to attend and reacquaint herself with family again .
She came without a call - just knowing that the reunion is always held on the first Sunday in August .
After the reunion service at the church , she visited with my dad at the home place to reminisce and learn more of her genealogy .
In the 1800's , Giles ' grandson , Giles II , moved to Georgia and then to Alabama , where we lost track of that entire limb of the family tree .
About seven years ago , one of his descendents was doing genealogical research and learned of a Newton family reunion at Boykin Church in our community .
She called the church in the middle of the week ( when no one would ordinarily be there ) .
By the providence of God , a cousin was in the church , answered the phone and shared family info .
A few months later , the relative visited the reunion , reuniting that limb of the family for the first time in almost two hundred years .
She , too , visited the old home place , and shared family genealogy with my dad and with family historian , David Newton , before visiting the cemetery to see the graves of her ancestors .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Patients seeking urgent care in U.S. emergency rooms are waiting longer than in the 1990s , especially people with heart attacks , U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday .

They found a quarter of heart attack victims waited 50 minutes or more before seeing a doctor in 2004 .
Waits for all types of emergency department visits became 36 percent longer between 1997 and 2004 , the team at Harvard Medical School reported .
Especially unsettling , people who had seen a triage nurse and been designated as needing immediate attention waited 40 percent longer -- from an average of 10 minutes in 1997 to an average 14 minutes in 2004 , the researchers report in the journal Health Affairs .
Heart attack patients waited eight minutes in 1997 but 20 minutes in 2004 , Dr. Andrew Wilper and colleagues found .
“ If a loved one has a heart attack , it does n’t matter whether he is well insured .
He still has a one - in - four chance of waiting over 50 minutes , because of ED ( emergency department ) overcrowding , and this wait will only increase , ” Dr. Robert Lowe , an emergency medicine expert at Oregon Health and Science University who did not work on the study , said in a statement .
Wilper ’s team used U.S. Census survey and National Center for Health Statistics data for their study , which covered more than 92,000 emergency department visits .
They used other surveys to calculate that the number of emergency room visits rose from 93.4 million in 1994 to 110.2 million in 2004 .
During the same time , 12 percent fewer hospitals operated emergency rooms , according to the American Hospital Association .
“ EDs close because , in our current payment system , emergency patients are money - losers for hospitals , ” Wilper said in a statement .
Harvard ’s Dr. David Himmelstein , who worked on the study , also lobbies for some kind of national health care system .
“ One contributor to ED crowding is Americans ’ poor access to primary and preventive care , which could address medical issues before they become emergencies , ” Himmelstein said in a statement .
The American College of Emergency Physicians said the findings were not surprising .
“ Emergency physicians have said for years that crowding and long wait times are hurting our patients -- insured and uninsured equally , ” ACEP president Dr. Linda Lawrence said in a statement .
“ Ever - lengthening waits are a frightening trend because any delays in care can make the difference between life and death for some patients .
The number of emergency patients is increasing while the number of hospital beds continues to drop .
It is a recipe for disaster . ”

ACLU poll : Majority opposes telecom immunity plan Nick Juliano

This ACLU poll released as Senate tackles FISA updates shows voters ' opposition to Bush proposals Majorities of voters on both sides of the political spectrum oppose key provisions in President Bush 's proposal to modify foreign surveillance laws that could ensnare Americans , according to a poll released Tuesday .
The survey shows nearly two - thirds of poll respondents say the government should be required to get an individual warrant before listening in on conversations between US citizens and people abroad .
Close to six in 10 people oppose an administration proposal to allow intelligence agencies to seek " blanket warrants " that would let them eavesdrop of foreigners for up to a year no additional judicial oversight required if the foreign suspect spoke to an American .
And a majority are against a plan to give legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping .
" Across the board , we find opposition to the administration 's FISA agenda , " pollster Mark Mellman said Tuesday .
The poll of 1,000 likely voters was released by the American Civil Liberties Union , which is lobbying Congress to reject Bush 's blanket warrant and telecom immunity proposals .
" We know that the American public realizes that this is an atrocious piece of legislation , " the ACLU 's Caroline Fredrickson said , referring to a bill before the Senate that gives the administration much of what it wants .
Fredrickson and Mellman spoke to reporters Tuesday on a conference call before the Senate gets ready to revisit the FISA update .
Congress has been debating FISA legislation since passing a temporary measure in August that was aimed at closing a loophole that required the National Security Agency to get a FISA court warrant before listening to purely foreign communications .
Critics said that bill , the Protect America Act , provided too few judicial protections , although some of the fiercest battles in the latest legislative fight have centered around the immunity proposal .
The Senate is considering extending the PAA , which expires Feb. 1 , for another month while Democratic leaders seek compromise on the legislation .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who exited the presidential race this month , led opposition to the bill in December and succeeded in temporarily blocking telecom immunity .
Fredrickson said the ACLU is supporting efforts from Dodd and others like Sens. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) to strip immunity from the bill , and she said the organization has been in touch with the major presidential campaigns .
Both remaining Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , have said they oppose telecom immunity , and Democrats feel a monthlong extension of the FISA debate would allow the candidates to refocus on the Senate after a slew of major presidential primaries Feb .
5 . President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to warrantlessly wiretap Americans communicating with suspects abroad after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , initiating a program that operated outside the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a 1978 law governing surveillance activities .
Critics say Bush and the NSA began working to subvert FISA even before 9/11 .
The Mellman Group survey was conducted Jan. 11-15 and was limited to those likely to vote in this year 's presidential election .
The polling firm conducted a study that produced similar results in October .
Sixty - three percent said the government should get an individual warrant before listening to a US citizen 's phone call with someone abroad , and 58 percent said they opposed " blanket warrants . "
Pollsters also presented arguments for individual warrants versus blanket warrants and found a strong preference for individual warrants ; 66 percent agreed with this assessment :
Some say Congress should keepthe traditional requirement that the government get an individual warrant for each American citizen whose phone calls or emails they want to wiretap instead of getting warrants to spy on whole groups of Americans at once .
They say the Fourth Amendment requiresthe government to get a warrant in each case by proving probable cause to an independent judge .
But the blanketwarrant allows the government to spy on whole groups of American citizens with no judicial review of the individual circumstances in each case .
Conversely , just 26 percent supported blanket warrants when presented with this argument : Others say Congress should set up a system that allows the government to get a blanket warrant for a year to conduct crucial wiretaps on terrorists communicating with individuals inthe United States .
They say that the courts will still be involved and that giving the government this authority is critical to keeping America safe .
They say Congress should not bog down intelligence agencies with administrative burdens by giving terrorists rights .
The poll also found 57 percent of likely voters opposed telecom immunity , compared to just a third who supported it .
Fredrickson said the poll demonstrated that the voters are behind the Democrats , and she called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to do more to stand up to the Bush administration .
" If he really opposes telecom immunity he has to do more than say it , " she said .
" He has to show it . "
Although the ACLU has mounted a PR and advertising offensive to fight telecom immunity and other perceived abuses , Fredrickson said activists still face an uphill battle , despite the nearly nonexistent public presence of telecoms and others who favor immunity .
Even if the public is n't seeing them , the telecoms message is being delivered in the corridors of power , she said .
" They tend to favor dark rooms , martinis and cigars , " she said of lobbyists representing the massive corporations .
John Gruber of Daring Fireball ( thanks for the link ! ) knows a lot about font - rendering , however in a recent post discussing screen - rotation and sub - pixel text rendering he let this slip :
“ I tested it on my Cinema Display with the screen rotated 90° , and , to my eyes , sub - pixel anti-aliasing still looked good . ”
That is just preposterous .
Aside from his observation being completely wrong , he also revealed a bug in OS X :
The current system does n’t recognize rotated pixel orientations , sub - pixel rendering on rotated screens should probably be disabled automatically .
( rdar://problem/5627732 )
Here are two screenshots of my browser ’s address bar as displayed on my Cinema Display , which clearly shows the difference .
The top image is Leopard ’s default sub - pixel rendering .
The second image is the same bar photographed with my display rotated 90° , the photo was then rotated back in Photoshop for better comparison .
The text was apparently calculated against the presumed horizontal LCD primary orientation .
But because the pixels were rotated , several of the letterform stems ( verticals ) are drawing as full - pixel - width colored lines .
The first “ h ” is especially glaring , its stem and stroke are drawn as a pair of dark red and light blue lines .
Sub - pixel rendering takes advantage of a known horizontal alignment of the three color primaries that make up each physical pixel .
The algorithm seems to render text at 3 x the horizontal resolution , ignoring the color information and treating each third - pixel as a valid light source to use for drawing letterforms .
That 3 x width is then striped with red , green and blue to match screen ’s component primary ordering .
( That was an educated guess )
As Steve Weller stated in the post John linked , the human eye has “ pathetic color - resolution ” .
This fact is exploited all over the place in video , with many formats sampling color only once for every four luminance pixels .
Several things are at play here :
Human vision is the bifocal product of horizontally arranged eyes .
Most written human language uses letterforms which are vertically oriented and horizontally distinguished .
Especially Latin - derived languages .
Most human languages read horizontally .
Human vision tends to be less color sensitive for motion , or when scanning information ( like reading )
It all just kind of worked out perfectly .
Digital color reproduction combined our horizontal predisposition with our soft and slow perception of color , and then arranged color primaries horizontally .
Text also reads horizontally , and since the viewer is rapidly moving their eyes , we perceive shape and contrast before color .
Additionally , Latinate languages evolved letterforms which utilize horizontal variations against a largely regular vertical syncopation .
Presto : sub -pixel rendering just seems fantastically obvious .
Regarding John ’s closing supposition ,
“ I ’m not sure the iPhones rotating display is reason enough to rule out sub - pixel rendering . ”
Based on everything leading up to sub - pixel rendering in the first place , most of the benefits would be lost if the underlying pixel grid was vertically oriented .
The sensitivity of computer text falls across the horizontal axis .
Adding resolution to the vertical axis is n’t worth the effort .
Sub - pixel rendering is ultimately a transitional technology anyway , a half - step that improves the now while waiting for a better and inevitable future to arrive .
Once we start seeing iPhone level pixel - densities all over the place , sub - pixel rendering will began its transition to technology footnote .
Digital displays will someday reach a point where every physical pixel is capable of producing every color of visible light .
( And someone will doubtlessly push into near infrared and ultra-violet , claiming increased realism and fidelity ) .
Future displays will also be operating at a density where anti-aliasing may not be necessary at all .
I still think Apple ’s decision to use standard anti-aliasing for the Leopard menu bar was a mistake .
Unless they ’ve got some spiffy high - pixel - density cinema displays ready for MacWorld and enable system - wide resolution independence in 10.5.x , switching to standard anti-aliased text rendering in the menu bar was a change that should have been postponed .
The necessary hardware pool just is n’t here yet and the result is an interface that looks markedly worse than it did under previous releases .
Ryan Lizza has an excellent article sketching out the lines of debate over the future of the Republican Party , and where John McCain fits into the whole thing -- apparently , he sees himself as leading a struggle against resurgent forces of isolationism .
Ross Douthat 's not too happy :
But , um , Senator McCain , you did notice that Ron Paul topped out at about 5 - 10 percent of the vote , did n't you ?
And that every other candidate in the race ( allowing for certain variations ) took roughly the same foreign - policy line as you ?
Does n't that at the very least suggest that there might be more pressing battles awaiting a politician looking to reinvent the Republican Party than a crusade against the isolationist menace ?
Please ?
Ross seems a bit confused .
As anyone familiar with George W. Bush 's 2006 State of the Union Address knows , " isolationist " means " anyone who does n't favor repeating the enormous blunders of the past six years . "
In that sense , the forces of isolationism really are growing , and one could even have imagined a President Romney or a President Huckabee turning out to be a closet " isolationist " once in office .
But John McCain wanted a pointless and counterproductive policy of rogue state rollback before it was cool .

Watching the recent developments and statements made by President Bush , it makes one question when impeaching Bush and Cheney become a matter of survival for our nation as opposed to an impeachment process where there was n’t the urgency that presents itself in these newest revelations .
We have known for some time that Cheney was in a battle with the intelligence community , and the White House actually refused to accept the NIE for almost a year .
Now it seems that the President let his Freudian slip show when he contradicted himself on the time - line in regard when he received knowledge that Iran had suspended their nuclear arms program in 2003 :
Scathing analysis of Bush having been caught lying about Iran ’s nuclear program Bush is holding a press conference at 10 am Eastern .
He scheduled it before the NIE leaked , showing that he lied to the American people , yet again , in order to start a war with Iran .
Let ’s take a stroll down memory lane and look at what George Bush had to say about Iran , when he knew that they had already halted their nuclear program : Hmm .
It actually seems that some reporters understand they ’ve been had by Bush on Iran .
Reuters headline : “ Report contradicts Bush on Iran nuclear program . ”
A new U.S. intelligence report says Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and it remains on hold , contradicting the Bush administration ’s earlier assertion that Tehran was intent on developing a bomb .
MORE
It ’s bad enough that he lied , but now that we know the truth , and we know he does too , instead of backing - off with as much finesse as possible , our “ C Average President ” is continuing his threats against Iran :
Bush continues threats against Iran By Bill Van Auken President Bush reiterated Wednesday that he will continue his provocative policy against Iran despite the release of a US intelligence report demonstrating that his administration deliberately and systematically lied to the American people and the world about Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ The Iranians have a strategic choice to make , ” Bush declared after arriving in Omaha , Nebraska for a Republican fund - raising event .
“ They can come clean with the international community about the scope of their nuclear activities and fully accept the long - standing offer to suspend their enrichment program and come to the table and negotiate , or they can continue on a path of isolation . ”
“ The choice is up to the Iranian regime , ” the US president added .
The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) released Monday flatly contradicted the claims made in a similar document published two years earlier that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons .
Instead , the latest NIE , which is the joint product of Washington ’s 16 spy agencies , claimed that Iran had pursued a nuclear weapons program but shut it down four years ago .
It also debunked the administration ’s dire warnings about the imminent threat of an Iranian bomb , estimating that such a weapon could not be produced — even if Teheran were seeking to do so — before 2015 .
MUCH MORE
In opposition to the NIE , the Neo- conservatives have come out of their lairs and condemned the Intelligence Community for “ being too timid . ”
John Bolton , who recently declared he was not a Neo- conservative , seemed to lead the charge :

A fire at Swedish hosting company PRQ , owned by two of the founders of The Pirate Bay , brought down numerous torrent sites earlier today .
Whilst it did n't take out The PirateBay 's site , it did take down several of their ancillary activities , as well as other BitTorrent sites hosted there .
Initial reports are that the fire at PRQ was caused by a powerfeed to one UPS , which has now been fixed by an electrician , and that some boxes are now coming back up .
The fire occurred sometime shortly before midday GMT , and took out approximately 200 servers .
PRQ ’s Anakata told TorrentFreak that not everything went down because of the electrical fault , but that he had to kill the power to the entire facility in order to fix things .
He added that none of the servers are permanently damaged .
The fire did n’t take out The Pirate Bay itself , much to the disappointment of some , including Swedish prosecutors .
It has , however , disabled several other torrent sites and some of Pirate Bay ’s services , including bayIMG , their court weblog and the Pirate Bay forums at SuprBay .
In 2007 several torrent sites moved to Sweden , and to PRQ in particular .
Sweden is considered to be a safe haven for BitTorrent sites , and PRQ is popular because it is owned by TiAMO and Anakata , two of the founders of The Pirate Bay .
Ironically , however , The Pirate Bay is not hosted in Sweden or at PRQ , which is probably a wise decision , you ca n’t have all your eggs in one basket .
Amongst the sites taken down were Waffles , Suprnova , Swebits and the popular TV - torrent site EZTV .
Waffles posted the following notice on their site
FIRE AT PRQ DATACENTER
Please bear with us waffles !
We ’re scrambling to get you your syrup .
–
The servers were not harmed .
– Even in such case , no data has been lost as we have daily offsite backups .
– Luckily , we have a brand new server already …
We are assessing whether to ship it to the new Swedish datacenter where arrangements have been made or to take the hospitality of our good friends in Canada ( unrelated to what .cd ’s move )
An admin at the private music tracker Waffles - one of the sites that is experiencing downtime at the moment - was n’t happy with the downtime and told TorrentFreak : “… ridiculous .
2nd time this month we ’ve had more than 6 hours downtime , ” adding “ I need to ship our new ( much more powerful server ) for waffles to a different datacenter in Sweden , before the Post Office closes . ”
Another admin said : “ We noticed the downtime 7 hours ago , and only found out via someone else outside of PRQ about the fire ”
Regardless , there will be some smiles in Hollywood and at the Swedish anti-piracy organization AntipiratbyrÃ¥n , as well as many frowns from users all around the world .
More information will be added when we get it .
UPDATE 16/2/2008 20:50 GMT : Power has been restored and half the servers are now back up
UPDATE 17/2/2008 02:03 GMT : Some sites including Waffles are back , EZTV and others are still down
Let ’s get a handle on morality and the rule of law in the United States .
The end - run around the law that requires the federal government to request a warrant to use electronic surveillance on American citizen ’s was not enacted to tie the government ’s hands , or to give this or any other administration the “ appearance ” of adhering to the nation ’s constitution , it was enacted to guarantee our right to privacy .
The truth is that no president is above the law .
The fact that a warrant can be requested after the act of using electronic surveillance 3 days after the fact makes not complying with the law unconscionable …and illegal .
The new FISA bill that is now in front of the Senate would give the telecommunications retroactive immunity for allowing the administration to spy on Americans without a valid warrant when they knew at the time it was patently against the law .
The administration knew it , the telecommunications companies knew it , and the members of the United States Senate know it .
Since September 11 , 2001 , we have witnessed President Bush and Vice - President Cheney while they have distorted and manipulated the media to convince American citizens to accept an invasion of Iraq .
The constant use of fear as a political tool to enhance the power of the presidency has succeeded in making George Bush one of the most powerful presidents in our history .
The FISA debate that is currently underway in the Senate is not about protecting the telecommunication industry that allowed spying on American citizens without a warrant , it is about setting a precedent so that the president and his administration will not be charged in the future with the very same thing .
Make no mistake , this is about allowing the administration to get “ off the hook ” for breaking the law .
George Bush and the people that make up his administration have lied to us 935 times in the run-up to the war in Iraq .
( See Dan Froomkin ’s blog on the Washington Post )
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2008/01/23/BL2008012301758_pf.html.)
Now the President is unabashedly trying to manipulate the U.S. Senate into giving him a “ free - pass ” when it comes to breaking the law .
This is not a partisan issue ; it is a legal and moral issue .
We can certainly agree that the scope of our knowledge about how many American ’s have been subject to government spying in the past has certainly been well documented , from Dr. Martin Luther King and John Lennon , to John Kerry .
This is n’t anything new ; we all know that the government has been at this business of spying on the citizens of this country for a long time , what is new however , is this administration ’s attempt legalize breaking the law .
I mentioned in the first part of this article that this is not a political issue .
The very same criterion that was applied to former President William Jefferson Clinton applies here .
He was impeached in the House for lying under oath about a tryst with an intern that worked for his administration .
Compared to what President George W. Bush has lied about , the Clinton deception hardly warrants a footnote in the history books , yet we all wait to see if the very same standards that applied to Clinton will be applied to Bush .
The mainstream media has apparently decided that the Bush Administration ’s spying on American citizens is not worth the headlines that Clinton ’s adulterous escapades had .
What does this type of reasoning imply ?
Where is the moral outrage that was present when Clinton lied under oath ?
Is the acquiescence of the American people on the subject of our government spying on our people sending a signal to all that read into it that we are n’t willing to take a stand ?
That the executive branch of our government is above the law ?
John Edwards seems to be the only candidate speaking out of the subject of giving President Bush ’s co-conspirators ’ amnesty .
He urges Americans to let your Senators know how you feel .
I applaud him for standing up for the rule of law in this beleaguered nation of ours , but then again , why should it be such a novel idea for a former Senator and a candidate for the presidency to stand for obeying the law ?
Maybe it ’s because nobody else in the crowd seems to believe that it matters .
That ’s the way I see it .
In a victory for privacy advocates , a federal judge has ordered a US company to pay almost $ 200,000 and barred it from selling the phone records of individuals ' phone records without their permission .
US District Judge William F. Downes of Wyoming entered a permanent injunction against a company called AccuSearch and its principal , Jay Patel .
They advertised a service on a website called Abika - dot - com that made phone records of any individual available for a fee .
Privacy watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission filed suit in 2006 , alleging the practice was illegal .
Downes agreed that the obtaining and selling of phone records without the owners ' consent was necessarily accomplished through illegal means , according to this release from the FTC .
He went on to say that the service represented a menace to consumers in the form of stalkers , identity thieves and costs of changing phone carriers .
Attempts to reach AccuSearch and Patel for comment were unsuccessful .
The company has said it plans to appeal the ruling , according to court records .
The ruling comes two years after Hewlett - Packard spied on reporters and board members in an attempt to identify individuals who were leaking information to the media .
Among the controversial steps taken was the practice of pretexting , in which investigators called phone companies and pretended to be reporters who wanted a copy of their phone bills .
The FTC has alleged that phone bills constitute confidential information .
According to its lawsuit against AccuSearch , Abika - dot - com claimed it could acquire the phone records , including outgoing and incoming calls , of any individual .
FTC attorneys argued that using false pretenses , fraudulent statements and fraudulent or stolen documents to induce carriers to disclose records was illegal .
Downes also shot down AccuSearch 's claims that it had immunity under the US Communications Decent Act because it actively participated in the creation or development of the content on the Abika site .
AccuSearch was ordered to surrender $ 199,692 in sales earned from the record sales . ®
" Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq , because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far - reaching . . . "
There it is again , that choking lie , so smoothly administered -- with just enough fear to help America gag down all that righteousness .
President Bush told it again in his final State of the Union address the other night , of course .
What choice did he have ?
The truth , coming from him at this point , would be . . . too weird , too offensive , impossible to comprehend .
But the truth is that we 've already failed in Iraq , and throughout the Middle East and Central Asia -- failed with consequences beyond reckoning .
God knows someone will have to take a swig of political courage and acknowledge it one of these days , simply to stop the lie -- the lies , a governmental cluster bomb of them -- from doing further harm .
It 's common knowledge now that we " went to war on a lie " -- the WMD scam -- but what is n't common knowledge is how the war is sustained on a daily basis by lies and partial truths and desperate , behind - the - scenes financial damage control .
The war is all weapons systems and public relations , with the reality of wrecked countries and wrecked lives and a hemorrhaging of the national treasury suspended in media hoodoo and denial .
Consider the number 72,000 .
This number -- of total U.S. battlefield casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , through Jan. 5 , 2008 -- is simple enough , but as I ponder the fact that Paul Sullivan and his organization , Veterans for Common Sense , had to wrest it from the Department of Defense with a Freedom of Information
Act request , and the fact that the only media outlet to pick up on it so far is the Scottish newspaper The Herald , I begin to grasp the extent of the deception in place sustaining the war on terror .
The reason that the casualty totals reported are far lower , Sullivan explained to me , is that the Defense Department releases the stats on only one category of battlefield casualty to the media , the number of GIs " wounded " in action , that is , harmed by the instrumentation of war : bullet , shrapnel or knife .
A GI who cracks his head on the windshield of his Humvee in a crash , though he may have suffered brain damage and had to be evacuated from the battlefield , is considered " injured , " not " wounded , " Sullivan explained , and thus does n't show up in the figure the DoD releases and the media misleadingly report .
Likewise , a GI who suffers a heart attack , or , let 's say , one of those desert mystery illnesses , or a severe emotional collapse , is " ill , " not " wounded , " and is also MIA from the official casualty count .
And in this way does the war remain a tad more statistically palatable to a distracted public .
" This administration has a concerted plan to conceal the human and financial costs of these two wars to maintain public support , " said Sullivan , a Gulf War 1 vet and former Veterans Administration project manager who was blowing the whistle on the shoddy quality of vets ' health care long before the Washington Post " broke " the Walter Reed scandal a year ago .
" There are some in the VA -- top political appointees -- who are fundamentally opposed to providing health care to vets , " Sullivan went on , talking about the deeper deceptions of the war on terror that keep the political debate focused on vague future " consequences of failure " rather than the present - day consequences of a criminally inept , shoot - from - the - hip foreign policy of aggression .
It is at this level of deception that things get horrific : in the denial of care for physically and , especially , emotionally wounded vets -- men and women suffering from the private hell of post - traumatic stress disorder .
" VA hospitals and clinics have already treated 263,909 unplanned patients from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , " according to a Vets for Common Sense press release .
" On top of that , VA reported 245,034 unanticipated disability claims from veterans of the two wars . "
Note well the words " unplanned " and " unanticipated . "
This facet of the Bush administration 's lack of planning for its invasions has so far escaped significant notice .
Apparently the neocon brain trust expected such a cakewalk that the costs and logistics of GI medical care were n't taken into account .
Sullivan said he fully expects the VA to face as many as 700,000 patient claims -- including staggering numbers of PTSD claims as our battle - weary troops " deploy for a third or fourth combat tour in an escalating war that surrounds our troops with 360 - degree combat 24 hours per day " -- which could run up a tab of $ 700 billion .
The only way to control this monster expense is routine claim denial .
" This administration is so absolutely corrupt , incompetent and malevolent , it pales anything that came before it , " Sullivan said .
" Why is our economy tanking ?
The war , the war , the war . "
Note particularly that the human and financial costs Sullivan and others are making are not " projections " for an endless war but estimates based on where things stand at the moment .
But this is a war we can keep on losing into the indefinite future .

There are times where it can be difficult for small business to compete in the paid search environment .
As the cost of targeting keywords on venues such as Google AdWords continues to increase , many small businesses are finding it difficult to keep pace .
They either have to accept the fact that they can afford only a very small slice of the pie or abandon paid search marketing altogether .
We recently encountered a scenario like this with a client 's Google AdWords campaign .
The main keyword phrases they needed to target had become so expensive that not only were they only realizing a very small portion of actual traffic that could be had , they were paying exorbitant prices for each visitor .
We encouraged them to increase their overall AdWords budget , however that was something they could not afford to do at the time .
So how could they continue to get the best value out of their AdWords campaign while maintaining a small budget ?
While I cannot mention the company by name , I will provide as much information as I can to demonstrate how we more than doubled the effectiveness of our client '
AdWords campaign by making two simple adjustments .
This particular client has a budget of around $ 600 - $ 700 per month which is considered small for the industry they are in .
They are targeting about 60 keyword phrases total which are grouped into 7 ad groups .
The daily budget is set to about $ 25 which typically places us where we need to be at budget wise at the end of each month .
( Tip :
It is a good idea to set your daily budget a bit higher than what you actually expect to spend .
You can always reduce this towards the end of the month or even pause the campaign if you have reached your budget . )
In October of this year , Google recommended that they set their daily budget to a little over $ 600 a day , that is if they want to take advantage of all the traffic that Google and their search partners can send them ( this does not include contextual , mobile , radio ads , etc. ) .
That 's about $ 18,000 a month which may not be a large sum of money to most companies but is extreme for many small businesses .
Because their budget is so small in relation to their competitive industry , they were only receiving 3 % of the actual ad impressions that were being served .
If they could increase their budget to what Google was recommending , they would have the opportunity to increase their click - thrus by 2,798 % .
In that same month , they received a total of 182 click - thrus on their ads which were displayed a total number of 7,361 times giving them an average click - thru-ratio ( CTR ) of 2.47 % and at an average cost of $ 3.31 per click - thru for a total of $ 602.34 spent .
A click thru ratio of 2.47 % is pretty good and the average cost per click - thru is not exceptionally high .
However 182 visitors for the month is pretty low .
Because increasing the budget was not an option , how could we increase the number of visitors while staying in the same budget range ?
The first thing we looked at is where the majority of the budget was being spent .
In the case of this campaign ,
$ 394.16 went towards one very competitive keyword phrase .
They received 135 click - thrus at an average cost of $ 2.92 for that phrase .
Add to that fact that we had set the highest amount we were willing to pay for a click - thru to right around $ 10.00 in order to obtain ad placement in the 2nd to 3rd position range .
The problem with this particular phrase is that it left only $ 208.18 to be spread out for the remaining 59 keyword phrases they were targeting .
Therefore we decide to make two adjustments :
For the phrase that was eating the majority of our budget , we lowered the maximum CPC we were willing to spend from $ 10 to just $ 1 .
This may cause us to lose our ad placement of 2nd to 3rd position but it was a move we had to make in order to have a chance to increase total click - thrus .
We increased the maximum CPC for some of the less competitive " longer tail " types of phrases .
Here are the November results of that experiment .
569 total click - thrus
10,328 total impressions
5.50 % average CTR ( click - thru ratio )
$ 1.05 average CPC ( cost per click )
$ 599.91 total spent .
We more than doubled last month 's traffic , cut average CPC by more than half and saw CTR increase by more than 3 % .
What about the keyword phrase that was eating up the majority of our budget ?
You would think that we received little to no traffic related to that phrase , right ?
Wrong .
Lowering the maximum CPC from $ 10 to $ 1 still gave us an average position of 3.2 , generated 399 click - thrus from ads that displayed 5,013 times , giving us a CTR of 7.95 % at an average cost of $ 0.50 and spending $ 199.71 total on this phrase .
We did not expect these results at all but there they are .
Whereas one would think that the more you are willing to spend , the better a phrase would perform , the exact opposite was true in this case .
So , the takeaway from this case study -
If you are finding it to expensive to compete for that highly competitive keyword phrase or phrases , try cutting back on the maximum you are willing to spend for click - thrus and concentrate your efforts on " longer tail " or less competitive keywords .
The results may astonish you .
Of course this does not negate the fact that you should monitor your campaign closely to ensure that the keywords you are generating traffic by are producing a good return on your investment in the post click environment ( after you get them to your site ) .
However it does show that it is not always the best strategy to chase after high dollar keyword phrases , especially when you do n't have the budget to effectively compete .
